	schema:reviewBody "A controversial and shocking movie? Definitely and the way some people today profess to be jaded about The Night Porter says more about our current culture than about the movie itself. Other persons who experienced the Holocaust firsthand have reacted negatively towards it for its portrayal of a destructive but loving relationship born amidst the Holocaust. Their objections are certainly understandable. There has also been though an awful lot of politicallycorrect garbage and pretentious nonsense written about The Night Porter much of which has missed or misinterpreted some of the strongest elements of the movie.When I first saw The Night Porter in the early 1980's it certainly had the power to shock me and many others yet at the same time it offered a depth of aesthetic experience well beyond just shock for its own sake. These aesthetic qualities produce a sense of doom and sadness yet also show beauty and love amidst the hopelessness.Dirk Bogarde gives a really masterful performance as Max a former Nazi SS man who bears a huge burden of guilt. After World War II Max works at the main desk of a gorgeous old hotel in Vienna. Here he reencounters Lucia who survived the Nazi concentration camps where she was a victim of Max's sadism. Bogarde's Max and Charlotte Rampling as Lucia do not say a word at first during their unexpected postwar encounter in the hotel yet their understated expressiveness speaks paragraphs. The most controversial parts of the movie show the sort of sadomasochistic relationship which the two resume soon afterwards. While this relationship is very disturbing with Max's sometimes cruel nature and the destructiveness of the mutual attraction there is also a kind of love expressed by the two towards each other. Lucia is certainly a victim yet she also consciously holds a power over Max. The sadomasochism is not glamourized and I don't see any suggestion that these two lovers are any sort of role models. Yet they also evoke sympathy.Throughout the movie Bogarde is able to show a wide range of thoughts and emotions by just a slight movement of the corner of his mouth or by the raising of an eyebrow. Rampling shows vulnerability and also the power that she has over Max. She sometimes appears like a sleek sly cat and at other times clearly like the victim of the camp horrors. Other actors such as Philippe Leroy Isa Miranda and Amedeo Amodio also do a nice and sometimes subtle job of expressing the psychic state of their characters. Another character an Italian who survived awful times appears like a dog who has been beaten and fears another whipping.The Night Porter can be slowmoving yet this is punctuated by some very vivid scenes. For me the most striking one is a flashback to a time during the war when Bert a Nazi associate of Max puts on a performance for a group of SS men and women to the accompaniment of some gorgeous classical music. Not only does the scene seem to have a very sinister quality but Amodio as Bert expresses an emotional longing which has important repercussions. There is also another very eerie flashback showing a musical cabaretstyle performance by Lucia for her SS captors. Something of the corruption moral bankruptcy and hopelessness of Nazism is conjured up by this scene.On the downside some of the minor characters are portrayed in a caricaturish way the voice dubbing can be offputting and some plot elements towards the end of the movie are at times very silly. Through those failures though I think the movie still succeeds aesthetically. Partly this is due to the appealing yet melancholy and ominous musical score by Daniele Paris and others the disturbing magnetism of Max and Lucia and the cinematography. Throughout the movie the beautiful fascinating city of Vienna almost seems a character in itself.The Night Porter is certainly not for everyone. In addition to its portrayal of a very disturbing unconventional love relationship it has a few brief scenes of graphic sex and small bits of the ugliness of the camps. For those who don't mind getting through those parts its aesthetic qualities can be very rewarding. Be warned though that the movie contains much ugliness along with its beauty. As Lucia says to someone who is trying to use pschoanalytical games to avoid his guilt and shame There is no cure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people have thought this was a loathsome one and I can't blame them. When I saw this movie for the first time it left a depressive and nauseating feeling. But I cannot agree that this is barely nazi sexploitation sleaze. In fact the Night Porter is a perfect psychological study of masochism. And masochism is not cheap sleaze it is a terrible addiction that even basically normal people can get trapped into even though they know it will destroy them. Very much like drug addiction.Besides if you're into movies it's pretty obvious right from the start that this is the work of real professionals. Director Liliana Cavani was not famous before she did this but she certainly knew how to make a movie and had learnt the best lessons from her more famous counterparts. As for the acting by the two main performers Dirk Bogarde and Charlotte Rampling it is just top class no more to say.The movie starts on a bleak day in Vienna in the 1950's. It focuses right away on the character of Max Dirk Bogarde who works as a night porter at a fancy hotel. We soon find out that this ungrateful job is a hideout as he is a former nazi. And the hotel is actually a secret meeting place for gatherings of former Nazis who are well determined to let nobody track them down. One daya group arrives at the hotel. Among them a beautiful woman Charlotte Rampling. Her deep blue gaze freezes as her eyes meet the night porter's. They have recognized each other. She was kept years beforeas a young girl at a concentration camp where the night porter was operating as an SS guard. It gets soon hinted at by flashbacks that they had a close relationship which helped her survive physically even if she was left mentally destroyed.The woman Lucia is married to an orchestra director who tours in Vienna. He is just vaguely aware of her wife's past and as she demands him to depart immediately he convinces her to stay for just a few days. Lucia is in fact desperately asking for help but her bland husband doesn't understand. As for Max he is both afraid to be reported and at the same time irresistibly attracted. He attends the opera performance where Lucia's husband is playing while she is in the public. They sit there in the dark obsessed by each other's presence while the Magic Flute is playing but none of them makes a single move. That's a chilling scene.Lucia's husband is surprised as when they are about to leave she demands to stay for just a few days. It is already too late. Lucia has lived through hell then built a new life abroad and more or less forgotten. But it seems life doesn't taste anything for her anymore just no more suffering that's all. With Max she experienced a horrible but passionate love affair and in the deep of her heart she remained addicted to that atrocious intensity. She is like a former alcoholic who has quit for years but suddenly falls back.The rest of the story is predictable. Max and Lucia find each other again and cannot part anymorewhatever it may lead them to. Actually it can only lead them to death. Max's nazi colleagues spy on each other constantly and soon find out about the affair. Both Max and Lucia become dangerous people who must be eliminated.We learn more through flashbacks about the past relationship between Max and Lucia. The key scene of the movie takes place in a smoky and sinister officer's mess where masked men are playing a gloomy tune on an accordion. Half naked Lucia wearing an SScap performs a song by Marlene Dietrich which says If I were to wish for something I would like to be just a little happy because if I were too happy I would long for suffering. Couldn't be more explicit. As she has finished her show she joins Max at a table and he has a present for her in a box. A horrible present. The severed head of a prisoner who kept bothering her. Lucia recoils incredulous as she opens the box then looks in Max's eyes and sips in her glass of wine. What more extreme love present can a man make than killing for the woman he loves? This scene is almost unbearable and it's precisely the film's essential five minutes.So if you don't like this film it sounds like a normal reaction. It's actually difficult to like it  but one can find it interesting and important. Especially those who have experienced sexual abuse by relatives drug addiction or alcoholism or people who are related or engaged to such people. That makes quite a few. When one is plunged into destruction a solution is to take a liking for it. But it's an extreme solution which gets you intoxicated for life and may lead you to seek total destruction as an only way out.The phenomenon described in the movie has been observed many times even though it is difficult to understand or accept for an outsider. When people are abused and isolated for a long time whether in prison or in their own family it usual that they develop a bond with their abuser as he or she becomes their main affective reference. This is commonly referred to as the Stockholm syndrome.Better you don't watch this if you're feeling down.".

The first time I saw the movie I was a bit disappointed. I had heard so much about this movie that the film couldn't live up to my high expectations. But some scenes found a place in the back of my mind and stayed there. The second time I saw it I was intrigued more and more and ever since I see it as the classic it should be.If ever there was a difficult movie it was The Night Porter. The pace is slow and the characters are all weird. There aren't many movies where you get a homosexual Nazi wanting to be a ballet dancer and a sadistic Nazi still in love with love with a masochistic girl from the camps. There's more but I don't want to spoil the plot. Only a spark of the plot could have been the subject for lots of raunchy exploitation movies but The Night Porter manages to keep its class. The movies is set years after the war. Some Nazis were fortunate enough not to be caught and got on with their lives. Unfortunately one person has survived the camps as well. She immediately recognizes Max Dirk Bogarde her cruel SMmaster and he now a night porter in a hotel recognizes her Charlotte Rampling as well. The only problem is that the other living Nazis cannot know she's still alive or they would assassinate her. The passion between Max and his former slave returns and the Nazis find out about their relationship. Max tries to keep her out of their hands so madly in love that he wants to die for her. Again more information would spoil the movie.The Night Porter is one of the few movies where SMrelationships aren't immediately reduced to a bunch of idiots and losers playing around with whips and leather masks. It also dares to show you other Nazis than the Pavlovian dogs you normally get to see. And above all it stars Charlotte Rampling as Lucia. Watch her as she performs the dance of Salom and gets a present from Max know your Bible and have an idea of what's to come. Watch her face and her nearskeletonlike body very closefully that is how you should act disgust. Watch her as she locks herself in the bathroom and tries to hurt Max's foot with some glass. Listen to the music the perfect addition to this murky movie.Due to the difficulty of the movie it'll never raise above its status as cult classic and actually that's a shame. Be brave and try it.".

It's an intense and compelling study of these characters who flow in the most opposite of circles one a Nazi the other a Jewish prisoner in the concentration camp he works at and a love that transcends anything I've imagined experiencing. I've heard the film called dull numerous times and I could see why one would think this but I thought the haunting silences only made the film more engaging and had my eyes further glued to the screen. The structure of spasmodically switching from scenes in the concentration camp to when the two lovers see each other again in 1957 really helped put the viewer into the mindset of the two main characters. It jars the mind and keeps us aware of this inordinate love and why these people are so confused and attracted to one another. A truly original technique that I really admired. Liliana Cavani uses angles and wideshots that create a haunting sense of passion and really made the cinematography rank high among my all time favorites. Dick Bogarde and especially Charlotte Rampling are phenomenal. Their performances are passionate intense and natural. The film certainly lived up to my expectations.".

This deals with Max the night porter of the title who has tried to put his past in the SS behind him. One night he spots a woman Lucia and they both recognize each other... she was one of the concentration camp prisoners and the two had a specific relationship with one another. The plot is captivating. This is deliberately paced and those who have short attention spans andor wish for a lot of developments in a feature are not the intended audience for this. I found the behavior of all of the characters chillingly psychologically accurate and this definitely takes a long hard unflinching and uncompromising look at human nature and the mind and not everyone is going to like the observations. The acting is excellent. All of the leads disappear into their roles. They are all wellcast too talent as well as physical types. I don't know if anything similar to this has truly happened but I can imagine it and this does pay respect to the historical events. The editing mixes flashbacks and the present effectively. This has disturbing content including violence sexuality that is not graphic and explicit nudity. None of it is gratuitous. The DVD has credits and posters and while the print starts out looking shabby it turns out to be perfectly fine. I recommend this to anyone who believes they can handle it and is mature enough from reading this review. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Way back in the mists of time in the early 1970's there were some directors both male and female who made sincere efforts to make films that dealt with themes of fringesexuality and dark nihilism but create  them with seriousness mood and poignancy in other words they tried to raise the fringes up to the level of High Art. Along with films like Last Tango in Paris The Night Porter is a story about a very implausible encounter between 2 people who willingly descend into selfdestructive behavior and death. The story involves a female Holocaustsurvivor who accidentally reunites with a man who used to be a Nazi guard at her concentrationcamp and who had sexually tormented her. But we're to believe that she actually loved this man and fondly remembers his sexual exploitation of her in the camp portrayed through many flashbacks. The very idea of this occurring in real life defies belief but perhaps that's not the point. I assume the director who is a woman wants the viewer to accept the scenario asis and then ponder the many gray areas of sexual morality and emotional bondage between men and women and then question the dark side of the soul and where it leads us if we explore its power too deeply. I assume the film's nihilistic ending is the director's answer to these questions.The film's pace is very ponderous and pensive with long periods of silence and wordless flashbacks to the Holocaust. The film is very moody includes some very pretty Classical music scores and the camera frames scenes with may creative angles and reflections. Charlotte Rampling is really quite good in her role as the Holocaust survivor. Most people remember her topless dance in one of her flashbacks where she dances seductively for several Nazi officers but it's actually quite tastefully done filmed as an odd analogy of the New Testament story of Salome's Last Dance. It's probably one her best roles despite the unbelievable context.This film is very much part of that genre of early 1970's films known today as Cinema of Alienation. The early 70's was a time of some pretty serious artistic Angst which is a mindset that can sometimes produce very powerful art. The film's ending would never get past Hollywood today since American audiences are supposed to walk out of theaters feeling happy and secure not disturbed.I recommend the film. It will linger in your mind for quite a while. But it's not a datemovie so choose your coviewers wisely. Remember this is High Art... ".

How can one find redeeming virtue in the sadomasochistic affair between a former S.S. Officer and concentration camp survivor who chance to encounter one another after the war and resume their affair?  But indeed the power of this film is in that very choice.  Charlotte Rampling's postwar concert pianist is beautiful refined successful and married.  Dirk Bogard's former S.S. officer is resigned to quietly living out his days incognito as a night porter in a hotel secretly preserving his true identity and trying to avoid detection by authorities.  In his servile role as a night porter it's hard to believe he was ever in a position of power over anyone else. But we see in flashbacks what he became when he did have that power and it isn't pretty. Yet as E.M. Forster said Only connect.  And therein lies the mystery.  For no matter how one points a finger at these lovers and declares them to be sick they are indeed lovers and their attraction to one another compels them to act in spite of the danger to both of them.  I believe this is one of the most intriguing stories of human connectedness you will ever see!  If you can get past the impulse to respond like the rest of the pack you may get a glimpse at the mystery of the human condition.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to dismiss a film like this or Salo or In the Realm of the Senses as garbage. It's too easy in fact and not very fair. These films are all very interesting if you can take them. And if you can't stand the heat hey stay out of the kitchen.Among the ranks of what I'll call the Artsploitation flick The Night Porter is rather tame. There are only a couple of hardcore sex scenes and there are really only two scenes with nudity.What I like about this film is first and foremost the performance by Dirk Bogarde. The subtle guilt and shame he projects is simply amazing. He really builds a three dimensional character and mostly without dialogue. Other performers are weaker. Charlotte Rampling his captive gives a very uneven performance. Sometimes it seems on the money other times it seems forced or blank. None of the others are really worth mentioning except for that one actor's ballet dancing which is quite remarkable.Cavani's direction is sensuous. I saw this film for the second time todayand I had failed to notice before that it was directed by a woman. Unfortunately that doesn't affect my reading of the film any but it is interesting. This definitely seemed like a male project. Cavani's direction has a certain grace a certain elegance. The film contains several scenes that could be called masterpieces in the midst of a lesser work. My favorite in the entire film is the one where Lucia locks herself in the bathroom breaks a bottle in front of the door and then allows Max to run in after her. This scene is so marvelously directed it would work particularly well when seen as a separate entity. The famous nude cabaret song the one depicted on the Criterion cover is also exquisite.Technically it is perfect. The cinematography is beautiful as I've mentioned. The musical score is also gorgeous. It's possibly one of the greatest. The biggest failure of the film is definitely its script. The story is very difficult to follow. It's never clear exactly what has happened since the war and what these former Nazis are doing in Vienna. It's also unclear what exactly the trials are that are always being brought up. And I'm not sure what they are afraid of what they originally plan to do with Lucia or anything like that. Or why they can't break into Max's apartment again. A lot of this stuff seems silly. I would have also liked Lucia's character better developed. We get the sense that she accepted Max's advances so quickly so that she could get his protection which she receives in that biblical dance scene. I want more yet. With Max so well developed Lucia feels somewhat like an object for the plot.I rate this a high 710.".

The Night Porter isn't one of these films.It submerges you in the warped world of two people reunited by very unusual circumstances while managing to perfectly portray the Zeitgeist. Lucia is a camp survivor who while imprisoned develops a weird bond with one of her torturers Maximilian. In a way they depend on each other to survive. They reunite by chance in a Vienna hotel where Maximilian works as a night porter 13 years after the war.Their lives spiral out of control as they struggle to stay together blocking out the outside world along with its moral principles what is considered normal acceptable.What Lucia feels for Maximilian could be dismissed as a manifestation of Stockholm syndrome but I believe one could view it entirely different. Lucia never got over the events in the camp those were the strongest memories and the encounter with max reactivates all these feelings of masochistic nostalgia once more. Even the song she chooses to perform for the Nazi generals allows us a glimpse of her personality of her way of seeing things I would like to be a little bit happy. Because if I were too happy I would long for sorrow.Maximilian sees Lucia as his only means for redemption. If he can protect and 'love' Lucia all his act will be forgiven. It is clear the years of cruelty have had an effect on his mind and that also he never really agreed with the methods used he refuses to give his former Nazi comrades the salute. Lucia is his way out.With its cold colour scheme haunting music and brilliant acting The Night Porter brings us in the middle of a very personal drama. By showing us the story of two very strange characters the film succeeds in recreating the atmosphere after WWII.SPOILER. The ending is what makes this film a work of art it's not a pleasant walk in the sunset a happy ending for a traditional love story but a depiction of the brutality of real life a sudden end to a relationship seen as unnatural. This is one of the best films I've ever seen and I cannot recommend it enough.".

Max is the exSS officer who enjoyed a complex sadomasochistic relationship during WW2 with Lucia Charlotte Rampling his Jewish captive. When more than a decade and a half later Lucia turns up at the hotel where Max now works as a night porter old pains and pleasures are reignited.Liliana Cavani's film is potent powerful stuff a kaleidescope of human observations and ideas. Bogarde's performance is an intense and tortured one as is Rampling's essaying of the fascinating Lucia. A central plot thread concerning a core of exSS officers battling to erase their official records while fighting just as hard to maintain their inner power structure is the material of explosive drama.Bogarde and Rampling's addiction to their checkered history rings absolutely true and provides for a series of potent erotic interludes. Cavani's handling of the script's multiple layers is expert while the stately inventive cinematography by Alfio Contini is striking and truly an example of style following substance.A thriller a love story and a study of grotesque sexual politics The Night Porter is an outstanding achievement and a prime exhibit of a type of cinema that has now vanished. In every sense a work that begins with the intellect.".

When more than a decade and a half later Lucia turns up at the hotel where Max now works as a night porter old pains and pleasures are reignited.Liliana Cavani's film is potent powerful stuff a kaleidescope of human observations and ideas. Bogarde's performance is an intense and tortured one as is Rampling's essaying of the fascinating Lucia. A central plot thread concerning a core of exSS officers battling to erase their official records while fighting just as hard to maintain their inner power structure is the material of explosive drama.Bogarde and Rampling's addiction to their checkered history rings absolutely true and provides for a series of potent erotic interludes. Cavani's handling of the script's multiple layers is expert while the stately inventive cinematography by Alfio Contini is striking and truly an example of style following substance.A thriller a love story and a study of grotesque sexual politics The Night Porter is an outstanding achievement and a prime exhibit of a type of cinema that has now vanished. In every sense a work that begins with the intellect.";

It's very hard to obtain just one feeling towards the film since it has so many layers and creates so many emotions.The lead a night porter who used to be a Nazi officer in charge of a concentration camp encounters his past when one of his previous captives checks into his hotel. A relationship between captor and captive is then revealed. As a matter of fact in some sick way they are very much in love. Whether it's the Stockholm syndrome or something else is never quite revealed but when her fianc leaves she stays behind and the two of them pick up where they left off.Of course it can in no way be a idyllic relationship and of course problems occur. The fear that she can be used as a witness spreads among the Nazi underground which he is still very much a part off though he wants to leave and stay in the shadows. The movie is about what the night porter does to protect his love from danger and might I say it's quite poetic.Fabulous performances from both Dirk Bogardemy favorite actor of all time and Charlotte Rampling. The frames are nearly perfect and the film itself was so complicated and well done that the director Liliana Cavani should be considered a master.But lets get back to the emotions this film contains. I just can't makeup my mind how I feel about these two people and their love. One side of it is quite beautiful but the other side is both disgusting and incredibly chilling. Unsettling haunting beautiful chilling poetic disgusting and perhaps even romantic are the words I would use to describe this film. It's these mixed responses that makes me love this film so much.".

The general feeling seem to be that the Nazi program of extermination shouldn't be treated lightly.  Here we have nudity male homosexuality fellatio sodomy rolling around and having intercourse on a jellycovered floor.  Did I leave anything out?  And of course anything with a radiant young Charlotte Rampling running around in the nude can't be all tragic.But the movies treat the holocaust lightly all the time if by lightly we mean exploitatively.  The most familiar stories center on survivors all of whom carry with them an undeniable moral weight.  The power of survivorhood is so intense that recently a number of stories have come to light in which individuals invented histories of concentration camp experiences.  And of course all Germans must be the devils in a living hell.  These are convenient myths but they cheapen what actually happened and lead to a misunderstanding of the kind that perpetuates racial and national hatreds.  Historically the episode was worse than the media seem to imagine.  The inmates were not all saints.  The guards were not all sadists. At least some of them must have been capable of love.  The Nazis didn't kill six million people in the camps.  They killed more than twice that number if you count not only Jews but homosexuals communists the mentally retarded gypsies and political undesirables.These considerations rather complicate matters.  Evil there was without question but as is usual in human affairs it was mixed in with other very common personality and social traits.  The media treatment of the holocaust is usually so simple minded that it relieves us of the need for thought.The Night Porter is unsettling because it violates these strictures. With his past Max the Dirk Bogarde figure must not have any redeeming qualities.  Lucia his victim cannot possibly care for him.  Since we don't want to believe any of this  and it IS implausible  it's easy to hate this movie.But actually it isn't so terribly done.  There is first Charlotte Rampling unbeatable in this sort of role.  Then there is Dirk Bogarde who has never given a better performance except perhaps in The Servant. What he does with an ordinary scene sitting at a table or desk is outstanding in itself.  He seems to compulsively rub a napkin or piece of paper slowly and methodically across the surface.  Absent the cloth or paper he quietly squishes his fingertips against the wood.It isn't a great movie but neither does it deserve the scorn that's been heaped upon it.".

I must say though that I put off watching this for a long time because the subject matter and idea of a film that romanticizes Nazism just seemed one step too far especially as a Jewish person. However after seeing it come up again and again I decided to bite the bullet and give it a go.Yes this film is brutal and not for the faint at heart. I have a natural interest in transgressive sexuality and consider myself somewhere on that spectrum as well so maybe my opinion is biased but this film was not at all what I expected. I do not see it to be a Nazisploitation film as it has been labeled it does not romanticize Nazism. It is a deep psychological profile on bdsm and the dynamics of an abusive Ds relationship.The crazy thing is the main characters really do come to love each other in their own way albeit in a destructive violent way not unlike Heathcliffe and Cathy from Wuthering Heights. It is doomed but boy when they're together its like being caught in the middle of an erotic storm. Charlotte Rampling and Dirk Bogarde are maybe the best on screen couple I've seen in terms of sexual chemistry. The film really builds up the tension and puts you right in the face of their emotional turmoil. It is effective because outside of their affair the rest of the world is tight laced gloomy and overall feeling the effects of post war depression. It was geniusly done how delicate the whole game between the two is and the smallest sensory details add a layer of ingenuity and sexuality that is beyond belief. Dirk Bogarde's performance is brilliant his anger and sensuality and everything in between completely raw like a wild animal that constantly has to play at being human. Charlotte Rampling also had this totally unhinged quality and the two really work off each other's energy to bring together something genuine and not often captured on film.The Night Porter rocked my world and deeply moved me. It was all at once beautiful erotic heartbreaking romantic disturbing and terrible. It is a masterpiece.".

There is simply an unending buffet of explorable ideas with the lingering pain of concentration camp imprisonmentsexual abuse and transgression yet somehow this film seems content with not really exploring anything. Despite this the subject matter is never taken far enough to even be called exploitation. It's just.nothing. It feels as if Liliana Cavani saw this material as a challenge. Feeling that it was far too interesting she would see just how much she could whittle it down until no one would care one way or the other. There is an overwhelming feeling that perhaps the material actually was too risqu or subversive for her and as not to offend by going to any extreme it was kept generic out of safety. One cannot say for certain. Generic cinematography captures the lifelessness of the director's vision with dull grays pervading every shot.

Concurrently every one else in the cast defies all reason by staunch adherence to expressing less emotion than Caligari's Somnambulist. Claiming they are Nazi's or she is scarred from her past! do not excuse lazy direction and wooden performances. These people make Bresson's actors appear radiant and full of life. There is a key scene where Charlotte Rampling dances and serenades multiple SS officers while topless adorned with a Nazi commander's cap. This scene is not disturbing. It is not titillating or erotic. Yet it appears that the director's goal was to induce both feelings of attraction and repulsion in the viewer perhaps to have us realize her brilliance in making us question how we could be attracted to something so despicable though judging from the rest of the film Cavani may not be talented enough to create such a scene or think such a thought. What should be both haunting and beautiful turns hokey and irritating as it drags on.

	schema:headline " Controversial story will have you talking!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a very controversial film when it first came out in 1974 and they're was a lot of backlash towards it in the same manner that accompanied all of Pier Paolo Pasolini's films. I never liked Pasolini but I did find this film much better. Certainly more interesting than some have said. Liliana Cavani does have a focus point to this story and even though its an old fashioned one its surrounded in an unconventional manner. Dirk Bogarde is Max. The night porter in a seedy hotel who also happens to be a former SS officer. One day he notices a woman that is staying in his hotel and its a women that was his prisoner in a concentration camp and he had a sadomasochistic relationship with. Charlotte Rampling plays Lucia and at first she is stunned and wants to leave after seeing him but then she is unsure. One of the more remarkable scenes is when Max confronts Lucia and yells at her and slaps her asking why she had to pick his hotel. Lucia shows both hate and love in her reaction. It shows the viewer what kind of a strange but powerful bond was developed years earlier. Bogarde is terrific. His character is very neat and orderly and demonstrates his loyalty to the people staying at his hotel. Bogarde says so much without speaking and just using his fingers to run along edges of things. Ramplings beauty is needed in this film and her acting is also top notch. She does get very quiet towards the end but she has always been a brave actress and its needed here. Another scene that stands out is when she is a teenager in the concentration camp and in a skimpy leather Nazi uniform she performs Like Marlene Dietrich as Lola. SPOILER ALERT Later in the film other former SS officers learn of Max and a former prisoner and they want to get rid of her since she is a witness and Max refuses to give her up. Both of them are targeted and they hole up in an apartment. Cavani doesn't seem to care about how these two found each other or the circumstances she does though want to show that despite all the things that are going on nothing will separate them again. The last scene in the film shows this. They are dressed exactly the way when they first met. She in a dress for young girls and he in his Nazi uniform. Cavani does show some kinky and disturbing images but at the core of this film is just an unconventional love story. Its certainly worth a look.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was a very controversial film when it first came out in 1974 and they're was a lot of backlash towards it in the same manner that accompanied all of Pier Paolo Pasolini's films. I never liked Pasolini but I did find this film much better. Certainly more interesting than some have said. Liliana Cavani does have a focus point to this story and even though its an old fashioned one its surrounded in an unconventional manner. Dirk Bogarde is Max. The night porter in a seedy hotel who also happens to be a former SS officer. One day he notices a woman that is staying in his hotel and its a women that was his prisoner in a concentration camp and he had a sadomasochistic relationship with. Charlotte Rampling plays Lucia and at first she is stunned and wants to leave after seeing him but then she is unsure. One of the more remarkable scenes is when Max confronts Lucia and yells at her and slaps her asking why she had to pick his hotel. Lucia shows both hate and love in her reaction. It shows the viewer what kind of a strange but powerful bond was developed years earlier. Bogarde is terrific. His character is very neat and orderly and demonstrates his loyalty to the people staying at his hotel. Bogarde says so much without speaking and just using his fingers to run along edges of things. Ramplings beauty is needed in this film and her acting is also top notch. She does get very quiet towards the end but she has always been a brave actress and its needed here. Another scene that stands out is when she is a teenager in the concentration camp and in a skimpy leather Nazi uniform she performs Like Marlene Dietrich as Lola. SPOILER ALERT Later in the film other former SS officers learn of Max and a former prisoner and they want to get rid of her since she is a witness and Max refuses to give her up. Both of them are targeted and they hole up in an apartment. Cavani doesn't seem to care about how these two found each other or the circumstances she does though want to show that despite all the things that are going on nothing will separate them again.

	schema:reviewBody "I have mixed feelings about this film owing partly to the way it was promoted on its original release in the U.S. in 1974 as a titillating quasiporn movie. In fact the movie is actually somewhat restrained considering the grim subject matter.My most recent viewing leads me to consider it as a better movie than I had thought before with genuinely disturbing overtones and a far more serious exploration of a desperate and unhealthy love than one would expect. By the time the film ended there was no question in my mind that exNazi Max and former prisoner Lucia were in fact hopelessly in love with each other and needed each other in a way that far transcended a more normal relationship. The almost casual way that Lucia abandons her bland and clueless husband for her former captorlover is amazing in its down to earth simplicity. Nothing is more important to her than Max and he is willing to die for her.Not that this is a beautiful love story or a perfect movie. There are a lot of unanswered questions about the backgrounds of the two main characters and I wish Lucia's personality and motivations had been explored in more detail. There are moments that risk seeming unintentionally funny despite the somber approach. I found myself wishing that the writer and director had skipped all the intrigue with the Nazis spying on each other and concentrated more on the affair between Max and Lucia.The acting is generally good and the storyline made fairly credible. It's hard to imagine anyone but Charlotte Rampling in the difficult role of Lucia and she is amazing in her passion and perversity. The problematic role of Max is handled well by Dirk Bogarde managing to evoke some sort of sympathy for the character which is certainly not easily earned considering his background as an SS officer at a concentration camp during the war.This is an odd thoughtprovoking movie that can be both frustrating and fascinating to watch and is definitely not for everyone. More than one viewing is required to begin to appreciate the depths of the performances undertaken by Bogarde and Rampling but it can leave a bad taste in the mouth. The film is probably best regarded as a sort of highbrow guilty pleasure.One more thing I kept finding myself thinking of the Italian film Kapo a seldom seen movie with a young Susan Strasberg as a camp prisoner who does what it takes to survive. These two pictures might make for an interesting double feature.".

	schema:reviewBody "Liliani Cavani's 1974 film set in 1957 Vienna is a puzzling and uncomfortable study of a sadomasochistic relationship and is worth seeing for the performances of Dirk Bogard as night porterexSS officer Max and especially Charlotte Rampling as former concentration camp inmate Lucia. But it would be wrong to draw from it much in the way of generalised messages about fascism concentration camps or the holocaust. That some Nazis were sadists is hardly a revelation that among their millions of victims a few might have enjoyed being dominated shouldn't surprise us and that such a relationship should voluntarily be renewed after the war may be unlikely but not entirely incredible. So far as we can see in the film the only point of contact between Max and Lucia is their physical relationship based on mutual cruelty and pain which we are shown via graphic sometimes shocking images. Apparently they have no real desire to go beyond this physical relationship which they lock themselves into until it leads to their deaths. They could easily evade the siege of their apartment by a group of exNazis if they so wished.The film enters the area of the overtly political in its subplot about this group of exNazis who try to come to terms with their pasts by confessing their crimes to each other while at the same time taking direct action to file away both incriminating documents and awkward witnesses. The film leaves this story unfinished with these fascists going about their business in view of the recent resurgence of the extreme rightwing in Austria this seems an appropriately open ending. Music is prominent in the film. One scene takes place at a performance of Mozart's The Magic Flute. As well as reminding us of the sublime heights to which man can rise in contrast to the depths we have witnessed in the concentration camp scenes Mozart's opera seems  relevant because like this film it deals enigmatically with themes of good and evil imprisonment and freedom. Also relevant is the song Lucia sings in the key scene where she imitates Marlene Dietrich's Lola in the Blue Angel it was written by Friedrich Hollander and roughly translated it is about how the singer finds it difficult to choose between good and bad times because happiness and sadness go together.".

Infrastructure is back to normal but the scars inflicted by the war have only begun to heal. You were an SS officer who used to have a job that was unpleasant yet in your mind necessary. Now you're a lowly night porter for a swanky hotel in West Berlin.Thus starts the story of Maximilian Aldorfer Dirk Bogarde a man who lurks in the shadows along with a small cabal of surviving Nazis. They quietly meet to conduct trials to conceal any inkling of their past before the authorities find out going so far as to kill possible witnesses. Max's life is unassuming and guiltridden I want to live like a church mouse he says. That is until the arrival of Lucia Charlotte Rampling a former concentration camp prisoner whom he had a sadomasochistic relationship with and was her pseudoprotector. They recognize each other right away and the question becomes what will they do about it? The movie devolves from its tension inducing premise to a sensationalistic exploitation film. Don't get me wrong its leaps and bounds above Ilsa She Wolf of the SS 1975 but the intention is artistically the same and the fact that director Liliana Cavani tries to claw for deeper meanings beyond its trashy premise makes the film more manipulative than engrossing. There are references to the book of Mark and John the Baptist a near naked ballet sequence of Mozart's Die Zauberflote and comparisons between Pelleas and Melisande all of which amount to a bucket of filth. It a film that attempts cultural literacy but makes the fatal mistake of being alienating unpleasant and ultimately wearisome to watch.The Night Porter 1974 is not so much a movie as it is a forceful invitation into the minds of two severely damaged people. As the relationship between Max and Lucia turn into a despairing echo of what it used to be we see the extent of Lucia's Stockholm syndrome and the depths of Max's depravity. Yet what is forced upon us is the notion that this sordid love story 1 matters and 2 is tragic in a saccharine Romeo and Juliet kind of way.There is an uncomfortable longrunning juxtaposition between sadomasochism and Nazis. Perhaps it's because even today we equate Nazism with death destruction and absolute authority. In some circles it's hard not to get aroused by staring death in the face especially when it's carrying a whip. But while I'm sure this sexual predilection predates The Night Porter Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom 1975 and The Producers 1967 I can't help but feel this kind of treatment makes light of the Nazis and their resoundingly negative contribution to world history. Perhaps instead of dressing up in black leather and swastikas it would be wise to downgrade to a Vichy Greatcoat and Kepi you know just in case a friend goes rummaging through your closet.Ultimately while the premise is intriguing and there are touches of artistic merit The Night Porter is an insipid opportunistic treatment of history. It makes menial attempts at making its characters believable and relatable but sequentially removes them from a realm of reality within the films final grueling half hour. What should have been a movie about history human frailty or lacking that credible love became a kinky provocation offering little other than cheap thrills.httpwww.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

Divya does not appreciate being followed around by Lovely and creates a fictional woman Chhaya who distracts him by repeatedly phoning him and telling him that she loves him. Lovely believes this person to be real and falls in love. In a bar Ranjan's brother attacks Divya and is killed by Lovely  setting into motion a chain of events that will pit Lovely not only against the enraged Mhatre brothers but also against Sartaj himself who believes that Lovely is attempting to elope with his daughter.";

They talk over the phone so Salman doesn't know who his lady love is Kareena is aware of this fact. Thus the movie continues with some funny moments few romantic scenes etc.SPOILER!!! The weird part of the movie is the scene shown a few minutes before the ending. Why why would someone write an ending like that? Out of NOWHERE Kareena's best friend falls in love with Salman! They don't even show any such scene where the best friend pines over him or something before that. She hugs him once and falls in love! What a twist!That didn't exactly ruin the movie for me because I am not a fan of Salman movies however the 'twist in the story' was really stupid.There are good action scenes in the movie some songs are nice. Kareena is good in the movie. I am sure this movie will do well in India because for some reason people just love Salman. ".

	schema:reviewBody "With this new EID release of another SALMAN KHAN movie I would rather like to go for its review in a different mode.First of all let me tell you that as far as the economics of Film Business goes this has A New Blockbuster written all over it without any doubt. Releasing on a national EID holiday on Wednesday with more than 2500 prints and 1015 shows in a multiplex plus full houses in the single screen theaters too How can such a film can ever flop irrespective of its content or quality? Considering the phenomenal fan following of the STAR it is bound to become a success in any case before even the week starts on Monday. So if you want to know the box office result of the film then in all possibilities this should make a hattrick of Hits for Salman unless the Indian viewers wake up miraculously from their media created sleep.Now secondly coming to the content of the film what can one think of the story of a film with the title BODYGUARD? Obviously it has to be the love story between the Bodyguard and the owner of the body he is guarding. Hence in that respect the film has got nothing new and it remains completely predictable from the first frame itself where the viewer very well knows what he is going to see in the next reels.So it all comes down to the treatment of the film which sadly is again below the mark and not at all impressive as expected. Salman's magic is there for sure but he is not given the perfect action or entertaining sequences which can win over the viewers as compared to his WANTED or DABANGG. The humor is pretty lifeless and sounds outdated with all 80s kind of jokes which fail to create the required impact. However it seems that the writers were very much aware of its boring plot and therefore they thought of adding an unexpected twist towards its climax. But believe me this last reel addition is one of the most bizarre climaxes I have ever seen written very poorly without any kind of sane real life vision.In few words it's a big disappointment in almost all its departments ranging from the story script direction and execution. Though the stars acts convincingly putting best of their efforts but they alone are not capable of giving you a good time in the theater. Honestly speaking I enjoyed only the first opening song when SALMAN enters the screen in the entire film and was really thinking why this was chosen to be remade in Hindi since it had nothing to rave about in its script and content.Nevertheless SALMAN is there with all his trademark moves in the film along with doing another kind hearted gesture for his own real life bodyguard Tiger. Very sportingly Salman wears the uniform of Tiger's own Security Agency and also makes Tiger dance standing next to him in the opening song. I guess that's one of the reason why SALLU BHAI is loved all over the world for his numerous similar kind of humble friendly acts.To end the review I would like to tell you that why I almost walked out of the theater while watching BODYGUARD.The film is directed by the same director for the third time in a different language. Now who would have done it to satisfy his creative urge? Clearly this was a project undertaken for money and money alone otherwise what is the charm of directing the same script for the third time? As a real creatively concerned person the director should have given the project to another talented upcoming director and he could have been the Creative Visualiser of the project to keep an overall look on it.But coming to the main point of my distress there is a scene in the film where people are standing around a pyre on which the dead body is lying covered in white. To be precise this is a sequence in which they all have gathered to burn one of the main villains of the film killed by Salman. Now to my shocking surprise the scene has been shot by the talented director in HEAVY RAINS. The water is pouring heavily from the sky the pile of wood is all wet the body is all wet and here come a person holding a burning mashaal to set the pyre on fire. And as filmy it can get he also successfully puts the pyre on fire and then we are shown the body burning calmly just in the middle of a heavy rainfall.If this is what you call direction then Sorry I am not interested in writing about this film anymore. For me its just like playing with the innocent loyalty of your millions of fans. And all the BIG STARS like SALMAN really need to give it a serious thought.".

Salman Khan is still a quite good action actor but he has played so many similar supermanlike roles in so many similar movies I doubt he'd still enjoy this kind of formulaic role. Being an action hero character must be very tiresome that might be the reason why Sean Connery refused to play the 007 after several similar nodepth no soul killing machine for the British secret service. Salman Khan should also take a serious consideration of his acting career because he's getting old and getting heavier. Asking Kareena Kapoor to play the daughter of a super rich and super powerful man was actually a very bad casting job. Because she's too old to play a college student and her acting talent is not quite boundless but limited. I've seen many of her movies but never considered her a good enough actor.This screenplay was so poorly put together full of jerk and clownlike characters the directing obviously did a very poor job too. The most serious problem of this movie is such kind of storyline scenario and plot have already been repeated so many times there's indeed no need to add another bomber into this same old same old crap.".

Nothing can hurt him even the rake completely made of metal and even balls go punctured from hitting him. I don't know what went wrong the director is same the storyline is same but the movie becomes super hit in two languages but becomes so irritating in third.

The song I love You has many scenes which in actual films involved the hero getting hurt by the ball not the ball getting hurt by the hero Wooden rake hitting him and he fells unconscious and the last it's the hero who fells in the pool not pushing some girl into the pool.

	schema:reviewBody "After Dabbang and Ready this film is going to be third consecutive feather in Salman's cap.I felt a little disappointed with the treatment of the movie. The screenplay rushed at an odd pace. The first half was intriguing and speedy but the second half stammers a bit. Again in the last 20 minutes we see a hurricane of emotions.The movie has all the proportionate elements of a Masala Movie but I seriously felt a letdown in the humor quotient of the movie. The so called Tsunami Singh was a high disappointment rather than him his T Shirts looked funny. The dialogues were above average.A diehard Salman fan might get disappointed but it was a pleasure seeing Salman in a romantic movie that too was totally unexpected. Music boosted the movie due to which the faulty screenplay gets sidelined.Salman Khan is in top notch here. Kareena is back in the form. Mahesh Manjrekar Aditya Pancholi Raj Babbar are remarkable. Rajat Rawail as Tsunami is a letdown. He acts well sans comic timing.Editing by Sanjay Sankla is good he manages to keep the movie on track in spite of futile screenplay. Cinematography by Sejal Shah is marvelous. Himesh Reshammiya has lived up to the expectations from the fans. Background score from Sandeep Shirodkar is top class.After watching this one my recent favorites from Salman goes in the following order. 1. Dabbang 2. Bodyguard 3. Wanted 4. ReadyFinally watch it! Even if you are not a Salman Khan fan you wont regret watching this one.".

The screenplay rushed at an odd pace. The first half was intriguing and speedy but the second half stammers a bit. Again in the last 20 minutes we see a hurricane of emotions.The movie has all the proportionate elements of a Masala Movie but I seriously felt a letdown in the humor quotient of the movie. The so called Tsunami Singh was a high disappointment rather than him his T Shirts looked funny. The dialogues were above average.A diehard Salman fan might get disappointed but it was a pleasure seeing Salman in a romantic movie that too was totally unexpected.

	schema:reviewBody "From the last 2 years Salman Khan the 'jaaneman' of masspullers has been giving blockbuster hits like Wanted2009 Dabangg2010 and that has not been a failure a single time. Wanted Dabangg Bbuddah Singham  Bollywood has got into form of welcoming spectacular action flicks so Bodyguard is nothing new for it but a Salman touch. But Bodyguard is not a Action flick like the above ones. It's main stream carries Romance but we can see a situation also where action is necessary just like Ready. Like Ready this one is also an adaption of south hit 'Bodyguard'. But the question arrives is Bodyguard better or Ready? Ready was a comiccon movie where there was no serious matter but Bodyguard doesn't lack of that at all. Bbuddah even being a spectacular film stood a 'soso' in the boxoffice Singham disappointed very much in both fields so can Bodyguard be the most successful Action movie of this year? The Answer's 'Yes'.When it comes to being punctual and doing his duties perfectly Lovely Singh is unmatchable. Taking great pride in what he does he spares no effort in giving his everything to his profession.Summoned for an assignment of guarding Divya the daughter of Sartaj Rana a business tycoon. Lovely Singh accompanies her to her campus but ends up rubbing her the wrong way with his overprotective nature ...and paranoia about security. She finds him to be a major obstacle in leading a regular campus life. To throw him offtrack and get him out of the way she comes up with a 'masterplan' that of trapping him in a fake love affair. 'Once he's smitten by the girl of his dreams and is reveling in his newfound romance he will leave us alone and we shall be free to do our own thing unhindered' says Divya to her friends.She becomes an anonymous admirer of his and starts hounding him expressing her 'feelings' in no uncertain terms. Lovely Singh however proves to be a tough nut to crack and it takes quite a bit of doing from her side to penetrate his fortlike exterior. But once she succeeds in doing so he transforms into a completely different person. Divya is triumphant and is all set to relish her regained freedom.But things take an unexpected turn when she learns a few things about Lovely Singh. Things that she could've never even imagined! And she soon finds herself trapped in a dilemma that she's unable to resolve! And with her soon enough Lovely Singh finds himself ensnared in a web of lies trickery and deceit! On the whole Bodyguard is a successful tale of Love Faith  Betrayal. Even the film is not an action movie fully the action scenes are sure to rain whistles and claps and shouts. When you see Salman's entry with the title track be sure that there will be no mercy for applause throughout the hall.Siddique's simple but effective story and screenplay has every essential present in it that can bring a rockhard mood in the hero. Lovely Singh is the symbol of silence toughness and roughness and the script helps enough to glorify it. The twistinthetale in the climax which is one of the most surprising ones appeared in recent times was a stunner that makes you forget everything but to concentrate on the movie. How Sallu was tricked by nearly every man he trusted even the person he was protecting throughout Kareena's sudden change in emotion the unique storyline and some few but awesomely stylish action sequences and moves makes Bodyguard a dream debut for any director. Just like Abhinav Singh Kashyap Siddique just got himself a masterblaster at his first try.The first half of the movie was just going by the story to come to the main plot but the second half was furious in parts and it totally abolished the flaws of the first part. The second part works in a respective manner and transcends conceptually to an unbelievable climax. There are some comic moments by Rajat Rawail  some tough moments by the hero himself which are joy to watch.Music of this movie is a bit disappointing. The title track is perfect no doubt. But other tracks are not so special. 'Teri Meri' is beautifully visualized and it can be a good pick.This one should be counted in one of the best performances by Salman Khan. The always 'nobakwaas' silent sweet  tough in times Lovely Singh showed some guts and attitudes which are like the very first time in Bollywood. Lovely Singh overlaps Radhe  Chulpul Pandey this time. Bloody Good! Kareena Kapoor was pretty and stole some actually good moments. As this movie is mainly mancentric Kareena's character can look a bit unimportant but as she's a good performer she tried to not let us feel she was unimportant at all. Mahesh Manjrekar was disappointing. Aditya Pancholi in a cameo having a fistfight with Lovely was commendable. Rajat Rawail gives some laughs. Raj Babbar had nothing much to do. Others like Hazelextremely beautiful girl Asrani Mohan Kapoor etc. were okay.Vijayan's action will yet again steal the awards this year only if Ra. One  Don 2 doesn't compete such well. BGM by Sandeep Shirodhkar were perfectly situational. Art direction by Shailesh Mahadik  Monica Angelica Bhowmick doesn't catch eye. Editing by Sanjay Sankla is appropriate.Sallu's his intentions directly indicated that Bodyguard will shake the boxoffice for a big time and I'm sure he will pass with flying colors. Bodyguard is a mustwatch for the diehard Salman fans and those who are entertaining movie lovers this one's a certain dish that they would lick fingers after finishing. Final verdict 'Khud Pe Ek Ehsaan Karna Ke Bodyguard Ko Miss Nahi Karna'.".

The film didn't show any promise neither from its trailer neither when the reel starts rolling. As the painfully hilarious proceedings go on there is no way you can concentrate except to wonder how far Salman's star power is going to drag this film. It is evident that the director has put all his test on Salman and played a rather bold step. Not surprisingly the movie will be a crowd pleasure for many a viewer but there a re many who will be fatigued by its lack of plot and tactless story telling.Meant to be a love story the movie is as predictable as a five year old can imagine. But the most painful scenes are the incessant annoying jokes from the side characters and the naive portrayal of the lead character.May be fat jokes were never this bad. In this male star power driven film there is definitely no space for Kareena Kapoor to show her talent. Whatever but as time passes by and peril hovers on the female lead the action scenes we are fed is not that brilliant too. As many previous films have proved that hero worship is not bad for box office but at least they should be made credible enough for all to believe or at best convincing. But no Bodyguard is a far cry from this and instead we get is a lot of crappy and cheap special effects. And the last and the most important scene of unbuttoning Salman's shirt was by far the worst creativity anyone can come up with. Its really sad that after so much of crazy mishaps there was some substance at the climax of the film. Though the writing at the climax should be praised it is too less an too little after two hours of stupidity.At least Salman's charisma works enough for you to wait till the end. Its surprising that a single performance can put such leverage to a film as such. And a special applaud to the song 'Teri Meri' which was much better than all other mediocre tracks. At the end it doesn't seem fair that a single star and a single song put so many audiences through the film. May be such case shouldn't be criticized rather appraised for such a daring feat.".

Cleopatra was a total disaster.  It has no redeeming quality that I know of.  It is therefore important for embodying in one film nearly everything that you can do wrong in making a movie.  It is a movie that you must see if you are ever to understand what a truly good film really is.  The second was Tom Jones with Albert Finney and Susannah York shot with rented equipment and costumes on the streets of London with a supporting cast of brilliant British ensemble players and extras who stoodin just to get in a film. Tom Jones is simply one of the best motion pictures of all time for my money The Best from Literature.John Osborne who wrote the screen play produced a marvelous vehicle but the genius of Tom Jones is Tony Richardson.  He moves the actors and the story about the screen with a bawdy grace and earthy gentility that paints action and raucous laughter and beauty across one another with an even hand.  It is a glimpse of antiquity so close and real that we can nearly touch it and it makes us want to.  Though to be perfectly honest I'm not sure we'd care for the smell of it.Tom Jones is a low budget low tech high quality film that must win the award for the Most with the Least.  The photography is beautiful not because it used a dozen half million dollar cameras it is beautiful because it is good photography.  The acting wins out and casts of thousands would only serve to clutter the stage.   See this film whenever wherever and as often as you possibly can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Jones is a movie adaptation of the classic Eighteenth century novel masterpiece of Henry Fielding made up by the greatest contemporary British playwriter John Osborne and directed by one of the main film directors of English Free Cinema Tony Richardson. This film came at end of this golden period of the English Cinema in the sixties and it is the highest moment of this cinema. Tom Jones shows in the person of Tom Jones the masterly Albert Finney the point of view of the angry young man looking to the stupidity and the hypocrisies of the Eighteenth century society which resembles our times. It is not at all just a funny film even if some scenes are extremely funny and are some classics in the history of cinema famous like the one in which Tom eating a rich supper with his woman is really looking like eating her with the eyes. Tom Jones is the adventurous hystory of a modern hero who finally conquers his true love after any kind of trouble. This is an highly cinematographic film e.g. the movement of the camera gives itself the idea of happiness in the scenes of love in the country of Tom and Sophie the beautiful and greatest Susannah York the drama of the situation in which Tom risk to be hanged or the funniness in the bawdy scenes in the inn. In the beginning the film even outlines the beginning of the complex story using even the style of the silent cinema...Tom JonesAlbert Finney even also speaks directly to the public of the film reaching with his greatest originality an extreme level of funniness and pleasantness. The photography of the film resembles with its colours and views the landscapes of English painting of the Eighteenth century like in Hogarth's pictures. The fox hunting scene is pictorially beautiful. The actors are all the best of the English theatre of that period and playing at their best where theatre is so important and lively in England. Concluding a film that gives the sense of the joy of living through the movie media at the highest level it's a must to see even only this film a masterpiece of the forgotten but greatest English film director Tony Richardson. As Giancarlo Grazzini the greatest Italian cinematographic critic of that time wrote it was the best film presented at the Film Festival of Venice worthy of winning also the Golden Lion there and not just the Oscars!".

The philander English lad has good heart and affinity for troubles and an eye for the ladies  confronting amorous and bawdy adventures . His true love is Sophie Susannah York  the daughter of a higherclass rich owner Hugh Griffith.The picture is a lavish rendition of a classic novel written by Henry Fielding with lots of entertainment and fun . It is plenty of satire  irony  comedy  tongueincheek and amusement . Nice acting by Albert Finney  however  he felt the lead role wasn't serious enough and agreed to star only if he got a producing credit  he later traded the credit for profit participation . Very good support cast gives splendid acting . Feature film debut for David Warner  Julian Glover and Lynn Redgrave . Lively and jolly soundtrack by John Addison  author of numerous classic scores of the English Free Cinema . The film was very well directed by Tony Richardson who in 1977 made an attempt to return with similar character Joseph Andrews but the freshness  inspiration and magic had gone . It is followed by a sequel The bawdy adventures of Tom Jones an exploitive extension directed by Cliff Owen with Arthur Lowe  Joan Collins and Trevor Howard . Tom Jones picture was undoubtedly the biggest year . The film obtained Academy Awards in 1963 to best film for United Artists  Director Tony Richardson  adapted screenplay John Osborne and original music John Addison and was nominated  Albert Finney  Hugh Griffith  Diane Cilento  Joyce Redman and Edith Evans by their robustly agreeable characterization . Well worth watching.".

It is plenty of satire  irony  comedy  tongueincheek and amusement . Nice acting by Albert Finney  however  he felt the lead role wasn't serious enough and agreed to star only if he got a producing credit  he later traded the credit for profit participation . Very good support cast gives splendid acting . Feature film debut for David Warner  Julian Glover and Lynn Redgrave . Lively and jolly soundtrack by John Addison  author of numerous classic scores of the English Free Cinema . The film was very well directed by Tony Richardson who in 1977 made an attempt to return with similar character Joseph Andrews but the freshness  inspiration and magic had gone . It is followed by a sequel The bawdy adventures of Tom Jones an exploitive extension directed by Cliff Owen with Arthur Lowe  Joan Collins and Trevor Howard . Tom Jones picture was undoubtedly the biggest year . The film obtained Academy Awards in 1963 to best film for United Artists  Director Tony Richardson  adapted screenplay John Osborne and original music John Addison and was nominated  Albert Finney  Hugh Griffith  Diane Cilento  Joyce Redman and Edith Evans by their robustly agreeable characterization . Well worth watching.";

One of the great things about the movie is the comments to the audience by Tom. The technique is not new see The Road Movies but it is used to great comic effect. And the voiceover narrator enhances all the action. If you don't know the story Tom Jones is about a 'bastard' boy trying to make his way in the 1700's world of England. The story is delightful through with the requisite villains 'fallen' and lusty women sword fights and some amazing coincidences. Everything about the movie is delightful with great production values and an excellent cast. If you haven't seen this movie please do so. I don't see how you can not enjoy it from beginning to end.".

Fielding's novel  which is a most definite recommendation  rather cynically but goodhumouredly exposed mideighteenth century British hypocrisy at its best and the landed gentry's obsession for foxhunting at its worst. Richardson directed all this a bit like an elderly Sir Thomas Beecham 'the important thing is we all start and stop together nobody notices what happens in between' raising his baton in front of the London Symphony Orchestra the result in both cases is astounding. Richardson conducts his piece at a tremendous pace Addison's clavichord tripping along gaily so as to keep up the illusion and visual sequences such as a young trouserless Albert Finney escaping out of a window shinning down a tree and running off into the nocturnal depths of a beech forest all combine to keep you breathlessly awaiting the next scene. Susannah York is just delicious with that innocent facial beauty that raises heartbeats especially in the latter parts and Angela Baddely as Mrs. Wilkins and Diane Cilento as Molly play some great scenes. And some of the great scenes are worth telling...... Tom and Mrs. Wilkins enjoy a good roast with fruit eating lusciously and lascivously eating each other up with their sparkling eyes this scene is hugely delightful. The other great scene is the foxhunt this alone puts the whole film into a special category brilliant filmmaking almost comparable to the famous chariot race in Ben Hur........ I loved this film 37 years ago and recently had the luck to see it again having doubled my years I was just as enthralled and enraptured as the first time. A splendid piece of art.".

Each scene while keeping the plot going at a rapid pace was complete and a delight to watch all by itself. What I really loved about the deer hunt besides the beauty of the English countryside and the aerial shots was the whooping and yelling of the riders dogs barking and hooves pounding. It seemed much wilder and less elegant than the fancy fox hunts we've seen in more contemporary films. I was almost out of breath by the end.A movie like this I can watch over and over for the performances and the beauty of the direction even though I know the plot by heart. It's like listening to a favorite song by a great artist. I wish I could have been on the set to watch the fun in person. How do the people who make these wonderful types of movies walk away from them at the completion without feeling sad that they are over?".

And it needs to be followed by Barry Lyndon and Sex and Lucia.Kubrick's project took this same story from the other side the refined one. Its cinematography is lush and precise. But the project is one that contrasts nature rather than raw sex acts with foppish aristocracy rather than general city society. But the intent is the same to charm through images just in Kubrick's case the images are aristocratic.Medem's project is much more sophisticated switching the dial so that the sexrepress countrycity realisticstylized image contrast is between experienced truth and written truth.

	schema:headline " A Randy Film From A Ribald Book For A Bawdy Age";
	schema:reviewBody "A thorough adaption of Henry Fielding's novel would require a miniseries which the work later got for television. But John Osborne's adapted screenplay for which he won an Oscar captures the right spirit of the ribald and rollicking novel of the mid eighteenth century in Great Britain.It was one bawdy age the dissolute courts of the first two kings named George set the tone for British society at the time. The title character played by Albert Finney is a young man of questionable origins illegitimate no doubt who wants the love of young Susanah York but will settle in a pinch for any and all of the other women who can't seem to help throwing themselves at him.Finney as an infant makes his introduction into the world by being found on Squire Allworthy's bed planted there as it were with no clue to his origins. The Squire played by George Devine thinks that servants Joyce Redmon and Jack McGowran are the responsible parties and he banishes them both. But keeps the infant to raise in his household.Finney grows up to be a likable young lad who holds a great attraction for anyone of the female persuasion. Even the neighboring squire Hugh Griffith likes him but not as a suitable husband for his daughter Ms. York.The story in many ways sets the tone for the novels of Charles Dickens many of which concerned young men like Tom Jones David Copperfield Nicholas Nickleby Young Pip in Great Expectations who seek the meaning of their origins. But Fielding was writing for a public that had a lot less of a sense of decorum than Dickens's readers were. I doubt Charles Dickens could have gotten his work published if they had been as naughty as Fielding's.Director Tony Richardson really captures the look of 18th century Great Britain no doubt part of why he was named Best Director and Tom Jones awarded Best Picture of 1963. Albert Finney got an Oscar nomination but lost to Sidney Poitier for Lillies of the Field. Hugh Griffith was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor but he lost to Melvyn Douglas for Hud. It probably didn't help Griffith that he already had won one for BenHur. And Diane Cilento as the town tart Dame Edith Evans as Griffith's sister and Joyce Redmon were all nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Three British women lost to a fourth however as Margaret Rutherford trundled up the middle with her performance in The VIPs.Back in the day I remember seeing Hedda Hopper on Art Linkletter's House Party show and she was asked about her upcoming Oscar predictions. Hedda surprised me and everyone else by saying that she loved Tom Jones and said it was going to win everything it was nominated for. It didn't quite do that but it certainly was successful in getting those gold statues. That the conservative Hedda Hopper would champion a film like Tom Jones was the surprise. But I guess Hedda knew times were a changing.Now I suspect a lot more skin would be shown in a remake of this film. Yet Tom Jones will always have a lot of randy charm about the movie. It's one for the ages.".

I doubt Charles Dickens could have gotten his work published if they had been as naughty as Fielding's.Director Tony Richardson really captures the look of 18th century Great Britain no doubt part of why he was named Best Director and Tom Jones awarded Best Picture of 1963. Albert Finney got an Oscar nomination but lost to Sidney Poitier for Lillies of the Field. Hugh Griffith was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor but he lost to Melvyn Douglas for Hud. It probably didn't help Griffith that he already had won one for BenHur. And Diane Cilento as the town tart Dame Edith Evans as Griffith's sister and Joyce Redmon were all nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Three British women lost to a fourth however as Margaret Rutherford trundled up the middle with her performance in The VIPs.Back in the day I remember seeing Hedda Hopper on Art Linkletter's House Party show and she was asked about her upcoming Oscar predictions. Hedda surprised me and everyone else by saying that she loved Tom Jones and said it was going to win everything it was nominated for. It didn't quite do that but it certainly was successful in getting those gold statues. That the conservative Hedda Hopper would champion a film like Tom Jones was the surprise. But I guess Hedda knew times were a changing.Now I suspect a lot more skin would be shown in a remake of this film. Yet Tom Jones will always have a lot of randy charm about the movie. It's one for the ages.";

	schema:reviewBody "TOM JONES may not be the worst movie to take home the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture but it certainly is in the running for being the most ineptly directed. Tiresomely clumsy and terminally longwinded this socalled rollicking comedy barely merits a legitimate smile let alone any laughoutloud moments of glee. Under Tony Richardson's amateurish direction the film suffers from having little sense of comic timing a lack of the astute use of editing or camera placement or even the slightest hint that the famed director had ever been behind a camera before.It is easy to see what Richardson was going for he wanted to cut the historical epic as a genre down to size. The austere pretentious pompous Hollywoodstyle history lessons that were once a staple  and a symbol of what in Hollywood passed for class  were often humorless and selfaware of just how important they were. With actors giving solemn coldly pious performances the characters they played were placed on pedestals as being morally and intellectually superior to the commoners who served them  and who sat in the audience watching. TOM JONES' purpose  if indeed it has a purpose  is to show that the nobility was no better than the peasant class  other than maybe having lived in a slightly better quality of squalor.So be it  but by the same token big deal! The tendency of the movies to alternately worship and mock the rich and powerful has always been a given. There isn't much here that hadn't already been made fun of before and better in the period parodies made by Danny Kaye or Bob Hope. Or for that matter the Three Stooges. The best you can give TOM JONES credit for is being a forerunner of the snobandslob comedies of later generations move the story to contemporary Beverly Hills and cast some refugee from Saturday Night Live in the Jones part and you'll have a modern day CADDYSHACK. I mean is Hugh Griffith's overthetop vulgar nobleman really much different from the belowthebelt nouveau riche vulgarians that made up Rodney Dangerfield's film career? The simpleminded attack on the upper class is nothing new or different but that wouldn't matter if the film itself were well funny. It's story is the standard picaresque adventures of a young rogue's life among his social betters  jazzed up with all the cheap sexual innuendoes mistaken identities and misunderstandings that farce requires. For the most part the film seems to be a desperate attempt to blend the gritty realism of the various European new waves with the orchestrated anarchy of the Marx Bros.  while not succeeding at doing justice to either. It is like a rough cut made up of poorly chosen outtakes instead of a work of slick carefully crafted chaos it is comprised of one poorly staged scene after another a soundtrack of disconnected voices and a droning narration that always seems to be describing missing material. Impressed with Richardson's use of silent movie gimmicks title cards speeded up action iris fade outs etc. the film critics of the time lavished the film with praise for being new and fresh  by using tricks that even then were old and clich! The cast of distinguished British stage notables tend to mug for the camera as if they were in a Jerry Lewis movie. Even Albert Finney in the title role fails to give any real performance his character is jerked from scene to scene by circumstance rather than by dramatic motivation. Indeed lovingly photographed as though he were in a spread for a fashion magazine Finney has never looked so unrelentingly handsome and dashing  and yet been so vacuously lacking in personality. Amoral and callow there is little reason to care for Jones' fate other than the fact that he is so goshdarn pretty.Even granting that 1963 was a remarkably weak year for movies TOM JONES' winning of the Oscar among several other prestigious awards is a puzzlement. These things rarely go to comedies unless it is perceived that they somehow represent something groundbreaking like ANNIE HALL or AMERlCAN BEAUTY. Yet even if TOM JONES was seen as some sort of bold departure from the norm it didn't stop the Academy from soon going back to form and giving their top prize to such stiff shallow and selfimportant historical epics as A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS CHARIOTS OF FIRE GANDHI THE LAST EMPEROR THE ENGLlSH PATIENT BRAVEHEART and GLADIATOR  all of which carry at least some glimmer of hightone British superiority. So I suppose that even the thinnest patina of British class somehow in their eyes raised this lowbrow mess to the level of highbrow social commentary. Or worse art.".

	schema:reviewBody "I understand why this movie is called a classic. The camera work is dazzling and fresh sweeping away all the stodginess of a period picture. The cast is attractive cheerful and plainly having the time of their lives. The direction makes it easy to laugh along and get caught up in the sheer sexual charisma of Tom Jones' personality.But personally as an English major who really treasured the book I find that this movie is not all it's cracked up to be. It plays up all of Tom's worst qualities  his lustfulness the impulsive and almost infantile side of his personality  and plays down all of his loyalty courage and higher feelings. This movie was influential for the rest of the Sixties and in all the wrong ways.Tom was the first antihero in Sixties film a guy who is good looking and sexy but not especially brave or clever or even kind. Note again that this was NOT Fielding's intent. In the novel he says explicitly that Tom is as much a Hercules as an Adonis meaning that he is a real hero who fights for right not just a lover boy. But this movie plays Tom's fist fight scenes strictly for laughs as if to say courage and manhood are out and getting by on sheer charm is in. Not to carry it too far but you can draw a straight line from this vision of Tom Jones to the increasingly repulsive antiheroes who followed later in the decade. They range from the ultraviolent Alex in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE to the cowardly Indian warrior in LITTLE BIG MAN to the criminal Michael in THE GODFATHER.What's missing from the film  but not the book  is any sense that Tom really loves Sophia or that he learns from his adventures and becomes more worthy more manly at the end. The book takes the idea of choice and responsibility seriously the movie just laughs it off. Not surprisingly Tom's love affair with Lady Bellaston comes off differently as well. Casting the exquisite and sultry Joan Greenwood as Lady Bellaston was delightful but wrong. In the book she is a fat dumpy old hag who buys Tom and tries to corrupt him. In the movie she is a stunning older swinger who indulges him just for the fun of it. Sure it's sexy to watch  really sexy. But what does it prove? Nothing. Tom doesn't resist temptation he isn't punished and he doesn't grow. It's the infantile approach that was to become all to popular during the idealistic sixties.".

Diane Cilento was married to Sean Connery at this time. David Tomlinson is best know as George Banks in Mary Poppins. Jack MacGowran played the alcoholic director in The Exorcist.

Julian Glover later played Donovan in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and later played Grand Master Pycelle on Game of Thrones. And of course Lynn Redgrave was director Tony Richardson's sisterinlaw.As for Tony Richardson his best movie that I've seen was the posthumously released Blue Sky which won Jessica Lange a Best Actress Oscar. Richardson hadn't publicly acknowledged his bisexuality until he contracted AIDS which eventually killed him. Due to Orion Pictures's bankruptcy Blue Sky sat on the shelf for three years.In conclusion Tom Jones is a movie that will probably draw more than a few MST3Kstyle comments.

A big part of the reason this was given such prestigious honors was it dared push the envelope. Soon the Hollywood would be free to give us about all the profanity nudity and sex people would want.

How many times have we seen this bias?Finney was so young looking I didn't recognize him when I watched this film in the 90s about 30 years after seeing it in the theater when it came out.

The Ukrainian countryside has never looked so breath taking.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer Everything Is Illuminated is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the screenplay. In the movie Jonathan Elijah Wood obsessively collects items from his family from toothbrushes to retainers to scraps of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to a wall in his house to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is conspicuously bare. All Jonathan really has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during the Second World War. Jonathan decides to undertake a quest to Ukraine to find the woman thank her and learn more about his grandfather.His quest is aided there by a couple of characters who run a tourist company for Jewish people including a young man obsessed with western culture Eugene Hutz his grandfather Boris Leskin who thinks he is blind and who may have memories and demons of his own from the war and his grandfather's temperamental seeing eye dog.The screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for Jonathan's grandfather's town driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz playing Alex Jr. who starts the movie as a tracksuitwearing break dancing slacker just out to have fun but evolves into something more as not only Jonathan but all the characters gain their own illumination.Liev Schreiber Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz attended the screening and did a very humorous QA after the film Schreiber was very close to his grandfather who was a Ukranian immigrant and who died in 1993. This caused him to start to write to get his memories down on paper. Meanwhile he was asked to do a reading of Foer's short story The Very Rigid Search which was an excerpt from the still unpublished novel. Schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing saying that Foer had done in 15 pages what Schreiber tried to do in 107. Schreiber approached Foer and they talked about their grandfathers culture movies and the nature of shortterm memory in America in the end Foer agreed to let Schreiber adapt the book.Schreiber's own project was intended to be a road movie but the book has parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological history of the town of Trochenbrod that spans 500 years given his budget and limitations as a filmmaker he said he'd leave that to Milos Forman and take the road trip instead. This imagined chronology was what moved him to make the movie in the first place the idea that a past lovingly imagined was as valuable as a past accurately recalled.Schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents. After searching unsuccessfully in Ukraine for an actor he was walking through the Lower East Side in New York when he saw a poster of a woman centaur topless from the waist up with an insane cossack sitting astride her. Under the poster said the name Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band.Eugene Hutz then took over the story. He had never pursued acting as music was his first passion. One day a friend gave him the book and he thought it was written in a manner similar to how he writes music screw sentencessyntax language is my own.Later they got a call from a production company looking for eastern European music that was medieval but modern. Hutz met with Schreiber and he soon found the movie was based on the book he just happened to be reading. Not long after that came up Schreiber asked Hutz what he thought about Alex and whether he could do the character by any chance.Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001 shortly after the events of September 11. Both were in Europe at the time and they talked about the derogatory comments they were hearing about Americans which led Schreiber to want to try to find an articulate American who would defy the stereotype that Europeans have of Americans. Someone who was awkward vulnerable flawed innocent and looking for history beyond the borders of his own country. Schreiber started thinking about who that was and Elijah came up.One of Schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica I think that's who he said who also directed a segment in another festival movie All the Invisible Children who said you don't look for the actors you look for the people. Schreiber said there is something about who Elijah is that he has a generosity of spirit and a sincere goodness as a human being that came across on film. Schreiber said that the eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer and that if eyes are the doors to the soul Elijah's are garage doors. Elijah Wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this movie as both are sort of a blank slate on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may seem still and seemingly emotionless but it is all about his observations about his experiences with other characters and the environment he was in.On the differences between directing and writing Schreiber said he likes writing a lot more and jokingly described directing as hell. After his grandfather died Schreiber started to think about how to preserve some sense of history and himself is he content driven or not or just good at interpreting other people's work? He said he loved the exercise of figuring out what is emotional to you important to you.".

When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask Check. We usually get a mishmash of genres Check. But what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible intelligent and moving.Elijah Wood plays Jonathan an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. He is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. The sepia picture bears his grandfather an uncanny resemblance to him and the woman. To aid his journey he enlists the help of travel guides that comprise of a HipHop loving breakdancer Alex Eugene Hutz his apathetic and permavexed grandfather Boris Leskin and his dog Sammy Davis Junior Jr! What ensues is essentially a comedy. There is an unpatronisingly simple introduction with voiceovers. Alex's is especially funny as he educates his younger brother on the year 1969 proving how popular he is with the chicks and breakdancing thus setting him up as Jonathan's antithesis.Schreiber begins to break down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves. All three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity something Schreiber was unlikely to get wrong and as enchanting and fantastical as the film is the horrors that are allowed to crack through i.e. the past are presented in an almost palatable tone incidental music cinematography which make them all the more unsettling.As the unlikely group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a lot about who they really are.Elijah wood is as authentic as usual bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen. Formally a resident good in Lord of the Rings and a resident evil in Sin City he plays Jonathan with aplomb as he is bombarded with culture shocks and a quest for truth. Boris Leskin as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the youths with great humour and conviction as his own past is unravelled. However it is Eugene Hutz as Alex that makes the show. The director using that old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not gimmicky.Schreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. The continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale haze around a story about identity truth and family. If there was a complaint it would be the speed at which the film changes direction though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all. Nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of World War 2 in a completely fresh fashion.ChiOjo".

	schema:reviewBody "Actor turned director Liev Schreiber The Sum of All Fears does an above average screen version of the novel Everything Is Illuminated by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.Jonathan Foer Elijah Wood is a young man who has seen his grandfather Safran pass away. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. Thus Jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the Ukraine not knowing if she is still alive. He enlists the help of a brash young tour guide named Alex Eugene Hutz and his grandfather Boris Leskin to drive him to his goal. At first the trip hits dead ends and false leads but as the group nears its target the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town. There they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn.This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors. At times the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film. The title itself is a play on self discovery. This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past and his past ironically involves his companions Jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well. It's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime. By the end of the film these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives. It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul. It's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past. Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told.The story is deceptively simple. It functions as a road trip movie like The Straight Story combined with an interesting mystery story. It really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present. The ending is a bit surreal with its dj vu feeling.Elijah Wood Sin City The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Here he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin fare better as Alex and his grandfather respectively. Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. that's right is funny as a fiercely loyal companion.The spare music score by Paul Cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. The editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique Gothika Requiem for a Dream is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath.The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental. We never fully understand the whole background story of Alex's grandfather and what his motivations are. Likewise Jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man. At times the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed. But these are minor criticisms of what is a good introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure. That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.".

	schema:headline " A Sentimental Road Trip ThroughThe Impact of Eastern European History";
	schema:reviewBody "Everything is Illuminated is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel. This version is more about changes in Eastern Europe from World War II through postCold War and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory. Debut directoradapter Liev Schreiber retains some of the humor and language clashes of the novel mostly through the marvelous Eugene Hutz as the U.S.beguiled Ukrainian tour guide. He is so eyecatching that the film becomes more his odyssey into his country and his family as he goes from his comfortable milieu in sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical isolated land that has been ravaged by conquerors through the Communists and now capitalists with both Jews and nonJews as detritus. As funny as his opening scenes are when he establishes his cheeky bravura we later feel his fishoutofwaterness in his own country when he tries to ask directions of local yokels. Shreiber uses Elijah Wood as the American tourist as an up tight cog in a visual panoply as his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators in the book. He and Hutz play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plot. Once the grandfather's story takes over in the last quarter of the film marvelously and unpredictably enacted by Boris Leskin the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis as they just tidy up the closure.Schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human urge to document history. One of his consultants in the credits is Professor Yaffa Eliach and her style of remembering preHolocaust shtetl life through artifacts clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effective.The Czech Republic stands in for the Ukraine and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in the cities towns and countryside as this is now primarily a road movie and the long driving scenes do drag a bit. Schreiber retains some of the symbolism from the book particularly of the moon and river but having cut out the portions of the book that explain those they just look pretty or ominous for atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate. As W.C. Fields would have predicted the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughs. In general Schreiber does go for more poignancy than the book. It is irresistibly touching especially for those who haven't read the book but less morally and emotionally messy.The film is enormously uplifted by its marvelous soundtrack which ranges from songs and instrumentals from Hutz's gypsy band to traditional tunes to contemporary tracks to Paul Cantelon's klezmer fusion score. This is not a Holocaust film per se being a kind of mirror image of The Train of Life Train de vie as about memory of a time that is freighted with meaning now but will resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to that history.".

	schema:reviewBody "If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber just a look at his new film Everything is Illuminated which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America's finest actors but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.For those who haven't watched the film perhaps you should stop reading here.Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandparents is boundless. He watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed. On a clear moment this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection. Watching the photograph taken a long time ago a young couple are seen together. Watching makes Jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend taken on happier times. Watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his ancestors' past in the Ukraine.Jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency Heritage Tours of Odessa for his trip to Trochenbrod the mythical place where his grandfather came from. The agency is handled by an older man who claims to be blind and his grandson Alex a man who loves the pop American culture that has captured his imagination as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks a kind of English no one speaks and his conversation and translation for Jonathan's benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes unheard English terms. The old man insists in taking his dog Sammy Davis Jr. against the wishes of Jonathan who doesn't want to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip.As they embark in search of Trochenbrod it's clearly that his companions especially the old man has no clue where he is going. At this point the film becomes a road movie as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more acquainted with one another. As the trio arrive at the sunflower field with the house at the end it indicates they have indeed come to the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past.The older woman living in the isolated place is the missing link of the story. She is able to put things into the right perspective. But here is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors to the old man. We watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself. This in turn changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected Jonathan and his guides have been all the time.Some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story which after all it's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken. It would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book. The great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what's about to be seen.Elijah Wood a magnificent film actor does an excellent work by underplaying Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character. The felicitous casting of Eugene Hutz as Alex the Ukranian tour assistant and translator seems to be an idea made in heaven. Mr. Hutz is about the best thing in the film. His arcane usage of English gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film as well as Laryssa Lauret who is seen in the last part of the movie.The excellent cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the Czech Republic's countryside in all its magnificence. The musical score by Paul Cantelon is heard in the background adorning the film in ways that it adds a richness to the movie.Above all this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next.".

Playing a football hooligan a psychopath and now a young Jewish American Wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. Now with Everything Is Illuminated he might finally have achieved this. Playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts he truly gets to the soul of his character. Still it isn't like Wood does this alone. Aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer Liev Schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer Eugene Hutz Wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. Everything is Illuminated is a magnificent moving piece of cinema.Jonathan Safran Foer Wood a young American Jew sets out to the Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to America. Arriving in the country Jonathan meets the all talking all dancing Alex Hutz and his racist grandfather Boris Leskin. Travelling across the country the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that Alex and Jonathan never knew existed.It's a strange feeling when the film progresses into it's second chapter it is actually divided into four overall. The first part whilst occasionally a bit funny is mostly serious and intense. So when we are given a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step. It doesn't quite work but as the film progresses it definitely learns it's lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passes.To the ultimate credit of everyone involved as the story does continue so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more. Elijah Wood is magnificent Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why Hollywood has never properly noticed him. Most notable of all however is newcomer Eugene Hutz. Playing an intensely troubled character Hutz is absolutely brilliant. He shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill and when his character is communicating with Wood you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level. Without Hutz the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent but with him it hits the next level.As a debut work for actor turned director Liev Schreiber the story is also a brilliant piece to start. A work of passion Schreiber's grandfather himself an immigrant to America he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots he manages to really hit home. The final half hour in particular is so beautifully created that it's a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye. It is a moving story and with Schreiber's help it becomes even more powerful.Constructed with love from a passionate director Everything is Illuminated is a beautiful piece. A road story with a difference it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written. It's a film that everyone should see and it is the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally lay Frodo to rest.".

	schema:headline " Illumination is Humorous Sad  Deeply Moving";
	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this movie ... but the ads I saw implied and one published review actually said that this movie benefits from a light touch. That to me is very misleading.There is indeed plenty of humor eccentric unsubtle sometimes somewhat twisted humor the kind of humor I generally find very appealing indeed. But most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious deeply sensitive even deeply painful. The movie weaves together themes of Past and Present Perception and Truth Memory and Activity Life and Death. The entire movie is suffused by the history of European antiSemiticism in general and of the Holocaust in particular.How can Humor and Horror be combined in the same movie? The review I saw suggested that the humor is Absurdist. I don't think this is the case at all at least not in the common sense. Instead I think this movie stands in the tradition of much Jewish  Yiddish literature and theatre. I don't claim to be any kind of expert in this area but from what I've seen Humor is used in this cultural context both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people and also Humor is used as a means of recovering the Divine for men and women who choose a path of Faith rather than a path of either Despair or Absurdism. See Fiddler on the Roof for Humor used in both ways in this rich tradition.Elijah Wood Jonathon Wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look well strange compare Sin City when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect. In this movie it's easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his Search and for his Struggle between Perception and Truth. Eugene Hutz Young Alex and Boris Lesking Old Alex are both really just wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex are from the same generation yet seem so very very different and then find that they are not so different after all. And the way in which the Apparent Narrative Voice changes gradually from that of Jonathon to that of Young Alex .. as a journey of intended discovery for Jonathon becomes one of discovery for both Young Alex and Old Alex ... is to me so very moving.There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from I'm told Prague and environs standing in for the Ukraine of the story line. All feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place although I've never been myself to the Ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experience.All in all if you're looking for light comedy I would not recommend this movie at all. On the other hand if you are interested in a wonderful delightful and deeply moving film please check out this wonderful movie.".

Jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure he sticks out like a sore thumb in the Ukraine he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere. But what he discovers is more much more than he anticipated. This movie will make you laugh and will make you cry. Elijah Wood is really good in this film based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer.From someone I talked to this movie is somewhat different from the book. A book I gather is really good.

The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous  it totally makes me want to visit the Ukraine. I think one of my favourite lines and I don't think this will give away any of the plot was when Jonathan asked what had happened to the bombed out buildings and Alex answers Soviets...independence.

I found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing but a little cloudy on what had happened. After seeing it again a few weeks later things began to fall into place. It wasn't confusing just deep. In fact the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time. For example it occurred to me only after my third viewing that Sammy Davis Jr Jr Grandfather's dog is more than just a pet  perhaps she's the standin for his dead wife. Witness how fiercely he protects her. There is symbolism galore and none of it sappy or indulgent just real. The adventure of their trip keeps the storyline in perpetual motion and even when they arrive you're not sure if it really was the destination. As the movie continues so does the adventure and I got the sense the destination was merely a waypoint. The soundtrack is fun the scenery compelling  and both decidedly easternblock. I could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film but I'm not entirely sure I've discovered all the nuances yet. Besides it's more fun to tease these out yourself. As much as any film can be Everything Is Illuminated has proved to be like a fine wine that sweetens with time. I highly recommend seeing it  twice.".

	schema:headline " Shedding light on the indie side of the Holocaust";
	schema:reviewBody "Everything Is Illuminated is sort of the independent filmmakers preferred story line for doing a film about the Holocaust. Instead of historical fiction it is a contemporary journey generations later in effort to shed more light on the true historical significance of the Holocaust the stuff that can't be found in history books. In addition it is an offbeat comedy about a clash of cultures and a story of personal reflection and understanding.Based on the book of the same title Illuminated stars Elijah Wood as Jonathan Foer a young Jewish American adult who is very quiet but is an avid collector of things that are valuable or hold memories. In hopes of learning more about his grandfather's past a Holocaust survivor from a Jewish shtetl in Ukraine Jonathan travels there and enlists the help of a guide service which includes a young Ukranian man named Alex who speaks amusing English Eugene Hutz and his crazy grandfather. The film also marks the directorial debut of Liev Schreiber whose wide shots elongated moments of silence and written text scene transitions fall easily in line with that indie vibe. Most noticeable of all however is the music. Interestingly enough supporting actor Eugene Hutz is the frontman of the band Gogol Bordello which fuses that Eastern European folk sound with modern song structure and rhythms. I don't know if the soundtrack features Gogol Bordello music specifically but it features that style and a lot of it. Music is very intentionally integrated at moments and not merely used as transitional fluffthe sign of a definite independent film. The style seems to represent the coming together of cultures and is very catchy and unique adding to the easygoing humorous beginning of the film.Yes the beginning is much funnier than I thought it would be though this of course changes as the journey becomes more difficult for the unlikely trio and eventually as Jonathan finds more of what he is seeking. With the exception of a few moments this is not a Holocaust focused film that will disturb you. It is more about the historical significance from a much smaller perspective of a person to generations past without which he would not exist. The film cherishes all that is sentimental focusing on objects and artifacts especially seeing as Jonathan is a collector and understanding the ways the past can influence the present in the most basic of ways. Anyone can relate to Jonathan's journey and that's the best part of this story. Maybe not to the character himself who we really don't know all that much about given his timid nature but definitely to memories and wanting to understand where we came from. We all have attachments to sentimental objects which is why objects have such a powerful significance in society and literaturefilm. Schreiber gets how important that is to the film and really nails it. Illuminated is a mustsee for anyone whose Holocaust education is limited to textbooks and other movies for those that haven't really heard the stories of the people who lived it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Safran Foer's widely read novel 'Everything is Illuminated' was a zany concoction of story standup comedy and fantasy that worked well as a diversion because of Foer's very apparent rough style of writing everything is forgiven if the words play with the imagination. But as a film the book seemed a formidable undertaking. Liev Schreiber a consummate actor adapted Foer's book for the screen performing major surgery on the tale and then directed his version with great skill. The result is a film that always entertains but that also crosses lines between reality and fantasy writer's intentions vs screenwriter's needs and story manipulation that may please some and frustrate those who loved the book.Jonathan Safran Foer Elijah Wood is a collector of familial trinkets who sets out to the Ukraine to discover teasers of how his Jewish grandfather escaped annihilation in the Ukraine at the kindness of one Augustine Tereza Veselkova. Once in the Ukraine he hires a tour guide Alex Eugene Hutz who with his 'blind' grandfather Boris Leskin as driver and their bizarre dog Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. to take him to Trachimbrod the site where Foer's grandfather knew Augustine. It seems there is no such place and the journey to wherever begins. Alex mangles his English with malapropisms and strange word substitutions making his job as translator for Foer the high point of the road trip as it made the original book the reason to read!. The many entanglements the strange little group encounter in their drive results in finding the secrets Foer is seeking and he is able to return home satisfied with his journey.All this makes for an acceptable road trip comedy until Schreiber excises the bulk of the novel  the bits of history that make the eventual discovery of the truths Foer seeks more meaningful. And while the novel never lets the comedy slip off line the screenplay switches gears and makes the story another tender yet sad holocaust tale. But despite the completed film's ending the DVD shows the plentiful scenes not included in the film scenes that are as over the top and barking for laughter as Foer's crazy novel. We should only be grateful that Schreiber has the sense to delete these costly production numbers as they are indeed silly! Eugene Hutz born in 1972 Yevhen Hudz in Kiev Ukraine is the true find of the film. His 'acting experience' is solely as the 'front man for Gogol Bordello a gypsy punk band fusing supercharged folk influences with a sideshow cabaret'. But he manages the wildly maniacal yet strangely intuitive character and lines of Alex with great finesse. He is a treasure! The rest of the cast is strong and the splendid musical score by Paul Cantelon and the cinematography by Matthew Libatique add immeasurably to the film.Though many may disagree with Schrieber's manipulation of the book few will be able to miss the fact that for a first outing as writerdirector EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED is a fine start. Three stars for the film in general but a fourth star for the performances by Hutz and Leskin. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Holocaust Minstrel Show But Hutz is Great";
	schema:reviewBody "Everything is Illuminated is an embarrassingly bad stinker on almost every count with two exceptions Eugene Hutz is weirdly wildly charismatic as Alex a goofy young Ukrainian who imagines himself a hiphop star. And Everything Is Illuminated's score is excellent consisting as it does of authentic Eastern European folk music.The first half of Everything Is Illuminated consists of grated versions of Borat jokes. Ukrainians are funny because they try to be cool like Americans. Ukrainians are laughable because they speak English in a simpleminded pidgin calling African Americans Negroes for example and saying repose for sleep. Ukrainians are funny because of their sex lives. Ukrainians are also dirty irrationally and by nature violent they hate Jews they wear unattractive clothing the men are ready to beat up any newcomer to their town nave enough to ask for driving directions the women are either cowed housewives married to husbands and fathers who lead with their fists or slatternly sullen obese waitresses goatherding Ukrainian children engage in mindless vandalism like flattening car tires. These folks are so debased that even their dogs are ugly stupid and vicious. Yup there's even a creepy household pet. Of course these comically stupid ugly crude yokels are responsible for the Holocaust. At one point Elijah Wood as Jonathan Safran Foer insists that the Ukraine was as bad as Nazi Germany.This nasty stereotype is not the invention of Liev Schreiber the director and script writer. Schreiber and Safran Foer the author of the book on which the film is based are merely exploiting not inventing hateful ethnic stereotypes. The image of the brutal Eastern European peasant has been around for centuries. Americans are most familiar with this stereotype from Polak jokes and the film Borat. Eugene Hutz is genuinely funny in his thankless Eastern European AmosandAndystyle role. He acts the Ukrainian dunce with as much grace and dignity as possible and is the only thing worth watching in the film. Some scenes are laugh out loud funny especially when Wood lectures Hutz on the use of the term African American. But Amos and Andy was funny too.After about an hour of Bohunk jokes Everything Is Illuminated abruptly turns off the comedy tap and turns into a turgid static Holocaust film. What little action there was in the film provided by Hutz's kinetic mugging shuffling and jiving or by Ukrainians punching other Ukrainians stops. Characters stand still and offer speeches about horrible things that happened in the past. Jonathan and Alex arrive at the one pleasant house with the one dignified resident in all of Ukraine. The colorful cottage is out of a Disney fairy tale. Clean laundry snaps on the line. Orderly rows of sunflowers surround the home. The peasant woman living in the cottage is gracious and lovely. Aha. She's not really Ukrainian. She's Jewish.On the other hand Elijah Wood as Jonathan Safran Foer a modern American Jew comes off no better than the stereotyped Ukrainians. He too is a stereotype the uptight obsessional neurotic socially backward weak frightened passive Jew. Wood as Jonathan is so stiff he could be playing a corpse. A writer and director should have a very sound aesthetic reason for making the Jewish character in a film about the Holocaust a passive Jew. Scheiber has no good reason.

Given that there is a very selfdestructive death of another Jewish character in the movie Wood's passivity is even more troubling.The Holocaust is never honored by Everything Is Illuminated. In the unlikely event that this is the only Holocaust film the viewer ever sees that viewer would have no idea what the Holocaust was. As slow pretentious and ponderous as this film is it never for one moment manages to convey the monumental horror and heartbreak of the Holocaust.Again I'd love to see Eugene Hutz in just about any new film meanwhile I've been watching youtube videos of his band Gogol Bordello.

	onyx:emotionText "Everything is Illuminated is an embarrassingly bad stinker on almost every count with two exceptions Eugene Hutz is weirdly wildly charismatic as Alex a goofy young Ukrainian who imagines himself a hiphop star. And Everything Is Illuminated's score is excellent consisting as it does of authentic Eastern European folk music.The first half of Everything Is Illuminated consists of grated versions of Borat jokes. Ukrainians are funny because they try to be cool like Americans. Ukrainians are laughable because they speak English in a simpleminded pidgin calling African Americans Negroes for example and saying repose for sleep. Ukrainians are funny because of their sex lives. Ukrainians are also dirty irrationally and by nature violent they hate Jews they wear unattractive clothing the men are ready to beat up any newcomer to their town nave enough to ask for driving directions the women are either cowed housewives married to husbands and fathers who lead with their fists or slatternly sullen obese waitresses goatherding Ukrainian children engage in mindless vandalism like flattening car tires. These folks are so debased that even their dogs are ugly stupid and vicious. Yup there's even a creepy household pet. Of course these comically stupid ugly crude yokels are responsible for the Holocaust. At one point Elijah Wood as Jonathan Safran Foer insists that the Ukraine was as bad as Nazi Germany.This nasty stereotype is not the invention of Liev Schreiber the director and script writer. Schreiber and Safran Foer the author of the book on which the film is based are merely exploiting not inventing hateful ethnic stereotypes. The image of the brutal Eastern European peasant has been around for centuries. Americans are most familiar with this stereotype from Polak jokes and the film Borat. Eugene Hutz is genuinely funny in his thankless Eastern European AmosandAndystyle role. He acts the Ukrainian dunce with as much grace and dignity as possible and is the only thing worth watching in the film. Some scenes are laugh out loud funny especially when Wood lectures Hutz on the use of the term African American. But Amos and Andy was funny too.After about an hour of Bohunk jokes Everything Is Illuminated abruptly turns off the comedy tap and turns into a turgid static Holocaust film. What little action there was in the film provided by Hutz's kinetic mugging shuffling and jiving or by Ukrainians punching other Ukrainians stops. Characters stand still and offer speeches about horrible things that happened in the past. Jonathan and Alex arrive at the one pleasant house with the one dignified resident in all of Ukraine. The colorful cottage is out of a Disney fairy tale. Clean laundry snaps on the line. Orderly rows of sunflowers surround the home. The peasant woman living in the cottage is gracious and lovely. Aha. She's not really Ukrainian. She's Jewish.On the other hand Elijah Wood as Jonathan Safran Foer a modern American Jew comes off no better than the stereotyped Ukrainians. He too is a stereotype the uptight obsessional neurotic socially backward weak frightened passive Jew. Wood as Jonathan is so stiff he could be playing a corpse.

Jonfen or Jonathen is a bit tougher to like. He is a typical American tourist unwilling at first to put his Americana aside in order to live the life he has gone to seek. He eventually turns when he discovers what he seeks more or less in the form of shoe boxes filled with decades of memories. I am not sure whether I can say that story is about any of the characters or a character study of the 4 main characters plus Sammy. The 4th character a kindly grandmotherly woman who has been an isolate since WWII who holds the key to more doors that can be explained now. In essence it is a film worth watching without doubt with someone you love and tissues. At least it was this way for me. Elijah Wood is as usual chameleon like changing not only his persona but his physical look as well. The Ukrainian actorsinger who plays Alex is absolutely charming. The grandfather endearing. All so well played in a film that you watch without knowing what it is really about until the end. Which is good. Watch it.".

Reason number 1 the most important reason is of course how on earth did they manage to get anyone to play Oskar? The director has shown us a stroke of geniosity by casting a 12year old boy as Oskar who besides is a brilliant actor I wonder whatever became of him. Reason number two how could anyone ever visualize the grotesque and chaotic scenes in the book? Once again the director comes up with something brilliant he makes the scenes as graphic as possible he doesn't care about the MPAA he doesn't care about moviewatchers with heart problems and he's not afraid of overdoing anything. He puts as much force and effort in the scenes as possible and they come out brilliantly. Reason number 3  How does he capture the moods of the multilayered book? He simply stays very faithful to the books text and uses camera angles lighting effects and music perfectly to accompany the visions of Gnther Grass. Those are the most apparent reasons and because of those the film is brilliant. The only flaw is leaving the story unfinished although the ones who never read the book won't notice that. Altogether an interesting stylish and rewarding film experience.".

This tendency was best illustrated by the trend called expressionism an art movement of the nineteen twenties that applied to painting Dix Grosz cinema Fritz Lang Murnau and theatre Bertold Brecht's Threepenny opera. The movement was dismissed by the Nazis as degenerate art and abruptly ended with Hitler's rise to power. As a movie The Tin Drum is a unique modern tribute to expressionism.Before it was adapted for screen The Tin Drum was already a classic of German modern novel. The author Gunther Grass was born in Danzig now Gdansk Poland's major port on the Baltic Sea where the Solidarnosc movement actually appeared the very year the movie was released. During the interwar period Danzig was officially a free city but was claimed both by Germany and Poland and it was the German invasion of Danzig that was the official cause for the outbreak of World War II. So no wonder the hero of The Tin Drum little Oscar is born to a German mother and two different fathers a Pole the natural one and a German the adoptive one.When little Oscar is born his mother predicts that when he turns three he will be given a tin drum. Prediction comes true as little Oscar turns out to be a very naughty sort of Peter Pan. Disgusted by the world of adults around him he attempts suicide at age three by jumping from the top of the cellar staircase. He survives but his growth is stopped. The eerie gnome and his fellow drum become inseparable and if one ever tries little Oscar has a lethal weapon  he can shout so shrill that his voice breaks any glass around. So don't mess with little Oscar who keeps drumming and drumming for any reason and remains a sarcastic and outcast witness of his time  the rise and fall of Nazism.The Third Reich is depicted here as background for Oscar's adventures. Since he can't attend school because he will never give up his drum he makes a career in a troop of circus midgets where his glassbreaking talents can bloom. Most of the time Nazism is mocked here as a ridiculous farce with a humor  la Lubitsch. At heart though The Tin Drum is far from being just a satire as tragedy is often underlying under the dark humor. After little Oscar has lost his two fathers at age twenty one he decides to bury his fetish toy in a pit and embarks on a westbound refugee train as Germans are massively evicted of their former eastern territories.This movie has an unusual amount of excellent scenes but I'd rather not mention them because there are just too many and the surprise effect makes them all the more grasping. Needless to say that several of them deal with Oscar's glassbreaking exploits which soon develop on a massive scale. Many of them are also voluntarily disgusting but I guess it's the name of the game here. Should you eat before or after seeing this? In case you don't eat before you might not feel very hungry afterwards and if you do... well if you're faint of stomach better you avoid this movie anyway.If you get a chance and you don't mind subtitles the original version seems like a good option. Little David Bennent's mischievous and cringing voice is an excellent performance and gets enhanced by the rasping sound of the German language. The movie is almost two and a half hours long and if it's no wonder that many will find it absurd or offending it is neither slow or boringA well deserved Palme d'Or in Cannes for 1979.".

To stop growing then and there and remain a threeyearold a gnome once and for allGoodness what a marvel this film is! It is certainly the greatest film from Germany that I have seen yet. Winner of the 1979 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film The Tin Drum follows the life of a boy named Oskar. After seeing how ludicrous adults act Oskar decides to stop his growth and stay three years old forever by falling down the stairs. He succeeds and the fall has stopped his growth. Aside from the hault of growth the fall eqips him with two special powers that he regularly manifests. The lesser of these two powers is repeatedly pounding his tin drum which he absolutely refuses to let go of. Oskar's undeniable power is to let out a high pitched shriek that will shatter any glass he directs it at. Does it sound strange? Well the film is much stranger but also much more beautiful than my description.The film follows our little Oscar over a period of around two decades through World War II in Germany. We follow Oskar through his many sexual emotional tragic funny and beautiful exploits. An absolutely important credit must be given to actor David Bennett who plays young Oskar. He portrays Oskar as an infant as a three yearold as a six yearold as a twelve yearold as a 16 yearold as a 21 yearold...well you get the picture. Bennett was only 11 at the time and his performance is very impressive.I haven't seen very many German films from the last thirty years but most of the ones I have seen the excellent Vanishing and the immensely mediocre White Rose haven't had very good scores. The Tin Drum has a very slight but very servicable score by the famous Maurice Jarre. The score has an emotional theme played in only a few scenes notably the ending it also has an innocent little music box theme and surprisingly a cool waltz for scenes involving members of the circus a big part of the secondhalf of the film. A very good score. To my knowledge it was released on LP when the film was released and on a CD pressed in Japan sometime in the 90's. I read that the sadly out of print Kino DVD includes the isolated score as an extra.It's an excellent film that I strongly connected with but I can see many people not liking it it is VERY strange but I am somebody who has always found VERY strange things extremely beautiful and The Tin Drum is no exception. Overall I consider this film a classic and I'll once again state that it is certainly the greatest film from Germany that I have seen yet.".

The cinematography is appropriately dreary and the editing crisp and unadorned. The centerpiece though is the performance by the child actor at the core of the film. How much is owed to his voiceover narrative I don't know but the man growing inside of the stillgrown little boy was handled just beautifully.It's a disturbing and strangely uplifting movie at once. I recommend it  especially for those who have seen only black and white view of World War II and the typically American view of our adversaries in German.".

How much is owed to his voiceover narrative I don't know but the man growing inside of the stillgrown little boy was handled just beautifully.It's a disturbing and strangely uplifting movie at once. I recommend it  especially for those who have seen only black and white view of World War II and the typically American view of our adversaries in German.";

	schema:reviewBody "That day thinking about the grownup world and my own future I decided to call a halt. To stop growing then and there and remain a threeyearold a gnome once and for all  Oskar MetzertathThe Tin Drum is based on Gunter Grass's highly acclaimed novel which used magic realism to capture the madness of war and the folly of the people who made it possible. This movie only tackles the first two sections of the novel leaving out the postwar events. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign film in 1980 and the Palm d'Or at Cannes. It was also banned in Oklahoma as child pornography. Despite moments of brilliance The Tin Drum left me feeling incomplete and curiously unmoved.It is a very different kind of film from the others I saw this week using satire and surrealism to explore people's reactions during the period from 1939 to 1945. It seems to be saying that it is all right to stop growing that is participating in the world as a protest against the cynicism and corruption of the adult world. The setting for the majority of the film Danzig now Gdansk is a major northern port town in Poland. Danzig was a free and independent city until September 1 1939 when it became the first region taken by Germany at the outset of WWII. After the war Danzig became a part of Poland again. The Tin Drum is the story of Oskar Matzerath a boy who grows up in Eastern Germany before and during World War II. Oskar decides the only way to protest being part of the adult world is by banging on his drum and remaining a child forever. This is his rebuttal of society and his tin drum is his protest against the mentality of his family and neighborhood or perhaps against all passive people in Nazi Germany at that time. Oskar tries to shock the world out of its inhumanity. His life reflects Germany's struggle to free itself from its own dream of Teutonic superiority and find peace in the national soul.David Bennent as Oskar gives an outstanding performance creating a character that is both haunting and frightening. He looks like a little man in a child's body but his eyes are deep and have a very knowing look that seemed to be looking right through me. Oskar is not a cute little updated version of Peter Pan. Since age three when he was given his first tin drum Oskar can scream with such a high pitch that he can shatter any piece of glass. He even controls his scream to the point where he can break windows on the other side of the city or etch writing into glass. Oskar uses his ability to manipulate and control the adult world often using vicious and cynical snide comments about the insanity around him. At one point he disrupts a Nazi rally by changing the beat of his tin drum to the Blue Danube which the band then follows. The ensuing scene where the crowd breaks into a dance and the rain comes down leaving the Nazi soldiers bewildered is one of the best in the film.I found the scenes where Oskar joins a midget troupe and finds loving companions of his own kind to be very tender and moving. However the film became morally ambiguous for me when Oskar and his troupe decide to entertain the Nazi soldiers at the front lines. Schlondorff never really makes it clear what his motivations are and Oskar's actions seems to contradict his essentially anarchist protest for most of the film. The Tin Drum also contains some objectionable scenes of childhood sexuality and grotesque depictions of slithering eels being caught using a severed horse head as bait. The result needless to say is stomach churning.I found The Tin Drum to be absorbing and thought provoking yet despite moments of brilliance for me it did not add up to a totally satisfying experience.".

A town with billowing smoke and towering spiral steeples. A Grimm's Faerie Tale. The film plays out like a fantasy. To never grow up. The Tin Drum contains some of the most fantastic images found in a feature film The shattering of the jar with the fetus The cracking of the teachers glasses  The eels oozing out of the horses head as the seagulls scream and Oskar bangs his drum. It was an incredible scene to read on the pages of Gunter Grass' novel but to see a filmmaker capture the words and turned it into a real life experience was aweinspiring. Directed so well. It is an erotic film. Intense scenes of desire. Primal. It captures the dark side of us all. The scenes where Oskar and his first adolescent love exchange spit and fizz are very perverse and effective.Oskar does grow up as a man but remains the size of a 3 year old. He bangs his Tin Drum to drown out the craziness around him. World war II must have been horribly felt by those so close. The Nazi regime seemed so frightening. As a three year old who was conscious in the womb how would Oskar see this direction that man who once was three years old has taken. What is wrong with us?Overall it is about the next generation wanting the previous one to get over itself and enjoy this paradise called Earth. The film is mesmerizing. It is a beautiful piece of celluloid art. The magical realism is captured very effectively. How about doing One Hundred Years of Solitude? Here's your director.

The tin drum Oscar always drums on is a symbol of his protest against the cruelty that grown ups create not to mention the rise of Nazism.

I think Die Blechtrommel is one of the finest examples of this.It is often quite absurd this film one of the most memorable scenes is when Oscar watches a Nazi rally. As an officer is marching through the crowd the orchestra is playing a march. Oscar starts playing his drum and make all the musicians play false and after a while they all start to play An der Schnen blauen Donau and the crowd starts to dance.Die Blechtrommel is one of the most memorable films ever whet ever you liked it or not.

This is an adult world seen through the eyes of a child with all its dramatic events of several kinds including an amorous triangle formed by the boy's mother her husband and a cousin of hers. This triangle is accepted by them and everybody around them. The ascent of Nazism and the war that follows shape and form the story background from a certain point on with all their tragic and dramatic events. The movie is well made and directed but its symbolism is not very clear I mean if there is a message involved it's not very well passed on to the viewers through images and dialogues.".

	schema:headline " A Film You Should Watch once";
	schema:reviewBody "Is it possible to find a movie repulsive yet still feel it's worth a watch? The Tin Drum asked that of me last night and I have the overwhelming feeling that I am not alone. The film won multiple awards during its heyday. It tied with Apocalypse Now 1979 for the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or and if that weren't enough it took home an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Yet being aware of the film's remarkable accolades does not make watching it any easier.Based on Gunter Grass's controversial novel the film is a surreal firstperson saga about a boy from Danzig named Oskar who is brought into this world with a full consciousness. On his third birthday he's given a white and red lacquered tin drum and is told one day he'll be as tall as his assumed father Alfred Adorf. Oskar becomes so disgusted with the decadence and hypocrisy of the adult world that he decides right then and there to never grow up. To everyone's surprise he doesn't and goes through his life in the body of a threeyearold. Armed only with his tin drum and a piercing scream that can shatter glass Oskar goes through his peculiar life as the Nazis grow in prominence gain power and use Danzig as a pretense to invade Poland in 1939.The Tin Drum makes a lot of political proclamations and overtures using Oskar as a siren against Fascism. Oskar's mother Agnes Winkler is meant to represent the German population of Danzig who are seduced by German Nationalism yet choose to underplay its consequences. Within the span of a decade Oskar and Agnes familiarize themselves with three men the husband Alfred who embraces Nazism Jan Olbrychski the families Polish cousin and Oskar's possible father who stands against them and Markus a Jewish toy merchant who supplies Oskar with all his drums. All three men are infatuated with Agnes but hardly treat her as an equal. Jan lusts for her and she obliges him with regular rendezvous at a seedy hotel until she suddenly becomes pregnant and is distraught over the implications.It is established early on that Oskar is an unreliable narrator with mischievous ends. His plan to stay young is a narrative tool of magical realism which seeps into the story whenever Oskar plays his drum. The results are darkly humorous such as when an entire Nazi rally is interrupted by Oskar's incessant tapping. The crowd of dedicated Nazis suddenly break into a waltz instead of saluting a popular dignitary. Other details are exaggerated to fit the perspective of a particularly nasty little child especially when scenes are projected by an omnipotent perspective. In one scene Agnes and Jan make love while Oskar spies from the top of a church spire. He can't see but we can see Jan's awkward gyrations and Agnes's earthshattering screams mimicking what a sixyearold might think sex is.This is where the film starts to become thoroughly unpleasant. If meant as political allegory the film is subpar but taken as a complex yarn of psychological spectra the film is simultaneously brilliant and an uncomfortable watch. Is Oskar really a fullyrealized adult when he exits the womb? If so are we meant to root for him as he tortures the adults around him in much the same way a scientist would a lab rat? Oskar never grows up biologically yet emotionally his character arc bends like that of a comingofage tale right down to his sexual awakening and rebellious teenage years. Depending on your perspective these stories are the recollections of a small brat with a drum or the repressed memories of a young dwarf's life torn asunder by callousness and absurdity.It's heavily insinuated Oskar is affected by dwarfism and not actually a physical child for twentysome years. When Oskar comes face to face with a gaggle of circus folk he finds a kindred spirit in Berba Hakl a performer who says he too has chosen to stay little. Despite knowing this however actor David Bennent was only eleven when he starred in The Tin Drum thus your ability to stomach Oskar's sexual experimentation in the hands of flirtatious Maria Thalbach who was 25 is dependent on your suspension of disbelief. I for one find these scenes distressing especially when he uses his stature to his advantage.I put The Tin Drum on the same ballpark as Schindler's List 1993 A Clockwork Orange 1971 and Requiem for a Dream 2000. It's a movie you should see because it challenges your assumptions makes bold artistic choices and has something important to say. Additionally it says what it needs to in a package that granted isn't easily digestible but will leave an impact long after watching. It's also a movie the average moviegoer should only watch once in a lifetime.".

Say the movie is a comingofage tale of a boy living before and during World War II in Poland and yeah you'd think it'd be fairly typical. Now say the protagonist never grows more than he was at age three screams so high he can shatter glass whenever you try to take his drum away and that his mom dies from an addiction to eating raw fish and you'd say what is this?The Tin Drum is a surreal dark comedy that is often more unusual than funny but it is generally interesting and enjoyable to watch. You just have to be willing to accept a protagonist who isn't totally likable. Oskar's screaming actually hurt my ears his drumming creates disruptions he doesn't seem to mourn his parents' deaths and despite some glimpses into the Nazis' cruelty doesn't seem to have any problem with entertaining German troops. What this movie has to offer is a view of history and life generally quite possibly unlike any other. There is some colour some laughs some tragedy and some eroticism making for competent storytelling. Do I agree this is the best foreign language movie of 1979? I'd go with Tarkovsky's Stalker. But this is a movie worth seeing.".

You'd think talent like that could stop a measly world war.This film is only two hours twenty minutes but feels much much longer.

	schema:reviewBody "The innocent are so few that two of them seldom meet. When they do meet their victims lie strewn all round.  Elizabeth Bowen Volker Schlondorff's The Tin Drum stars David Bennent as Oskar Matzerath a young boy growing up in 1920s Danzig a city which once straddled the border between Germany and Poland. Because he's possessed an adult's somewhat pessimistic awareness since birth Oskar begins to develop a deep hatred of humanity. Oskar thus decides to not advance beyond the age of three. He will not grow up in this world and instead spends his days banging loudly on a tin drum as a show of protest.Oskar is initially painted as history's moral objector. He sees what others don't and protests what others keenly follow. Quickly however Oskar's drumming becomes Schlondorff's blunt metaphor for ineffectual artisans. Oskar drums and screams but no one listens. Nazisim gathers steam Poland is invaded Germany's economic miracle occurs and he becomes a witness to much adultery cruelty and horror.Oskar himself becomes increasingly amoral. His body may preserve an outward innocence but inside he grows self absorbed and cruel. And so though Oskar interrupts Nazy rallies and sympathises with the Jewish man who sold him a tin drum and who is later killed during Kristallnacht the Night of the Broken Glass upon which the Nazis destroyed Jewish stores and synagogues he is nevertheless quick to don a Nazi uniform and play his drum for Nazi officials.By the film's end Oskar epitomises every man infantalized by or made an obedient child to the tides of history. I prefer to be a spectator not an artist Oskar says. He's adopted a tone of total futility and comes to believe that imagination action and conviction are all inadequate in the fight against place time and political currents. But while this is Oskar's belief  he later throws his drum away altogether  it is not something Schlondorff necessarily affirms. Oskar's drumming is shown to have the power to destabilise. In one of his more successful protests an entire Nazi band is led into confusion by his boisterous percussion.Like the works of Wojciech Has Schlondorff's tone here is a strange blend of surrealism fantasy farce tragedy and much queasy imagery. Oskar himself has the face of a gnome and his antics are frequently nauseating. The film also makes heavy use of symbolism many of its major points conveyed obliquely. For example Oskar is shown to be born in 1924 the year when Germany's economy began its post WW1 climb. On Oskar's third birthday the country's economic stability is then aligned with the child's own refusal to progress a stagnation which echoes Germany's suspension of democratic and liberal freedoms. Oskar's drum is even shown to be threatened with a silencing on his sixth birthday which occurs in 1933 the year the Nazis came into power symbolising Nazism's quest to silence all dissenters.Other issues are raised almost imperceptibly. A throwaway line in which one character states that he was not present for Kristallnacht highlights a stance which was common in Germany after the war it happened but I was not there I did not participate. Meanwhile Oskar's own uncle is quick to replace a picture of Beethoven with Hitler when the Nazi Party comes into power and replaces it just as quickly when the Nazi's are defeated. He is the everyday Nazi his allegiances blowing with the winds of change.One of the most disturbing passages in the film revolves around fishermen plucking eels from a dead horse's head a sequence which mirrors the eating habits of other characters in the film all of whom are shown to be always munching on seafood. This food is later aligned to the corpses of English sailors sunk in naval battles off the coast of Germany. While Oskar protests Germany eats her foes while the country rots from the head down?.Antisemitism is touched upon openly  Jewish shopkeepers are bullied and driven to suicide  but briefly. More interesting are several sequences in which Oskar damns the Catholic Church for not resisting Hitler see Costa Gavras' Amen. In one of the film's more overt moments Oskar slaps a statue of Christ and accuses him of not helping. Meanwhile religion is mirrored to Germany's frenzied quasi religious adulation for Hitler whom Oskar calls the Gas Man a warped version of Father Christmas. Mirrored to these two national fathers Christ and Hitler are Oskar's own two fathers a Polish and German father both of whom are condemned to death by Oskar's behaviour. Schlondorff would revisit similar material with his 2004 film The Ninth Day.810  See The Garden of the Finzi Continis The Damned Seven Beauties Special Section and Protector.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's never a dull moment in this allegorical film about growing up  or deciding NOT to grow up  in a GermanPolish village between the first and second World Wars. Everyday life is coarse. The cobblestone streets are crowded with horsedrawn buggies and vendors. Everyone seems to shout or to talk emphatically. There are pompous political festivals and fustian speeches that end in rainstorms. Enthusiastic bands march clumsily around hitting innumerable clinkers. People sit at tables and eat unappetizing meals not decorously but more like animals  not essen but fressen. Sometimes they stuff themselves with fish until they die. There are grotesqueries circuses dwarfs clowns superhumanly tall psychotics. If we didn't know it was a German movie directed by Volker Schlondorff we might mistake it for Fellini.But it's from Gunther Grass's novel about a little boy who sees the political climate changing around him and decides to stop growing at the age of three. We follow him until he's twenty through strife love affairs grief disgust.The background for all this is the development of Naziism in Germany which the little boy Oscar refuses to participate in. What a case of arrested development although like Forrest Gump he has one outstanding ability that makes him different from others and that's a high piercing scream that shatters glass.It's a strange film ambiguous and full of symbols some of which got by me. I didn't get Oscar's attachment to his tin drum for instance unless it stands for Oscar's neoteny which itself stands for Oscar's unwillingness to grow along with Fascism. In that case though the drum would be a higherorder symbol a symbol of a symbol or a metasymbol. Where was I? Stanley Kubrick and Adrian Lyne both had a hell of a time getting their versions of Lolita made and released. Child pornography about which you wouldn't know Lo. But here Oscar runs around bare naked falls in love with and marries a midget and has intercourse with a teenaged girl whom he impregnates. But the blue noses are not up in arms about it. Those who made Lolita a nightmare to release have said nothing about it. Oh Lo how the mighty have ignored it.I haven't read the novel but I admire the movie for a couple of reasons not just because of its recognition that Naziism was an aberration but because everyone is given his or her due. The evil is there and it's explored but not exemplified in stereotypes. Oscar's step father for instance is swept up in the movement and wears his khaki uniform proudly but he's more stupid than cruel  brusque and thoughtless without being unkind. And Sigismund Markus Charles Aznavour the dreamy Jewish dry goods dealer who is in love with Oscar's mother. When he learns she's having an affair with a Polish citizen he ironically advises her Don't bet on the Poles. Bet on the Germans. Or better yet bet on me. And if Oscar is the hero sometimes the hero acts like a spoiled little brat. The film is narrated by Oscar in his little boy's voice and adds a good deal to our grasp of his feelings and of the backdrop against which this drama is played. It's not dull exposition. I went here then I lost track of my beloved then I looked for another drum. Instead Once there was a gullible people who were told that Santa Claus was coming but Santa Claus turned out to be the GAS man. Cut to a scene of soldiers clearing a building with a flame thrower. The narration is read most expressively.The movie begins with Oscar's grandmother back around the turn of the century sitting on a heap of damp earth in a bleak farmland scorching some potatoes in a small fire. At the end when Oscar and the others leave she remains behind. The final shot is of a train drawing away in the distance while an old lady sits before a smoky fire on a heap of dirt. I think I managed to catch that particular symbol. She's Anna Livia Plurabelle right? A remarkable film.".

It could have been poignant and really stood for somethingbut what could have been touching often was not. This is a fine example of a film that has won many awards that probably only got them because it was weird and the people on the committee thought there must be some deeper significancebut there wasn't. Seeing people throw up eels crawling in an out of cow's head 3 yearolds or who look and act and think like 3 yearolds trying to perform sex acts on a 16 yearold suicide a woman eating whole uncooked fish head guts scales and all and a child having sex with a midget are NOT my ideas of either entertainment or symbolism.

The same would probably apply to The Tin Drum but I am in no hurry to revisit this one. What struck me besides the overt symbolism as repellent as it was was the scope of the movie.  I can see why it was Germany's most expensive production before Das Boot.  A boy refuses to grow up going as far as damaging himself to stunt his growth.  His drum is the way he communicates with adults.  All of this takes place while Hitler rises to power. I do feel the film has something to say and I haven't read the Gunter Grass book but the film is a surreal experience.  Actually the more I think about it the more I would like to see it again.

Little Oscar symbolized a conscience of the citizens of Danzig when the Nazis are in power and the war rages. I am expected to sympathize with Oscar because he supposedly understands better than any adult around him what the chaos of 1920s would bring to life to Germany and to the world in 1930s but I simply can't. For me Oscar is the scariest and creepiest little creature with the empty and cold eyes of young Alex de Large whose expressing his outrage by constant pounding on his toy tin drum and screaming with windowshattering voice only annoyed me. As the years pass Oscar turned into a teenager who became naturally interested in girls but was trapped in a little boy's body which contributed to some of most disturbing and repulsing scenes in films that I've ever seen and I am a quite openminded and tolerant moviegoer. The movie's imagery is powerful and I guess the filmmaker drove his point across but for me The Tin Drum is too cold to genially touch me and too unpleasant to like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Blechtrommel or The Tin Drum is a German movie from over 35 years ago that managed to win an Academy Award in the Foreign Language Feature category as well as winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes. I cannot really see why though. I watched the director's cut of this film and it runs for almost 2 hours and 45 minutes. Certainly a case of quantity over quality here. David Bennent was actually a good choice for the main character as his face was truly memorable. However the solid acting by him and established actors like Adorf Winkler Olbrychski and the young Katharina Thalbach was not enough to make up for the flaws that this film has.Occasionall scenes with soldiers or speeches by Hitler and other Nazi officials are not enough to make a film a convincing politicalwar movie. And apart from that the stories were simply really more absurd than interesting. This goes for the main character's mother having several men at the same time or at the depiction of pedophilia later on which wasn't even shown as something bad here. Maybe the reason is because this film is so strictly against Hitler his politics and World War II so pedophilia something bad that even the Nazis despised was not depicted as really evil for that reason here. But the worst aspect was probably the storyline that the boy stopped growing because he decided to do so. Does it make sense that he did not want to be like adults in this world? Maybe. But don't all kids would like to stay young at some point? Why can't they do it? Complete nonsense rally. The inclusion of dwarf people that apparently made the same decision was really the negative highlight for this plot. I am not sure to what extent this film is based on Nobel Prize winner Gnter Grass' work and how close Schlndorff stayed to the original but in any case I cannot say this was a successful film adaptation. It's not a great family movie not a great war movie not a great political thriller and it's also not worth watching for the historic context. Maybe it could be considered fantasy. But if you hear about a fantasy movie about Hitler you knew you're in for something that is guilty pleasure material at best. This one here is not. It's just bad. Not recommended and certainly one of the worst Foreign Language Film winners in Oscar history. Also they could have kept this easily at around 100 minutes without losing any of the film's value. So many unnecessary scenes. But I guess they wanted to go for bloated here for whatever reason.".

I suspected that the screenplay by John Orloff came first and that Emmerich discovered it and became enamored of it and a quick trip to the IMDb verifies that this intuition was correct. It also informs me that Emmerich taking advantage of the money he made on the previous films paid for this whole movie out of his own pocket so that he could have full control of the film without interference from any studio. It shows.It's not a bad movie at all. And this is something I never thought I'd find myself saying about a Roland Emmerich movie. The cast is simply to die for Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth the elder her daughter Joely Richardson as Elizabeth the younger Rafe Spall as Shakespeare a talentless clod of an actor Sebastian Arnesto as Ben Johnson a talented playwright but not even in the same galaxy of greatness as the author of Shakespeare's plays David Thewlis as William Cecil Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil Derek Jacobi doing the prologue Jaime Campbell Bower from Camelot as the younger Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford and Rhys Ifans as the older Edward de Vere and the real author of Shakespeare's work.As presented the plot is not at all a scholarly argument for the Earl of Oxford's authorship of these plays. It is instead a clever reimagining of historical events some treated as loosely as Shakespeare himself treated actual history to turn the answer to the mystery that scholars argue about into a taut political thriller. In Orloff'sEmmerich's vision Edward de Vere wrote the plays and published them under someone else's name for no less a reason that to foment revolution change the course of history and determine the next king of England.And damnit that reimagining kinda worked for me. The sets and costumes are pitch perfect the performances are good and the potential is there for a good time to be had by all. Like anything related to Shakespeare the more you know about him and his work the better this film will be for you. There are so many asides and injokes that I cannot begin to go into them. Orloff really did his research. Except for the part about Edward de Vere having died before at least 10 of Shakespeare's plays were written that is. But that's just a nitpick and should not stand in the way of writing a good drama. Those kinds of historical nitpicks did not deter Shakespeare and they don't deter Orloff and Emmerich. All of them understand that The play's the thing and that history doesn't mean diddleysquat compared to that.".

Thomas Looney pronounced loanee facilitated his students in readings of the Shakespeare plays particularly the Merchant of Venice. Over the years while watching the plays hearing their rhetoric and absorbing this remarkable voice whose Elizabethan presence is still revered and studied today Looney became convinced the man from Stratford who is attributed to having written the plays the Orthodox View was not the true author. He came to believe the name William Shakespeare which appeared on two published poems the later quartos and the First Folio was in reality a pseudonym for someone else possibly a nobleman. Previously those who questioned the Orthodox View sometimes called AntiStratfordians had proposed others of the Elizebethan Age such as Sir Francis Bacon and Christopher Marlowe but Looney was convinced the true author was someone never before put forth since Shakespearian scholarship began in the 18th century. Shakespeare has and still does remain shrouded in mystery. Because Shakespeare biographical detail has been sketchy at best Looney developed a profile similar to those used by detectives to paint a picture of his candidate based on elements in the plays. He determined the writer was a nobleman a Falconer possibly sympathetic to the Lancastrian side of the Wars of the Roses and someone who loved Italy and Italian culture. And most important of all that he was a poet who possibly had written poems andor plays under his own name before going under the name of William Shakespeare. After finding a number of primary sources at the British Library he came up with his findings. Looney proposed a somewhat forgotten nobleman named Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford as being the true identity of the poetplaywright William Shakespeare in a book called simply Shakespeare Identified.Anonymous is a film based on Looney's original notion that Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford penned the plays which would become the greatest literary canon of the English language. The events surrounding the plays their performances Oxford's conscious willingness to stay behind the scenes and the attribution of the plays to the man from Stratford a businessman who had little or no experience in theatre are all dramatized in a period film which takes you back to the world of the Elizabethan Stage. One of the best aspects of Anonymous is how it relates the plays to political rhetoric of the period. In recent years Shakespearian scholars have proposed that many figures of the Elizabethan Court were satirized in the plays such as William Cecil and his son Robert Cecil. The links between the plays and contemporary politics are brought to the fore much more directly than in Shakespeare in Love.Character actor Rhys Ifans offers an Oscarcaliber performance as the man who some believe was the real Shakespeare. Ifans finds that delicate balance between the remarkable artist and the troubled nobleman who could not reconcile the two worlds of his life. If Shakespeare was in fact a nobleman who went under a pseudonym many of the events portrayed in Anonymous are plausible. Unlike today playwrights and poets lived on the periphery of society and a nobleman of the rank of Oxford writing plays containing charged political rhetoric would have been scandalous hence the ShakespeareOxford theory.The hero of the movie is actually his colleague Ben Johnson the Elizabethan playwright who has always dwelt under the shadow of Shakespeare especially in modern times. Johnson would have been the greatest playwright of his age if Shakespeare had not been writing. In this story he becomes the guardian of the Shakespeare plays and supposedly the man who saves the canon for posterity. Johnson in fact wrote the preface to the First Folio of 1623. If there had been a coverup of Shakespeare's true identity Johnson would have known.While the film bases many of its embellishments on facts known about Edward de Vere the film does take a few rather implausible historical licenses not unlike Amadeus which appeared about 25 years ago. Edward de Vere may have flirted with Queen Elizabeth when he was younger but whether they bore a child does seem quite fantastic. Later in the film an extraordinary truth about Oxford's own heritage is revealed. However films have to tell a story and some licenses are made in order the story remain interesting and compelling. Shakespeare in many of his plays bent history to fulfill his dramatic goals and theatrical visions.Many Shakespeare enthusiasts not only dismiss the Oxfordian argument but do not approve of the subject altogether. Some Stratfordians' view is that there is no authorship question and that any attempt to discredit the man from Stratford does a disservice to Shakespare. I think Anonymous is not so much about changing minds but about bringing the question out into the open. Regardless on which side of the fence you may be there are a lot of questions concerning the life of Shakespeare. Answers to mundane questions such as primary sources concerning his composing are strangely absent. No one seems to have mentioned Stratford being any kind of a poet playwright or actor in Stratford. However as shown in the film primary source evidence survives which speaks of Edward de Vere as an adolescent putting on a short play for the young Queen Elizabeth.So the film brings us back to the fundamental question did Oxford write the Shakespeare Canon or was it the man from Stratford? Primary source evidence is sparse and documents which could have shed light on this problem may have perished in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In short we may never know. But Oxford's star is on the rise and in years to come this may be the first film to acknowledge there is indeed a question. Whether it has been answered is up to each viewer.".

	schema:headline " One of the best films of the year";
	schema:reviewBody "I once gone to all the world must die.  William Shakespeare Sonnet 81 Actor George Dillon has said The purpose of drama is to challenge people and to make people see things slightly differently. The challenge is laid down in stunning fashion by German director Roland Emmerich in his latest work Anonymous one of the best films of the year. Focusing on two of the most important events of the Elizabethan age the Essex Rebellion of 1601 and the succession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I the film supports the premise that Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford a prominent aristocrat and court insider was the real author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare plays and poems of romance tragic political intrigue and comedy that contain such a compelling beauty and searing intensity that after 400 years still reach directly into our hearts and remain there forever.Described as a political thriller Anonymous creates an atmosphere of foreboding and intrigue that like many films of the genre begins with a jumble of names images and flashbacks that challenge us to sort it all out. We are not certain of anything but Emmerich invites us in the words of Diane Ackerman to groom our curiosity like a highspirited thoroughbred climb aboard and gallop over the thick sunstruck hills. Steering us through the maze of Tudor history the film makes credible the startling events of the time providing an authentic recreation of London in the 16th century with its crowded theaters and raucous audience cluttered streets and court royalty decked out in fine jewels.Though some may point out historical inaccuracies in the film Emmerich citing Shakespeare in Love as an example says that the film contains an emotional truth rather than a literal one because the drama is the primary concern. He need not have had concern on that aspect. Through Emmerich's direction the writing of John Orloff the cinematography of Anna Foerster and the superlative performance of an all British cast including Oscarworthy performances by Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I and Rhys Ifans as Oxford Anonymous succeeds both as an authentic drama and a plausible explanation for many of the problems surrounding the authorship question. While the film may lack a certain depth of characterization it more than makes up for it with style spectacle and an involving story.To some the film may be skating on narrative thin ice Emmerich however told an interviewer that if we provoke let's provoke all the way and provoke he does. According to Anonymous de Vere in addition to being Shakespeare was also the illegitimate son of the Queen and in 1573 the father of a son with Elizabeth Henry Wriothesley the 3rd Earl of Southampton Xavier Samuel. Emmerich handles the subject of incest with great taste with neither the Virgin Queen nor Oxford knowing the truth until close to the end of their lives. After a brief prologue by actor Sir Derek Jacobi the film begins with the arrest of playwright Ben Jonson Sebastian Armento by faceless men in knight's armor in the middle of a theatrical performance.The author of the play is a wellknown writer who though he is soon released is taken to the Tower and accused of sedition and slandering the State by the mere act of authoring a play the mark of a totalitarian society reflecting a growing disdain for the arts. The film then flashes back five years then forty years as we become acquainted with the young Earl of Oxford Jamie Campbell Bower taught by highly educated tutors with access to a vast library in the home of William Cecil David Thewlis where he was brought up as a ward of the court after his father's death.

	onyx:emotionText "I once gone to all the world must die.  William Shakespeare Sonnet 81 Actor George Dillon has said The purpose of drama is to challenge people and to make people see things slightly differently. The challenge is laid down in stunning fashion by German director Roland Emmerich in his latest work Anonymous one of the best films of the year. Focusing on two of the most important events of the Elizabethan age the Essex Rebellion of 1601 and the succession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I the film supports the premise that Edward de Vere the 17th Earl of Oxford a prominent aristocrat and court insider was the real author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare plays and poems of romance tragic political intrigue and comedy that contain such a compelling beauty and searing intensity that after 400 years still reach directly into our hearts and remain there forever.Described as a political thriller Anonymous creates an atmosphere of foreboding and intrigue that like many films of the genre begins with a jumble of names images and flashbacks that challenge us to sort it all out. We are not certain of anything but Emmerich invites us in the words of Diane Ackerman to groom our curiosity like a highspirited thoroughbred climb aboard and gallop over the thick sunstruck hills. Steering us through the maze of Tudor history the film makes credible the startling events of the time providing an authentic recreation of London in the 16th century with its crowded theaters and raucous audience cluttered streets and court royalty decked out in fine jewels.Though some may point out historical inaccuracies in the film Emmerich citing Shakespeare in Love as an example says that the film contains an emotional truth rather than a literal one because the drama is the primary concern. He need not have had concern on that aspect. Through Emmerich's direction the writing of John Orloff the cinematography of Anna Foerster and the superlative performance of an all British cast including Oscarworthy performances by Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I and Rhys Ifans as Oxford Anonymous succeeds both as an authentic drama and a plausible explanation for many of the problems surrounding the authorship question. While the film may lack a certain depth of characterization it more than makes up for it with style spectacle and an involving story.To some the film may be skating on narrative thin ice Emmerich however told an interviewer that if we provoke let's provoke all the way and provoke he does. According to Anonymous de Vere in addition to being Shakespeare was also the illegitimate son of the Queen and in 1573 the father of a son with Elizabeth Henry Wriothesley the 3rd Earl of Southampton Xavier Samuel. Emmerich handles the subject of incest with great taste with neither the Virgin Queen nor Oxford knowing the truth until close to the end of their lives. After a brief prologue by actor Sir Derek Jacobi the film begins with the arrest of playwright Ben Jonson Sebastian Armento by faceless men in knight's armor in the middle of a theatrical performance.The author of the play is a wellknown writer who though he is soon released is taken to the Tower and accused of sedition and slandering the State by the mere act of authoring a play the mark of a totalitarian society reflecting a growing disdain for the arts. The film then flashes back five years then forty years as we become acquainted with the young Earl of Oxford Jamie Campbell Bower taught by highly educated tutors with access to a vast library in the home of William Cecil David Thewlis where he was brought up as a ward of the court after his father's death. We also witness his marriage to a teenage Anne Cecil Amy Kwolek daughter of William a marriage that never produced any lasting satisfaction for either party.As we return to present time Oxford is forced to hide his identity because of the biting satire of his plays that lampoon some of the more prominent members of the court and also as a result of a political arrangement that becomes clearer later in the film. His initial choice to front for him is the same Ben Jonson but Jonson refuses passing the mantle to Will Shakespeare Rafe Spall an actor for the Lord Chamberlain's Men who seizes the opportunity.

	schema:reviewBody "Roland Emmerich's Anonymous addresses the question of Shakespeare's identity in this tale of Edward de Vere and his actions in the court of Queen Elizabeth. The film starts a prologue by the eminent Shakespearean actor Derek Jacobi and then leads us into a scene with Ben Johnson running about London fleeing from the knights of Robert Cecil while carrying the Complete Works. From there we flash back five years to the first time Johnson was arrested for authoring a seditious play while de Vere Christopher Marlowe and other luminaries of the London dramatic scene watched. From there a second flashback of another 40 years sends us to watch de Vere's youth and his first encounters with the Cecils and with Queen Elizabeth. Throughout the film we follow three periods of time de Vere's youth and his growing love for the Queen the peak of the Shakespearean arc in London when de Vere was feeding plays to Shakespeare and involving himself in intrigues of London surrounding the question of Elizabeth's heir and to a much lesser extent the actions of Johnson and Cecil in the aftermath of the deaths of Elizabeth and de Vere and the coronation of King James I. Some have complained that the various swings from one time line to another are confusing but I found it easy to differentiate between young Edward and young Elizabeth and their much older counterparts. The main body of the film centers around the contest between de Vere's actions to place the Earl of Essex in the line of succession and the competing interests of the Cecils first William then Robert to steer the throne to King James of Scotland. Thankfully for the viewer it is easy to differentiate between the two camps as Essex and his entourage are all fairhaired while James and the Cecils are darkhaired. There will be controversy about this film due to the great liberties it takes with historical facts. John Orloff's screenplay ranges from facts well established in the historical record to some points that are debated by experts with varying points of view and interpretations to some fictions that are introduced and can only be viewed as flatly false. Who wrote the plays and poems we attribute to Shakespeare? This is at least a topic for debate. Who killed Christopher Marlowe? This film provides an extremely unlikely answer to this question. Was Elizabeth truly a Virgin Queen? A modern viewer might think this to be unlikely especially considering who her father was but the number and variety of her children suggested by the film seems extremely unlikely. And then there are facts not in dispute at all that are contradicted by the film such as the fact that Edward de Vere survived his first wife Anne Cecil de Vere and indeed remarried. It is important then to understand that this film is a work of fiction and is not presenting what it believes to be the literal truth regarding the authorship of Shakespeare's plays. With that in mind it comes out well in comparison to the featherlight Shakespeare in Love. The production values of the film are tremendous. The producers have gone to great efforts to replicate Elizabethan London with its architecture and much and the wooden planks used in place of modern sidewalks. The acting is tremendous especially Rhys Ifans as de Vere and Vanessa Redgrave as Elizabeth. I recommend this film highly not as a serious treatment of the authorship question but as an entertaining piece of historical fiction. It might have been interesting to see a film that was a more serious treatment of the Oxfordian pointofview but such a film might well have been fairly boring in comparison.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. While it is clear that writer John Orloff and director Roland Emmerich believe that Edward De Vere The Earl of Oxford and not Will Shakespeare wrote the infamous and iconic plays we have celebrated for 400 years my advice is to watch this as a Hollywood movie and not a docudrama. Hollywood is at its best when exaggerating twisting and dramatizing historic events and figures.You may be an expert on Shakespeare and even Elizabethan history but whether you are or whether you are not my guess is that you will find this to be interesting and thoughtprovoking. You may agree with the idea that Shakespeare was not the prolific and talented author but this movie provides one possible alternative ... with no scientific proof or actual documentation. We see Rhys Ifans and Jamie Campbell Bower portray Edward De Vere as the older and younger version respectively. Both capture his passion for writing and frustration at being unable to live the life for which he was born.Vanessa Redgrave and her real life daughter Joely Richardson portray Queen Elizabeth at the older and younger stages and we certainly get a distinctive impression of how the Virgin Queen may have been mislabeled as much as any figure in history. Many lovers and illegitimate children are mentioned and the web of secrecy would have been exhausting given the other responsibilities of her position.Rafe Spall portrays Will Shakespeare as what one might call The Village Idiot. The buffoonery we see from this man is an extreme that weakens the case for De Vere rather than strengthen it. Though talented writer Ben Jonson Sebastian Armesto was De Vere's first choice the lack of morals by the illiterate actor Shakespeare allows him to seize a capitalistic opportunity and soak up the audience love.The best part of the film is the realistic look and feel of the streets the Globe Theater and costumes. Rhys Ifans is exceptional in the role of De Vere and the story itself plays out much like one of Shakespeare's plays. The downside is I believe most will find the multitude of characters and timelines and subplots to be quite confusing at times. Don't take a bathroom break or you'll miss new babies being born and upheavals being planned.".

	schema:reviewBody "Was William Shakespeare a front for an aristocrat who did not want his name revealed as the author? This movie is about political intrigue and how theater gets caught up in a larger struggle for power. The movie offers an interesting and controversial portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I and a glimpse of life in England at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The printing press was becoming a political weapon and those who published could influence the public maybe to the point of rebellion. Hence the need of the government to control what was being performed on stage. The stage served the same function of television does today. It was the medium of mass entertainment which made the playwright a critical player in the politics of the time. Now if Shakespeare was a front then the question is who wrote all these plays? Maybe it doesn't matter who actually wrote the plays but then again maybe it does matter because by knowing the author this may lead to new interpretations of the plays. Maybe these plays were political polemics produced under the guise of historical drama. Whatever the case one thing is for certain these plays made an impact on society that continues to reverberate to this day.One other point. This movie is a work of fiction and so if it is loose with certain historical facts so what? This movie is not a documentary. Rather it is a fictional historical drama that revolves around a controversial and even shocking plot. Whether Shakespeare is the actual author of the works attributed to him is not the point. That is a matter for debate. What is the point is whether the movie works as a movie. The story is complex yet the movie manages to engage the audience through strong acting and by presenting a story crammed with political intrigue. Who can say for certain what was going on in England 500 years ago? It is all a matter for speculation based upon the available historical material all of which is subject to interpretation. The idea of English writers bickering and fighting over the authorship of plays may seem trite and far fetched but the conflict makes for good drama even if it is pure fiction.".

	schema:headline " Great Acting Costumes Cinematography  Screen writing...";
	schema:reviewBody "The good parts The cinematography acting costumes sets and screen writing were magnificent. The film is stunningly beautiful to watch in every way. Vanessa Redgrave as Elizabeth I Rafe Spall as Shakespeare and Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil steal the show but the Edward de Vere Christopher Marlowe and Ben Johnson characters are also quite good. The basic premise of an authorship mystery involving Ben Johnson Edward de Vere and William Shakespeare was handled brilliantly by screen writer John Orloff who gets an A in my book on making the premise believable.Some nitpicks The whole subplot involving the succession to the crown was a bit tough to believe. I wanted less of that and more background to the Shakespeare vs. de Vere storyline especially more about what would have inspired de Vere to write the poems and plays in the first place. I believe it is likely quite difficult to tell a story this complex in a 2 hour movie and have sufficient character development and it actually would have worked much better as an HBO miniseries. Some minor editing changes would have made the movie a lot more accessible to the general public.

	onyx:emotionText "The good parts The cinematography acting costumes sets and screen writing were magnificent. The film is stunningly beautiful to watch in every way. Vanessa Redgrave as Elizabeth I Rafe Spall as Shakespeare and Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil steal the show but the Edward de Vere Christopher Marlowe and Ben Johnson characters are also quite good. The basic premise of an authorship mystery involving Ben Johnson Edward de Vere and William Shakespeare was handled brilliantly by screen writer John Orloff who gets an A in my book on making the premise believable.Some nitpicks The whole subplot involving the succession to the crown was a bit tough to believe. I wanted less of that and more background to the Shakespeare vs. de Vere storyline especially more about what would have inspired de Vere to write the poems and plays in the first place. I believe it is likely quite difficult to tell a story this complex in a 2 hour movie and have sufficient character development and it actually would have worked much better as an HBO miniseries. Some minor editing changes would have made the movie a lot more accessible to the general public.

Now I can see how some people might dislike this movie especially for those that are fans of Shakespeare. Also the movie doesn't really make you think but instead goes in a black and white direction. Where Shakespeare is a charlatan and a fraud while being a obnoxious drunkard and a despicable person at that. Also this movie might irritate some viewers who judges movies by how true it is historically. Although history is written by ink and usually by the victors. But what this movie is is a intriguing movie that grabbed my attention most of the way through although it had some slow moments. And can get a bit convoluted the way it goes from before and after parts but you catch on after a while. Since there are movies about Shakespeare it would have been more interesting if it had more of the back story of Earl of Oxford and his life. And also some parts seemed a bit farfetched. The cast was pretty good and the acting for the most part is believable. Especially Rhys Ifans who played Earl of Oxford the way he presented himself was charismatic and you could tell the character is intelligent by the way he expressed himself. Vanessa Redgrave was also great as Queen Elizabeth I. What was intriguing was how plays are in a way sort of like movies and this movie was about how plays moved people in immense ways. Overall this movie was a good blend of drama romance and conspiracy.7.410".

Even without being a historian and without being able to confirm the contradictions about dates and places it's clear to me that the focal point of these conspiracies is simply claiming that Shakespeare couldn't have written the most acclaimed English literature for not having the necessary social connections education and culture in order to achieve that. In other words those investigators suggest the fact that the greatness from a person is determined by hisher money or social position and that it's impossible for any commoner to possess the necessary talent in order to stand out in hisher occupation. Under that logic every millionaire person should be an artistic and scientific genius.The film Anonymous tried to examine that hypothesis about Shakespere and even though I liked it I think its screenplay should have been better polished because its frequent chronological jumps court intrigues and numerous characters make it occasionally a bit confusing and tiring. Nevertheless I have to admit that Anonymous generally kept me interested.Anonymous recreates London in 16th century with an absolute realism and attention to every detail from the mud on the floor to the extraordinary replica of the Globe theatre all the visual elements are brilliant even though they occasionally draw more attention than the necessary. The narrative aspect also suffers from some excesses and I think that the film could have been a bit shorter by deleting some of the most tangled plans from the villains or even from the heroes.The whole cast from Anonymous brings solid performances highlighting Rhys Ifans Vanessa Redgrave and Rafe Spall.

Instead it nearly put me to sleep. None of the characters aroused any interest or sympathy. None of the characters had any life so how could they interest me? None of the characters had a character arc meaning that no one significantly changes or grew during the film. Well that's not completely true. The young de Vere played by Jamie Campbell Bower seemed to be an immature horn dog while the older de Vere played by Rhys Ifans seems to have no interest in sex at all but that wasn't character growth  that was an unlikeable character mysteriously becoming a very different unlikeable character with no explanation for the change. As Edward de Vere Rhys Ifans attempted to show his poetic soul by looking constipated. He didn't show a shred of humor which is decidedly odd for a man who supposedly if he was the real author as the Oxfordians would have it wrote more comedies than tragedies. His character claims that art must be political or else it is merely decorative but he never expressed any political beliefs in the film. He had a personal grudge against the Cecil family but there is a difference between the personal and the political. By the way I find the statement that art must be political or else it is merely decorative to be the most offensive thing in the entire film.According to the film Edward's consummate goal was to install Essex on the throne rather than James. But why did he care? Was it some sort of prejudice against the Scottish? Was it out of some sort of affection for Elizabeth? He lusted for her as a youth but we never see him show any affection for her as a woman rather than as sex object when they were young. And if he had felt any deep affection for Elizabeth one would have to question why he would care for such an emptyheaded libertine. Did de Vere actually think Essex's political policies were superior to James's political policies? If so why didn't the film ever differentiate between their policies? Does this mean that Oxford would have thought the screenplay of Anonymous was merely decorative? As played by Ifans de Vere didn't seem to have a passion for anything or any joy in living. He didn't even enjoy writing  he wrote to keep his voices from troubling him. At the very end of the film he shows some love for his son but by that point it was too late for me to care about this cold fish.Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored. I have long thought that it would be difficult to make a film with Oxford as the hero of an Oxfordian movie because you would either have to portray him as a prig who was ashamed of writing Hamlet or as someone who would like to have taken credit but was too big a wimp to say anything. This film manages to portray Oxford at least when he is Ifans as both a wimp and a prig. The film did not bother me primarily for the way it treated William Shakespeare. It bothered me primarily because it was so damned boring.Even if you accept the premises of the film it doesn't make sense on its own terms. Queen Elizabeth is not presented as a Puritan quite the opposite and she clearly enjoys plays. Why at the very end of the film does she suddenly insist that de Vere's name never be on the plays? That comes completely out of left field. And Robert Cecil is supposed to be an ultimate political gamesplayer and spy master. Why doesn't he know that the man he installs as King likes plays? Why did de Vere first learn about the power of plays to move people when he was a mature man played by Ifans who attended a public performance of a play by Ben Jonson? According to the film de Vere had already written Romeo  Juliet and the Henry IV plays and had them performed at court  wouldn't he have already known about the power of plays to move people??? The second most offensive thing in the film i.e. after the statement that art must be political or it is merely decorative was changing the line that can sing both high and low to that can kiss both high and low  turning it into a cheap oral sex joke.".

Experts have debated books have been written and scholars have devoted their lives to protecting or debunking theories surrounding the authorship of the most renowned works in English literature. Anonymous poses one possible answer focusing on a time when scandalous political intrigue illicit romances in the Royal Court and the schemes of greedy nobles lusting for the power of the throne were brought to light in the most unlikely of places the London stage.  C Sony PicturesAs an average moviegoer I had no idea that Shakespeare's authorship was ever questioned. I didn't know there were theories that existed that other people might have been the true author of the plays one of which the film focuses on is Oxford. But as far as what ANONYMOUS achieves it certainly opened my mind as an individual that there is a possibility that another person might have been the true writer of the plays. I mean why not? It makes the whole thing pertaining to Shakespeare's plays much more interesting. At the most basic level ANONYMOUS does one thing right It's damn interesting and entertaining.Even as a person who never liked Shakespeare's plays especially the dreaded ROMEO AND JULIET the film manages to be involving. I was compelled throughout the film and what makes it work are the actors. Most of them are on the top of their game including Rhys Ifans who is unrecognizable as Oxford compared to his role in HARRY POTTER 7 PT.1. Even his stares are intense. Rafe Spall as William Shakespeare seems to have a field day with his role portraying him as an attentionseeking moneygrubbing actor. I'd also like to point out that Sebastian Armesto playing Ben Jonson seems to have an unexpected greater amount of sreentime than anyone else in the film and he does well in his role as the aspiring writer who plays as a messenger between Oxford and Shakespeare.Another interesting thing to point out is that the film really doesn't focus on the whole authorship debate a lot. We see that Oxford is the writer giving the scripts to Ben but other than that the film pretty much brushes it off to the side and instead focuses more on the relationship between Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I as well as the Essex Rebellion. As you can tell the cast is pretty huge and I have to admit the first 20 minutes of the film is pretty confusing. We're introduced to a world with many characters and time periods jumping all over the place but it gets easier to grasp once you get to know the characters.Overall ANONYMOUS is an interesting and entertaining film that will get people talking about who the real author of the plays are. The least anyone would get out of it is two hours of a fun what if? scenario. The performances by the cast is what really makes the film though. If it wasn't for the cast the film wouldn't have worked. Additionally haters of director Roland Emmerich might find themselves pleased that ANONYMOUS is a characterdriven film that doesn't rely on things being destroyed every five minutes. I'd like to see him make more films like this.".

I lost count of the historical inaccuracies after the first 20 minutes or so Hamlet before Richard III? Richard III not II at Essex's revolt? And the way Marlowe died?

But if there was any fear that this movie would lend weight to the countless conspiracy theories that have littered history for centuries then those fears were soon dispelled. True Shakespeare is made to look a complete idiot. But that says more about the director and writer than it does about the Immortal Bard. If Shakespeare is treated badly then Ben Jonson is positively lampooned. Watching the movie I occasionally got the feeling that its producers did not know who Ben Jonson really was. Historical accuracy was not high on the list of priorities for the makers of this movie. They engage in dynastic and historical gymnastics in order to support the pathetically weak plot mainly that Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford wrote the 37 plays attributed to Shakespeare. By the time the movie finished I think the Earl of Oxord had turned out to be his own father and Queen Elizabeth i was his mother. This will only count as a spoiler if you have attempted to follow the entwined family trees of the Cecils Tudors and de Veres through irritating jumps back and forward in time which totally confuse the audience. Having said all this the movie does boast an outstanding cast and Elizabethan London is excellently recreated with both costumes and sets. Just a pity that they also decided to manufacture the historical events.".

For the first part of the movie the audience doesn't sympathize with any of the characters Ben Johnson is pointless we might feel him only during the ending scenes but I think is a hateful character and the Earl of Oxford that should be the protagonist doesn't seem to be it.Moreover I HATED the reconstruction of London made by computer it gave to the film this sense of artificiality and surreality which didn't helped at all the plot.I admit the acting was fairly good and the story itself is very interesting as a new vision of Shakespeare's fame and works.

The part is given to Rhys Ifans who fails entirely to endow it with any sign of life whatsoever. And as for the big question the film poses 'Who wrote Shakespeare?'

	schema:reviewBody "Anybody expecting to get a great account of the Black Dahlia case even fictional will be disappointed going in to this movie. Of course I knew that it was a fictionalization of the case but I had no idea the movie would present its own evidence and draw its own conclusions.But the main problem here is not the lack of factual detail so much as the confusion of plot that surrounds and overwhelms the Black Dahlia case itself. So much plot and character and sideplots and backstory are built around the central characters that the case itself seems like a distraction. A key plot point and character motivator is the fascination of the two detectives with the murder but this is never elaborated enough in the film and we're left to halfheartedly guess at the character motivations.The tone is never consistently campy but when the camp arrives it overwhelms the story. A dinner scene between a suspect and her family had the crowd in stitches the only scene during which the audience laughed. The problem is that the scene is valuable to the plot and should never have been played for laughs. Hitchcock or even Lynch could have shot the same scene with the same events and dialogue and made it menacing and creepy which it needed to be to function in the mystery.Other problems De Palma uses the lesbian angle of the movie never a part of the case to full exploitative advantage and the actresses seem unable to master to the expressive 1940s style acting that would have come naturally to even a marginal 40s star.Although the film brings a clearcut finale rather than a vague puzzle too many loose threads come together too neatly and rather than bringing the film to a satisfactory conclusion it leaves you scratching your head is this what I spent the last 2 hours waiting to hear? Overall there is too much plot too little character development and a wildly uneven tone. The movie has its moments but it's a blinding mess all together.".

Confidential is firmly planted in the 1950s and Chinatown takes place in the 1930s De Palma's film has shallow roots once upon a time in Los Angeles. Clearly a movie nominally set in 194347 in which the lead characters attend a silent movie The Man Who Laughs  1928note that the characters are sitting in the balcony which was reserved for blacks back in the ugly days of segregation. Oops! has nothing but contempt for the past which is reflected in a thousand ways from male actors' scruffy haircuts and inability to wear hats properly to a laughable lesbian nightclub scene featuring K.D. Lang in top hat and tails singing Love for Sale which rather than depicting the classic film noir era is most evocative of Bugsy Malone a far more accurate film.One can find fatal flaws in virtually every area of this movie with little effortin fact the most difficult task in critiquing the film is remembering everything that's wrong with it.First there's Josh Friedman's dialog She looks like that dead girl! How sick are you?not quite She's my sister and my daughter is it? Then there's miscasting at 31 Kirshner is much too old to play the 22yearold Black Dahlia opulent production design by Dante Ferretti police officers lived like this on LAPD pay? Who knew? music Mark Isham in the entirely predictable cue mournful trumpet genre odd costumingFriday casual for the men fall collection for the womenJenny Beavan down to the crowd scenes which are busy to the point of distraction. And I wish I had the cigarette holder franchise on this film. I would be a rich man.Even special effects are misused with an earthquake that serves no purpose except to underline an obvious plot turn. Granted the overly complex story is almost impossible to follow but in this instance De Palma must assume the audience has an IQ of about 50. And unlike the shocking and painfully realistic noseslitting scene in Chinatown the far worse violence inflicted on the Black Dahlia is amusingly fake. If De Palma was hoping to make a slasher flick he failed badly.Nor does Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography escape a rap on the knuckles for a ridiculous lesbian stag film presumably made at a cost surpassing the combined budgets of all blue movies produced from the 1920s to the 1950s and a selfconscious and overly elaborate shot in which partners Blanchard Eckhart and Bleichert Josh Hartnett engage in a shootout followed by the camera slowly rising up floor by floor of an entire apartment building proceeding to a befuddling shot of the building's roof before it at last discovers the Black Dahlia's body in a vacant lot in the adjoining block. As visual storytelling this is a grandiose and miserable failure. And then there's Fiona Shaw who chews so much scenery that she must have been rushed to an oral surgeon to have the splinters removed.For that matterand perhaps this is what makes the heart of the film beat so faintlythere is very little of the Black Dahlia in The Black Dahlia who only surfaces far into the picture.In fact the first 30 or 40 minutes are devoted to boxing matches between the two detectives nicknamed Fire and Ice from the Symbolism 101 school of writing. I know it's in the book but that's no excuse.So where is the Black Dahlia in this confusing mess? She exists entirely on film. Of course in real life Elizabeth Short never got a screen test or even appeared in a school play but De Palma gives her one and Kirshner trying her best at the impossible task of acting 22 makes it as pitiful as possible with an intentionally miserable reading of Vivian Leigh's famous monologue from Gone With the Wind. The handling of the crime scene? Ridiculous even by Hollywood's lax standards. Vintage blackandwhite police cars swarming the streets and detectives bellowing instructions like some sharkjumping 1970s cop show that any good investigator would already know. Ditto the morgue.Then there's the contrasting lovesex scenes and it's obvious De Palma hasn't a clue how to stage either one. The sex scene between Harnett and Johansson occurs in the dining room when overcome with passion Bleichert rips away the tablecloth sending dishes everywhere and has his way with Lake. Isham's score is lushly romantic an oddly contrasting choice of music and amour like this is sure tough on the Havilland china and the Baccarat crystal.The love scene between Swank and Harnett is just as amusing with Bleichert and Linscott having a little pillow talk while she's wearing nothing but huge pearl earrings and a long matching necklace with pearls the size of small onions ensuring I would imagine a rather bumpy ride.And about those crazy Linscotts. Bleichert knows exactly how to make rich people confess to murder Use their valuable antiques for target practice. The last time I checked police revolvers hold six rounds so unless Bleichert was planning to fight off one of them as he reloaded I can't imagine what he thought he would do after his sixth question. Then again not everybody can send a crystal chandelier crashing to the floor with one shotsome of us need two.And while you're at it Bucky take out a couple of those clown paintings please.".

It involves violence money pimps porn and the most notorious murder in California history. Sadly though the movie just doesn't cut it.The Black Dahlia isn't about murder or guns or pimps or porn. The Black Dahlia is about the new American dream to sleep with Scarlett Johansson. The Dahlia isn't even introduced until a third of the movie is over the longest 45 minutes I've ever experienced in cinema. A good hour of the movie doesn't have anything to do with the plot and watching it is just like watching paint dry. Much of this wasted screen time is attributed to the relationship between Sgt. Leland Lee Blanchard Aaron Eckert and Officer. Dwight Bucky Bleichert Josh Hartnett where we see their transformation from enemies to partners to friends unrealistically fast which is unrealistically clich.But the biggest downside of the movie is Josh Hartnett. What Hartnett is doing as a serious actor is beyond me but his performance is a wooden as they come. It is unbelievable that he was considered for the role of Bleichert and the fact that he was cast really makes me lose faith in Hollywood's mainstream actors. His noirish voiceover was like reading words off the script making it feel less and less like the artsy film De Palma intended it to be.The only redeeming feature of the flick was Mia Kirshner who had about one minute of screen time as the Dahlia but was the most memorable character. Oh yeah and we do get to see Hilary Swank's ass.But overall The Black Dahlia is just another bad film to cap off the summer. It is extremely confusing with all its pointless subplots and just gets annoying at the end. It's one of those movies you consider walking out of and I counted down the minutes to what I thought would be a climactic finale but was just a series of long monologues and unclear speaking. In the end we learned little about the Dahlia and were pretty much back where we started except for a few missing comrades.".

Such is the case with Black Dahlia a film noir from Brian De Palma a past master of the macabre and the complicated Blow Out Body Double. It has all the trappings of a firstrate detective novel James Ellroy made into a 1940's thriller with appropriately moody music of the soulful trumpet Mark Isham lush production design Dante Ferretti and equally impressive costuming Jenny Beavan all set in a timelessly seedy Los Angeles.There's also the conflicted sometimes dark hero detective Josh Hartnett and the sexy dangerous femme fatale Hilary Swank accompanied by the questionably good voluptuary sex bomb Scarlett Johansson.

The original novel was based on aspiring actress Elizabeth Short's unsolved grizzly murder in 1947. After a considerably convoluted exposition with plot lines rarely intersecting in a unified way the film has the nerve to offer one of the most extensive denouements in film history could be a half hour with lengthy explanation of how all those ends tied together.

	schema:headline " Interesting and stylish but disappointing overall";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been almost ten years since Curtis Hanson delivered what was arguably the best picture of 1997 L.A. Confidential. That movie was great in almost every way my key dislike was only in the performance of Kim Basinger yet the Academy did not agree with me and a big part of that was due to the source material from James Ellroy. And now comes The Black Dahlia another one of Ellroy's books based on detectives in the 1940's only revolving around a real event and having master filmmaker Brian De Palma at the helm. And unfortunately the film comes with mixed results.After taking part in a boxing match which ends up giving a whole lot more power to the L.A.P.D. Dwight Bucky Bleichert Josh Hartnett and Leland Lee Blanchard Aaron Eckhart are promoted to detectives and become partners. Shortly afterwards they become entangled in the brutal murder of Elizabeth Short Mia Kirshner otherwise known as the titular Black Dahlia. What follows for them is a tale of corruption greed and vengeance. It may not seem like much not too mention the femme fatales of Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank but the film really has a lot going on.And this is where a bit of the problems lie.Some of the events that occur over the course of the film are just completely random and almost unexplainable. Hell random subplots appear and disappear faster than they come up. When it really starts getting down to business the movie becomes downright confusing and the narrative does not let up for anyone to truly figure it all out. It gets especially bizarre in the final act when almost nothing truly makes sense and we just have to sit and just contend with what ends up happening. It makes it seem like they want the audience to sift through and determine what is relevant to the film and what is not and only then can they truly grasp onto a full understanding. Even after watching the film a few hours ago I still question some of the things that happened.I think one of the key reasons it does not make a whole whack of sense is the fact that it revolves around a real event. Last week's Hollywoodland had this same problem in that the filmmakers do not seem to have an idea of where to draw your attention. Do they want the focus on the murder itself or do they want the focus on the cops investigating it? Adding in a few seemingly bizarre backstories does not help this either. They seem to strike gold when they focalize on what the murder and its impending investigation is doing to Bucky and Lee but they do not spend enough time expressing it. They touch on it in passing and instead cut to either useless items or completely random things. You can tell that there is some form of direction however just not enough.Hartnett plays Bucky very smoothly and does a very adequate job in his narration. He really lacks the zest to make his character interesting however and has a really tough time trying to make the audience care about him. He just does not seem to have the hardboiled cop schtick nailed down here and only comes off as a little less than softboiled. Eckhart on the other hand does have the zest and really shines through as Lee. His character goes through most of the changing during the film and you can see the dramatic change of character as the film progresses. He just does not have nearly enough screen time to truly flesh him from being the strange and mysterious character.Johansson does well for herself as the girl stuck between the two partners and only sparingly gets the opportunity to stretch out her enigmatic character. Swank on the other hand feels completely useless in the scheme of things until her character actually serves a purpose later in the film. Her disappearreappearing Scottish accent is laughable and her whole performance really begs the question of how she has managed to snag two Best Actress Oscars in less than ten years. Supporting work especially from Mike Starr Fiona Shaw and the flashback heavy Kirshner are all on the mark and are fairly well done in their limited roles.Whereas there were problems with many other things there are none with the sets costumes and cinematography. This is 1940's Los Angeles and it looks gorgeous. Every single minute detail seems to have been polished and amped up to the point of looking like it was filmed sixty years ago. It makes the film feel more realistic than it is and makes the sheer coolness of the settings and characters stand right out. Although it may be advertised as being noir it really is nowhere near as dark as it could have been. Yet it still has enough packed into it to make this film visually astonishing.Another standout is the feel of it being a De Palma film. The camera angles the slow motion the violence the sheer editing of it all especially the worn black and white film clips of Kirshner as Short just screams old school De Palma. From the start even with its problems the audience knows it is in the hands of a style master and in that regard the film is consistent and on the mark.But unfortunately that same phrase cannot be used to describe the rest of the film. It is truly a mixed bag but despite its confusing narrative it is still interesting and stylish as hell. But I still cannot help but be disappointed overall. I guess I was just expecting a whole lot more.710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dante Ferretti's set design beautifully evokes the 1940's Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography enhances the period look and the voiceover narration has been pulled from filmnoir classics. While Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia has much of the look and feel of Curtis Hanson's 1997 L.A. Confidential that far superior film boasted better performances and a wellwritten screenplay. Although both films were based on James Ellroy novels and both had complicated involved plots the Hanson film came together with satisfying logic. Unfortunately De Palma's movie is equally if not more complex and leaves a few threads dangling or at least badly frayed.Although loosely based on a famous Hollywood murder The Black Dahlia spends more time than necessary in establishing the threeway partnership if not mnage between Josh Hartnett Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart. The leisurely pace allows viewers to ponder the last time that they saw a film with so many double letters in the stars' names. The trailer which has played in theaters for weeks was misleading and the actual murder and resulting investigation do not begin until well into the film after we have witnessed boxing scenes between the police investigators Hartnett and Eckhart and some threeway flirtations that do little to advance the proceedings.The film only becomes interesting when the campy upper crust Linscott family enters. Hilary Swank as Madeleine Linscott is a deadly femme in black and as fatale as they come. Fiona Shaw as her mother shamelessly steals scenes and chews the banisters in her few minutes on screen and John Kavanagh as Emmet Linscott adds to the family's quirky personality. An entire film could have been constructed around the Linscotts that would have been far more interesting than the HartnettJohanssonEckhart romance. Scarlett has little to do but purse her luscious red lips and look desirable in tight blouses which she does quite well. Josh is all squintyeyed intensity and muscled charm which he does quite well. Aaron tries for more but goes a bit over the top perhaps he would have been more comfortable playing a cousin of the Linscotts.Although The Black Dahlia is not the worst way to spend two hours the film's pedigree would lead viewers to expect more. Only a week after the lessdisappointing Hollywoodland De Palma's take on another old Hollywood mystery should have been riveting. All of the essentials were there except possibly a seasoned troop of stars for another L.A. Confidential. Unfortunately what arrived was a nearly indecipherable mystery within a tedious love triangle that was wrapped in multimillion dollar production values.".

It bears few of the director's signature set pieces and possesses none of the energy of classics like Body Double. Dressed To Kill Blow Out and Scarface. Based on the rambling seedy novel by James Elroy which I read and enjoyed very much over a decade ago this filmization of the novel fails in its casting structure and set design. Although the film's period Los Angeles has all the trappings of ye olde Hollywoodland it looks like a movie set. Josh Hartnett is totally unconvincing in his central role as is the highly masculine Hillary Swank as a femme fatale give me a break! she belongs in an Almodovar movie! who sucks Hartnett into a convoluted web and her unappealing mouth. Scarlett Johannsen who looks ravishing in a shot or two is weak as water and owns little screen presence. The narrative is unbelievably matteroffact and most of the film's surprise revelations are plain silly. More conservative critics have focused on the film's sleaze and trashiness. If ONLY there was more sleaze and trash. This is lightweight film noir that will will send most viewers back to the video store to rent the DVD of LA Confidential an excellent adaptation of another Elroy novel. This turgid celluloid clunker is something I will soon forget.".

Most of the actors try to copy the style of dialogue from the 1940s which would be fine if we were in the 1940s but this is 2006.

In this case the viewer has to spend far too much time trying to figure out what the movie is trying to do. Just give me the mystery that the movie is about. No one needs to make the moviemaking process a mystery.For those of you who are going just to see Scarlett Johansson I have to say I am very disappointed in her. Her acting needs a lot of improvement or she needs to find movies that embrace her sensuality. Yeah she is sexy in this movie too but her voice does not fit her actions and her acting is puzzling not mysterious. I want the Scarlett I knew from Lost In Translation and American Rhapsody at least she could act and her voice fit her character. Other main characters were just as puzzling however.

Suffice to say whenever anyone said anything dramatic I was embarrassed for them.The violence was pointlessly graphic. Showing the Dahlia's eviscerating body a thousand times had no emotional impact at all and only made me sick. Keep in mind I love campy horror movies with rivers of gore but the badly CGI corpse had no place in a serious movie.It was only 2 hours long but it felt like at least three. I literally felt like I was in a time warp when I looked at my watch when the movie was over. It was a waste of life. I kept hoping it get better or end but it never ever did.Sadly it wasn't even laughably bad.".

It may not much for people knowing what the Black Dahlia murders were all about or that read the book but for a movie it was good.The film has the feel of L.A. Confidential but it's not that good or maybe more like Where the Truth Lies and is beautifully shot. The story itself is somehow convoluted but it all becomes somewhat clearer in the end. Yes the plot does have some holes in it and some acting is not so convincing as it should be but saying Josh Hartnett didn't act is just lame. He plays a less emotional person than others and he was very well cast for the role. Some of the script scenes were weak that's one thing an actor can't change.Bottom line watch it in a slow night when you feel like seeing a movie that removes you from everyday life. This is not exactly a noir film but it's close enough.".

I'll keep it short and succinct as I do not take pleasure in bashing anything that at least assumes itself to be something artistic.Let's try to tackle the plot here. You can take your pick as to which one there were about 6 of them poorly strewn into the course of the feature. Things started out fine as a mid 20s boxer drama. Then about twenty minutes into the movie we are introduced into a love trapezoid and a dirtycop storyline. It was as if the writer wanted to suck the life out of every other genre just so he wouldn't have to deal with the supposedly main story arc that being something about the dead actress which doesn't even get a mention until more than half way through the movie and from then on is nothing more than a footnote in a sidenote of some other blackcomedy plot line.Be prepared to suffer through some completely arbitrary scenes. There are quite a few bastardized scenes that for no other reason than to muddle the viewers' minds get juxtaposed right in the middle of whatever topic Brian was focusing on at the moment. There's a lot of that going on. One minute you'll be trying to settle in with a vainly forced scene between two characters then suddenly find yourself socked in the noggin' by a completely unnecessary shot of something happening a few blocks away.Alright although this movie was a rotten grape I feel that I must mention a redeeming factor. Josh Hartnet showed exemplary control over her mannerisms and expressions. He was after all the main actor. He did a superb job of conveying any of the fifty bajillion emotions he was handed. Pat on the back for him. His partner was equally impressive where as everyone else did their damnedest to ham it up as much as possible.Okay but seriously here's an example of bad film making. There's a line in the movie right You look just like that dead girl. An actress says that line and then the immediate line that follows it is a flashback to THAT LINE. Let that settle in. A FLASHBACK TO THE VERY LAST LINE OF DIALOGUE SPOKEN!!!!!!!!!! And it wasn't just an isolated incident oh no. The entire film is gummed up with such pointless actions.Anyhoo yay for Hartnet's performance but boo to DePalma and his horribly wacky film. Yikes.".

Then I watched all of the extra stuff. Then I watched the film a second time. The next day I watched it again.So first off it is well cast.

The pleasure comes when you are still surprised by the outcome even with such clues in place.With the above in consideration I had to know that there was a reason for Eckharts insane obsession with the case. Maybe I was let down a little with that reason Which I will not give as it is a spoiler but I was happy with the fact that there WAS a reason for his irrational behavior.Most of the cast was fairly acceptable. I was considerably happy that Hilary Swank was given a more exotic role to play in direct contract to roles she has played recently.

A lot of people however might be disturbed by the subject material and if that is the source of the public opinion of this film than that is understandable.What people do not understand is that this film is acted and played out just like a black and white film from the late 40's Early 50's.Classic film buffs probably love this but I am sure that the person who goes to movies with a lot of explosions car chases and fake looking CGI will not like it at all.My only complaint is that it was not filmed in BW But the sets and the locations... I believed I was in Hollywoodland so to speak.I just had to add this after browsing through the BAD reviews of this filmI respect the moviemaking PROCESS too much to just say nothing about this... What would this kind of activity be? Take the time and go through the negative reviews And you will see that there are a few duplicates. Actually more than a few... Quite a few. What is that?

Sgt.

It goes without saying that TBD doesn't come close to matching that film's standards but that's not to say it's a film with absolutely no intrinsic value whatsoever.Based around a true story which interestingly as I said remains the biggest unsolved crime in L.A.'s history today the film brings the atmosphere of the time alive quite well capturing a good period setting and decent film noirish style. Many have complained about Hartnett's performance in one of the lead role's being too bland and wooden. He's not an actor renowned for turning in Oscar worthy performances but he's certainly not as bad as everyone says he is not bringing any outstanding depth to his role but carrying it fairly well anyway. A lot of the supporting cast including Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson show him up a bit but there you go. Brian De Palma is also a director who scores as many misses as he does hits but again he also does fairly well in spite of himself here gliding things along nicely and building a fairly neat sense of tension and suspense throughout.A downside is that the pace drags a bit towards the end and there are a lot of twists and turns to pay attention to maybe a bit too many. Or maybe James Ellroy is a bit over me. Nevertheless this is a good solid thriller that is well worth seeing. ".

I suppose next it will be The Return of the Black Dahlia.";

Expectation... Curtis Hanson did an excellent job with L.A. Confidential so why not?  And now I've seen the result of DePalma's work. First of all don't even compare it with the L.A. Confidential movie. Black Dahlia is told in a radical different way being much more synthetic expressive and theatrical. This is not a very common way of telling stories in modern movies however this method made me recall the typical 'overacting' as seen in the 40's noir movies like Double Indemnity. Was this intentionally?  Probably yes. It feel a bit weird to begin with but at the end of the show I had to admit It works. The movie clearly tries to describe all the details from the book which sometimes makes it loose its own breath. The original story had so many details and took place over a very long period of time. This is one of the points where the movie sometimes stumble. It's simply trying too hard. One thing that is hard to criticize is the stunning visuals. The movie is absolutely beautiful making every scene a work of art. The other highly successful point I would have to mention is Hilary Swank. She IS a femme fatale by definition. Fans of the classic filmnoir genre will most likely be more than satisfied. Keep a lookout for this one and be ready to be thrilled.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have only seen 16 movies released in 2006 and I think that The Black Dahlia 2006 directed by Brian De Palma is one of the most enjoyable. The way it walks talks sounds and feels truly captivated me. It is a fantastic cinematic achievement. It is shocking dark very clever and enormously beautiful. It is over the top but how would you make a movie about the investigation of the most notorious and gruesome never solved murder in Hollywood differently? I like this exploitative overplayed smoldering overwhelming cheesy campy Crime  Drama  Mystery  Thriller my favorite genres with the evident elements of black comedy the most favorite genre when it's done well. I don't deny that it has its problems but I still believe it is worth watching and rewatching especially on DVD when you can stop it and return to the earlier scene to see what you might have missed the first time. The Black Dahlia is one of the rare films that make you forget all their flaws. I am still puzzled with the ending but I LOVE the movie I could not take my eyes off the screen. The way De Palma uses light shadows his combination of colors black and gold  my favorite his use of stairways and the way we first are allowed to notice the body  it is Art noir film made by an Artist. Besides I simply can't be indifferent to a movie that uses Cole Porter 's song Love for Sale which I adore as performed by k.d. lang.The movie grabbed me with its visual grandeur heated atmosphere of danger dark desperate mood and that's why I like it so much. I don't like it for its story  after all it is one of the myriads of versions of what had actually happened 60 years ago I don't admire it for the acting even though Mia Krishner as unfortunate Betty Short was heartbreaking and I did like Hillary Swank for the first time in my life yes I know that she is two times Oscar winner but I liked her here when she said to herself Bucky...I'll try to remember... that  it was a good acting irony which I've never seen in her before. I also believe that Fiona Shaw was wonderful in her role  it simply could not be played any differently and to make her character so over the top was an artistic achievement and not the lack of acting abilities as many viewers seem to believe.I respect the movies that entertain me excite me and stay with me even if I see their weakness very well. Black Dahlia is one of these movies. I am perhaps one of very few viewers in the whole world who actually was satisfied with the ending and the big revelation before it. Yes it is bizarre and it is grotesque but it fits the whole movie perfectly and when I mentioned earlier how clever the movie was I meant how well its creators explored just one of the evidences and using the works of literature art and earlier cinema built the whole possible story behind the murder based on it. Once again The Black Dahlia is IMO one of the best and most entertaining movies of last year which I enjoyed enormously.Directed by the Artist with a unique vision and talent The Black Dahlia will be appreciated as time goes by.".

	schema:reviewBody "De Palma's staged theatrical style has always felt like an injoke an expressive homage or sometimes a slap in the face to the conventions of cinema. And in the case of his high energy thrillers the joke is funny and damned entertaining. But in the case of his dramas De Palma constantly walks a thin line between evocative melodrama and camp The wonderful Carlito's Way in my opinion is the exception. And The Black Dahlia often steps over that line. With a steady buildup of noir conventions the film hearkens to the expressionistic film and acting styles of the 40's  a style which can induce giggles in audiences raised on irony. And I can count a few musical swells flamboyant acting choices and dramatic fadeouts which caused unwanted comic relief. Or did it? If there's one thing De Palma loves more than entertaining his audience it's confounding them. How else do you explain the twohour joke that was Raising Cain? Although I for one found that particular joke damned funny. You watch Dahlia with the distinct impression that De Palma is enjoying every minute of it. He's copying Wilder Welles and you guessed it Hitchcock  and he's having a blast doing it. So when Josh Hartnett's character pulls a full dinner setting including the turkey off a table and throws Scarlett Johansson down lustfully upon it should we also smile and remember Double Indemnity? I guess it would help if you've seen Double Indemnity. That said the film's biggest flaw is that it smiles at itself for so long that it leaves little time to wrap up the plot. The onslaught of lastreel revelations seems to exist only to give the actors more opportunity to relish in the delicious mood De Palma has created. We never really cared about the plot in the first place because De Palma didn't care about it either. He's more interested in the shadows the thrills the drama the lurking killers swelling music lusty confrontations and blood splatters. And the plot points get lost somewhere in the mix. So who can blame us for glazing over when Hartnett finally starts to care about the mysteries rather than just being mystified by them? De Palma has painted such an odd exciting picture even when it turns to camp that the audience would rather keep watching the elaborate setups than sit through the convoluted solutions. But then again what good is a joke without a satisfying punch line?".

I'm not a huge Ashton fan but I do think he is funny and this was probably the best movie I've seen out of the ones I've seen him in. Same with Brittany Murphy although I really haven't seen much of her stuff.

Because there are enough laughs to keep it going  especially in the first half of the film. And the two leads are likable enough. It has to be said that both look terrific and Kutcher in particular has developed a very nice style in physical comedy.The problem with all these kind of movies for me is that they tend to drag a bit as they reach the 1hour mark and then you're sort of waiting for it to end. This is certainly the case here. But if you like to see goodlooking people in reasonably funny romantic situations you can do a lot worse than this one.".

Mixup at the rental agency in terms of cartransportation they end up with a lesser car ripped right off of the aforementioned PTA  Get stuck in snow PTA again! And so on and so forth...Some of the gags are too crude and shouldn't be included  the pathetic joke about the vibrator as a honeymoon present is unnecessary. Sticking it into the wrong electrical current outlet is a good payoff but I was expecting it to be handled funnier. It's a bit anticlimactic.Overall this is an embarrassing situation comedy where lots and lots of bad stuff happens to people minding their own business. It's kind of like Meet the Parents  events continually spiralling out of control bad luck for good people  but not as funny or welldeveloped. The characters are likable which helps out a lot. The direction isn't as bad as I expected.But the script could have used polishing and the whole premise has been dealt with before. As a means of simple 90minute entertainment you could do a lot lot worse trust me!. But I'm just hoping they don't make another one.

The trip turns out to be terrible as all these accidents start happening to them. Will they able to overcome these obstacles and stay married? The plot is pretty generic as there's really nothing new about it. Films like Just Married can sometimes be really funny while other times they can be bad. Just Married falls somewhere in between. While there are some funny moments there are also a lot of yawns. Ashton Kutcher stars as Tom and he does a good job. He usually plays the same character but does it well. Brittany Murphy plays Sarah and does a good job. She is a really good actress and one day will be a huge star. The material she is given in this film just isn't very good. Christian Kane plays the exboyfriend of Sarah and he is trying to get her back. He is an okay actor nothing special though. Shawn Levy directs and does an average job. Just Married is the type of comedy you would expect out of January which is average and forgettable. The film is only 95 minutes long which means it isn't too much of a pain to watch. The movie does drag sometimes though and so it feels like its longer then it really is. There are no memorable scenes or lines as you have already probably heard it and seen it before. There's really no reason to go and see Just Married. The stars didn't benefit from it nor were they affected from it in a bad way. In a few years most people will forget they have seen it. So there's no harm in watching but there are better comedies out there. Rating 5.310 a soso comedy that's really not worth watching.".

I think that they are amateur actors. They have a hard time acting. And that's why it came so natural in the film. That's how they really are. I'm glad I just decided to sit down and watch the movie.

But it seems to me that a lot of the people who hated this movie didn't put their guards down. I have the same problem to sometimes. I don't like Ashton or Britney. I think that they are amateur actors. They have a hard time acting. And that's why it came so natural in the film. That's how they really are. I'm glad I just decided to sit down and watch the movie. Let go and watch it. It has it's very funny moments. As for the 5.0 I can let go. Some films it just takes time I guess.910";

	schema:reviewBody "A perfect wedding is a concept that is often fantasized.  Women can envision the perfect cake the perfect dress and their perfect man waiting for them at the alter.  Men envision their perfect beautiful bride and lifetime of happiness.  But neither person ever seems to think of the possibilities of what can go wrong in a marriage especially right off the bat at the honeymoon.  Romantic comedies often deliver the fantasy of flawless courtships that lead to flawless relationships.  Just Married presents a different formula by showing the possible faults and blunders that may and in some cases will happen on the 'perfect honeymoon. Just Married is the story of the romance between Tom Leezak Ashton Kutcher and Sarah McNerney Brittany Murphy.  Tom the graveyard shift traffic announcer on KNR radio is just an average Joe.  A recent college graduate who lives at a beach loft with his best friend and thinks the finer things in life include anything with ESPN.  Sarah is on the opposite side of the looking glass.  The daughter of the wealthy owner of the Los Angeles sporting teams Sarah is accustomed to having the luxuries of life.  But in Tom she sees a different cut from the runofthemill aristocrats she has dated and the two are soon married.  But on their European honeymoon the couple immediately begins to experience problems.  From difficulties with a European outlet to questions with marital fidelity the newlyweds soon ponder the question that everyone has been asking 'Are they too young to be married'?Just Married is a very enjoyable collaboration between director Shawn Levy Big Fat Liar and screenwriter Sam Harper Rookie of the Year.  Levy's skill behind the camera is key in bringing comedic success to the movies many pratfalls and hits.  One such usage is of a split screen as Tom and Sarah attempt to consummate their marriage on the airplane.  Harper's script while at times seems comically generic is careful not to overrun gags.  Harper also creates humorous dialogue between Tom and Sarah by implementing speeches that only man like Tom would consider on his honeymoon I.E. does the hotel have satellite television and why doesn't the French hotel have signs in English. Harper's contrasting characters are brought to life by the outlandish slapstick of Ashton Kutcher and the sweetness of Brittany Murphy.  Kutcher's antics establish the mentality and character of Leezak and display Kutcher's potential to be a rising star in the industry.  But Kutcher does not merely rely on his comedic behavior in the film.  Kutcher also shows that despite Tom's ignorance he truly loves his new wife and would do anything to make her happy.  Murphy is equally good in her role as Sarah.  Despite Sarah's prosperous upbringing Murphy plays the character as a person very down to earth where wealth has not spoiled her.  She is neither cruel nor snobbish and the audience can feel the genuine love she has for her husband. Audiences will be able to sympathize with Murphy when she experiences heartache and fall in love with her when she readily forgives her husbands behavior.Just Married is a wonderfully surprising romantic comedy.  It differs from the usual loveydovey recipe and adds more outrageous events that may occur in a courtship and marriage.  Kutcher and Murphy make a superb comedic team and do the film justice with their performances.  Although Kutcher is known for his roles as a dimwitted male he adds to his character by adding loyalty and love.  Murphy is also great as the contrasting better half. Despite the films silliness it does deliver a final message of love and devotion that makes the movie appeal to the male and female audience.  Movie lovers of comedy will not be disappointed nor will the romantics.  Like a perfect marriage Just Married is equally balanced.".

I know Ashton's pale but why do they have so much pancake makeup on him.  It takes away from the film because I wasn't paying attention to what was said but more to the clown makeup on Ashton.Now to the story. Well there isn't much to say except it was predictable and not that funny.  It reminded me of National Lampoon's European vacation except not as good.  Two newlyweds go to Europe only to have mishap after mishap happen.  The honeymoon turns into a disaster.  The very small yellow car was funny as well as the roaches. And I did like some of the songs in the film.FINAL VERDICT  If you are a big fan of Ashton or Brittany then you will probably want to see this.  Otherwise I wouldn't watch it because there are better teen comedies out there.".

The acting is fine but overdone much of the timeseemingly more the result of the writing and direction than the work of the actors. The characters are neither likable nor realistic. They seem stereotyped and onenote in spite of attempts at fleshing them out. Kutcher and Murphy have both given in good performances and been in good films but here... well at least they have fairly good onscreen chemistry. The humor mostly consists of mishaps usually involving pain with the occasional awkward andor embarrassing situation. No observations no wit no clever references. Just unpleasant scenes. The pacing is OK. As clichd as it was I must admit that I liked the endingformulaic and predictable as it may be. However by then it was much too late. A film that's just annoying and not at all funny this is one you should not spend time on unless you're into the Adam Sandler type humor of pain and embarrassment being funny. I recommend this to fans of Sandler and his type of comedy. Everyone else should most likely just steer clear. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "This film looked so insulting just from the trailers. By insulting I mean that the jokes used were the same rehashed crap that is always used in these simple romantic comedies. Naturally some people find it quite amusing each to hisher own I guess. Well the film itself really isn't too bad but quite frankly it isn't anything really that good either. It stars Ashton Kutcher who's credits include Dude Where's My Car and he will be appearing in the sequel to that film Seriously Dude Where's My Car which is due out in 2004. Among Ashton's many other talents he's one of the main characters on Fox's hit television sitcom That 70s Show. It's really a shame this guy wastes his time on such stupid roles at least in motion pictures because he has some real talent. Brittany Murphy also stars in Just Married. You may remember her from 8 Mile Riding In Cars With Boys Don't Say A Word and Summer Catch. She is a very talented actress and it seems that her career is far exceeding her reallife husband Ashton Kutcher. No offense to Aston but the guy needs to get off of his ass and do something good for a change. He has definite talent and he wastes himself on such pitiful roles. Sometimes movies like Just Married or Dude Where's My Car can be quite fun to watch. But that just wasn't the case with either of these films. Just Married is based on a simple premise for a film that has been seen many times before. Not to mention that the jokes for the most part are mostly simple and provided nothing more than a simple chuckle at times.As I stated above the story is simple. Two people meet by chance from opposite sides of the tracks and they fall in love. She's from a rich family. He's from a middle class home. Naturally her family doesn't want her to marry him because they've always dreamed of the better guy with enough cash in his wallet to retire at the ripe old age of thirtyfive. But this just won't due for the love hungry girl so she excepts the proposal of her middleclass boyfriend. They get married and go on a honeymoon in Europe but as nature intended everything goes wrong. From a really small compact car nearly burning down and destroying whatever hotel they are in and even ending up in jail this pair just can't seem to get things to work in their favor. They figure they better call it quits before it gets to late. But love is in their hearts and after all all you need is love. Every love has it's good days and bad days. So they give it another chance. All's well that ends well. The director of Just Married is a man named Shawn Levy who has given us such masterpiece films as Big Fat Liar and two other barely memorable theatrical films from 1997 entitled Just In Time and Address Unknown. Not to mention he's worked on such great television series' as Lassie 1997 and The Secret World of Alex Mack 1994. Okay okay. Perhaps I'm being too hard on this film. Just Married did give a few cute moments that made me giggle. But overall it's every bit as disappointing as it promised to be based on the trailers. Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy are great actors. And you know what I hope Ashton does keep making comedies because the guy is just naturally funny. But for the love of Pete at least make a film that is actually funny. ".

What's not to like?I saw it again and paid more attention to some of the finer details realizing what a rich full textured film it was.And yet again I saw it. Still more revelations.In fact every time I see it and I'm sure to see it again I enjoy it more and more with each subsequent viewing.This film's narrative is nearly as perfect as the Hula Hoop itself despite the albeit fictional account of the invention of said dingus.But it strikes me as odd and unfortunate when I encounter someone who's seen this and not enjoyed it.All I can say is have you tried it more than once? It isn't exactly what I'd call an acquired taste but when you see how rich in detail and humour it is you may begin to appreciate it for what it truly is a great film that deserves a second chance.

What's not to like?I saw it again and paid more attention to some of the finer details realizing what a rich full textured film it was.And yet again I saw it. Still more revelations.In fact every time I see it and I'm sure to see it again I enjoy it more and more with each subsequent viewing.This film's narrative is nearly as perfect as the Hula Hoop itself despite the albeit fictional account of the invention of said dingus.But it strikes me as odd and unfortunate when I encounter someone who's seen this and not enjoyed it.All I can say is have you tried it more than once? It isn't exactly what I'd call an acquired taste but when you see how rich in detail and humour it is you may begin to appreciate it for what it truly is a great film that deserves a second chance.

The film is so engaging and whacky that many unfamiliar with the Coen's style may be turned away by it. However the Coens are filmmakers who know what they are doing and this film is a perfect blend of reality and surrealism. Reminiscent of a classic movie from the 40s or 50s The Hudsucker Proxy has an atmosphere and look to it that we seldom see anymore. Part of this is due to the fabulous set design and costumes. But also the Coens' direction and dialogue are top notch. One particular scene near the beginning of the movie so don't worry about spoilers concerning a newspaper a coffee cup and a heavy wind fills you with magical glee and perfectly sets the scene of this fantastic fairytalelike fable. Some may be disappointed by the ending but on close inspection it is a brilliant metaphor in a film that says so much about success failure and how people cope with both. Paul Newman Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh are superb and are backed up by a cast that all gleam with their own wonderful persona including Steve Buscemi sadly not in it enough Bruce Campbell John Mahoney and Charles Durning. So If you want to see a film that will fascinate you make you laugh and fill you with that magical joy that only the Coen Bros. can supply then The Hudsucker Proxy is the film for you.".

Bruce is his same old self. he has a presence and is great in the few scenes he's in.Tim Robbins is wonderfully cast as the lead in this role.The elevator operator lent a wonderful character to the movie.The two Cab drivers in the Caf who perform the I got gas Bromo commercial type bit were great narrating Norville's encounter with Amy.The guy in the News room creating the Crossword puzzle with a Scrabble set asking people questions for clues.

I will come back on those quirks later.I love the way the Coens always combine highbrow subtlety with  lowbrow slapstick which makes it so accessible.  This movie is not heavy on subtlety but there are some genius moments in it to make it watchable again and again.  Newman for one is great in this movie and having the best of times. He makes minimal acting an artform.  Really he could act anyone of that screen with his eyes closed.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is a contrast with her hand wavingher Katherine Hepburn affectedballsy way of speaking and general overacting but I guess she sets the scene quite brilliantly to complement the decor and general 30's feel of the movie.  You see apparently the Coens have a penchant for the 30's movies styleand so they should.. Many a great movie was made in that decade but the story in which an imbecile's dingus against all odds became a total Fad and all the rage doesn't quite fit that decade.  I can't think of any Dingus which became all the rage in the thirties life was too hard for thingamabobs then I suppose and the earliest example the hoolahoop was definately a brainchild of the 50's Life was good and spendable income to buy doodahs was more readily available .  I don't mind that at all but I was confused to find out that it was set in the 50's because of all the visual and audible references to the 30's.  If Mussburgers office wasn't an artdeco Lovefest that clock!I don't know what is.I guess this review is definitely style over content but you know what? That just doesn't matter because plot is secondary to the visuals and dialogue in this movie.  And that is just alright by me.  It is the reason why these movies are so good for repeat viewings.  Once you know a plot you are not likely to watch it again just for the plot's sake.  It is the sights the sounds the dialogue that makes you want to watch a movie again and again. Oh you don't believe me?  Name your favourite movie not the one you tell your friends is your favourite but the one you watch again and again. What makes you want to watch it repeatedly?  Is it because you want to know what happens for the 100th time?  Ofcourse not!  You want to watch it for the 100th time because of the dialogue the fun the special effects the object of your desire etc. etc...Now I am not saying that plot is not important but I am saying that what makes Coen Brother's movies so good is that they think about their vieweraudience who wants to watch their movies until they can repeat every line in the movieand becoming sad anoraks in the process.  I actually know people who watched the Big Lebowski half way and walked out of the cinema only to find them Lebowski addicts after one more viewing.  I am not naming names but you know who you are...I liked this movie the first time round... I know I will love it later...Now for the Coen parallels between this movie and the Big LebowskiJennifer's way of speaking was similar to Julianne's Maud. They were both feisty Brunettes who fall for the main characterI wouldn't call 'em heroesThe voice over to remind us that it is a fairytale at the beginning and end by guardianangeltypes. Sam Elliot in Big and Bill Cobbs in the Hudsucker Bizarre Dance Dream Sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but are hugely enjoyable. Blond Bombshell AnnaNicole Smith in Hudsucker and Tara Reid in the Big LebowskiWho want to seduce the hero. Steve Buscemi. Memorable Lines...So all in all I guess I recommend it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a massive fan of the Coen Brothers Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski being two of my all time favourite films.  As such when I got round to watching The Hudsucker Proxy on video is was expecting it to be a well made film if not quite up to the heights of those other films considering its poor box office.Having seen the film I was delighted to admit that I and most of the filmgoing public were spectacularly wrong.  To put it simply The Hudsucker Proxy is an exceptional movie and even stands out in relation to the other Coen Brothers' films.  There's just so much to like in this film.  Tim Robbins' performance is great as is Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Paul Newman is also a stand out.However these performances would be for nothing if it wasn't for the marvellous script witness the boardroom scenes in which the directors discuss how many floors it was that Mr Hudsucker fell not including the mezzanine or the scene in which they interrogate Norville about his new invention.  The script is also responsible for the fantastic line Y'know for kids! which means nothing if you haven't seen the movie but now always makes me laugh whenever I think of it.A few days after seeing this I also saw Fargo on video.  What I find difficult to believe is that Fargo won Oscars and was highly popular while The Hudsucker Proxy passed by relatively unnoticed personally I think Fargo is one of the weaker Coen Brothers' films.  If you're put off by the fact that you've never heard of The Hudsucker Proxy don't be.  This is an absolutely fantastic film and I can't stress enough how much I would recommend it.  If you see a copy buy it.  This is film making at its finest.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm a massive fan of the Coen Brothers Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski being two of my all time favourite films.  As such when I got round to watching The Hudsucker Proxy on video is was expecting it to be a well made film if not quite up to the heights of those other films considering its poor box office.Having seen the film I was delighted to admit that I and most of the filmgoing public were spectacularly wrong.  To put it simply The Hudsucker Proxy is an exceptional movie and even stands out in relation to the other Coen Brothers' films.  There's just so much to like in this film.  Tim Robbins' performance is great as is Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Paul Newman is also a stand out.However these performances would be for nothing if it wasn't for the marvellous script witness the boardroom scenes in which the directors discuss how many floors it was that Mr Hudsucker fell not including the mezzanine or the scene in which they interrogate Norville about his new invention.  The script is also responsible for the fantastic line Y'know for kids! which means nothing if you haven't seen the movie but now always makes me laugh whenever I think of it.A few days after seeing this I also saw Fargo on video.

Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is labored. She tries to squeeze every last snicker she can with her character. She misses the mark in my opinion moving and talking with so much effort and pace  just to get a laugh  that in the end she gets none.Paul Newman goes the other way  he understates his character and when contrasted to the lunacy of both the environment and the story around him  it makes for some great scenes. He makes a great villain in this movie  and for me he's a large reason why the movie works.Tim Robbins does a good job especially at the start of the film. His best moments come when the story and the environment overwhelm his character.There's great moments like the ridiculous Muncie fight song the Monty Pythonesque mail room Charles Durning with wings and the grim faceless board members  with their inane questions and so frightened to lose their authority that they agree to virtually anything.This film isn't genius or anything but if you enjoyed the antics of something like 'Arsenic and Old Lace' then this is worth catching. It's delightfully silly  and has some interesting visuals and symbolism along the way.".

Its like a crossword puzzle that dances through your memory by teasing you with clues that you use to assemble a preengineered interlocking marvel.I believe a Coen project has three elements and they build it that way. They begin with a major problem in narrative. These are well known most have to do with the identity of the narrator specifically names or roles. For this film it is the fated role for Lebowski' the name for Man who Wasn't' it is recognition in Brother' we had fate again but this time targeted on opportunity rather than vehicle for narration.The second element is the selection of the cinematic cloak to wear. I believe this is wholly unrelated to the first in fact the arbitrariness is part of the fun. In Man' it was noir Brother' adopted the indigenous narrative song which led to both Homer and Teebone Burnette here it is screwball. And not just today's screwball. When these guys mine they go to the source lode and in this case it is Capra. In fact I believe they started with Capra's original screwball It Happened One Night.' There the man is a fasttalking news reporter who attaches himself to a popular phenomenon as a personality. The woman is successful in terms of being rich anyway and she masquerades as a regular' girl. Turn that inside out and you get the outline for this. Add some other Capraisms and the gods in the machines and this is what comes out.Oh and the third element pure cinematic experience. Visual metaphors extreme images manifold quoting almost distractingly detailed sets. Here all the actors support these three elements and that is the marvel of Coen projects. Many other films really do believe that the story and the quality' of the actors in making it real somehow carries power. This is much better being rooted in intelligent inquiry and love of visual imagination.Robbins and Newman support this type of acting well. They have done so before. But there is always one actor at least that the Coens use as the white space the actor that only knows about one dimension of the project. Here that is Ms Leigh. Even though she is being goofed on she does the best work of her career.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

Blood Simple Raising Arizona and Barton Fink all displayed an energy and panache that had been missing from American film since the early seventies. The Hudsucker Proxy followed and it was the brothers most ambitious film to date. Steeped in fifties nostalgia the film deals with corporate greed and the invention and success of the Hula Hoop. Norville Barnes Tim Robbins looking very much like Dagwood Bumstead is in search of a job in the big city. Optimistic and filled with idealism he gets in on the ground floor of a big company and rises quickly only to be used as a pawn by a scheming board chairman Sidney Mussburger Mr. Dithers?. Instead he turns the tables and makes the company millions with his invention. Enter a female reporter who attempts to expose the company's duplicity but instead falls in love with Barnes while Chairman Mussburger plots revenge. Proxy's first hour is filled with typical Coen imagery and fine tailored editing. A boardroom suicide is grand theatre and a montage of the Hula Hoop's accidental success is masterful. But once achieved Hudsucker becomes sluggish and uninteresting. Robbins' transition from the mail room flunky to board room tyrant is unconvincing while Paul Newman as Mussburger is too healthy looking an octenagerian whose passion in life is all consuming greed and power. Jennifer Jason Leigh is downright grating lost somewhere between doing Hildy Johnson and her version of Dorothy Parker. The film is Capraesque shades of John Doe mixed with Wonderful Life and that's a bad fit for the acerbic dark comedies the Coen's excel at. Visually Hudsucker is a good looking film but like the Hula Hoop in 59 it fades fast.".

Though like Fink The Hudsucker Proxy has its roots in old Hollywood it's a different old Hollywood that of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges.One of the first scenes is perhaps the most stunning  it takes place at a boardroom table and that's all I'll say. To get on with the story After the death of Waring Hudsucker Charles Durning a nobody from the mailroom Norville Barnes Robbins is chosen by the second in command Mussburger Paul Newman to become President of this huge corporation Hudsucker. Why? Well it was Hudsucker's wish that the company go public. Mussburger figures if he can drive down the stock price he and the board can afford to buy 51 and retain control. Thus the lowly Barnes who walks around with a piece of scrap paper that has a circle on it. It's his invention  you know for kids. A reporter Jennifer Jason Leigh realizes what Mussburger is up to and gets into the company as Norville's secretary. Poor Norville wonders who's trashing him in the press. Meanwhile he goes to work on his invention.The sets in this film are huge to emphasize the smallness of anyone who works at Hudsucker. The company is a slight exaggeration over a normal company  only slight  your pay is docked for just about everything including a moment of silence for the late Hudsucker and there are some things that are sacrosanct  like a blue letter. That's so important that when one secretary sees it in Norville's hand she screams. The most obvious thing in the company is an enormous clock  an homage perhaps to The Big Clock and it figures into the story.The acting in The Hudsucker Proxy is good if a bit frantic probably another homage to early fasttalking films like The Front Page. The film is set in 1958 but the style is more '30s and '40s particularly in the performance of Jannifer Jason Leigh who does a Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday and sounds at times like Katharine Hepburn.The Coens manage to throw everything at The Hudsucker Proxy from old movies including an angel so it will keep film buffs pretty busy. There are some hilarious scenes and the result is overall a fantastic movie with some great people including the abovementioned and Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney. Great fun. And make sure you get a double stitch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any audiences familiar with the work of oddball geniuses Joel and Ethan Coen could hardly have expected their latest labour of love excitedly billed as this time it's a comedy! to be conventional or play to expectations but in 1994 the Coens were greeted with their first box office flop scorned by baffled critics and audiences alike. Upon retrospect it becomes clear that due to faulty advertising or otherwise audiences were simply not approaching The Hudsucker Proxy from the right angle perhaps expecting a less subversive more straightforward laughfest. And while the film in question is often hysterical its sole intent is not to make people laugh  The Hudsucker Proxy exemplifies the Coen brothers' tendency towards judiciously applied weirdness in the midst of profundity but with a more channelled focus the final product being a sidesplitting occasionally frustrating but consistently remarkable film easily one of the strongest in the Coens' consistently impressive body of work. Almost as much a throwback to classic science fiction as the period screwball comedies it emulates the Coens take influence both visually and thematically from the dystopian visions of Fritz Lang's Metropolis Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times the film's most obvious influence and Terry Gilliam's Brazil as the monstrosity that is Hudsucker industries grinds its dank perpetually moving gears to the same nihilistic grind of the capitalist machine its continual churning in and spitting out of new ideas proving a snidely introspective jab at the nature of the film industry itself. The utterly brilliant screenplay written by the Coens and fellow quirky genius Sam Raimi proves a superb send up of the ludicrously fast paced flurry of the business world as moments of sublime silliness and slapstick comedy are juxtaposed with cutting social commentary without ever slowing the movie's continual breakneck pace. The screwball influenced dialogue exchanges and clever one liners are contemporary classics the continual banter between Hudsucker executives or coffee shop patrons narrating the romantic encounter between Barnes and Archer are hysterical the film making its mark as one of the Coen's most consistently hilarious films but also one of their most shrewdly intelligent in the midst of all of the trademark oddities and wit. The film's saccharine ending is the most obvious source of contention borrowing unapologetically from It's a Wonderful Life and while the sudden shift into Capraesq soaring jubilancy does feel distinctly out of synch with the tone of the rest of the picture its ironically wholesome feel does seem oddly subversive enough to merit debate over its quality. However much of an oddity the ending may seem its inclusion can hardly be considered a creative misfire in such a uniformly whip smart work and while viewers unwilling to supply their own justification or meaning for its inclusion may become frustrated with the jarring change in tone the unexpected finale does shake up the film with a dose of irreverent cheerfulness much in the same way Barnes' influence is shown to be a blessing to the cold efficiency of Hudsucker Industries. Either way Carter Burwell's music boosts the film's quality like none other not a single note failing to perfectly encapsulate the mood of the scene whether an operatic grandeur complimenting a faux dramatic sequence showing the arrival of a blue letter straight to the boss very important or a plucky string orchestration keeping with the lighter more irreverent tone of subsequent scenes. Similarly Roger Deakins' pitch perfect cinematography as usual effortlessly blends the classically stylish with quirky innovations making for a consistently visually sumptuous work. Similarly the film's 1950s costumes props and locations are similarly laudable and Gilliam influenced blending period realism with fantastic dystopian touches leading to an impressively envisioned outcome.Tim Robbins gives a delightfully madcap performance as Norville Barnes the earnest corporate cog consistently bewildered through his struggle to keep up with the inexhaustible machine he has found himself swept up by. Robbins perfectly essays the spirit of the film always silly and irreverent enough to raise a laugh but with just enough pathos to incur moments of thoughtful reflection when necessary  a masterful comedic feat. Paul Newman is an instant classic as Sidney J. Mussburger the gravely voiced machiavellian corporate shark willing to dispose of any possible obstacle human or otherwise. Newman launches himself into the role with a particular shameless vindictive glee and few boss from hell performances have proved so hysterically memorable or enjoyable. Jennifer Jason Leigh is flooring as an ambitious reporter attempting to get the goods on Barnes  her continual machine gun delivery of lines rattling off at breakneck speed without missing a beat is jaw dropping while she also fills the character with exactly the right quantity of muted warmth. John Mahoney similarly raises many a laugh as Leigh's newspaper's fast talking editor willing to do anything for a splashy headline and Charles Durning is consistently hilarious given his moments to shine as Waring Hudsucker whose suicide incites Barnes' promotion to president. Bruce Campbell is also a wonderful presence as a sleazy reporter his tremendous charisma making the most out of a tiny role as does Steve Buscemi in an amusing cameo as a beatnik bartender.Deliriously funny quirkily chaotic but always with a firm sense of directorial intent and control The Hudsucker Proxy proves one of the Coen brothers' most inventive subversive and stylistically enjoyable feats. While the final act will inevitably divide audiences the sheer volume of innovation and coy blending of influences on display is enough to cheerfully carry the film through its few such storyline quivers. For any fans of the Coens the film should be considered a must see and for anyone unfamiliar with their eclectic body of work but seeking an offbeat intelligent and masterfully crafted comedy such a gem of a film should prove just the thing  you know for kids!. 910".

I think I'm a pretty smart guy but I submit that a monkey sitting at a keyboard could type out a manuscript for Hamlet in its entirety before I could ever come up with a movie as good as this one.  esh.  The extent  limitations of my talents compared to that of the Coens or anyone else for that matter quite frankly depress me.The video box for this movie should have consisted of plain brown paper instead of what it does consist of.  The cover gives away the significance of the circle with which Robbins' character is obsessed for the first hour or so of the movie.  When I rented it I either didn't notice before I took it from the shelf or I merely forgot after I left the store what was on the cover of the box.  This turned out to be a blessing because it was all such good fun trying to figger out why Robbins was so obsessed with it! The casting was as is typical of the Coens' movies superb.  Having Robbins play the role of Norville Barnes would not have occurred to me. However he pulls it off magnificently.  I guess this is why I'm counting beans here in Winnipeg Canada instead of making my mark on Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh's Amy Archer is wonderful.  Her accentdialect is perhaps somewhat exaggerated but nonetheless enjoyable.  The Pulitzer Prize scene is a standout in my opinion.  Paul Newman plays the role of the nefarious Sidney Mussburger with a twinkle in his eye  his tongue in his cheek.  We get the feeling that he is quite aware of the camera but unlike Mel Gibson who is also always aware of the camera Newman is still convincing.  The movie would have been much worse off without him. The They dock ya! scene near the beginning of the movie is great. Robbins plays it for all it's worth.  Simply brilliant.  The scene wherein the steel ball stops in motion is also brilliant in its simplicity  effective in its portent.  I swear only the Coens could conceive of it. And the preceding scene with the water bottle  trash can fire pays homage to Marx Brothers slapstick again Newman  Robbins are superb.  I howled with laughter. The Hudsucker Proxy is devoid of sex profanity drugs car chases  explosions.  Definitely NOT mainstream Hollywood.  It has a kindof Gotham City feel to it a la Batman.  IMDb indicates its genre to be ComedyRomanceFantasy.  I think this while not important is misleading. The element of romance is weak.  And to suggest that it is fantasy is dubious because most of what happens in the movie is plausible except for a few scenes. Roger was in this scribe's opinion a little too harsh on it He gives it only two stars.  Yet he says This is the bestlooking movie I've seen in years a feast for the eyes and the imagination.  The art direction and set design are breathtaking recreating the world of 1930s screwball comedy in which towering skyscrapers and vast boardrooms were the playing fields for the ambitions of corrupt executives ambitious kids unsung geniuses and lady newspaper reporters with nails as sharp as their wisecracks.  Huh? That hardly sounds like the preamble to a twostar movie review.  I think he should watch it again maybe when he's in a better mood. What more could you expect from a comedyfaux drama?!  The only present I wanted for Christmas '02 was The Hudsucker Proxy on DVD  my girlfriend had to search high  low in my home town to find it but find it she did. It's amazing the st you can find on DVD these days.  But trying to find a modern masterpiece is a crap shoot.  It makes you wonder about how fickle the consumer is  how unimaginative some movie studio executives are. This movie is crammed with pearls  I could go on  on describing the smorgasbord of wonderful scenes in this movie.  Just rent it  learn for yourself what a great movie this is.  I suggest that you won't be disappointed.  Then eat your heart out in contemplation of how most mere mortals can only marvel at the handiwork of the brilliant Coen brothers.".

The only present I wanted for Christmas '02 was The Hudsucker Proxy on DVD  my girlfriend had to search high  low in my home town to find it but find it she did. It's amazing the st you can find on DVD these days.  But trying to find a modern masterpiece is a crap shoot.  It makes you wonder about how fickle the consumer is  how unimaginative some movie studio executives are. This movie is crammed with pearls  I could go on  on describing the smorgasbord of wonderful scenes in this movie.  Just rent it  learn for yourself what a great movie this is.  I suggest that you won't be disappointed.  Then eat your heart out in contemplation of how most mere mortals can only marvel at the handiwork of the brilliant Coen brothers.";

I've wanted to see this movie for years and seized the opportunity the other day when I found it at a movie lover's video store Scarecrow Video Seattle WA in PAL format. This required me to rent a machine that converts the PAL signal and as I paid the 800 deposit to the store clerk for said machine I joked This better be worth the wait and the deposit.The success of the comedy in Schtonk! is due to the fact that it is based in fact. If it weren't for this being an actual event in German history the ludicrous story would seem just too stupid to be funny. The idiocy of the characters actions is of course embellished which is why the movie is so good. The magazine reporter desperate for a scandalous scoop is brilliantly played like a man who wants the big story so bad he will believe anything. And he does. Once he stumbles on to the Hitler diaries he and the rest of the press can't get enough. This movie obviously works on several levels some of which I don't quite appreciate being I am not German but one universal statement is that of the press having the role of gatekeeper the ability to decide what is a story and the consequences when that ability is misused.I've seen Uwe Ochsenknecht in a couple of Doris Drrie movies and found him to be a talented comedic actor. His portrayal of the diaries forger is one more great performance. The farcical telling of his role in the hoax serves as a vital display of how absurd and fascinating a story this con was. Such details as his reasoning for using the initials F.H. and his taking on the characteristics of Hitler the deeper he got into his work are hilarious subtleties that play an important part in the greater humor of the entire film. The story did seem to drag on in a couple places perhaps a little more editing could have been implemented but that won't deter me from recommending this fun satire or seeing it again and again myself. I've been looking forward to seeing Schtonk! for the last 12 years and now that I've seen it I can honestly say I am not disappointed.".

The acting especially Gtz George is awesome. It's one of those few movies that I can watch over and over again and still keel over with laughter at some scenes. Konstantin Wecker's score is one of the best I know and perfectly supports the plot. Based on the true case ! of masterforger Konrad Kujau who in 1983 fooled the renowned German magazine Stern by selling it his faked Hitler diaries for millions of Marks. Kujau was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison but was released after 3 years because of cancer. He became so famous through this affair that in 2006 faked Kujau fakes were sold on ebay. Against the backdrop of these true events Dietl develops his story of greedy men who bring out the worst in each other and who are going blind to an extend that it borders delusion. It's a straight 10 out of 10!".

Certainly successful in portraying the circumstances in which a forger could produce the notorious Hitler Diaries it happened in 1983 and not only German press but the press world wide walked into the trap the film shows that the yellow press and its sensationhungry reporters made use of the curious fascination of the public world wide with the Nazi past. as Harald Juhnke's character says to his chiefeditor  with Hitler we never had such a famous writer writing in our magazine ever before!.For Germany the most painful aspect of the film might be the support for the publication from former Nazis represented by a character played by Karl Schnbock 82 years old here! as a former intimate friend of Hitler he knows that the diaries are forged but gives full support the end justifies the means. One of the memorable scenes is the arrival of the guests at the rally of former Nazi's and supporters a memorable image when the guests walk to the house in the rain under their umbrellas illuminated by torches.The cast is very good with Gtz George and Uwe Ochsenknecht outstanding. Both have scenes that are side splitting funny George when he for the first time reads from the diaries and Ochsenknecht when he begins to think talk and look like Hitler. But as said the film is too long for its own good. There are more memorable scenes than the those I have mentioned already but for instance does the viewer really need to see all 60 diaries made? The use of the old song La Paloma in the scene on the boat is a nice idea but it also takes too long. And what to think of the first scene before and during the credits it does not add anything to the things to come and is not funny either.The for this film composed music itself is mediocre but the use of recordings of Zarah Leander and that of a small yodeltheme are very clever. All in all unbalanced at moments very amusing and certainly worth a view.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the Sternmagazine one of Germany's most influential leftistliberal mediums published Adolf Hitler's diaries in 1983 it had the same effect as if CNN would publish the secret sex emails of Abraham Lincoln the diaries were as blatantly fake as a three dollar bill. The magazine though still everpresent at German newsstands never regained its reputation entirely and the view if not trust that the public had of journalism and media would change forever. Most readers were simply outraged disappointed and only the most cynical eyes saw elements of unwanted and very 'brown' the German synonym for fascism humour.Director Helmut Dietl has picked up on this humour having created a farce that remains among the best ever produced in Germany a land not particularly famous internationally speaking for its comedies. It would have been easy for Dietl to poke fun at the Stern editors their greed corruption and arrogance that were revealed after the scandal but it would have been a cheap shot. Instead Dietl created a social commentary holding a slightly distorted mirror into the face of the viewer forcing them to laugh at their own faults follies and hypocrisy.The story is pretty much taken straight from the reallife events Masterfaker Fritz Knobel Uwe Ochsenknecht has an inspiration and after producing fake nude portraits of Eva Braun for aging Nazis by now disguised as historically interested businessmen fakes Hitler's diaries offering them to rundown and out of luck journalist Hermann Willi Gtz George. Willi haggles the diaries off as journalistic sensation to the editors of the newspaper HHpress Sternthinlydisguised. As the money rolls in tension builds in the minds of deceivers and those allowing themselves to be deceived for the sake of profit Knobel keeps producing more 'diaries' generally based on the authors own trivial daily life and general being flatulence and halitosis. Inevitably the scam get's exposed for what it is the media disgraced Knobel and Willi make off like bandits Knobel conning his way into Austria and Willi either having lost his reason completely or in for one final con feigning insanity hijacks the former yacht of Hermann Goering convinced that Hitler is alive and living in Argentina. And if you're not convinced that the Fuehrer is alive and well and living in Argentina then you haven't read enough conspiracy theories.Heart and soul of this film is the casting all the actors shine most of all George best known in his role of toughbutt cop Schimanski and German synonym for 'machismo' in the 80's plays a character to slimy the fragrance of sweat almost permeates the screen. Ochsenknecht's features speak volumes after seeing her in Schtonk! Christiane Hrbiger will forever be the a synonym as Naziniece and not to forget Harald Juhnke in his lifetime known as both Germany's Frank Sinatra and drunkard of the nation playing George's crooked photojournalist friend and in comparison one of the few voices of reasons in the film. Special credit should go to Ulrich Mhe whose song and dance during the final part remains one of the films highlights. And yes even Veronica Ferres who when performing the role of Anna Frank in theatre animated the audience to shout at the actors playing the Nazis she's hiding under the ceiling could not ruin this film.If one can blame something on a film it may be that essentially only has one joke which is the actual premise of the story itself and the triangle lovestory of Ochsenknecht Ferres and Dagmar Manzel that adds little to nothing to the film and seems rather pointless. Also if you're not familiar with German mentality social structure and historic background going back at least 70 years to a time which many Germans still don't want to talk to much about a lot of the inside jokes will escape you. The movie isn't as international accessible as for example Das Boot and if you're looking for a movie that will make you slap your leg every ten seconds Schtonk! isn't Airplane or a Bob Hope film. Rather it's a film that will make you smirk perhaps even at yourself.Interestingly the strange title of the movie isn't actually a German word unless you pronounce it like Stunk which means trouble or bickering since Charlie Chaplins The Great Dictator was never popular with German viewers. I leave it to the reader to figure out why but if the readers happen to be Polish or French let it be said no just like us Germans you didn't raised your right arm in protest either!".

And if you're not convinced that the Fuehrer is alive and well and living in Argentina then you haven't read enough conspiracy theories.Heart and soul of this film is the casting all the actors shine most of all George best known in his role of toughbutt cop Schimanski and German synonym for 'machismo' in the 80's plays a character to slimy the fragrance of sweat almost permeates the screen. Ochsenknecht's features speak volumes after seeing her in Schtonk! Christiane Hrbiger will forever be the a synonym as Naziniece and not to forget Harald Juhnke in his lifetime known as both Germany's Frank Sinatra and drunkard of the nation playing George's crooked photojournalist friend and in comparison one of the few voices of reasons in the film. Special credit should go to Ulrich Mhe whose song and dance during the final part remains one of the films highlights. And yes even Veronica Ferres who when performing the role of Anna Frank in theatre animated the audience to shout at the actors playing the Nazis she's hiding under the ceiling could not ruin this film.If one can blame something on a film it may be that essentially only has one joke which is the actual premise of the story itself and the triangle lovestory of Ochsenknecht Ferres and Dagmar Manzel that adds little to nothing to the film and seems rather pointless. Also if you're not familiar with German mentality social structure and historic background going back at least 70 years to a time which many Germans still don't want to talk to much about a lot of the inside jokes will escape you. The movie isn't as international accessible as for example Das Boot and if you're looking for a movie that will make you slap your leg every ten seconds Schtonk! isn't Airplane or a Bob Hope film. Rather it's a film that will make you smirk perhaps even at yourself.Interestingly the strange title of the movie isn't actually a German word unless you pronounce it like Stunk which means trouble or bickering since Charlie Chaplins The Great Dictator was never popular with German viewers. I leave it to the reader to figure out why but if the readers happen to be Polish or French let it be said no just like us Germans you didn't raised your right arm in protest either!";

The drama unfolds in a fast pace and is over before you know it. I think the dislikers expected a very much different approach to the theme e.g. the commentator who promoted the English version of this journalistic farce. I think it is simply not interesting enough to show that Trevor Roper was sorely misled. The whole point of this German movie is that it shows that the whole affair is largely due to the still present enormous awe of the person of Hitler and that not only in Germany ! The bizarre notion that history had to be rewritten with this discovery is of course nonsense which was believed by German journalists as well as foreign experts or should i say experts .

Such a disaster deserves a movie based upon it describing the creation the quotes and the medial attention to Hitler's diaries which later were discovered as a grotesque fake. And here we have it. In a small charming reference to the genius and timeless Charlie Chaplin satire we got a movie that is based on the famous fake of the 80s in which went out into the world. As it is a satire of the actual events the characters are a bit different than in real life. Maybe a few extra situations were included. But this makes it even more funny. This movie is starring some famous German actors e.g. Uwe Ochsenknecht Gtz George Ulrich Mhe Armin Rohde Harald Juhnke Veronika Ferres etc. And they all do a great performance in portraying their characters especially Ochsenknecht as the faker Fritz KnobelKonrad Kujau who looks more like Hitler himself during the process I write his handwriting better than my own and George as the journalist Hermann WilliGerd Heidemann who becomes more crazy about the diaries and everything about Hitler that he is willing to do everything just for a good story and is even willing to buy a bunch of burned book pages and underwear which is sold to him as the ash of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. And even hopes to find the real Hitler alive. The story is told with many actual details including the famous FH on the diary's cover instead of AH for Adolf Hitler also including the editors' ideas for the meaning of FH actual quotes the press conference with the diaries and many more.Another interesting fact is that this movie not only features a lot of music from the Third Reich the great Zarah Leander or related music Richard Wagner it also features people who were related to the Third Reich like Karl Schnbck who was in some Nazi Propaganda movies like in 1943's Titanic. Also Gtz George's father Heinrich was the biggest actor in the 30s and 40s starring in the biggest Nazi propaganda movies. Later I also saw the British TVseries Selling Hitler which is based on the same events but features the actual names of the real people and companies. It was also a very good one but it plays in a completely different league than Schtonk not only is it longer and gives a more detailed description of the events. But in this movie the directors were more concentrated on describing the story from the German site. So you can't compare these two at all. I can definitely recommend this movie. It's an entertaining and funny movie which can be seen again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Schtonk is a German movie that was released back in 1992 so it will have its 25th anniversary next year. The director is Helmut Dietl and he is also one of the pretty many writers that worked on the script here. This one was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar and won also many other glories during all kinds of awards ceremonies. If you look at the cast you will find so many known names if you have an interest in German cinema George Ochsenknecht Ferres Mhe Hrbiger Hoppe Manzel etc. All you have to do is check the cast list to see who else is in here. No surprise to anybody should be that this film also received major glories at the German Film Awards such as Best Picture but also lead actor for George. And as a result this is possibly the man's most known work today just because of all the awards recognition. But it is just one great George performance from a stellar body of work. I cannot deny I am a fan of his and his performance here is one reason why. I am not sure if I would call it his best but it's right up there with his finest.As for the other player some are solid some are not. The biggest letdown is once again not surprisingly at all Veronica Ferres who simply isn't a good actress and with somebody else in her role this could have been an even better film I think. It is still fairly decent though. It is about fake Hitler diaries and greedy ruthless authors and journalists who don't care about the truth as long as they become popular. A whole lot of this film is over the top but it still works somehow and George going pretty hammy at times is even not a problem at all I think. Overall I believe the late George and the late Dietl make it work. It is nothing you should watch if you are in for a historically accurate film but there are some pretty funny moments and this film will make you shake your head on more than just one occasion and with that I don't mean because the film is absurd or unrealistic it is intended that way for comedic purpose but exactly from a positive perspective about how good of a satire it is at times. Yet there are weak moments and weak performances not just Ferres but she stands out negatively that keep me from giving this an even higher rating and consider it one of the year's best. George elevates the material a lot and makes up for some of the weaker stuff performancewise too or for an occasional length not too many but it's not enough for greatness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even after seeing Szabo's Mephisto a couple of times it is still difficult to see through the actor Hoefgen played brilliantly by one of the best actors Klaus Maria Brandauer. Accompanying his rise to prominence the viewers come to face important questions about morality friendship leadership fame...At the beginning Hoefgen dislikes the upcoming and dangerous Nazi clique. Yet when he realizes that they are willing to give him the chance to become famous and respected signs of hesitation can be hardly found  he grasps the opportunity to be in Berlin and be a director of the National Theatre. I'am not interested in money he says however he has already sold his soul to the devil the Nazi party. Hoefgen has become the victim of his acclaimed theater character Mephisto. Mephisto of the real world offered him to win the crown of mankind as Hoefgen did in his theater role and the latter willingly accepted it. He closed his eyes to the beatings of the Jews he witnessed the expelling of his lover the escape of his wife the banning from theater of his friends etc.And yet has he become the reincarnation of evil the real Mephisto? I am inclined to think that Hoefgen had good intentions about his closest who opposed the system. This is shown by the fact that he insisted in front of the Nazi officials for his black lover to leave Nazi Germany safely and that his friend Ulrichs be rehabilitated. And he did it successfully. At that point comes the question whether Hoefgen made the right choice  should he have gone to the opposition and thus failed to save anyone or he did the right thing by accepting Mephisto's offer and becoming a man of certain influence which he used to save his closest? Then again do you close your eyes to the brutality around you as long as you and your friends are safe? A very interesting comparison can be made between the actor Miklas played by the Hungarian Cserhalmi and also seen in the Czech Oscarnominated production Zelary and other legendary films by the Hungarian directors Bela Tarr and Miklos Jancso and Hoefgen. The former is an ardent supporter of the Nazis at the beginning but later becomes disillusioned and chooses the opposition. Hoefgen on the other hand moves in the opposite way in the movie. From an opponent of the Nazi Mrderpakt murderous thugs as he calls them at the beginning he becomes a follower albeit no participant and goes as far as to betray Miklas and his plan to the Nazi officials resulting into Miklas' death. At the moment when Hoefgen learns about his death he refuses to believe he was murdered but instead insists it was a car accident. In the close up of Brandauer's face talking to the woman I believe the viewer can read regret in his eyes...Through both characters and mainly through Hoefgen Szabo raises the topic of the role of the intelligentsia in the Nazi rise to power. What were they supposed to do? The ones in the opposition either died or went into exile as Hoefgen's wife. The rest followed the Nazis willingly or not. In that age of hopelessness should one sell his soul to Mephisto as Hoefgen did  then rise to power and save whomever you can? Overall are we from our position nowadays able to judge how the intelligentsiathe actors should have acted? Mephisto has to be seen in the light of Szabo's life. It was recently revealed he was an informant for the Hungarian government in the 50's. In an interview he claimed to have saved himself and a friend of his from being gibbeted. Resemblance to Hoefgen...? The towering performance of Brandauer as Hoefgen is absolutely stunning. His face stature looks eyes everything fits perfectly into the image of the divided personality of the main character indicative of this personality is the Nazi general's inquiring why Hoefgen has such a soft handshake. Regarding the images there is hardly a viewer who can forget Mephisto's white face on Brandauer and the shots of Hoefgen's moments of madness estimation megalomania anger...Especially powerful is the last scene where Hoefgen is running and trying to hide from the giant searchlights of Olympiastadion in Berlin his curved almost crying face and saying Was wollt ihr von mir? Ich bin nur ein Schauspieler. What do you want from me? I'm just an actor........".

A very interesting comparison can be made between the actor Miklas played by the Hungarian Cserhalmi and also seen in the Czech Oscarnominated production Zelary and other legendary films by the Hungarian directors Bela Tarr and Miklos Jancso and Hoefgen. The former is an ardent supporter of the Nazis at the beginning but later becomes disillusioned and chooses the opposition. Hoefgen on the other hand moves in the opposite way in the movie. From an opponent of the Nazi Mrderpakt murderous thugs as he calls them at the beginning he becomes a follower albeit no participant and goes as far as to betray Miklas and his plan to the Nazi officials resulting into Miklas' death. At the moment when Hoefgen learns about his death he refuses to believe he was murdered but instead insists it was a car accident. In the close up of Brandauer's face talking to the woman I believe the viewer can read regret in his eyes...Through both characters and mainly through Hoefgen Szabo raises the topic of the role of the intelligentsia in the Nazi rise to power. What were they supposed to do? The ones in the opposition either died or went into exile as Hoefgen's wife. The rest followed the Nazis willingly or not. In that age of hopelessness should one sell his soul to Mephisto as Hoefgen did  then rise to power and save whomever you can? Overall are we from our position nowadays able to judge how the intelligentsiathe actors should have acted? Mephisto has to be seen in the light of Szabo's life. It was recently revealed he was an informant for the Hungarian government in the 50's. In an interview he claimed to have saved himself and a friend of his from being gibbeted. Resemblance to Hoefgen...? The towering performance of Brandauer as Hoefgen is absolutely stunning. His face stature looks eyes everything fits perfectly into the image of the divided personality of the main character indicative of this personality is the Nazi general's inquiring why Hoefgen has such a soft handshake. Regarding the images there is hardly a viewer who can forget Mephisto's white face on Brandauer and the shots of Hoefgen's moments of madness estimation megalomania anger...Especially powerful is the last scene where Hoefgen is running and trying to hide from the giant searchlights of Olympiastadion in Berlin his curved almost crying face and saying Was wollt ihr von mir? Ich bin nur ein Schauspieler. What do you want from me? I'm just an actor........";

Initially indifferent to the rise of the Nazis unable to accept that their government will change his life he follows them and befriends a highranked Nazi so that his art might continue.  But it can never be as it was before.  Yet he continues to do as he is told to use the theatre as a propaganda medium without questioning the consequences.He cannot admit to himself that he has made the wrong decision and even when he is in Paris and is presented with another opportunity to escape the Nazi regime he returns to Germany to the pursuit of his theatrical life no matter how restricted it is.Excellent film with a very good lead performance.".

But it's a good film because it's committed to clearly spin and align the different layers of self.The story is Faust both the film and the playwithin. Our film is about an actor who sells his soul for a gilded life on the stage the play is where he is Mephisto  not Faust  and tries to reason with his decision to be Faust and a third layer is about an era Nazi Germany in the early years that was also about a Faustian bargain and staged images of power. The protagonist is an actor from the German stage and plays one. It has a Hungarian filmmaker at the helm who knows probably too well the type of life from the Eastern Bloc.So this succeeds where Hollywood's Cabaret felt contrived and false because everyone is a step closer to the nervous soul of that world.Something is quite brilliantly handled here and I believe it's this one of the conceits of our actor a leftist in the early days is for a Peoples Theater that directly involves and agitates into action. Of course that's all gone when the Nazis come into power with their Wagnerian notions on the ideal and the pure. He has to do Hamlet the ambition however is still the same a play that involves the audience but in this environment seems ludicrous and hypocritical. It's a statesponsored event after all. Now we see several excerpts of Faust and more shots of our man backstage in pale Mephisto makeup acting the role in real life but we never see Hamlet. We never see just how he intended this Peoples Theater. We skip to the curtain call and rapturous audience applause.But of course the main thrust of the film is that of a man and later society that simply doesn't know where the stage ends and life begins. His way of involving the people in a broad sense is acting out in this world that is all about posturing and pretending but doing so in a way that actually saves lives.The man can thrive in this world because the world has shifted to align with what he was all along. He doesn't become true the world becomes as false as he is. It's the stage and lights that shift so when the narrative planes align for us we understand that all along he was a decent human being. The chilling finale has him on that stage that is the yawning void where the machinery of self is decided. Just who controls the lights that he acts to?".

What does he have to learn on this journey to the great capital and a great career? Some say compromise others humiliation. If the latter exaggerate it's going to be the compromise that will lead to something Hendrik would probably never want nor expect...MEPHISTO directed by Istvan Szabo is a movie based on true events from the life of Gustav Grundgens 18991963 and based on the novel by Klaus Mann. Therefore we could say that it is partly a biopic. Yet this view would lead to confusion and misinterpretation. MEPHISTO is foremost a film about a life in a particular situation about decisions one has to make about burden one has to carry about misunderstanding one has to prepare for and about treason one has to cope with. Hendrik Hoefgen Klaus Maria Brandauer appears to be a very complicated person he wants to do something powerful yet he is haunted by insecurity and fear that lie within his four walls of the psyche. As a result he wears a symbolic mask among people. The role of his life is Mephisto which he portrays twice. However he does not expect that this second time in order the portrayal to be accepted he will have to adjust it. Moreover what he never foresees is that he will also have to adjust his entire life and career in order to exist. The moment that presents his character in a nutshell is the meeting in the theater with Nazi Prime Minister Hermann Goering Rolf Hoppe  his behavior changing from insecurity and soft handshake so despised by the new leaders to cold smile and obedience. Then they will start to like him then they will call him Mephisto our Mephisto. But is that the only way to popularity?...But the development of the main character which is close to masterwork is not all MEPHISTO offers. It's a movie about a particular reality presumably a political content that Germany was exposed to in the 1930s the reality that never leaves you indifferent. It is a movie that provokes emotional thoughts in any viewer ready to reflect. A pack of fanatical men rule force a code of proper beliefs and behavior and...what to do to survive? Either immigrate or adjust oneself to this reality. Those who reject a new vision of Germany e.g. Hans Miklas or Otto Ulrichs experience the worst of course communism was another evil of the time those who immigrate Hendrik's wife Barbara are regarded traitors yet those who stay and parrot the pseudoclassic slogans are for the time being used for certain purposes. Yet not all people can choose...In this case a very interesting though upsetting facet of the problem is developed racism. Hendrik's mistress Juliette Martens Karin Boyd is black she wants to have a baby. However the career of the actor and the director of Berlin theater would come to an end. He cannot dare for love with a black woman. In a memorable scene she asks him desperately What guilt is there to blame on a child born of black mother and white famous father? Then as he immediately puts aside this question she shows him an old photo from his childhood in which Hendrik stands upright in his most young fresh pure years. Juliette looks at him in despair and says Do you still recognize yourself? I'll leave this thought to you who read... You must see this scene a little psychological pearl!The performances are terrific. Klaus Maria Brandauer portrays his part in a very powerful way. You see an actor playing an actor a mask among people an actor in his roles an actor in his life a person who once appreciated freedom yet in time asks himself Freedom? What for? It occurs that the Nazi dominate his life already. I think that if you like Mr Brandauer as an artist you would definitely regard this role as one of the best ones except for Redl 1985 and Nebuchadnezzar 1998. I am proud to say that Krystyna Janda a Polish actress is in this film. Although I don't list her as one of my favorite actresses I have to admit that she very well fits to the role of Barbara Bruckner Hendrick's wife. In a memorable conversation in Paris she does a very fine job showing helplessness rejection and disgust to what happens in Berlin. The third role absolutely worth consideration is Rolf Hoppe's Hermann Goering  he portrays a real Nazi whose behavior is supported by three pillars of the ideology POWER ABSOLUTE PRIDE and INFLEXIBILITY. As for purely technical aspects the movie does not boast much. The picture is rather pale and the camera job is also not very outstanding. Yet Sztabo's film is primarily meant to win by its content to leave something psychologically precious in the viewers appears to be more for the MIND than for the EYES. Therefore this weaker cinematography may be forgiven for the sake of flawless aspects galore.MEPHISTO though a sad and rather a depressing movie is a must see for people who appreciate thoughts who want to get something from a film. Perhaps not that historical to the letter but a pretty nice insight into a complexity that human appears to be. But see it in spring or summer rather than long dark and upsetting autumn evenings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mephisto is Istvn Szab and screenwriter Pter Dobai's adaptation of Klaus Mann's novel about successdriven actor Hendrik Hoefgen's rise to fame during the Third Reich.The movie invites the viewer to see World War II from a seldomexplored perspective that of the arts. We see the blacklisting of communist and jews the decline in production of foreign playwrights like Molire and using culture to spread Nazi values.And in the middle is Hendrik Hoefgen an actor who just wants to survive and get fame but by his own fault ends up involved in the higher echelons of the Nazi Party and becomes director the State Theater immortalized by his performance as Mephisto because of the values this character seems to share with the ideal German the Nazis are trying to create.The movie poses the question can art remain pure amidst political times and if Hoefgen's life is any indication then no it can't. It can revolt and flee for safer places or it can stay and become a corrupted tool of ideology. Hoefgen although never played as villains is a deeply flawed man and hardly innocent of his dealings with the Nazis. Throughout the movie he's described as a selfpromoter who cares only about himself. Such is his intention to please that he always goes back to the Mephisto role the one he's more popular with. Eventually one wonders where Hoefgen ends and the character begins as people call him Mephisto as if that were his real name.In the end though he's more of a Faustian character than a true seductive devil. He symbolises everyone who happily compromised with the the Reich. He's never treated with pity for it's obvious he knew what he was getting himself into. And yet one can't help feel pity for Hoefgen and the way he slowly loses power over himself until he becomes just a lackey of the state.Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a magnificent performance as Hendrik Hoefgen. He plays it with an endless range of emotions so conflicted is his mind. Another great performance was delivered by Rolf Hoppe as the PrimeMinister a patron of the arts and Hoefgen's admirer and protector. Hoppe plays his character unlike any Nazi I've ever seen like a real person which only makes his reserved outbursts more violent.From a technical point of view the movie is nothing outstanding. Szab doesn't impress the viewer with extravagant cinematography costumes and art direction which are the staple of period movies. He lets the screenplay and actors do all the work allowing the movie to develop slowly until the fascinating ending. It may be a difficult movie to watch but one that rewards patience.".

This problem is compounded by the close up camera we are always looking at his face in some unendurable clinch as he tries to kiss us and ask us how good he is again and again.The other weakness is the long build to the story.

	schema:reviewBody "Mephisto is a German film by a Hungarian filmmaker Istvn Szab. It was received very well since it won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film and an award for Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival. It's a historical film which takes place at preWWII Germany during the rising of the National Socialists. Even though its references to the epic tale of Faust are obvious the film doesn't fall to highlighting nor underestimation of the viewer. It's a clever film characterized by strong aesthetic styling about art evil and people living in the shadows of power.A German stage actor Hendrik Hoefgen has to choose between his political ideologies and his career when the Nazis win the election in the year 1933. He has to abandon the leftwing circles in which he has been working before. He's a married man but has an affair with a black German woman. Germany wants to destroy all arts that aren't truly German due to which Hendrik gets the role of Mephisto. He has to keep playing this role which is in the popularity of the Nazis in order to keep his highly valued status. Faust is Germany's national epic which is an ancient folks tale but generally known as written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It's a story about a man who sells his soul to the Devil. Quite an eternal tale Faustian contracts are signed every now and then in the modern world. Mephisto is a fictional character in the book. He wagers with the archangel Gabriel that every man can be enticed to join the dark side. Gabriel chooses Faust a religious servant of God as their target of the bet. Mephisto sends a plague to Faust's village and the villagers ask for a helping hand from him. But Faust is unable to help the villagers because God doesn't answer to his prayers. Totally desperate Faust resorts to Mephisto the demon. Mephisto agrees to help but at the same makes him an offer  eternal youth with all its pleasures. In order to attain this Faust must sell his soul.This is how the story goes or at least the original folks tale with which I am more familiar with compared to Goethe's book. But back to the film. Once when Hendrik has just performed at stage as Mephisto he goes up the stairs to the box seat of a Nazi general. The general flatters him and they talk a little. The audience turns around and starts staring at them. The play is no longer performed at stage but in the seats in the life of the real characters of history. This is the scene where fiction becomes reality. The camera takes a long shot of the theater hall as Hendrik or Mephisto as the general calls him shakes hands with the general  a Faustian contract has been signed.To my mind the film realized brilliantly how to use the face of Mephisto. First on Hendrik then on the German officers around him and then on his wife. The face equals the mark of evil. It represents something Hendrik has now turned into. And in the final scene he runs to the field followed by the spotlight stops and says What do they want from me now? After all I am just an actor. This reminds one of the actual events that occurred after WWII. The trial of Nurnberg for instance and other smaller trials. Many artists were accused for working for the Nazis. But Hitler's propagandafilmmaker Leni Riefenstahl for example said that she only made movies nothing else. So is one either part of the solution or part of the problem? The themes of evil art and inner darkness characterize this aesthetically stylized historical war film. The face of Mephisto turns into an icon which collects symbolic meaning to itself. It's a mask so what do we find behind it when it is dropped down and the truth is revealed. In the end when the camera takes a freezeframe shot of Hendrik's face we see the truth. The artificiality the illusionary world and the facade are now destroyed. We see the protagonist as a human being begging for mercy. But not only the face of evil and society are revealed also the faces of fiction art and cinema.".

I was looking forward to see a dark parable on the cost of success and looking the other way the hunger of adulation and success that an actor craves at any cost. I was however left feeling very underwhelmed at the end the picture. I don't want to destroy the film entirely it's just that I feel in many regards it's not worthy of the level of brilliance and expectation that its reputation comes with.The lead character has little in the way of an arc and although I will agree that the lead performance is excellent it's a shame there's so little for him to do. There is little character growth he just seems to go through set scenes that are unfortunately predictable and without drive. Intellectual film watchers may watch this film and gaze in wonder at the parables and symbols in this film but I found them awkward and clumsy and the plot only halfexplored as if the director is afraid to create some sort of dramatic tension. Hendrik's affair and story with the black dancer in this film holds a lot of possibilities and could be used to investigate deeper motivations in Hendrik Hoefger and Nazi Germany at large yet is brutally underutilized and washes by seemingly without much of a thought.The problem I feel is that although it does tick many of the boxes for being a smart and intelligent film it seems to tick these boxes so deliberately as to feel cold. Most of the time the film seems to run through a mental checklist of what respectable cinema should be and although yes smarts in film is a good thing and should be brought to the table as much as possible Mephisto seems to have forgotten to bring drive to the story and so it seems to drag out far longer than necessary. I really wish I could like this film but there's too much lacking for me it just seems too pompous and convinced of its own selfworth for it's own good.".

This film does not address the Holocaust but does focus on a man in a very awkward position during the war  does he flee or does he stay and accept the new way?

As his associates and friends flee or are ground under by the Nazi terror the popularity of his character supersedes his own existence until he finds that his best performance is keeping up appearances for his Nazi patrons.If you want to win an Oscar it never hurts to make a film about World War II and especially if you throw the Holocaust in there. This film does not address the Holocaust but does focus on a man in a very awkward position during the war  does he flee or does he stay and accept the new way? Although not intentional at least not obviously so it seems oddly like the story of Emil Jannings.";

Heinrich was a satirist who believed that art must contribute to the betterment of society and that it could not avoid being political. Their debate continued into the Nazi era though to say how their minds changed would spoil this film.Mephisto is occasionally a little obvious or simplistic and some of the minor characters are unconvincing but Brandauer shines in the main role and the music set design and camerawork are superb.

	schema:reviewBody "Anybody wanting an intelligent insightful or mesmerizing motion picture should readjust they're expectations before walking into Pandorum. There are a few themes here that are interesting and the characters aren't dumb some are engineers and scientists after all but chances are you've already seen these archetypes in countless movies already. As for whom to recommend this film to if you enjoyed Event Horizon andor Alien there's no reason why you wouldn't find anything to like in this film. However contrary to what many people have said Pandorum seems to resemble another film Eden Log a French scifihorror picture much more than either of the previously mentioned. As in Eden Log our central characters wake up with no memory of how they came to be in their isolated environments. Likewise they also have to explore an isolated world around them were horrible things have occurred and monsters seem to be looming. Even more interesting is that both films feature protagonists caught up in the mix of highly mysterious projects entitled Eden. Our two main characters are Corporal Bower and Lt. Payton played by Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid respectively. The two wake up disoriented and contained i.e. trapped in a small hypersleep chamber designated for the Elysium the name of the large vessel of characters are aboard crew of Flight Team 5. Unaware of what has happened to the other crew members the two begin to analyze their situation and Bower being a technicalmechanical engineer notices electrical surges throughout the ship signal that the nuclear reactor core in the Elysium is about to overload and shutdown. The two begin a makeshift mission to try to save the ship with Bower climbing through ducts and exploring the wasteland left of the craft and Payton guiding him over a comlink and a crankgenerator powered computer terminal. If you've seen any of the Alien films or played the videogames Doom or Dead Space this should sound quite familiar.Oh yeah and there's monsters aboard though I won't reveal what these monsters are for potential viewers that don't know yet.To Pandorum's credit however there are a few unforeseen plot twists before the credits roll. Some audience members may roll they're eyes at the ending but I find it's a rather nice addition to the experience. Instead of a big epic final battle with an Alien Queen you get a heavy plotreveal in the finale that causes some reflection upon the film. While it may be no masterpiece Pandorum is not a bad film. 2009 has been a surprisingly good year for scifi thus far Star Trek Moon District 9 and this certainly doesn't detract from that. In terms of horror Pandorum should be a breath or fresh air for those who've endured films like Halloween II and The Final Destination for the past few weeks. In fact I'd say Pandorum is the second best horror film of the year thus far not quite matching the entertainment value or overall quality of Raimi's epic return to the genre Drag Me To Hell.In terms of filmmaking this is a rather well put together film. The cinematography looks great with the exception of a few action sequences that go overboard with the quickcutting but overall audiences won't have to worry aboard an abundance of shakycam or other cons. Also everything here is properly lit. Those who had trouble with their eyes focusing on images during Eden Log won't have that issue here. This film also doesn't meander around in complete darkness for as long.Director Christian Alvart obviously has a lot of talent and I'm glad he directed this film as opposed to someone like say producer Paul W.S. Anderson. He really knows how to handle suspense and build up intense scenes. Like Neil Marshall he can place his actors in tight unattractive situations with monsters crawling right beside them or vice versa and have the audience holding their breath. Hopefully he'll garner more work in the future.As we now know Pandorum has tanked at the Box Office. While on one hand that's disappointing it's not all together terrible news as the film might garner some sort of cult status in the future. In interviews only a week ago Quaid discussed the possibilities of not only a sequel but a trilogy following Pandorum. Not only is that seemingly impossible now given the films performance it additionally doesn't seem necessary. The film ends with a complete sense of closure. There's no need to see what happens after we leave this world and such a story wouldn't resemble the experience in Pandorum in the slightest anyway.Allinall the latest spacey scifihorror epic has everything you could want in a genre picture. It's not original admittedly this is simply a collage of other better films but so little is in the 21st century. The film does feature a solid cast that deliver solid performances thick atmosphere several scares a few unexpected twists astonishing special effects and set pieces and quite a bit of gore. If you are a fan of the subgenre and these type of movies you'll definitely want to check it out.Runtime 106 minutes 1 hr. 46 min. Related Recommendations It!

Taking a lot of ideas from Alien a 1979 classic scifi movie and borrowing the creatures from The Descent another near classic movie from a few years ago Pandorum was still impressive. The storyline wasn't completely original because it reminded me a lot of Event Horizon but whereas Pandorum went more for a science level Event Horizon was more supernatural. Most people trashed Event Horizon as well but it was another movie I liked also even though the ending of that movie was flawed. Of course I'm reviewing Pandorum so I won't mention the former film anymore.THe cast for the most part was rather good for a movie of this type. Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid are the two most marketable names but the other characters outside of maybe the Cam Gigandet character worked pretty good. My only real problem with Gigandet was that he overacted a bit but otherwise everything was good.The movie does claustrophobia well and the entire movie had me jumping a lot. THere was tension and for the most part the film was fast paced. I didn't find myself looking at my watch one time. THe visuals were decent but the creatures should've been kept in the shadows more. Horror works best when the viewer uses hisher own imagination to visualize them.Did I say horror. Well yeah because this is really a scifi horror film more along the lines of Alien as mentioned above. It doesn't match the classic status of that movie but Pandorum is worth seeing for its psychological feel and how some people might act after being in space for so long. By the way the movie does have a twist which I will not spoil for anyone who wants to see it.Note THis is a film that may make most of its money on DVD and will likely acquire somewhat of a cult status.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2174 the natural resources of Earth are exhausted and the spacecraft Elysium is launched to the planet Tanis in the last hope of mankind. Due to the long travel the crewmembers are divided in teams that travel in extended hypersleep rotating in shifts along the trip. When Corporal Bower Ben Foster from Flight Team 5 wakes up due to a malfunctioning of his chamber he is disoriented and with amnesia. But sooner he realizes that the reactor is not working and provoking power surges in the ship. Then Lieutenant Payton Dennis Quaid also awakes and they find that they are locked in a room but the access door to the bridge is not reactivated. Bower moves through the ventilation trunk trying to open the door from outside. Sooner he discovers that there is some weird threatening life form in the ship and running is always the best option to survive. When he meets the biologist Nadia Antje Traue and the strong farmer Manh Cung Le they team up trying to reach the reactor and save their lives. Meanwhile Payton rescues Corporal Gallo in the room but the menace of the paranoid Pandorum psychological trauma seems to be affecting Gallo. Pandorum is a surprisingly great scifi with potential to become a classic in the future. The claustrophobic and complex story recalls The Descent in at least two scenes but it is original and very well developed. The final twist is a great surprise and the advantage of the DVD is the facility the viewer has to repeat the explanation to fully understand the plot. The only imbecile scene is when Nadja holds Manh in the moment that he is going to kill a creature telling that the it is a child. My vote is eight.Title Brazil PandorumNote On 13 April 2015 I saw this movie again.Note On 24 January 2017 I saw this movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Echoing such luminous scifi classics as 2001 and Alien Pandorum is a terrific psychological thriller although it does struggle at times to be coherent and original. But it's a true mindbender and it's packed with action that moves so quickly neither the actors nor the audience can really catch a breath which is a good move if your plot is shaky to begin with.As with the best deepspace movies the context is mental illness what the Professor on Gilligan's Island called oddly enough island madness. Only in space. In the distant distant future a ship has been sent from the Earth carrying a lot of people headed to the only Earthlike planet ever found. Sometime during the journey things go awry. We pick up the story as an astronaut named Bower Ben Foster awakens from hypersleep abruptly he's soon followed by his commanding officer Payton Dennis Quaid. The rest of the crew is gone and the only door is locked from the outside. What's happened here? Making matters more difficult is the amnesia that each man suffers from owing to their having been in hypersleep way longer than intended. Somehow they must piece together what has happened and find out what lies behind that door  and throughout the rest of the gigantic ship.Not only does the movie recall Aliens and 2001 you can also see similarities to The Descent and The Abyss really any movie in which people are trapped in claustrophobic environs. And although the pacing is frenetic at times the movie is really chillingly shot by Wedigo von Schultzendorff. On the one hand the plot flows linearly  Bower needs to get to the ship's reactor so he can reboot it and save everyone  meaning that the actors race from scene to scene running out of time. On the other hand they don't piece together what's happened as quickly as they might in other lesser films they seem to figure things out gradually as if assembling a puzzle in their heads. Bowers and others  and there are others  discover right away though that they're not really alone on the ship and that their enemies are extremely strong and fast and vicious.Injected into this ohmygoodnesswhat'soutthere madness is well madness. The movie's title is explained as being a sort of mental illness that affects astronauts from time to time when they just plain go bonkers for seemingly no reason and kill everyone on board. Is that's what's happening here? Is Bower the crazy one? Or is it Payton? Are they in fact alone on the ship? Foster is excellent as the hero who remembers a little bit more of their mission as time elapses Quaid in turn shows a few more layers than we're accustomed to seeing from him he's usually more of a poor man's Harrison Ford. Both actors turn in convincing fullthroated performances that complement rather than succumb to the special effects and cinematic wizardry. Often the effects are the entire show. Now it's true that you won't see a lot of character development here as you might in the most cerebral of scifi but what works best here is the paucity of knowledge about the situation and the characters. By spinning the tale gradually feeding the audience only a snippet at a time director Christian Alvart dangles the mystery in front of his viewers without allowing them to settle back and solve the mystery on their own. When you're constantly kept on your toes with sudden lurches of unseen shapes and reverberating noises you  like the befuddled characters  are concurrently kept off balance. The result is an unsettling entertaining delight.".

I viewed Pandorum on Friday and then Surrogates on Saturday and without question Pandorum is a superior film.

They don't know what the mission is where they are nor what has happened to the rest of the ship. As they explore their surroundings they learn that the ship is teeming with mutants who are superfast superstrong and superloud. Chase scenes abound as the crew try to avoid being eaten while regaining control over the ship and come to terms with the mission.The film starts off with obvious references to Pitch Black Alien and Aliens. Once the mutants appear however the film shifts into overdrive and it becomes Resident Evil Aliens and Descent. The mutants all screech like the vampires in 30 Days of Night but fortunately the noise is blended in with the rest of the soundtrack and so didn't give me a headache.The film's real problem is one of its main selling points the mutants. Without them the crew wouldn't be running from set piece to set piece and wouldn't be compelled to stop and question what they discover. But that also cheats some of the characters like the nonEnglish speaking Agricultural worker out of some needed character development. It also cheats the film out of seriously dealing with the fine story that is bubbling just under the surface of the writhing mass of mutants. There is some fine SF here you just have to ignore the action.There are a couple twists along the way which I will not mention here but they are welcome additions of cleverness to an overall film that feels as if it's riffing on lots of other popular SF films. The ending was pitch perfect for SF and I enjoyed the movie overall. I do have to wonder though in a space ship the size of a city wouldn't the designers have installed a couple windows?".

I do have to say the aliens kind of reminded me of the creatures in the movie DESCENT just with armor. The movie itself had a feel of the original ALIEN movie. Now to what I enjoyed about this movie was the way the story evolved into a edge of your seat thriller with twist after twist. The story is what separates this from other spaceship scifi movies. Even leaves the viewer thinking what if this happens. PANDORUM is a good way to enter this fall season. Great story good effects easy story to follow just enough gore to satisfy everyone and not to much Dennis Quaid to make me happy!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is great.The people who are bad mouthing the film are people who don't like science fiction to begin with. The people who are parroting oh it's just over used scifi plot devices and blah blah blah don't have any idea what they're talking about.Films can be genre films. They don't have to reinvent the wheel. You can make a scifihorror film and it can deal with issues that people deal with in scifi. I'd love to hear these critics share their thoughts on the original Indiana Jones films. Oh it's just over used action movie plot devices like fighting Nazis? Please haven't we seen that before? You can literally do that with any genre film it's just critics choose to suckle up to the indie darlings or the movies that have Will Smith in them because they want to get their glorious kiss up words on the box and will pish posh dismiss anything they don't think will get them cool points with generation suck.So it's a scifi horror film that deals with memory loss mutants and the end of the world what's wrong with that? It seems to me that films should be judged on what they are supposed to do especially if it's a genre film. I'm not saying in the broad spectrum of But is it art? and You can read my film from many directions there is no specific way to read it kind of art house janus pictures black and white 348 minutes of french tedium but I'm saying that if a movie is supposed to be a comedy and you have a theater full of people laughing that film is a success that film did what it was supposed to do maybe you didn't care for it's particular brand of humor but you can't say that it was a bad movie. This is the case for The Master of Disguise a film that was a box office bomb and critically reviled yet has gone on to do quite well in the rental and home video market because it's a movie made for kids and kids love it. Same goes for the last bunch of unwatchable Steve Martin ridiculousness. If you're under the age of 12 chances are you're going to love it because it was made for you it wasn't made for snarky 28 year old hipsters. So while I can't imagine ever wanting to watch The Pink Panther 2 I won't call it a bad film because it's not made for me and who it was made for love it wholeheartedly.So in this genre film of scifi horror the audience I was with myself included were terrified throughout the picture. People jumping and screaming and laughing afterwards about how scared they were. Back to the film. It's a roaring success. The sets are gorgeous and the special effects are fantastic. The film moves quickly and is full of twists and terrifying jump outs. It's just a lot of fun to watch. It's fun to get scared.The film doesn't go overboard on the gore it doesn't try to force in sex it does feature good actors giving great performances. The CGI doesn't look awful like in 90 of the big effects driven films of today. The fear is real and the story while having its roots firmly planted in some of the well worn treads of other scifi works has enough new and good ideas to make the picture seem fresh.Don't listen to the jerks the critics and the haters. If you like to get scared watch scifi and have fun check out Pandorum.".

Some are obvious and at least one is just completely unexpected but none of them feel overly typical. Ben Foster is really really good in this and I must say that he is getting much better at picking roles with 310 to Yuma and now this! One thing that really stuck out to me also was how much some of it reminded me of the game Dead Space don't read into that too much as far as story goes it's just that there are a few elements that I think were inspired by the game and if you have played Dead Space I think you will know what I mean when you see it. This movie was good really good and finally gave me the space horrorfiction fix I have been craving since the last good space movie Sunshine by Danny Boyle. Go see this movie!".

Intense action! New superstars will emerge from this one. I won't spoil it by telling you who. You'll see. Rating  8.1Antibodies director Christian Alvart takes suspense into space with this tale of two astronauts who realize that they aren't alone as they drift into the darkest corners of our galaxy. Awakening in their hypersleep chamber with no memory of who they are or what their mission is disoriented astronauts Lt. Payton Dennis Quaid and Corporal Bower Ben Foster gradually surmise that they are the only ones aboard the darkened spacecraft. But how did they get here and what are those strange sounds coming from the belly of the ship? The only way out of their hypersleep chamber is a narrow air shaft and the only one small enough to climb through it is Corporal Bower. As the younger of the two space travelers shimmies inside the older remains behind to offer guidance on the radio transmitter. But the deeper Corporal Bower ventures into the ship the more apparent it becomes that something horrible has happened. Could it be that the survival of the entire human race rests in the hands of these two astronauts stuck on a lonely ship in deep space?".

For me this is the best scifi in the last decade the only one which I enjoyed from beginning to the end without being bored for just one minute or even half of minute ! Very suspenseful and engaging throughout. This was and is an excellent movie well scripted awesome acting and surprising twists leave this movie with you catch into it. A must watch for space thriller fans! Dark full of terror suspense really excellent movie excellent acting of Ben Foster and Antje Traue...Hopefully there's coming second part of the movie Pandorum isn't suppose to be an action space flick it's not a generic star wars clone And it is defiantly not a AvP off. It isn't supposed to be this movie is more of mystery suspense with a mint of tragedy. I thought this movie wasn't going to be good at all but I was way wrong! This movie is extremely awesome. It kind of reminded me of Dead Space. Great story always kept you trying to figure things out a must see. This movie has Intense very scary great actors and a space ship full of monsters. Great set design and the movie has its own feel. Original story line not another reboot A bit like aliensevent horizonand a zombie movie so perfect for me I LOVED IT!!!!! In addition this is vastly underrated movie. One of the best space films of recent years. Great story with plenty of twists and a great ending cool mutant design as well I found it so amazing! reminds me Dead Space video game. It's a survival horror movie which has its thrilling moments really very good story and creepy creatures. I enjoyed much more than the last 5 Resident evil and other space movies so for me this one is the best SciFi movies I have ever seen. Excellent cast involving story crazy action scary moments adventurous. a very excellent movie to watch at night in the dark. Worth buying entertaining enough to watch more than once. Alien Event Horizon and now Pandorum  Gothic science fiction horror. Pandorum is an original story with a great twist that actually make s sense excellent acting with believable characters all in an imaginative environment. Its dark very scary and very serious stuff. EXTREMELY EXCELLENT AMAZING MOVIE!".

Although nothing new in terms of things we haven't seen before encapsulate a group of menwomen and see how they react the film is strung together differently enough to hold your attention. You never really know what's around the next corner.The story is pretty common Earth is doomed. Spaceships are sent out to find a habitable planet. One of these ships has been lost in space for some time and when ship's pilot 4 Bower Ben Foster 310 TO YUMA wakes up from a prolonged hypersleep much of his memory is gone or scrambled. Slowly things begin coming into focus as he finds various clues about who and where he's at. And not long after his awakening another pod opens up and spills out Payton Dennis Quaid VANTAGE POINT a high ranking officer who's memory is just as screwed up.Bower is chosen to explore the ship and getting out of their pod chamber is the first challenge since they're locked in for unknown reasons. Like giving birth Bower squeezes through the canals of the ship's innards and is expelled onto what appears to be a dead ship. But he quickly runs into friends and foes. Some of the crew it appears have mutated and are cannibalistic. Others have had to do terrible things in order to fight and survive. All Bower wants to do is reactivate the ship's power systems and get to the bridge.And that's about as far as I want to go without producing any spoilers....There are several jumpinyourseat moments that'll surprise the hell out of most viewers. And the darkness of the cold ship makes for some excellent atmosphere. The sound score also added a spooky quality to the production.Ben Foster has rarely let me down in his choice of roles and Pandorum was no exception. His embattled and continually challenged character was pitched just right throughout the film. It was also one of the first times I'd seen him as a main character and I was pleased to see it. He's a great young actor.And I've saved the best for last the filming. It was pretty amazing. Again the dark qualities and claustrophobic shots were pulled off without feeling forced or contrived something I can't say of all films ...like THE DESCENT.Surprisingly this film got poor reviews and pretty much flopped at the box office costing over 40 million to make but only grossing 10 million. Shame. It's actually better than you might think.".

Again the dark qualities and claustrophobic shots were pulled off without feeling forced or contrived something I can't say of all films ...like THE DESCENT.Surprisingly this film got poor reviews and pretty much flopped at the box office costing over 40 million to make but only grossing 10 million. Shame. It's actually better than you might think.";

	schema:reviewBody "2174. The Earth has become vastly overpopulated and food  water have become exceedingly scarce. The spaceship Elysium is launched carrying 60000 passengers and crew it's destination  a distant Earthlike planet called Tanis which was discovered 21 years prior. On route to Tanis two crew members  Cpl. Bower  Lt. Payton  awaken from hypersleep but at first have limited memory on where they are why they're there and where they're headed. Seemingly the only ones on the ship and with their memory gradually returning they soon find out the ship's nuclear reactor is malfunctioning so Bower sets off to reset the system while Payton stays on the Bridge. However not long after he sets off he realises he  Payton are not the only ones on the ship....and the inhabitants are most definitely not other passengers or crew members.If you love films like Event Horizon Alien and Prometheus then you will enjoy Pandorum. It even has a slight Descent feel to it. Pandorum is a very dark sinister movie which is exactly the way a good SciFi space movie should be. None of this Star Trek crap.The pace is really good and it's not like an hour of story  character development then only 30 minutes of minimum action. It doesn't take long to get going at all and when it does it doesn't let up very much. I mean there's obviously slower moments but they are never dull or boring so the story still ticks along nicely even during these periods.The look  feel of the movie created a really creepy dark atmosphere and when the aliens are brought into it the tension rating also goes up. If you're after plenty of gore then move along as you won't find it here and this is another movie that proves you don't need buckets of blood to enhance the scare factor.Oh just a quick note...pay attention to the film as well because if you don't then you probably won't understand the ending. SciFi fan? Watch it. Horror fan? Watch it. In fact just watch it!".

The other thing that I loved is the claustrophobic ambiance and disturbing scenes folding one after the other. Just amazing. The only thing that I didn't like so much was Dennis Quaid performance don't misunderstand me he's a terrific actor I just think he can do better than that. I'm giving a 9 stars to this movie.

It starts with two astronauts Dennis Quaid  Ben Foster  wake up from pods  they are solitaries and some has decimated the crew . One of them goes to explore the zone in where can live people noinfected . Meanwhile the astronaut Bower attempting to survive  and he meets new survivors  Antje Traue Norman Reedus Cung Le  hidden throughout the aircraft .Then they encounter themselves chased by bloodthirstypredatory monsters which have added them to his food chain. They must confront carnivorous mutants hordes of warriors starving of human flesh and some of the most horrifying creatures ever made . The survivor group is surrounded  as they encounter a pack of carnivorouscrawling creatures that are waiting for them  facing their destruction and exposed to cruel bites by meateating sickos. They undertake a desperate fighting to survive and confronting each other.This exciting picture contains thrills chills plot twists actionfilled with fierce fights and lots of gore and guts . The terror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized . The film turns out to be a crossover between psychological issues of crew from  Event horizon  a certain similarity to the extraterrestrial attacks on the spacial corridors of Alien saga   the weird monsters from The descent and Resident evil by Paul W. Anderson here also producer  taking ideas here and there  resulting to be a fine movie . And of course the theme of people being stranded in a hostile perilous environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of Pitch black . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames . It's predictable but also its predictability is redeemed for some extraordinary surprises and in part by the charismatic acting from the main protagonists  Quaid and Foster . The flesheating mutants appearance deliver the goods plenty of screams shocks and tension. The makeup assistants create the truly terrible cannibals. Horrifying and astonishing images about eerie events with deserted and threatening corridors  such as the creepy scenarios in the large spacial craft without barely people  and covered of metal and iron . Cool  dark cinematography by Wendigo who creates a perfect atmosphere and haunting musical score fitting to action and horror . The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Christian Alvart who subsequently would direct another good terror film as Case 39 .".

	schema:reviewBody "I think boxoffice failure of this one was caused by crappy advertising. Posters are set in the tone of Starship Troopers or Crank or Saw and they doesn't resemble the soul of this movie. At all. So if you want to see Pandorum but you feel stink from the posters  don't be afraid it's only a poster. Movie is better.In few words Pandorum has splendid sets and design gooooood acting Ben Foster especially gives power to this movie and most important  strong directing and quite good script with few kinda' freshy concepts.The script has only one major flaw  too much talking. This story is a great pretext to create almost silent movie. It would be a challenge to tell the plot almost without talking but I'm sure it could have been done good. And THEN we would get a fresh movie! Instead we have something more hollywoodish but still attractive and wort watching.Director Christian Alvart knows how to thrill. I've watched this movie on rather bad DivX copy and shitty speakers and still was climbing the armchair in few moments. Very good sense of suspense. DVD or BlueRay should emphasize those experiences.But good directing isn't much when your cast is shitty. Respect goes here to Ben Foster and Denis Quaid who assist the director in gaining the right feel of the movie. Female lead Antje Traue was a nice choice too. She jumps over the overplayed strong female character known from times of Sigounrey Weaver's Ripley and plays here in very simple yet realistic manner. It adds some very needed reality feel to the story. In the opposite we have Eddie Rouse whose theatrical acting  either it was director's choice or his own  doesn't fit here and spoils the mood.To complete the picture we have here very very very good design and nicely created and lighted sets without joykilling cardboard feel. It helps again the story to be more believable. But we have to remember that I watched it on DivX so It could be worse in better quality.This whole bunch of things is nicely photographed and edited so the final package WILL make you happy.Summing up  be prepared for some dejavu from time to time for example The Descent 2005 Event Horizon 1997 Creep 2004 but it's a good mix for sure and if you are looking for dark Science Fiction in the tone tone not level of Alien I definitely recommend you this title.".

	schema:reviewBody "As scifi movies go Pandorum is one of the more original you will find. Despite taking more than a few cues from the Alien franchise this art house feature delivers so much freshness and punch much like District 9 it can restore even the more cynical person's faith in Hollywood. Pandorum is at its core a psychological horror that is as much about the 'demons' that lay around a dark corner as it is about the ones that haunt the mind. Staring Dennis Quad and Ben Foster as two surviving members of a crew who awaken from a deep sleep on board a city sized space ship the pair has no recollection of how they ended up where they are and what their mission is meant to be. Initially believing that the rest of the crew and the ship's large compliment of passengers are still asleep it soon becomes apparent that something else is awake and that this thing has a taste for human flesh. However to reveal more about the plot will ruin the multiple twists that swiftly come one after another right up until the end credits. Fans of Solaris 2001 and Sunshine who also do not mind copious amounts of blood and guts on screen reminiscent of the horror thriller Descent will enjoy this story. Although Michl Britsch music score proved distracting to the point of annoyance and the special effects are a little weaker than one would expect for a film released in 2010 everything else about Pandorum makes this a must see movie. The performances are excellent the set designs are as epic as the story itself and the direction is tight. 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just never know what to expect from horror  scifi films. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. I can't think of too many times where it didn't work. I guess there's Supernova Doom Virus John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars and other films like that. But there's also the Alien movies the first Species Pitch Black Event Horizon and even the Resident Evil movies that hit the nail on the head. I would have to say Pandorum does a pretty decent job of hammering it down.Pandorum is loud noisy and has more gore than I think most regular moviegoers are probably used to. That being said it also strives to be intelligent and arty. It's kind of a strange mix. It melds together elements of such films as Event Horizon Alien Resident Evil and even The Poseidon Adventure. I mean the whole film is about a guy trying to reach the reactor of the ship to turn it back on. Just imagine Gene Hackman or Kurt Russell if you've only seen the remake Poseidon and company trying to get off the ship before it breaks apart...but they're being chased by cannibalistic monsters that seem to have superhuman strength and speed.The acting in the film for the most part is pretty decent. Dennis Quaid comes off kind of cheesy a few times and some of the dialogue for the other characters could have been spruced up a bit. There's really nothing to cry about though. I was kind of excited to see that Norman Reedus The Boondock Saints Blade II Deuces Wild Gossip Messengers 2 The Scarecrow was in this but was disappointed when his character gets dragged off a mere five minutes after he hits the screen.The special effects and cinematography were very stylistic. The scene of the mutant cannibal lair where they're all piled on each other and intertwined was reminiscent of the scene in Alien Resurrection where Ripley is lying with all the Aliens in their lair. Now imagine having to crawl through them covered in their skin to get to where you need to go. Yes it is pretty nervewracking and disturbing. The ferocious way the mutants run attack and eat their prey is also a big visual highlight.You can tell that the writer of this film really did try to do something intelligent and new while treading on some familiar ground. There's a pretty decent story lying under all the visual hocuspocus and gore. I actually liked the end one of them at least even though I could see it coming a mile away. I wanted to write that I didn't like it but I just can't. It worked so well within the frame of the story.Is Pandorum a groundbreaking film? No. Is it going to shock genre fans and be the next big thing? No. Is it a good movie that entertains but at the same time doesn't dumb anything down story wise for action and gore? Yes. Like I said earlier your normal Friday night moviegoing audience will probably find it more shocking and gory than us genre gore hounds. It was still a good watch.".

As the Great Crash happened in 24th October of that year and the crisis effects would only be felt in Europe some months later I think the film was not an answer to the Great Depression but it could as well be. Germany anyway since the end of the First World War lived in a state of permanent crisis but as we know crisis can many times stimulate the creativity  see the German Expressionism and see also for instance Die Drei von der Tankstelle  Yeah! Art is not just Murnau Fritz Lang etc.. it can be represented by a musical comedy like Die Drei von der Tankstelle Three from the Gasoline Station.Die Drei von der Tankstelle tells the story of three rich friends that suddenly lose everything they have this tastes like Depression! including house furniture and all and have to work for the first time in their lives. They open a gasoline station and meet a girl that will conquer their three hearts. This intrigue will challenge their friendship. This is the basis of the story that is punctuated by hilarious gags and musical numbers. This is really a feelgood film that at the same time is very creative and funny. The actors look like they are having lots of fun.Highly recommended! I don't understand why this film is not mentioned together with other great musical films. And pay attention This is not just another film with an indifferent plot sprinkled with musical numbers  music and plot work very well together and the result is this charming film. Go for it!".

Their lawyer informs them that their bank has gone bankrupt and that they have lost their entire fortune. Instead of bemoaning the catastrophe they open a petrol station which provides enough to live on but does not make them rich. Willy Kurt and Hans have no intention of allowing their friendship to suffer as a result of life's caprices.

The reason may be the inclusion of Heinz Rhmann even if the story and list of cast members makes it obvious that Willy Fritsch was still a much bigger star in Germany at that point than Rhmann. 3 years before the Nazis came into power we have a light operetta movie with lots of romance here. No hard feelings though and no serious drama either. They had the possibility to include that too but I guess they wanted something light because the music parts and of course the lesson on friendship would not have worked so well otherwise.Then again it did not work really well. The action does not make sense for the most part in my opinion and I was not impressed by any of the aspects of the film. There are a couple catchy songs but overall the music is as forgettable as the comedy the story and the acting. By some it may be considered one of the best German comedy films but in my opinion it is far far away from such a title. I guess those who say so just need to watch more German comedies. Rhmann himself rarely has the opportunity to show us what he is capable because otherwise we may forget that Fritsch besides Harvey is the star here. A fairly forgettable 90 minutes I must say. I was not really entertained well. I am a bit surprised to see the people who wrotedirected this one managed to have successful careers in Hollywood afterward. I guess they must have stepped things up later on because here they really do not show us quality filmmaking. Thumbs down for Die Drei von der Tankstelle. I don't recommend it.".

Three friends are broke so they decide to sell their car and run and open a gas station.Lillian Harvey shows up  as Lillian Cosman teasing and taunting the three friends played by Willy Fritz Heinz Ruhamann Oskar Karlwies. Lilian is the daughter of a big magnet played by Fritz Camper and had a girl friend  played by Olga Tschechowa.They all three find out that Lilian was teasing all three of them and this almost breaks up their friendship and business. What confused me cause I don't understand German that much Is that Olga shows up offering a deal to the place they all agree but the next scene they still own the business but it's big now.It looks like that Kamper is offering to buy the business. Could it be that she was offering a loan approve by the company? This is confusing. Felix Bressahart character actor who would later immigrate to the U. S.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm gonna start off with a little bit of a tangent. The scene where Lilian Lilian Cossmann to the gas station and meets the second attendant Kurt Oskar Karlweis is quite something. Kurt starts singing about how she's just a woman and needs a man with her. There's all these references to women and driving. On the one hand he's trying to find an excuse to let him ride with her. On the other hand it reminds me of this Schwachsinn in Saudi Arabia that denies women the right to drive. Now Europe is being flooded with Muslim immigrants who apparently can't run their own country to go to a country that was more progressive than much of the Arab world is today about 80 years ago.And that's what so much of this early German really is  a relic. This is a rather silly lighthearted comedy perfect for TMC with no moral or ethic implications and little connection to the reality of the day. Yet it is still studied because it was a very financially successful early talkie. The dance scenes are fairly entertaining. Whenever the three men are together it's funny and the lyrics are quite clever. However such films seem typical of that escapism. It's no shocker that in a world where people make such fluffy goodfornothing films street battles and concentration camps would be the norm. So how do I reconcile the progressive situation of Weimar Germany with its predilection to mass murder? Well both the Muslim world and Nazi Germany engaged in it but at least women could drive in one of them. It's the little things.".

Schultze the main character is a quiet lonely aging German man. Horst Krause played the part amazingly honestly. I never once felt like any of the characters were acting especially Schultze. The writer and director Michael Schorr enables the viewer to feel Schultze's emotions and to care for him without ever really trying. It was almost as if I was seeing the world through Schultze's eyes and feeling emotions through him rather than being told what he was feeling or being shown what he was seeing. This film is also a great comparison of American and German culture. It was interesting as an American to see my home portrayed from a German point of view and I believe this film gives a uniquely appropriate portrayal of German life as well. This film is one of the best I have ever seen. It made me feel a range of emotions it dazzled my ears with Zydeco music and most of all it made me truly care. I left the theater with an amazing feeling like I had just had a experienced something truly special. I cannot believe this is Michael Schorr's first feature film. It was truly perfect.".

Followed by his sojourn to Louisiana which insists on being French despite the fact that it's in America. Did he go there looking for her? Then the premonitions. Early on a brief sound bite on the radio about lung cancer. Then near the end he's offered a meal of crabs in the bayou. Ja Krebs he says. Krebs means cancer in German. And he was a miner so worked every day breathing radon. Did he have cancer? And of course the music. An accordionist who plays the local polka he picks up zydeco by ear and loves it. But his fellow Germans don't like it and they're even less interested in the US. In fact he stops playing after he gets to America. They want polka even more than the Germans do albeit a strange American kind that includes yodeling.Then the unspoken. So much of this story is told by pictures not dialog. It's a subtlety that Hollywood has completely lost touch with. It's so refreshing to see it again.This movie is a delight. I defy anyone to dislike it. There's something of An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge in it but it's not quite that facile.It's a quiet tour de force. I want more.".

This films' pictures speak such a humourous and humanist language that dialogue is simply not needed. They tell you how important it is to live your dream  even if it's only the small dream of an elderly not very handsome or clever man. Schultze is just not the type who speaks a lot  his story is worthy to be told nevertheless.I laughed a lot seeing this it also touched me. Great camera work the film really trusts the power of pictures. To me it's the best German movie of 2004 so far and I've seen Gegen die Wand which I liked very much.".

Schultze the main actortries to seek it by playing a tune he heard on the radio on his accordion which leads him from SachsenAnhalt in the former East Germany DDR to a music festival in Texas.

This wonderful slice of life and comment on Thoreau's observation of people living lives of quiet desperation is so well done it leaves me reflecting on it long after having seen it. Schultzie a retired miner who plays the accordion and hangs out with his atlooseends friends hears some zydeco one night on the radio and starts to play it. He doesn't even know the name of the tune and certainly has no cultural connections with the music but he plays after hearing it once and extends his experience playing polkas to incorporate this new rhythm and beat into his playing. He does it with such a nonchalance and earnest commitment that he even takes him by surprise. The scene where he plays his new found music with his fellow burghers is amazing. His friends rally to his support while the more traditionalists object to this nigger music. The whole film is a series of embroidered vignettes of still shots which are pasted on the wall with the characters moving slowly across them. The pace is slow and there are lots of gaps but that only adds to the charm of this delightful little film. It is full of sentiment without becoming sentimental poignant but never maudlin and lingers long in the memory.".

The whole oppressive overlay of deadend jobs in a dead town with the daily drinking to blur the boredom was much like life back home. As was the firm rejection of everyone of anything new or different the clinging to traditional music at the festival Shultze always living in the shadow of his father. You sensed that he suddenly woke up at the end of his life to realize he had wasted it. Yet Shultze was always a little different so I was not too surprised when he tried to get to America..his little garden of flowers and washing the gnomes next to his little old shack of a house. His attraction to the lady in the nursing home his drive to raise money to go to Texas only to run away when he found the same life replicated there. His trip through the bayou was like his own journey to heaven..reminded me of Being There as everything fell his way. Great filming done in this flick the quiet scenes the views of the country the coal mountain against the lake the boat trip food for the senses as I took in the message..it's never too late to find happiness in life and how one person can touch so many. And of course the genuine kindness of strangers..which was a bit over the top as he wandered the deep south. I wonder if that would really happen in today's Texas....oh and I loved the music!!".

The blades slowly spin round and round. These blades are shown at various times throughout the film as a metaphor of the endless cycle of life. The film moves at a very leisurely pace as Schultze and his two friends also newly unemployed face a world without work. Much time is spent intentionally watching the men sit around. This may try the patience of some viewers but like the spinning blades of the windmill it has a point. The mine was their life and without it in their small town the men must find something else anything else to fill their time.Schultze plays the accordion usually polkasand belongs to a local music club. By chance he hears a Cajun tune on the radio and quickly becomes interested in the music and even shakes up the 50 year music club anniversary by playing what one audience member deems jungle music. Yes his new love of Cajun music is not shared by his fellow members.Nevertheless the club awards him with a ticket to the Texas music festival the town's American sister city is sponsoring. Once their however Schultze begins his odyssey to locate the Louisiana Bayou country and the home of his new found love Zydeco music.It's really at this point that the story picks up. The humor is so droll and slow paced that by pick up I don't mean that it changes drastically from the first two thirds of the film rather Schultze begins to go on his own subtle adventures and it is gratifying to the viewer to finally see him arrive at his destination.Schultze Gets the Blues is more about what doesn't happen then what is actually happening in this film and ultimately this man's life. Like the spinning blades time goes on and it is the subtle changes and adventures we choose that shape our lives and like Schultze we never know when our time is up.".

Born in Germany I always enjoy movies which portray the everyday man or woman  them  being Germans and American  colliding  last one which comes to mind was Baghdad Cafe which was also delightful .The style of showing life and using the camera reminded me a little bit of Fassbinder movies and I very much appreciated the realistic approach. A very convincing debut. After having lived for over a quarter of a century in the States and longer than that in Germany I usually get very frustrated watching Hollywood movies. Locations I have been toare made to look so glamorous that I do not recognize them any more and the same is true for actresses and actors. Everything has a tendency to be larger and more beautiful more impressive than life. The story line is most of the time as far removed from reality as Oprah and her average viewer have nothing in common.These Hollywood movies leave me with a bitter aftertaste. Why is my life not so glamorous and why does my house my street  my city looks so ordinary and is fraying at the edges.? Schultze gets the blues beautifies nothing. In the German part A depressing little town in a depressed area of former East Germany. Though there are some attractive spots to be found too and the camera knows how to capture them. Three friends being forced into early retirement. Life in early retirement boring and very predictable. But there are good things too. Friendships community events the joys of a little Schrebergarten weekend garden house and discovering something new like music and food from the South of the U.S.. Schultze discovers Cajun music by accident and tries to save enough money to travel to Louisiana. By a stroke of luck he wins a trip to New Braunsfeld in Texas where he is confronted with an expatriated version of Germans he nor I can relate to. He escapes on an adventure transporting him into the swamps of Louisiana and happens to encounter only positive experiences. He speaks not one word of English and consequently is not really able to communicate. Like in Baghdad Cafe the America shown is not glamorous but for that reason attractive to the German visitor. There is nothing intimidating or superpowerlike in a houseboat with a picket fenced roof top garden. The beach houses in Louisiana may be prime real estate but the film shows them as not particularly attractive looking probably because it is out of season and the area is deserted.. Everything in the movie feels right. As I learned from the DVD all locations were original and were not changed by the film crew. Not in Germany nor in the States. Many people participating in this film were the actual owners or employees or guests of the bar dance hall concert hall or retirement home. In both countries we get a realistic view of things retired people do.For me there were a bunch of comic situations in the film like Schultze entering the Jacuzzi in a tiny speedo barely visible due to his impressive corpulence. After living so long in the States it is difficult to remember that huge bathing shorts are not worn in Germany and all men wear speedos. The German crowd in New Braunsfels dressed up in Bavarian outfits though I am sure that only a fraction of them originally originated from this area in Germany. But somehow the personification of a German in America is a Bavarian while in Germany you would never find a German from another region dressing up in this style. The cooking radio show which gave you time to go shopping for the ingredients and then continued the instructions. The shots in the Bayous were absolutely beautiful. The choice of bars and dance halls was superb. The acting flawless. By using so many amateurs and only original locations the film feels completely authentic. There was barely a scene in this movie which I had not experienced myself in one way or the other in either country.The only little thing which was a little bit over the top for me was the New Orleans style funeral in Germany and the fact that the houseboat lady and her daughter attended it. Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and did not think it being slow for one second.P.S. In the English subtitles it says that the people consider the zydeco music as nigger music. That is not correct. Neger in German means negro and is not used in a diparaging way. For these people it is just something unfamiliar. The word is used in the German language like black here.".

Some other critics both professional and not have described the film by first time director Schorr as slowmoving and even boring. I found it to be neither.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine how the director Michael Schorr could draw us into the story of a plump old retiree with a face as interesting as a honeydew melon Horst Krauss but he manages to do it.Lif in Schultze's German town is filled with inaction. We get several static shots of the architecture and the layout of the streets empty of occupants. I mean it literally. We see a shot of a tiled and sterile courtyard  and the shot hangs there for a good ten seconds.The same technique is used throughout. Lots of scenes in which people are doing something and Schultze is off in a corner somewhere observing or just staring. There are two shots of a gray sky both held for about one minute. In the first the screen is blank except that a slender sliver of material enters the picture and slices through it in a leisurely way. We guess it's one of the blades of the energyproducing windmills we glimpsed at the beginning but it could be anything  a sickle a helicopter rotor a mobile. In the second static shot of the sky it is blank except for three unmoving contrails from highaltitude jets.He's not a man without honor in his own Dorf though no Umberto D. He's an accordion player in the local Musikverein and though he shows more enthusiasm than talent he's chosen to represent the village at its sister city's music festival in America New Braunfels Texas where as a matter of fact you can still buy a good Wurst. It isn't that life in his village is bad. It's just that it's extremely dull even for a dull man.And then he has a musical epiphany. Surfing the radio dial one night he runs across a station play a Cajun song. He shrugs turns the radio off walks across the room stops turns around thoughtfully goes back to the radio and turns it on again listens to the tune for a few minutes then shuts it off and begins to practice the tune on his accordion.In deliberately paced movies like this the smallest changes in detail catch your attention. In this scene it's the expression of Schultze's face and he grasps what the Cajun music is doing.There really isn't much to the rest of the story. Schultze goes to America and winds up buying a small fishing boat and travels around in the Louisiana bayous soon realizing that compared to professional Cajun musicians he retains his amateur status. He packs his accordion away and that's the end of his musical career.The natives are friendly enough in a minimal way but Schultze has a language problem and in any case is rather shy. A woman dances with him at a Cajun nightclub and leaves him in the middle of the dance. He looks around puzzled and disappointed and then leaves. She returns a moment later with two drinks and searches for him without success. Mostly they pay no more attention to Schultze than they would to any other stranger.Here's a spoiler. Finally he falls in temporarily with an AfricanAmerican woman and her young girl. They invite him to dinner and he stuffs himself on crab and other Cajun food. Then they go out drinking and dancing and having generally a hell of a good time. Too good. Schultze is a heart attack waiting to happen. The black woman takes him to her home and covers him tenderly while he sleeps in a chair dreaming of the dance he's just been to. Then he burps twice and dies quietly.Schultze's funeral back in Germany is played neither as tragedy or comedy. It's a solemn affair as funerals tend to be except that in the middle of a woman's peroration somebody's cell phone starts ringing and people make wisecracks about it and laugh. As the large group of mourners walks away from the graveyard the village band plays the Cajun tune that had so captivated Schultze. The last shot has the column in black silhouette passing the everturning windmill of I guess life.Schultze did what he longed to do at the end of his life course. What more could anyone ask? That the movie is so touching is a tribute to the director and writer and to Hort Krauss the actor. Neither gives us much reason to love Schultze. It's not that simpleminded. If we can identify with him it's because his ordinariness is an extension of our own.".

It tells a simple story in a very understated way and the overall effect is quite powerful.Schultze is a recently retired miner a hard working man that now finds a lot of time on his hands and not much else. His mother is in a nursing home with dementia his only family his mates from work who like to share a glass of beer when they get the chance. The imagery in this film is stark and dramatic. The long pauses tempt you to reach for the fast forward button but they create the emptiness you will understand about Schultze's life. His only bright spot is his accordion and his membership in the local music club which is celebrating their 50th anniversary. This year they offer a special prize an expense paid trip to Texas. The club received an invitation from their sister city to send one person to their annual GermanAmerican festival. The winner will be selected at their Anniversary concert may we put you down for your usual polka Schultze?

	schema:headline " Gentle Though Overlong Character Study of a Retired German Salt Miner's Zydeco Obsession";
	schema:reviewBody "Firsttime directorwriter Michael Schorr has made a gently idiosyncratic film that is at once bittersweet and enervating a combination familiar to anyone acquainted with the works of filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. It feels like Schorr is indeed making a Jarmuschlike film in his gently drawn character study of Schultze an accordionplaying German salt mine worker. What I like about Schorr's style is the naturalness with which he presents such potentially eccentric characters and also the elliptical nature of his story treatment i.e. he lets the viewer fill in all the blanks in the storyline instead of inserting contrived plot devices to move the film along.The plot revolves around the early retirement given to Schultze and his two beerdrinking coworkers. As the lone bachelor of the trio and caring for an ailing mother in a nursing home Schultze is bored in his small town in SachsenAnhalt region of Germany. By chance he hears a snippet of zydeco music on the radio and becomes so instantly hooked that he takes odd jobs to save up for a trip to the bayou country in Louisiana. Fate somehow works in his favor as his town's music club is having a 50th anniversary celebration including a trip for a luckily chosen musician to the US sister city of New Braunfels Texas. After a controversial performance of zydeco music at an otherwise allpolka concert Schultze wins the trip and makes his way to Louisiana. There he rents a boat travels the bayous and meets lots of nice people along the way.It's a sweet story that Schorr has elongated with long establishing shots and scenes some relatively inconsequential like the flamencodancing waitress that drag on for too long but he compensates for the most part with the sheer quirkiness of the episodic plot. The comedy is not laughoutloud funny except for a bikini shot of Schultze in a Jacuzzi but the film's observational humor brings a gentle resonance to the story. While his rotund figure and gentle manner would initially have you think he will be the reincarnation of S.Z. Cuddles Sakall from Casablanca Horst Krause actually plays Schultze in quite a plainfaced manner imbuing his character with an inarticulate realistic humanism. Harald Warmbrunn as Jrgen and KarlFred Muller as Manfred lend sound comic support as Schultze's buddies. Interestingly all the roles are filled with such natural actors that the whole venture often feels like a documentary especially when the film comes stateside.While I enjoyed Axel Schneppat's cinematography I think the editing by Tina Hillmann is frankly not disciplined enough to completely pull off such a sweetspirited parable and from my perspective the 114minute film could have easily been shortened by a halfhour. After all Schultze's journey to Louisiana doesn't happen until well after the onehour mark. I also think that Schorr views Schultze a bit too much at arm's length and doesn't allow us to get to know him beyond the thoughtful befuddled man that Schorr presents here. For example there is a lovely scene near the end of the film where Schultze asks for water from a local woman cooking crabs but it's not clear beyond her sense of giving why a bonding occurs between the two. If there is a moment of catharsis for Schultze I'm not sure I was aware of it. The charm of the 2003 movie however will likely sway you if you are patient enough to absorb the deliberate pacing. The DVD's one significant extra is Schorr's detailed informative commentary on an alternate track. He speaks in German but the English subtitles help translate his often illuminating remarks. There are three similar Germanlanguage trailers included as well as various previews for other Paramount Classics films.".

It's a rather slow and subtile affair and you really have to be in the mood for it but given the right setting to watch this movie it will blow you away.

	schema:headline " A fine movie for those who like small quirky films with unusual and appealing lead characters";
	schema:reviewBody "If you like sweetnatured movies with unlikely lead characters particularly when they find themselves breaking out of old habits you should like the German film Schultze Gets the Blues. It's the first film from director Michael Schorr and he brings it off with style. Herr Schultze Horst Krause is a heavy set man probably in his late fifties who with two friends has been eased into retirement at the commercial salt mine he has worked at for years. Calling Schultze portly would do poor justice to his sizable belly. He's not flabby he's earned those inches through hard work and plenty of beer. He lives alone and has never thought much about fancy ideas like life. Now he takes afternoon naps drinks beer with his two friends washes his garden trolls and continues to play the accordion at polka parties. He's a slow moving slow talking deliberate man. Life is just there nothing is happening in it and Schultze is slowly being bored to death without realizing it. He just continues to take each day at its own pace. Then one night he turns the radio dial at home and suddenly hears a fast strange style of accordion playing he's never heard before. He's come across a broadcast of Louisiana zydeco music. He listens puzzled. He turns the radio off and starts to go back to bed then turns and switches the music on again. He listens some more. He tries to figure out the music he's listening to. He turns the radio off again heads back to bed but then stops and puts on his accordion. He picks out the tune then plays it faster and faster trying to match the zydeco beat. Herr Schultze doesn't know it yet but he has just changed his life. Before long Schultze is playing his zydeco song before puzzled polka audiences. He finds a recipe for jambalaya and cooks it for his two best friends who've never had such a spicy dish before. Schultze smiles approvingly as they keep eating and drink more beer. He gets part time jobs to earn money for a trip to bayou country in the States. And he wins a contest which will give him enough money to go to his town's sister city in America New Braunfels Texas to compete in a music festival. Schultze gets there listens to the others and realizes he's out of his league. Instead of going home to spend more time polishing the garden gnomes and taking naps in the afternoon he buys a small blue boat with an enclosed cabin and sets out from coastal Texas into Louisiana bayou territory. Schultze can speak probably no more than a dozen words of English. He also is one of the most sincere innocent and nonthreatening people you'll ever meet. Schultze meets people he never thought of meeting yet somehow always wanted to. Old men playing dominos in a friendly bar in Moulton Texas. A Czech band made up of cheerful Americans on the Texas gulf coast. Middleaged cajuns dancing to a zydeco beat in a bayou bar. A woman and her daughter on a boat who give him a glass of water and invite him to stay for a creole lunch of crab and shrimp. The postcards and pictures he sends back to his friends bemuse them. Schultze also finds a contentment that we share with him. The movie takes its time. There is no flashy cutting. The director isn't afraid of setting up his camera and simply letting a scene unfold. The first half of the movie when Schultze is at his home can sometimes seem as slowmoving as Schultze himself but stay with it. Once you get into the rhythm of the movie it works. There is little dialogue especially when Schultze gets to Texas just the efforts of a wellmeaning man to be understood and of the efforts of wellmeaning Texans Creoles and Cajuns to understand him. The movie has a deadpan sense of humor about it at times. It can be poignant but it's not sad. And even the ending is not too sentimental. The movie is well photographed especially the long gray days in Schultze's home town and the lush bayou landscapes that make up the last half of the film.".

Instead of going home to spend more time polishing the garden gnomes and taking naps in the afternoon he buys a small blue boat with an enclosed cabin and sets out from coastal Texas into Louisiana bayou territory. Schultze can speak probably no more than a dozen words of English. He also is one of the most sincere innocent and nonthreatening people you'll ever meet. Schultze meets people he never thought of meeting yet somehow always wanted to. Old men playing dominos in a friendly bar in Moulton Texas. A Czech band made up of cheerful Americans on the Texas gulf coast. Middleaged cajuns dancing to a zydeco beat in a bayou bar. A woman and her daughter on a boat who give him a glass of water and invite him to stay for a creole lunch of crab and shrimp. The postcards and pictures he sends back to his friends bemuse them. Schultze also finds a contentment that we share with him. The movie takes its time. There is no flashy cutting. The director isn't afraid of setting up his camera and simply letting a scene unfold. The first half of the movie when Schultze is at his home can sometimes seem as slowmoving as Schultze himself but stay with it. Once you get into the rhythm of the movie it works. There is little dialogue especially when Schultze gets to Texas just the efforts of a wellmeaning man to be understood and of the efforts of wellmeaning Texans Creoles and Cajuns to understand him. The movie has a deadpan sense of humor about it at times. It can be poignant but it's not sad. And even the ending is not too sentimental. The movie is well photographed especially the long gray days in Schultze's home town and the lush bayou landscapes that make up the last half of the film.";

The acting is absolutely superb in this German movie about a man who retires and finds his passion for life has gone until he discovers Zydeco music. This is not the typical Hollywood tale but rather a very foreign in this case German look at how a person deals with the end of their life. I watched this film after Hurricane Katrina so it was good to see some of the old local landmarks like the Rock'N Bowl being used as a location. The storyline had me hooked from the very start as Schultze and his friends drew me into their world and everyday mundane lives and following Schultze's evolution. This is a story that resonates for all of us as we must one day face the question of existence like Schultze's character did and I hope I do it as well as he did by seizing the day. If you enjoy a good oldfashioned story that doesn't rely on juvenile humor huge explosions or gee whiz special effects then go rent this movie today.".

The utter simplicity of technique that writerdirector Michael Schorr uses to tell this quiet tale of the glory of the human spirit is magical. This is one of those films that deserves a very wide audience from every age group! Schultze Horst Krause Jrgen Harald Warmbrunn and Manfred Karl Fred Mller have just been retired from their life's occupation of working the salt mines in a bleak little German town and are left to 'celebrate' with their company 'trophy lamps' made of large illuminated salt crystals! drink beer and ponder their next step retired life. Of the three Schultze is the loner his wife in an extended care facility for the mentally challenged where Schultze plays his accordion polkas for their entertainment. The woman in charge Frau Lorant Rosemarie Deibel encourages Schultze to further his interest in his accordion. Manfred and Jrgen insist he play polka music and enter a contest in America. But Schultze has heard zydeco music on the radio zydeco  a style of dance music originating in Louisiana that is usually played on accordion guitar and violin and combines traditional French melodies with Caribbean and blues influences and becomes quietly obsessed with that music.Off to America to compete in a Texan Polka Contest loner Schultze wanders to Louisiana where he finds not only the music of his soul but a people who accept him more than his little German hometown. And the gentle message of this quiet little film is about loneliness and friendship and the impact they make on us all.Schorr spends the bulk of this twohour journey with visuals that depict isolation longing and the small things that make up what we call life. His cast is superb with Horst Krause's Schultze creating one of the most memorable characters on film. In a time when Baby Boomers are looking at retirement with anxiety this little movie is just the antidote. Highly Recommended! Grady Harp October 05".

I know some will say that is exactly what the director wanted to happen and it matches Thoureau's quiet lives of desperation theme but I found it distracting in the end. In fact supposedly a big transformation occurs when he hears Zydeco music but it is up to the audience to determine this and with the small exception of a dialog with a doctor and his inability to stay focused on his previous life polka music without shifting to new life Zydeco music I had a hard time deciding whether he was bored with life and looking for something different or somehow consumed with a new passion in his later years of life. Any visible positive character transformation for a new loud life of hope and excitement came very little and very late in the movie.I wish there was little less abstracted stills and slow pacing of camera movements for a little more directness and some more gap filling cues from the director.

But still while this movie doesn't really stand out and it is incredibly predictable there are some really fun moments. We at least finally have the split up family vs just one crazy family. Reese really turned on the charm and stole this movie she was so adorable and she was great in the jump jump scene with the evil kids. Vince had some moments as well but it's more the supporting cast that was just a fun addition to the story.When upscale happily unmarried San Francisco couple Kate and Brad find themselves socked in by fog on Christmas morning their exotic vacation plans morph into the familycentric holiday they had until now gleefully avoided. Out of obligationand unable to escapethey trudge to not one not two but four relativechoked festivities increasingly mortified to find childhood fears raised adolescent wounds reopened...and their very future together uncertain. As Brad counts the hours to when he can get away from their parents stepparents siblings and an assortment of nieces and nephews Kate is starting to hear the ticking of a different kind of clock. And by the end of the day she is beginning to wonder if their crazy families' choices are not so crazy after all.I would recommend Four Christmases just if you wanna see a cute holiday movie in the theater this year. Vince and Reese had good chemistry and this movie just represents the craziness of having to go to all the families every year for Christmas. There are some really good laughs here and there I loved the scene where Reese played the Virgin Mary and Vince was Joesph in their church play and Reese just gets stage fright and freezes while Vince just makes a fool of himself on stage. Over all this is a cute movie there's nothing special about it but it's worth the look.610".

If you notice the Christmas TV lineup is the same each year and the most modern film usually on the list is THE SANTA CLAUSE 1993. This just goes to show that sadly Hollywood isn't creating Christmas classics as it once did. Perhaps one of these years we will get a Christmas film reminiscent of the ones we love to watch on TV every year but this ain't that year  or at least FOUR CHRISTMASES isn't that film.The problem doesn't lie within the film's premise but in the actual events that play out in the film. Kate and Brad live life with and for each other and that's it. They don't have much contact with their families  where each parent is divorced and some remarried  and each Christmas opt for a tropical vacation telling their families they are doing charity work instead. All in all they are happy with each other but have buried their family issues. However this year they get caught in their lie and are forced to visit each parent individually celebrating a total of four Christmases. In the hands of an able and creative script writer this film could have been quite enjoyable as both Kate and Brad learn to appreciate their families and not exclude certain things  mainly marriage and children  in their lives just because their parents are bad examples of them. Instead each visit with a parent seems to be a drawn out slapstick or sex joke and nothing else and is just not in any way funny or clever.The film suffers from a lack of intelligence and it is shocking that it attracted the star power it did. The star's talents are hardly used and instead the film opts for oversexed relatives ultra violent brothers and insanely disobedient children  who get no reprimanding for their actions. As a genre of film that almost lends itself to families this one missed the mark and is not recommended for the kids. As an adultgeared Christmas film it just isn't funny. Adult humor can be funny and appropriate if there is other substance backing up the film  see 'KNOCKED UP' or 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.' All we are offered in FOUR CHRISTMASES is one boring and uninspired vignette after the next with paperthin character development and uninteresting characters.With rarely an enjoyable moment and an atmosphere that provides almost no Christmas spirit FOUR CHRISTMASES shouldn't be on anyone's list of holiday films. It is the awkward gift given by a relative. You know the type. It comes in a pretty package but upon opening you find that it is a pair of underwear or a sweater that is designed to sit at the back of closets. This film surely will.".

Running a scant 89 minutes it stars no less than five Oscarwinning actors in the standard cookiecutter story of a commitmentphobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Cowritten by firsttimers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who cowrote The Hangover the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad a pair of selfsatisfied upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharptongued banter turns out to be a roleplaying fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket rolls over the city and ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving thirdworld children they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father where his other sons cagefighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his bluecollar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary but he's still angry that she married his best friend who is half her age and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father and this is where the tone gets seriousminded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon  he with his semiimprovised riffing she with her exacting intelligence  would seem to be absurdly mismatched but they spar convincingly even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his hamfisted stage debut. Robert Duvall Mary Steenburgen Sissy Spacek and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau Tim McGraw Carol Kane and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon whose only previous featurelength credit is the critically praised videogame documentary The King of Kong and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADDlevel pacing of the story. The 2009 DVD being released for the holidays doesn't offer much in terms of extras other than two different screen formats.".

In fact the bitter taste from last year's disappointing Fred Claus was still present when my girlfriend said she wanted to see this movie tonight. Of course I cringed at the idea while mildly protesting but eventually gave in with the prospect of secretly indulging in an unspoken I told you so. Only kidding that thought never crossed my mind...Anyways I didn't even really know what this was about before seeing it but it didn't take long for the plot to be outlined after a pretty funny scene at the airport. Basically after 3 years of avoiding spending time with their families on Christmas remember you can't spell families without lies Kate and Brad find themselves in an unfortunate situation this year that forces them to spend Christmas with their divorced parents and very dysfunctional siblings. This concept could go either way for me because I really liked Christmas Vacation but disliked The Family Stone. Fortunately just as it started out great this continued to be more like Christmas Vacation all the way through with several laugh out loud funny dialog and various slapstick that had the whole theater roaring with laughter. One of my favorite parts was a Nativity play where Vince Vaughn effectively delivers some hilarious over the top scenery chewing that had everybody in stitches... well except Kate.As funny as I thought this was it wouldn't be a real Christmas movie without delivering some sort of constructive message among all the chaos. Since I can empathize with Vaughn in his situation with Kate the film's resolution probably had more personal impact for me. I can also understand the criticism that most of the talented cast was wasted in comparison because the family situations were not addressed equally. What I liked the most about the film's brief serious turn is it wasn't syrupy while providing some genuine touching moments thanks to the believable acting skills of Reese Witherspoon Vince Vaughn and of course the two screen legends Bobby DuVall and Jon Voight. Best Christmas movie I've seen since Bad Santa and yes I will listen to my girlfriend's suggestions without being such a Scrooge from now on".

What I liked the most about the film's brief serious turn is it wasn't syrupy while providing some genuine touching moments thanks to the believable acting skills of Reese Witherspoon Vince Vaughn and of course the two screen legends Bobby DuVall and Jon Voight. Best Christmas movie I've seen since Bad Santa and yes I will listen to my girlfriend's suggestions without being such a Scrooge from now on";

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Vince Vaughn is starting to remind me of what Woody Allen went through ... I liked his funny movies. Just wasn't a fan of Wedding Crashers or The Breakup but I certainly recognize his comedic talents. Here his quirks play a little better though I never really bought off on he and Reece Witherspoon as a couple.Low expectations a strong cast a few clever lines easily relatable family strain and a true sight gag make this one enjoyable enough. The trailer gives away the setup of the film as Reece and Vince are forced to visit all four pieces of their disjointed families on Christmas. For some reason director Seth Gordon King of Kong casts Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek as VV's parents and Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen as Reece's. The curiosity stems from the age difference between these actors ... a 1516 year span. Just struck me as odd. Though not quite as odd as Jon Voight offering parental advice. Now THAT is comedy! Despite the hijinx the messages abound we all have the weirdest family it is never easy to really connect with another person and it's always a good time for cheese whiz. This is really VV's film as Reece has little to offer save for the bounce bounce scene. Mr. Vaughn is truly at his best in the moments of rapid fire dialogue as he helplessly tries to avoid another ridiculous situation.One warning to parents the film is rated PG13 and there is a segment regarding the Santa secret so be forewarned. The unwritten rule is broken. The quick lines and uncomfortable family moments make this one worth a few giggles. Not a Christmas classic but a decent comedy.I must mention the tribute to the classic A Christmas Story as the kids peer into the toy store window early on. That scene is followed by the airport scene where the ticket agent is played by none other than Peter Billingsley a grown up Ralphie from that movie and producer of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "O come all ye faithful. That certainly seems to be the attitude that studios have at the holidays sputtering out yearly Christmas flicks and luring all the little 'children' to their theatres made of gingerbreadno matter how godawful that movie may be. Those thinking that Four Christmases must be four times the fun of a normal Christmas movie are about to get a truckload of coal at their front door because you'll receive nothing but four times the pain four times the tripe and four times the garbage.2008 marks the second year in a row a Vince Vaughn yuletide film has met the silver screen. I will not claim to have seen Fred Claus but I can honestly not envision it being any worse and if it is then all those involved must simply hate the holiday season. Ironically it truly is the films gimmick that is its greatest determent. Of course if the film had been remotely funny then this would have been an asset but being forced slog through two hours of atrocious slapstick and mean spirited comedy is not how I wish to spend my valuable vacation time. With such talent involved the absolute failure of Four Christmases is all the more lasting and if not for Vince Vaughn who gets the films only and very very few laughs the Grinch himself would have loved it.Following the only clever scene in the film in which Brad Vince Vaughan and Kate Reese Witherspoon meet in a bar although not to the end which you may expect they plan their annual holiday trip down south for sun relaxation and as an added bonus an ocean between them an their families. But following heavy fog in their home city of San Francisco their flight is delayed and thanks to a pesky reporter are featured on the news which of course their families are watching. Thus begins the hilarity with the duo visiting each of their four divorced parents including Brad's father an awful Robert Duvall his professional fighter brothers Denver an awful John Favreau and Dallas Tim McGraw and his mother Sissy Spacek. And on the other side Kate's mother Mary Steenburgen her baby loving sister Courtney Kristin Chenoweth and father Jon Voight who adds the only gravitas to the film. As the couple hops from home to home their relationship is put to the test. Will they learn the true meaning of family?In its wholeness Four Christmases is really a spiteful and mean spirited film where all the characters do is fight. Kate and Brad fight Kate and Brad fight with their families and their families fight amongst themselves and I for one don't want to be watching material like that around what is supposed to be a joyous time of year. They openly avoid their families and their families really want nothing to do with them. Not a single person in this film seems like a real person and never encounter problems or family quirks that might hit home and really people if it does take your family to see a shrink in addition to having no characters which are in any way likable. I mean this truthfully after the first Christmas I was ready to leave and the same slapstick surfaces again and again like the appetizer you accidentally dropped in the egg nog at an open house Baby spittle scenes UFC takedowns and crude sexist jokes seem to make up this films backbone.A few times throughout Four Christmases the quip You can't spell families without lies appears. If this is what the Christmastime spirit is going to embody in the future of Hollywood then you might as well just shove the ol' tannenbaum in the trash right now which coincidently is exactly where this piece of dreck belongs as well.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

Ironically it truly is the films gimmick that is its greatest determent. Of course if the film had been remotely funny then this would have been an asset but being forced slog through two hours of atrocious slapstick and mean spirited comedy is not how I wish to spend my valuable vacation time. With such talent involved the absolute failure of Four Christmases is all the more lasting and if not for Vince Vaughn who gets the films only and very very few laughs the Grinch himself would have loved it.Following the only clever scene in the film in which Brad Vince Vaughan and Kate Reese Witherspoon meet in a bar although not to the end which you may expect they plan their annual holiday trip down south for sun relaxation and as an added bonus an ocean between them an their families. But following heavy fog in their home city of San Francisco their flight is delayed and thanks to a pesky reporter are featured on the news which of course their families are watching. Thus begins the hilarity with the duo visiting each of their four divorced parents including Brad's father an awful Robert Duvall his professional fighter brothers Denver an awful John Favreau and Dallas Tim McGraw and his mother Sissy Spacek. And on the other side Kate's mother Mary Steenburgen her baby loving sister Courtney Kristin Chenoweth and father Jon Voight who adds the only gravitas to the film. As the couple hops from home to home their relationship is put to the test. Will they learn the true meaning of family?In its wholeness Four Christmases is really a spiteful and mean spirited film where all the characters do is fight. Kate and Brad fight Kate and Brad fight with their families and their families fight amongst themselves and I for one don't want to be watching material like that around what is supposed to be a joyous time of year. They openly avoid their families and their families really want nothing to do with them. Not a single person in this film seems like a real person and never encounter problems or family quirks that might hit home and really people if it does take your family to see a shrink in addition to having no characters which are in any way likable. I mean this truthfully after the first Christmas I was ready to leave and the same slapstick surfaces again and again like the appetizer you accidentally dropped in the egg nog at an open house Baby spittle scenes UFC takedowns and crude sexist jokes seem to make up this films backbone.A few times throughout Four Christmases the quip You can't spell families without lies appears. If this is what the Christmastime spirit is going to embody in the future of Hollywood then you might as well just shove the ol' tannenbaum in the trash right now which coincidently is exactly where this piece of dreck belongs as well.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com";

I kept hoping something really funny would happen but it never did. I feel like Reese Witherspoon was wasted in this movie. I have loved most of her movies but she should have bowed out of this one. As for Vince Vaughn I keep wondering why he is so popular. Also the scene in the church was disgustingly bad and for those who know the true meaning of Christmas it was an insult.".

The presumed payoff is that they become partly reconciled to their families and we assume keep them in their lives. It was therefore a cynical surprise that the last scene made it obvious that Witherspoon  Vaughn's characters had reverted to type.

	schema:headline " A dangerously halfcooked turkey dinner.";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah the Christmas movie is there anything more fitting and resembling of its subject matter when it comes to big screen adaptations? Much like the holiday season itself however one can't assume absolute objectivity Christmas is undoubtedly a holiday that is about family joy and celebration and yet there are hordes of people who anticipate the ringing on sleigh bells with about as much excitement as a turkey waiting to be put into an oven. Four Christmases surprisingly accommodates this somewhat polarising aspect of the holiday during its initial stages but then promptly spirals into clich storytelling for the sake of proving a warm and fuzzy ending to melt the bitter snow in our hearts. What's most surprising however is that the movie's sugary latter half actually works a whole lot better than its former as director Seth Gordon never quite hits the ball on his intended edgy comedy routines. In the end what you end up with is something akin to a dangerously halfcooked turkey dinner that has its moments and yet fails to satisfy because of the amount of picking you have to do. It's standard Christmastime affair that will be sure to mildly please those who are into such a thing but for the rest of us it's just another thing on the list to avoid.The name of the game this time around is yes you guessed it family. Well that and dysfunction of course. Four Christmases a movie about finding out about the real joys of life which resolve to be not exotic holidays or gifts but real honest companionship never goes anywhere new with what it has to say if you've seen any number of cookiecutter Christmas movies you've pretty much seen this. To its advantage and at times disadvantage the script penned by a whole array of writers I'm not even going to bother listing does broaden its horizons with comedy that stays true to the sub genre's atypical formula but branches off with a little more risqu material. As to whether or not the risks reap any rewards is something of a mixed bag there are moments when Four Christmases is genuinely funny and the performances do well to get this across but with far too many misses and an overwhelming lack of such instances the movie certainly isn't going to have you out of your seat. That of course doesn't mean that there isn't fun to be had here because there is this is a feature that is bound to lightly amuse more than cause a ruckus of laughter and for that there is a certain amount of praise warranted.Where Four Christmases slips up quite often though lies in the tepid romance that is supposed to be getting some analytical treatment here. The story of Brad and Kate is not a new one madly in love for three years the two have been sharing a life of luxury together for a long time now and yet never really got to know each other in the process. The movie opens with a rather striking sequence that even shows the two roleplaying in public as cooked up personas which is interesting considering how little time they have spent getting to know each other. Of course this is an interesting premise but little is done to capitalise on it script wise. When it comes to the performances of Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon the dynamism and chemistry is just as rigid and dead there is no believable spark present and no genuine moments of heartwarming romance. In fact the most believable moments that occur between Vaughn and Witherspoon is when they are at odds with each other again this plays into the movie's much more engaging comedic edge but does little to pad out the silliness. On their own the two thespians provide great performances respectively but brought together there's an imbalance that never quite allows either of them to connect.If there's one thing that the movie does get right however it's conveying the frantic chaos inherent to the holiday especially when it comes to family celebrations and gettogethers. Of course it's standard fare that has been done countless other times in far greater features but in amongst the many problems that Four Christmases suffers from such moments of awkward and often slapstick family confrontations fulfil their purpose of tickling the audience far greater than any of the other lacking elements. For a Christmas movie it's not bad but it's not great either throwing in sporadic comedy and fun with lukewarm romance and lazy plotting Four Christmases isn't anything new for holiday movie lovers to soak up but it certainly isn't anything to loose any sleep over either. Instead it simply exists as a throw away for a couple of hours of silly entertainment to lighten the spirits it may not do its job coherently but it does so enough to satisfy those that target such affairs.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

Old Shatterland and his faithful halfbrother are on the trail to discover the gold charge . In spite of troubles caused by bandits led by Murdock Rik Battaglia who acted as good guy in Winnitou and Old Firehand and a Sioux chief  Winnetou's enemy they get escape . Old Shatterhand set out on pursuit of the bandits and prepares them a trap . But when Shatterhand rides for Sioux help against Murdock's gang who captured their companions he finds the tribe's friendly chief succeeded by his hostile son Red Buffalo Voyo Goric who starred various Indian roles who proves to be a dangerous enemy . Winnitou then fights against Red Buffalo in an exciting combat . Mabel's party eventually reaches the dangerous Valley of snakes and after that the Valley of Death which holds the answers to the mystery of the missing father and hidden gold . At the end takes place a silly epilogue by means of explosions and fire with no much sense .This is a passable episode about one of the series of popular German made Western  featuring the duo formed by valiant Old Shatterhand who agrees to guide the motley group trough Osage Indian territory and immortal Winnetou  both of them repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always .

	schema:reviewBody "Winnetou und Shatterhand im Tal der Toten or The Valley of Death is the last Germanlanguage Winnetou film from the 1960s and also the way it all ended unless you count the Winnetou film Brice made 30 years later. This one has him and Lex Barker once again reunited and the good thing is that they have a lot more screen time than in previous films that were actually no real Winnetou films anymore. Another good thing is that it runs for under 90 minutes so stays pretty essential. But this is also all the positive there is. I must say I was not too impressed by anything in here other than the landscapes once again but then again I am not the greatest Winnetou film fan at all. Harald Reinl is back as writer and director and maybe this is a reason why the film did not suck altogether as we was extremely successful and among Germany's most known filmmakers for a long time. He was at the age of 60 when this film came out and it was briefly before his Oscar nomination. In terms of the story and scriptplot I would say that it is about on par with most of the previous films. If you liked these go check it out. I personally did not like them that much but I must say that I have seen a lot worse from the franchise. And there are the usual faces again. Ralf Wolter and Rik Battaglia are joined by the stunning Karin Dor as female lead this time. As a whole I give this one a thumbsdown but looking at how this is already the 11th movie it is still surprisingly bearable.".

It is his very calmness and seeming omnipotence that make his emotional outbursts when they come that much more intense and painful for audiences.  He brings to the story the delicate sense of ironic humanity that comes from someone who may not actually lay claim to being human.Jeff Bridges provides the warm tired cynical but still hopeful center of the film that provides reality to Spacey's quiet otherworldliness.  Jeff Bridges is the much needed Everyman of this movie who is like so many of us out there intelligent wanting to do the right thing essentially a good person at heart who is perhaps little lost and a LOT tired of the shackling nature of every day life in a first world nation.  He asks the hard questions he clings to his perceived reality.  But he also wants to help.

I can't see it raking in buzillions of dollars despite the fact that far FAR less worthy films do that every summer.  Instead it will carry along fondly or even maniacally supported by lovers of the film by word of mouth quietly finding a new audience and making change where ever it goes.  It's a gentle engaging quiet film that punches viewers between the eyes not through editing action or shouting but through that most basic and often forgotten art of cinema finding a strong story and just letting it tell itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "KPax is a very intriguing film.  Is Prot Kevin Spacey really an alien or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien?  That is the question that Dr. Powell Jeff Bridges must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth.As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered both theories grow in credibility.  His ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess.  Yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration.  The ending seems to give the answer but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. Normally I don't like lady or tiger endings but this one is tantalizing. I have my own theory that fits all the clues but I don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's.Director Iain Softley Wings of the Dove' spins the tale delicately with great skill.  This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate.  This is not to say that the directing is technically inferior because it is excellent.  However Softley remains unobtrusive delivering great power through the use of subtlety a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream Look how brilliant I am!'Kevin Spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as Prot.  This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding requiring Spacey to render the cool and logical Prot one minute and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next.  Spacey is so believable as both alien and human it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult.  Jeff Bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot.This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer.  I rated it a 910. If you must have closure at the end of a film this movie will be very frustrating.  However if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits you won't be disappointed.".

	onyx:emotionText "KPax is a very intriguing film.  Is Prot Kevin Spacey really an alien or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien?  That is the question that Dr. Powell Jeff Bridges must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth.As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered both theories grow in credibility.  His ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess.

Totally different than anything I had seen before leaving far to many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say I loved it. This morning was the first time I'd watched in in probably 23 years and I still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in top form as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. The supporting cast are near perfect as well each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. The open ending was handled very well giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end. How this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's Oscars is beyond me. If you haven't seen this film run to WalMart RIGHT NOW. The DVD is usually in the bargain bin pick it up! 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Life is comprised of infinite possibilities some known others a mystery and destined to remain so.  And what of the vast unknown the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters?  Who is to say what exists or what is possible?  Valid questions all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic in KPAX' directed by Iain Softley and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges.  In the wake of an incident in New York's Central Station a man named Prot Spacey is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan where he is delivered into the care of Dr. Mark Powell Bridges who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient who claims to be from the distant planet KPAX.  It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell as Prot with his calm direct forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce he eats bananas peels and all and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites is quite convincing.  But it's Powell's job as well as his nature to be skeptical. Prot's claims however remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell who finds himself in something of a quandary Prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for KPAX a scheduled return trip that allows Powell but a short time to sort it all out.  And Powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly if he is ever going to know the truth.  And he has to know.  The truth after all is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind.Softley has created and delivered a sensitive thoughtprovoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding Prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is in fact possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement you are able to identify with Powell seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him.  Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot just may be what he says he is.  And in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around.  How do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves?  While at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident not only in Prot but in Dr. Powell as well.  All of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama.As we've come to expect Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot presenting his character from the inside out emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time.  This is a unique individual and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself.  For this film to work it is essential that we believe who and what Prot is we do and it does. Spacey simply pulls it off magnificently.  It's a memorable performance from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long long time.Jeff Bridges meanwhile emerges on equal footing with Spacey adeptly making a very real person of Dr. Powell.  It's a fairly straightforward role and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right which opposite the character of Prot was no small task.  And again for this film to work it was necessary for Bridges to rise to the occasion.  And with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is he succeeds without question.  Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity and is so giving in his performance that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant and at times intense.  It's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring.  It's a great job by Bridges who never attempts to steal the spotlight from Prot which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch.The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack Rachel Alfre Woodard Dr. Villers Ajay Naidu Dr. Naidiu Vincent Laresca Navarro Kimberly Scott Joyce Conchata Ferrell Betty and Saul Williams Ernie.  An entertaining emotionally involving film KPAX' is a dissertation on possibilities as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition.  It's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it.  In the end it makes you realize just how real KPAX is and it makes you appreciate Prot's journey and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us human or alien.  And it may just make you reflect upon your own journey where you've been and where you're going.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.".

This film is very funny and Kevin Spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature. KPAX is a smart film and I wasn't expecting it to go where it did.  In the end I found myself thinking about the small things in life and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted.  I left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside and for families and couples on a date KPAX is a splendid film that will not disappoint.

He claims to be an alien gets locked in mental institute understandably and knows all sorts of things he shouldn't know about astrophysics.So is he an alien or isn't he? The psychiatrist played by Bridges tries to find out but the question is ultimately left for the viewer to decide. That is what I love about the movie it doesn't preach. It doesn't demand us to believe in Prot. But at the same time the movie does raise some questions. Do we really know how the universe works? What if  that is the question this movie wants to  and manages to  raise.Then you have the ending which isn't Hollywoodlike it only slightly touches the usual clichs about family and stuff yet it is hartwarming and beautiful in its own silly way. I won't go deep into it so I won't spoil it for anyone but please watch closely throughout the movie and be prepared to use your brains a bit at the end.The movie also plays a lot with audiovisual stuff. Beams of light are shown throughout the movie accompanied with beautiful piano music perhaps because Prot allegedly arrived on our planet with a beam of light. This play with light makes the movie a subtly beautiful experience.Altogether this is an incredible work of art.So you have all this  and what do the critics say? Most of them simply call it crp and if they bother to explain why they think this way they mumble something about this movie belonging neither to the scifi genre nor to the psychological drama genre like the critic of the Guardian magazine. Well get this to your heads A GOOD STORY DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A CLEARLY DETERMINED GENRE.I repeat in case the professional critics didn't quite understand what I said.A GOOD STORY DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A......Ahh what's the use.

The movie never fall to a lower level  the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely wanna know how it ends what's about Prot... You have to think a lot after the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions... Is Robert Porter Prot or is Prot only using Robert Porters body as a means of transportation. How can he see uvlight and how can he know that much about astrology. But everybody can make his own end and can decide in what he wanna believe. Very good movie with an excellent Kevin Spacey!".

Bridges makes an excellent doctor you want to tell him what's on your mind and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role.The interaction between Prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour.The ending is bittersweet  I like Prot's choice but the final scenes with Bridges made me teary.".

It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm  the world is in disarray and is 'bright' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees but Prot sees truth  he sees the minute  and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly.The film is particularly detailed therefore I would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how Softley interjects nuances.

	schema:headline " Alien? Or delusional human?";
	schema:reviewBody "By sheer chance I stumbled on this movie searching movies starring Kevin Spacey who is a terrific actor. I also found the storyline intriguing so I rented the DVD. I'm glad I did. I give this movie 910. Why? Because it's a very good movie. It's not a typical Hollywood blow'emupshoot'emup. It doesn't rely on CGI or even special effects to puff it up. What makes it a good movie then? It has an intriguing idea and a good script to go on. It has very good actors and good direction. But most of all it is a compelling story of a very strange man who may or may not be an alien.A man Kevin Spacey appears seemingly out of nowhere in Grand Central Station in New York City. A woman is robbed by two hoodlums and this man tries to help her off the floor. In the scuffle the police arrive. At first they think the man robbed the woman but a witness steps forward to clear him. But he gives the police such strange answers to their questions that soon he finds himself in the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan where he's assigned to resident psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell Jeff Bridges. Dr. Powell determines the man's name is Prot inexplicably pronounced to rhyme with notewhy not just spell it Prote? and he claims to come from the planet KPax which lies about 1000 lightyears away in the Constellation Lyra. Powell of course thinks Prot's delusional and prescribes medication for him but mysteriously it has no effect on him. Dr. Powell claims Prot is the most convincing delusional he's ever handled. But through several hypnotic sessions he sees emerge a more human side to Prot. Soon Prot is making a significant positive effect on the other patients. He tells them he's returning to KPax on July 27 2001 a planet he's described to them as an idyllic and peaceful place and tells each one he will take one of them back with him. Soon all the patients are vying with each other to compose an essay why he or she should accompany Prot to KPax.At a lawn party he's hosted Dr. Powell talks about Prot to an astrophysicist friend and tells him of Prot's claim to come from a distant solar system. The man is intrigued. Dr. Powell asks him for some questions with which he can query Prot to test his claim. Prot comes through in flying colors. Based on his answers he's invited to be interviewed by a group of astrophysicists and astronomers. He blows them over with his intricate knowledge about the solar system and its two suns from which he claims to come. Does Prot really come from KPax? Or is he a savant who has the capability to rapidly master the intricate knowledge of a field that only specialists would know? At another lawn party Dr. Powell hosts Prot attends. An incident with a water sprinkler system causes Prot to lose it. Dr. Powell sees in this Prot's human side showing through and become convinces Prot is from planet Earth like everyone else. Through a little sleuthing he traces Prot to a small town in New Mexico where he identifies him as Robert Porter a man who had worked in the local stockyard as the man who stunned cattle before they were slaughtered. Porter lived a quiet isolated life with his wife Sarah and daughter Rebecca. One day a drifter stopped by and raped and then murdered Sarah and murdered Rebecca. Porter discovered the drifter and killed him in a fit of rage. Then according to the official record he died by drowning in the local river although his body was never found. The date all this happened was July 27 1996. Suddenly Dr. Powell sees the significance of Prot telling everyone he's returning to KPax on July 27 2001. Dr. Powell is now convinced something very serious is going to occur on the fifth anniversary of the deaths of ProtPorter's wife and children. The date comes. ProtPorter turns catatonic. One patient a young woman who never spoke to anyone is found missing. The movie ends with Dr. Powell pushing a catatonic ProtPorter in a wheel chair implying to him he knows what happened to the missing young woman. ProtPorter has a cockeyed grin on his face. Is he Porter? Or Prot's human shell Robert Porter's body after Prot's departed with the young woman to KPax? Well who knows? Normally I don't care for ambiguous endings but this one worked OK.It was interesting to see a young Aaron Paul Jesse Pinkman of Breaking Bad playing a cameo role as Dr. Powell's estranged son.NOTE The Constellation Lyra's major stars are about 1000 lightyears away. Dr. Powell remarks this is quite far away. But in terms of the Milky Way galaxy whose diameter is 100000 lightyears a 1000 lightyears away is not really far in galactic terms. Any star found within 1000 lightyears radius of our sun would be considered a member of our stellar neighborhood.910".

In THE MATRIX will be believe one can travel between reality and virtual reality? In SUPERMAN STARMAN  and E.T. will we believe that a being from another planet can visit us and interact with us? The answer is perhaps obvious yes if we are to become immersed in the story and enjoy the film.This film KPAX is just like that. If one sits down to it and buys into the premise that it is possible for Prot to be from a faraway planet called KPAX then it is a totally absorbing film. One of the best I have seen in a long time. Ultimately this film isn't about aliens or space travel it is about the human condition and about finding out what is really important to us. The character Prot is a catalyst in this story and it doesn't matter in the end whether he really is from KPax.some possible SPOILERS  On my second viewing of KPAX tonight I took careful note of everything that was said and presented. When you do so there should be no residual doubt that Prot in this story really is a KPAXian. An alien who is completely harmless and who is more like a guardian angel than anything else. One who can travel anywhere he wants on a beam of light taking one and only one person with him. Through most of the story he takes the catatonic Porter with him. At 551AM on July 27th 2001 he returns to KPAX leaves Porter behind in the care of the good doctor and takes one of the patients with him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Iain Softley's KPAX starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges is a very special movie. Softley's humanity tale taught by an alien or not finds solid material in Charles Leavitt's screenplay based on the novel by Gene Brewer. Under his direction Softley generates from what could have been an entirely starpowered vehicle by Spacey and Bridges into a touching and inspiring experience. Spacey plays Prot who arrives at a New York train station. During an incident Prot proclaims that he is from another planet and consequently committed to a local mental institution. He is assigned under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell Bridges who is intrigued by Prot's conviction or delusion that he is from the planet KPAX a thousand light years away. Mark's interest in his patient highlights he is a workaholic. This has alienated his second wife Rachel and Mark also has a son in college from his first wife that he has not spoken to in years. Is Prot really from KPAX? The movie takes an interesting turn when Prot gives Mark's brotherinlaw Dr. Steve Becker a good Brian Howe and his world class astrophysics colleagues a lesson on his home world or is this to be believed? KPAX asks the interesting questions. Marks asks Prot about laws on his planet. Prot says All beings know right and wrong. That ends up being an endearing theme of KPAX. It about getting life to work. There is a great partnership between Spacey and Bridges. Spacey's Prot is definitely the more showy of the two roles though one depends on the other much like Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise in Rain Man. Jeff Bridges is acknowledged. His Mark Powell is genuinely dealing with his life which isn't working and coaching his patient who is also contributing to him. Bridges brings such a level of compassion conviction and intelligence to his role. Kevin Spacey is awesome. He gives Prot the questionable inhuman edge aloof intelligent though connected to people. His Prot is self aware of the perceptions and is loyal to Bridges's Mark. Spacey does an amazing balancing act so effortlessly. Is he human? Spacey keeps us guessing. along the way Spacey may get another Oscar. The strong supporting cast is lead by Mary McCormack as Mark's nearly estranged wife and Alfre Woodard as Mark's boss. In the end KPAX is a movie about getting it right and it also does so itself.".

The plot itself is simple  Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient Prot who claims to be from the planet Kpax who arrived to Earth by a beam of light while Dr. Powell played by Jeff Bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions... First of all I must admit the cast is perfectly chosen Kevin Spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of Prot always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not... Some of the gem scenes include the one where Prot innocently eats the whole banana even the peal while in session with Dr. Powell or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the KPax system to the astonished astronomers... Jeff Bridges on the other hand is the subtle rational side of this movie and he delivers it perfectly. There is a whole other cast of excellent actors like Saul Williams' convincing performance as Ernie who make this film truly work.Kpax has it all elements of comedy SciFi even psychological thriller concerning the Prot's identity but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama. The main premise of the movie is quite intricate but the director never lets it get loose he always keeps it believable and yet twoways interpretable. The camera and photography have almost a crucial part here continuing the main idea of light travel there is much focus on lightshadow play lightning settings  one of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell holds a crystal figure in his office which refracts light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true? Subtle and slow paced intriguing and pleasurable Kpax is truly a gem to watch one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes but those who see it  might fall in love with it.".

It is a pity because i like Kevin Spacey. But watching so obviously a copy made me feel uncomfortable and ended up hating it. You cant beat or steal a classic. Plus this movie seems to lack some of the deep and uncomfortable questions that the original creates in the viewer the story is sort of bleached.

Upon discovering that Biolystock had extorted 2000.00 from his last Broadway flop Bloom simply on a whim mentions to Biolystock that he could've made a fortune on the flop if he'd only gotten more money from the old ladies. Needless to say this revelation gets Max's mind workingget the old ladies to invest 1000000 on what Biolystock knows will be a surefire flop then run off with the excess cash! Max convinces the gullible Leo to join him on the scheme and off the two men go on a crusade to produce the biggest disaster Broadway has ever seen. They come across a godawful work written by a former Nazi Kenneth Mars called Springtime For Hitler and decide to produce it. If it's a flop Max  Leo will become rich. But if it's a hit they'll go to jail....If you're one of the infinite many who've been unable to secure any of those scorchinghot tickets to Mel Brooks' current Broadway phenomenon The Producers there's always this the original 1968 movie version to watch  enjoy. This Oscarwinner for Best Screenplay is a comedy classic and easily Mel Brooks' masterpiece a brilliantly funny film that hasn't aged a bit. Zero Mostel  Gene Wilder are hilarious  perfectly cast as the conartist producers with terrific chemistry between them just their opening scene together including the great bits about Leo's blue blanket and Leo terrified of being jumped on by Max is already one of the great filmed moments of comic acting. Kudos all around to the rest of the cast too Kenneth Mars as the deranged Nazi playwright of Springtime For Hitler Christopher Hewett as the notalent gay director who only makes Springtime even more misguided than it already is Dick Shawn in an outrageous performance as L.S.D. the hippie ham who lands the coveted role of Hitler his audition song Love Power is a major highlight and the gorgeous Lee Meredith as Ulla Max  Leo's dimwitted secretary. And then there's the Springtime For Hitler production number itselfyes it's everything you've ever heard about it a wonderfully hysterical you gotta see it to believe it moment in film comedy.Mel Brooks' direction is spot on and his hysterical screen writing here has never been better though his cowriting with Gene Wilder on Young Frankenstein comes close. His Oscar win for the screenplay was very well deserved indeed. The Producers is a timeless comedy classic and the defining moment of Mel Brooks' long illustrious film career.".

They come across a godawful work written by a former Nazi Kenneth Mars called Springtime For Hitler and decide to produce it. If it's a flop Max  Leo will become rich. But if it's a hit they'll go to jail....If you're one of the infinite many who've been unable to secure any of those scorchinghot tickets to Mel Brooks' current Broadway phenomenon The Producers there's always this the original 1968 movie version to watch  enjoy. This Oscarwinner for Best Screenplay is a comedy classic and easily Mel Brooks' masterpiece a brilliantly funny film that hasn't aged a bit. Zero Mostel  Gene Wilder are hilarious  perfectly cast as the conartist producers with terrific chemistry between them just their opening scene together including the great bits about Leo's blue blanket and Leo terrified of being jumped on by Max is already one of the great filmed moments of comic acting. Kudos all around to the rest of the cast too Kenneth Mars as the deranged Nazi playwright of Springtime For Hitler Christopher Hewett as the notalent gay director who only makes Springtime even more misguided than it already is Dick Shawn in an outrageous performance as L.S.D. the hippie ham who lands the coveted role of Hitler his audition song Love Power is a major highlight and the gorgeous Lee Meredith as Ulla Max  Leo's dimwitted secretary. And then there's the Springtime For Hitler production number itselfyes it's everything you've ever heard about it a wonderfully hysterical you gotta see it to believe it moment in film comedy.Mel Brooks' direction is spot on and his hysterical screen writing here has never been better though his cowriting with Gene Wilder on Young Frankenstein comes close. His Oscar win for the screenplay was very well deserved indeed. The Producers is a timeless comedy classic and the defining moment of Mel Brooks' long illustrious film career.";

Mel Brooks' The Producers his most sustained and inspired piece of lunacy!Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel have amazing chemistry as meek accountant Leo Bloom and scheming Broadway producer Max Bialystock. Max seduces little old ladies for checks and when Leo comes into his office one day he finds that a producer can make more money with a flop instead of a hit. They decide to do his ploy and create the world's worst play Springtime for Hitler a gay romp with Adolf and Eva and meet interesting characters including author Franz Liebkind Kenneth Mars director Roger DeBris Christopher Hewett and their Hitler Lorenzo St.DuBois aka L.S.D. Dick Shawn.What makes this comedy such a gem is its mixture of types of comedy. There is slapstick there's satire there's bad taste and everything but the kitchen sink! The scenes I have seen so many times but what makes me love them is how they mainly Wilder play their roles. Wilder is somewhat crazy and relies on his blanket to calm himself down. Not only does he have comic perfection he's a darned good actor to boot! Mostel is great as the wouldbe sleazy loserproducer with eye movements that put Silent Bob to shame and a great voice.The songs in it are great also. Two of them were written by Brooks himself Springtime for Hitler' with which I have auditioned for a role in a musical with and Prisoners of Love'. They're both very funny real Brooksian note to MerriamWebster include that word right next to blingbling'. It's not exactly a musical but The Producers is in a class of its own.

Mostel's seduction of the old the awful and the ugly has no equal in movie physical comedy.The scheme put on the worst flop imaginable and when it closes virtually after opening night the two scammers snare riches the investments they don't have to return.

And Max and Leo are clearly Jewish in character if not so openly identified.Kenneth Mars grabs laughs as the author of Springtime for Hitler an unreconstructed Hitleradoring flake who raises pigeons on the roof of a Manhattan tenement while accoutered in the odd leftovers of Wehrmacht uniforms.When I fitted in seeing The Producers in its opening week I sat in the middle of an audience that was to a certain extent as befuddled as the film's playgoers watching the first part of the intendedtooutrage musical comedy about the Third Reich. Not only were SS uniforms swastikas and photos of Hitler on the stage but the movie theater audience also digested perhaps for the first time a sendup of an uproarious gay couple two real queens. One is effeminate to the core the other is a crossdresser and a faultlessly garish one at that. This kind of stuff hadn't been done before in a Hollywood flick.1968's audience had many who wellremembered World War II and some had fought in the conflict. I knew people who admitted feeling that the horrific global battle against Hitler had been trivialized by Brooks and his extroverted cast  until they could no longer hold back guffaws that segued rapidly into uncontrolled laughter.That The Producers is also now a runaway Broadway hit is no surprise and I'd love to see a DVD release with Lane and Broderick. However fine they would be it's the original that broke barriers. The DVD has a number of worthwhile features including a fascinating Making of... segment. Peter Seller's short famous encomium is read and there are the usual other additions. An outtake presenting an alternative blowup of the Springtime for Hitler theater is interesting largely because it shows how perceptive Brooks was in scrapping it for the shorter scene actually used.The Producers is in some ways a subversive movie. Without stridently proclaiming a new aesthetic it is exactly that and so it's a timeless classic. This is not satire about Nazism Hitler and the Third Reich. It's treating as suitable material for slapstick and quick gags the detritus of an evil time.But it's also a bit dated no subject is taboo today for comedic treatment and many who see it for the first time as my teenage son did tonight will enjoy the movie without getting the full impact of its assault on conventionality.Is there any historical topic that will not in the passage of time be employed for pure comedy? Is it possible that the next generation will laugh at a comedy parodying Auschwitz? I hope not but I also can't be sure.Many years ago I refused to watch Hogan's Heroes on TV because I personally knew former U.S. POWs. But that show with Werner Klemperer as Colonel Klink was very popular. Hogan's Heroes was to TV what The Producers was and is to film. And both made a mark that will be emulated as future generations go beyond satire to humorous treatment of matters most today consider beyond the pale of acceptability as a vehicle for laughs.1010".

It's hard to fault the antagonistic partnership of the two main characters and are played so well. The actor who played Hitler in the show was so bizarre that it worked much like the play 'springtime for Hitler' was to the audience I presume! The only character I thought was unnecessary was the babbling 'oldschool' Nazi but you could argue that he was necessary for the plot to move forward.Overall great lighthearted fun.".

The actor who played Hitler in the show was so bizarre that it worked much like the play 'springtime for Hitler' was to the audience I presume! The only character I thought was unnecessary was the babbling 'oldschool' Nazi but you could argue that he was necessary for the plot to move forward.Overall great lighthearted fun.";

Leave it to writerdirector Mel Brooks to answer that and answer it he does in the uproarious comedy The Producers.'  Zero Mostel stars as the producer in question one Max Bialystock with Gene Wilder costarring as Leo Bloom the meek accountant who steers Max onto the path to instant riches with a scheme that in Max's hands simply can't fail.  With Leo on board as his new partner Max embarks upon a search for the perfect script the first step of the plan that will lead them to the pot of gold at the end of the Great White Way.

The Producers' is every bit as funny now as when it debuted in 1968 maybe even funnier it proves that good comedy is timeless and this is comedy at it's best.

	schema:headline " Bad taste is simply saying the truth before it should be said. Mel Brooks";
	schema:reviewBody "In 21st Century America the one feature of The Producers that astounds even today is the boisterous exaggerated confrontational impulsiveness of its two lead performances. But in 1968 the film's content was like a suicide bombing of the audience's idea of good manners. There's such greed in its heroes such merry deceit such eagerness to concede every ethic that the 1968 audience just had to surrender stick with it. How did Brooks get away with that? By proving the dishonorable struggle of both lead characters at the start by casting them with actors you couldn't help liking. Mostel's Max Bialystock is a man whose yearnings are so measureless they exonerate his voracity. There's a scene where he rubs his grubby office window with coffee peeps through the dirt sees a white RollsRoyce and shouts That's it baby! When you've got it flaunt it! You can drink a tall glass of his gluttonous selfindulgence. Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt! It's characteristic of this movie that after he says the line he rips off the belt tears it to smithereens.Mostel a distinguished thespian blacklist foil and academic here gives a tour de force of low comedy. Regardless of a combover that starts just above his clavicle he propels buoyant egotism spitting on his hand to slick back his hair before an elderly female investor enters for her weekly frolic. What Mostel propels in particular is unreserved selfassurance. He never has doubts. Maybe he never thinks at all just simply carries on out of evolutionary necessity.Wilder was a fresh mug in 1968 familiarized to audiences with a significant supporting role in Bonnie and Clyde a year before also as a rather hysterical character. His performance in The Producers is a tinge short of cardiac arrest. On the floor with Mostel over him he shrieks Don't jump! Don't jump! Mostel begins to leap in a flurry. I'm hysterical! I'm hysterical! Mostel pours a glass of water and chucks it in his face. Wilder serves a perfect line I'm wet! I'm hysterical and I'm wet! I'm in pain and I'm wet and I'm still hysterical! Gene and Zero reel on the floor so violently we expect them to chew on one another. Mostel's so overexcited and feral Wilder so flustered and frantic you marvel that slobber didn't get on the camera lens. The entire movie's toned on that plane of turbulent anxiety. One of the delights of watching it is to see how the actors are able to manage timing and distinctions even while shrieking. Timing is in the hands of actors but without scripts there would be loads of tedious improvisation. Good timing in the written words is the gateway to good timing on screen. I'm sure we'd be surprised at how snappish the dialogue seems on the page. But Brooks a veteran nightclub act himself leaves space for delivery while simultaneously working economically with form. Characters repeat the last thing another character said to extend the laugh. Characteristic of Brooks that's often what causes the laugh. Language is ecstasy to him.Kenneth Mars is a militant liveaction cartoon up on the roof with his pigeons singing Nazi songs later commanding an audience member to stop laughing because I am the author! I outrank you! Brooks includes gay jokes with the ostentatious couple of Broadway director Roger De Bris and his righthand Carmen Giya. At one point Max Leo and Carmen crowd into a teeny elevator and are ejected breathless and illatease. Heterosexuality's epitomized by the nubile Lee Meredith as Ulla the voluptuous secretary who types one letter at a time then stops for a patontheback smile. The other terrific performance is by Dick Shawn as the actor who plays Hitler. In a movie made at the pinnacle of the hipster era he's a hippie comprised out of archetypal junk scraps with his finger cymbals soup can necklace and kneehigh shag boots.To produce a musical named Springtime for Hitler is naturally in the worst achievable taste as an exiting audience member remarks in the movie to the glee of Bialystock and Bloom who're depending upon precisely that response. To make a movie about such a musical was also in bad taste apparently. It's clear that Bialystock and Bloom are Jewish but they never touch on that. As Franz Liebkind rages they nod because the more repugnant he is the more liable his play will fail. Brooks throws in merely one brief flash to indicate their personal feelings. As the two men walk away from the playwright's apartment Bloom covers the redandblack Nazi armband Franz has given him. All right take off the armband says Bialystock taking off his own. They throw both armbands into a garbage can and spit in it.Whilst jabbing at the troubles of Broadway Brooks' directorial debut's concerned with two overtly Jewish characters who are in the best tradition of Jewish comedy doomed to failure in a film steaming with conflict on every level. Whilst there may be a prominently JewishAmerican sensibility about Brooks' work it's a feature that he's chosen to leave out after this film apart from the Yiddish Native American chief in Blazing Saddles the metal detector scene in High Anxiety occasional comments in To Be or Not To Be and the fictitious trailer for Jews in Space in History of the World Part I. But what he's maintained and what I feelhaving grown up in a family of Brooks fanaticsis what makes a particular generation enjoy him so insatiably is a pure audacity mischievous delight eagerness to leap any bound for a laugh. They'll say Ah comedy today's all eff this eff that fart on this have sex with that. It's all bad taste. And I say look at your boy Mel. He knows better than any of them Bad taste can taste the best.".

Along the road from profitable failure to disastrous success Leo emerges from the shell of his insecure conservatism to become a jaded  and freespirited  fellow manipulator.Although the film often feels somewhat stagebound I'd still argue that it's the most cinematic project I've seen from Brooks. That's partly because here he isn't spoofing a particular genre and adopting its visual style but mostly because of the greater depth and resonance of the characters. I especially enjoyed the seduction scene with Mostel and wilder at the big Parisianstyled fountain  I felt the magic of cinema there in a way that I've never really felt with a Brooks movie before. I felt myself really wishing I could see this in the theater with a bunch of other people instead of at home on DVD with my girlfriend.At times the humor is a bit obvious leaning as Brooks often does on simple puns. But the characters  including supporting ones like Dick Shawn's wasted hippie L.S.D.

The performances are good and the dialog unusually subtle for any comedy.I felt the conclusion was a little bit of a letdown even if it was just Brooks being selfreflexive on the obvious nature of dramatic resolution courtroom scenes are the very definition of obligatory.

	schema:headline " A bittersweet comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The Producers is the most bittersweet of comedies.The year is 1968 23 years after the end of World War II. The scene is New York City where countless Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and Europe survivors of Nazi concentration camps like Auschwitz and relatives who have lost family to the Holocaust live. The horrors of the Holocaust can never be forgotten by those whom it touched in any way but for those who stared evil in the face and lived survival eventually becomes a celebration of life. By turning the Nazi Holocaust into a joke Mel Brooks Zero Mostel Gene Wilder all Jewish of course are thumbing their nose at Hitler saying We're alive and you're not! Such black humor has a long tradition in Judaism a way to maintain sanity in a hateful irrational world. And it has precedent in the 1942 Ernst Lubitsch film To Be Or Not To Be starring Jack Benny. The element of celebration of life gradually comes out in The Producers as Zero teaches Wilder to relax be happy and live a little such as the scene in Central Park in the boat. Wilder says as much in his statement to the jury during sentencing. The little old ladies are hardly complaining either. Yet if you think too hard about the story line and really understand the history behind this it can bring tears to your eyes. How can the sadistic evil murders of more than 6 million Jews and millions of others at the hands of brutal Nazi monsters not? But Mel Brooks is saying It's finally time to let go. He is also making an outrageously funny movie. Brooks appears briefly in the film as one of the dancers with the line Don't be stupid be a smarty come and join the Nazi Party! It reduces Nazism down to its most banal essence. This was Mel Brooks' first film seemingly coming out of nowhere. But he had been one of Sid Caesar's main writers in the early days of live television so he knew what worked in comedy. If you look at a list of comedies from 1968 Funny Girl I Love You Alice B.

So much of the humor is in the expressions of Zero especially the absurd situations and the details like the tacky costumes in Springtime for Hitler. By today's standards I suppose The Producers might seem tame to younger viewers used to shock jocks. Yet The Producers somehow accomplishes the rare feat of being funny the second time you watch it and the third and fourth and .... Thinking about the family I never met that died at the hands of the Nazis of the people I've known that survived the concentration camps of the infinite suffering multiplied by millions always brings tears to my eyes. But The Producers brings a smile to my face just thinking about it. And for a movie about the Nazi Third Reich that is a remarkable feat. For that I say thank you Mel Brooks!".

	onyx:emotionText "The Producers is the most bittersweet of comedies.The year is 1968 23 years after the end of World War II. The scene is New York City where countless Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and Europe survivors of Nazi concentration camps like Auschwitz and relatives who have lost family to the Holocaust live. The horrors of the Holocaust can never be forgotten by those whom it touched in any way but for those who stared evil in the face and lived survival eventually becomes a celebration of life. By turning the Nazi Holocaust into a joke Mel Brooks Zero Mostel Gene Wilder all Jewish of course are thumbing their nose at Hitler saying We're alive and you're not! Such black humor has a long tradition in Judaism a way to maintain sanity in a hateful irrational world. And it has precedent in the 1942 Ernst Lubitsch film To Be Or Not To Be starring Jack Benny. The element of celebration of life gradually comes out in The Producers as Zero teaches Wilder to relax be happy and live a little such as the scene in Central Park in the boat. Wilder says as much in his statement to the jury during sentencing. The little old ladies are hardly complaining either. Yet if you think too hard about the story line and really understand the history behind this it can bring tears to your eyes. How can the sadistic evil murders of more than 6 million Jews and millions of others at the hands of brutal Nazi monsters not? But Mel Brooks is saying It's finally time to let go. He is also making an outrageously funny movie. Brooks appears briefly in the film as one of the dancers with the line Don't be stupid be a smarty come and join the Nazi Party! It reduces Nazism down to its most banal essence. This was Mel Brooks' first film seemingly coming out of nowhere. But he had been one of Sid Caesar's main writers in the early days of live television so he knew what worked in comedy. If you look at a list of comedies from 1968 Funny Girl I Love You Alice B.

	schema:reviewBody "The Producers1968 has three things that make it a pleasurably funny film. One the humorous interreactions between Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.  Two the film's memorable and unforgettable Springtime for Hitler musical number.  Three the energetic and fresh style of the filmmaker Mel Brooks.Mel Brooks does a fantastic job in his masterful film debut as film director.  Blends the crude humor of Blazing Saddles1974 with the subtleness of Young Frankenstein1974.  Brooks's direction is daring and isn't afraid to use material that might be a little risque.  I believe Mel Brooks direction in The Producers1968 is excellent and surpassed only by his more mature direction for Young Frankenstein1974.The screenplay is terrificly good for a comedy of this kind.  Perhaps the best written film by Mel Brooks in his directorial career.  Boasts some original lines of dialogue and strange situations.  The film's screenplay received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplaytoo bad The Producers1968 wasn't considered for Best Picture or Best Director.Gene Wilder was the best alter ego as actor to Mel Brooks as director.  He was in the director's three top films and that is no accident because Gene Wilder always added more laughs to the films of Mel Brooks in which he was in.  The Mel Brooks pictures where Gene Wilder wasn't in lose a lot with the lack of his presence.  In my opinion Gene Wilder worked with Mel Brooks in a way the director has not worked with anyone before or since.The characters of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are opposites in personalities yet they make a perfect duo.  The two leads give brilliant performances in their roles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom.  Two is a number that plays an important role in many of the Mel Brooks films.  In his films there is a leader and an assistent whose plans never work as originally envisioned.A satire on planned failure and unintentional success that was daring for its time.  Deals with how a bad or below average product can be popular due to good fortune.  In the film Max and Leo attempt to produce a failure on Boardway to collect the insurance.  To their chargin the play becomes a big time success.The main idea of the story was eeriely prophetic because today there are many lousy films that are big box office successes.  The Producers1968 message was that people will go to see anything even if the product isn't very good or excellent.  Its funny to see how truthful The Producers1968 was in portraying a certain element of human nature.  To see films like Blair Witch Project1999 or other lousy big hit films become successes shows that The Producers1968 in one way was ahead of its time.I have no intention of watching the Boardway play based on the film for several reasons.  One the actors in the play do not bring the same type of humor or style of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.  Two the story worked much better when written during the late 1960s.  Three anything that has been inspired from film into Boardway usually turns out to be not very good at all.Kenneth Mars rounds out the main cast in a hilarious turn as Franz Liebkind. One of the best sequences is when Max flirts with old women to get their money.  The final scene is another brilliant moment in The Producers1968. The set designs are beautifully constructed and visually depicted.William Hickly makes an obscure appearence in a film before his breakthrough role in Prizzi's Honor1985.  The Producers1968 is Mel Brooks at his best and most enthusiastic.  I can tell the film was made in the late 1960s because of the manners and style of the characters.  A classic comedy made at a time when the cinema took chances and weren't afraid to use its artistic freedom to the fullest extent.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSMel Brooks is a legend. At least he used to be. Whilst writing a lot of classic films throughout his career Brooks was awesome. With The Producers Silent Movie Blazing Saddles Young Frankenstein and others Brooks created a collection of some of the finest spoofcomedy collections of all time. The 1990's were considerably more cruel on Brooks however. With the very average Life Stinks Brooks began on a downward spiral and this was only confirmed more with Robin Hood Men In Tights and Dracula Dead And Loving It. Whilst these two films at the end both featured the gorgeous Amy Yasbeth the scripts were hideous. With these three films under his belt then it seems of little surprise that Brooks would retreat to his first and arguably his finest success The Producers.In this film we are introduced to Max Bialystock the superb late Zero Mostel a washed up Broadway Producer who is forced to fraternise with old ladies as an attempt to get their investment in his plays. Entering into Bialystock's life is Leo Bloom the God that is Gene Wilder a nervous wreck of an accountant who retreats to his blue security blanket the second he is placed in peril. Together they team up to produce a Broadway flop since a flop makes more money when the particular scenario is right. Will Bloom  Bialystock succeed and make their fortune? Or will they screw up in mammoth proportions and end up in prison? This is Mel Brooks it's obvious which of the two options is more likely!Whilst I confess to never seeing Brooks' recent theatrical remake of this film the problem with plays being limited to America I must have seen this original piece countless times. Whilst I confess that nowadays it feels slightly dated it remains hilarious and remains wonderful to this day. In Nostel and Wilder there is a perfect partnership of the brash loud mouth and the quiet withdrawn type. Added to the main partnership are a superb supporting cast of Kenneth Mars Dick Shawn and others. Mars inparticular as the eccentric Nazi writer of Springtime For Hitler the duo's chosen play is hilarious in his extremeness.There's not much more to be said really. The Producers remains one of Brooks' finest pieces of work and I pray that the film remake based on the theatre production is going to be acceptable. Ultimately though even if that remake is dire lets not take away from the original. This film is a beautiful piece of comedy and if you haven't seen it yet then get yourself to the video store straight away.".

We had watched the original movie some time ago and we thought it was quite funny. On second viewing though some of the fun one had that first time seems to have disappeared somehow.

He was a man who could do anything at all and still give an honest performance to everything he did. It was Mr. Mostel's misfortune to have been blacklisted at a time where his career was at an all time high. When film work stopped Mr. Mostel had the theater to go back. Who knows how far this actor would have gone if he hadn't been a victim of the McCarthym that ruined many lives.Zero Mostel made a creation out of Max Bialystock. This was a man who had seen better days in his producing career days and now finds himself dodging his creditors because he doesn't have the money to pay his debts and has to rely in his stable of old ladies for living. Zero Mostel was the perfect man to play this larger than life character.Gene Wilder whose second film this is showed from the beginning to be a genius in the movies. His Leo Bloom was an excellent creation and his chemistry with Zero Mostel seems to be real. The film owes a great deal of its success to Gene Wilder who acts as the straight man.In supporting roles we see Kenneth Mars as the lunatic author of the musical.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a fan of Mel Brooks. At all. For a comedy director I find him painfully unfunny and therefore very difficult to like. The Producers is often cited to be Brooks' best film and for good reason as it is. Although it never reaches the realms of hilarity and quite a few of the gags aren't funny in the slightest it's a breezy little comedy that's based around an amusing idea and is hard to dislike on the whole. The idea is that a Broadway producer can in theory make more money from a flop than he could from a hit. When accountant Leo Bloom Gene Wilder suggests that this could be the case a plan forms in the mind of once great producer Max Bialystock Zero Mostel and we're on course for an amusing ride as the two set out to find the worst play ever written a drama called Springtime for Hitler eventually wins out and pull out all the stops to ensure it's a surefire Broadway flop! Through a stark colour scheme and overacting from all concerned Mel Brooks succeeds in creating a distinct comicbook style that lends the film a very comedic and fun edge that few films have succeeded in capturing adequately since. The cast helps this film enormously with everyone giving hammy performances that help in creating the film's sense of fun. Brooks regular Gene Wilder is of course the star of the show despite not being the absolute central character. His performance is more subdued than Mostel's but still very over the top. The play itself features a very tasteless yet very amusing and catchy opening song that will no doubt be swirling around your head for days afterwards. The play itself is actually the funniest thing about the film with most of the hilarity coming from the monumental miscasting of an Elvis impersonatoresquire character calling himself 'L.S.D.' Dick Shawn in the role of the fuhrer himself.Overall this is a very fun film. The sense of fun is carried throughout even if the jokes don't always work. I can almost guarantee a good time from watching this movie and it's one that fans of this sort of film shouldn't go without seeing.".

Unlike Schindler's List and a plethora of screenplays on the subject all of which confine the drama to the morality of good and evil some with didactic overtones others with pure shock value or both this movie illuminates both with a spotlight and a microscope the social origins of racism.  Here's the problem  The very institutions that teach right from wrong that inculcate tribal loyalty patriotism and social identity that teach us to pledge allegiance and follow the golden rule have also quietly inferred or noisily demanded that the other' the alien amongst us' in Biblical terms is both different and inferior. Every culture Herodotus observed thinks its own system of values superior to the values of others.  If this is true and I think it is the subtext is clear  others' are inferior.  Which leads one to ask  Is it possible to have a moral socialized populace without racism or at least ethnocentrism? Set in Kenya during World War II the drama devolves around the struggles of an expatriate family of German Jews.  Culturally intellectually and socially they are Germans not Jews which is both fascinating and historically accurate.  Like many other Jews of their generation the expatriate family viewed their Jewish heritage with both skepticism and as a sentimental indulgence.  Unable to come to grips with the events in Europe reeling from and their new social status of being nobodies in the middle of nowhere they struggle as social nomads stuck between their privileged position as white overlords of the native Blacks and their fallen uncertain status as guests without rights.  We watch the internal dynamics of a Jewish expatriate family through the prism of its own internalized assumptions both as highly cultured Germans and increasingly as Jews.  And what they discover about their own hidden assumptions their ethnocentrism and European sense of privilege and superiority  becomes as shocking to them as Hitler's Germany.  Like every other archetypal hero being nobody in the middle of nowhere is the crucible that produces the Hero's special character where he or she eventually returns home in the end bearing gifts wisdom and a healing balm.  In the end they emerge with real gem of a prize  they understand both intellectually and emotionally the comparative advantage of other cultures and societies.  What I especially loved about this film is its emotional tone.  It's an emotionally evocative film though not with the mawkish childish paroxysms of a Disney flick.  We watch adults dealing with culturally layered adult emotions unwrapping and examining each layer as one peels an onion.  Their collective emotional journey is as rich and textured and subtly presented as any I've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "The German film Nowhere in Africa' provides a fascinating glimpse into a little known chapter in World War II history.   The film tells of a handful of Jews who on the eve of the war fled to the wilds of Kenya to escape the rising tide of antiSemitism in their home country.  The movie focuses on a lawyer named Walter his wife Jettel and their daughter Regina who narrates the tale. The foundation of the story rests on a series of interlocking ironies. First these Jewish refugees find themselves being treated in a more humane fashion in this ostensibly uncivilized' society than they were in the socalled civilized' one they've been forced to flee.  Second the men in this dislocated community end up fighting against their own native country eagerly joining the allied forces in their attempt to overthrow Hitler. Moreover Jettel although she and her family are themselves victims of prejudice and bigotry still feels superior to and looks down upon a culture and a people she believes are clearly inferior to her own.  Finally as the war comes to a close Walter and Jettel virtually trade places in their attitudes he once so eager to remain in Kenya feeling the need to return to a postHitler Germany to help rebuild his native country and she once so eager to leave it wanting to remain in a land she has learned to love a country she has come in many ways to think of as her own.In fact it is the transition Jettel undergoes throughout the course of the story that makes Nowhere in Africa' such a fascinating film.  For Jettel is clearly the most interesting and complex character in the movie.  Haughty and coldly superior at the outset she eventually comes to see the beauty of differences' that exist between peoples and cultures an appreciation that paradoxically brings home for her the universal nature of human beings. Despite the grim reality of what is happening to her family and friends back home Jettel is at first unable to shake the sense of pampered privilege she has long taken for granted as a result of her upper middle class upbringing and background.   But both the land and the people of Kenya soon transform her into a woman who is able to see and understand the truly important things in life  tolerance acceptance love family.  The relationship between Walter and Jettel is a truly complex one they are not a conventionally happily married couple but rather one torn apart by their different oftenconflicting views of the world and their somewhat shaky love for one another.  There are times in the movie when we simply do not know where one or the other partner is coming from  and that ambiguity heightens both the reality and the drama of the characters and their situation.  As the everobservant daughter Regina is a more conventional less wellrounded personality more a plot device than a fully developed character in her own right.  Still she provides a great deal of the emotional depth needed to fully engage the audience in the story. All the actors are superb with Juliane Kohler as Jettel proving a particular standout.  In addition the wide screen photography captures with crystal clear clarity the haunting beauty of the African countryside bringing an almost epic quality to this otherwise intimate family drama. For indeed despite the personal nature of the story there is lurking ever present in the background  mainly through letters received from desperate and increasingly endangered relatives back home  the larger picture of a world gone suddenly inexplicably mad a world that feels strangely remote yet which is all too real in its menace and influence.  This isolated community may provide for these dislocated people a refuge for the body but it can't provide a refuge for the mind and soul.Nowhere in Africa' offers a unique eyeopening perspective on the holocaust.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a grand epic in the scale of Gone With the Wind Lawrence of Arabia and Fitzcarraldo. It is the best movie I've seen this year and more than that it was one of the most amazing film experiences of my life.It is Caroline Link's Nowhere in Africa which won the Best Foreign Film Award when in actuality it was far better than the Best Picture of the Year. To call it a great or brilliant or majestic film is an understatement in fact I'm at a loss for adjectives to describe it.The film tells the story of a German Jewish woman and her young daughter summoned to Kenya by her husband circa. 1938. Adolf Hitler is on the brink of declaring his final solution of the Jews and it is with great luck that Jettel and young Regina escape.In Africa they adapt slowly to their new rural life. While Regina befriends cook Owuor Walter and Jettel's relationship threatens to destroy itself because of the hardships the family encounters.I will not spend too much time going into detail for watching this masterful story unfold is a treasure in itself. This film is based on an autobiography by Stephanie Zweig and when it is available in English I will certainly read it.Also the language in this movie is truly beautiful. I saw Nowhere in Africa again just days after watching it for the first time and spent more time ignoring the subtitles and listening to the beautiful spoken German. And then there is one scene toward the end that I simply could not believe. It involves a locust invasion and quite simply it was the first time I've ever seen something on the screen and asked myself aloud as I did the first viewing How did they do that? The performances here are firstrate too.  Julianne Kohler who was wonderful in the ultraweird Aimee  Junger is perfect we understand this woman fully even when she doesn't speak. Merab Ninidze has some great scenes with Walter the father and Sidede Onyulo is simply magical as Owuor.But the movie belongs to the two girls who play Regina. They look amazingly similar and they are both stellar. Lea Kurka brings much hope as the adorable young Regina and Karoline Eckertz is subtle and remarkable as the older Regina particularly in a heartbreaking exchange with her father at her school.It would be a shame to miss this film. No it would be more than a shame. It would be downright wrong and discouraging. This film along with the wonderful Whale Rider are two remarkable international films that bring beauty grace and majesty to the screen and are perfect for adults and older children.".

	onyx:emotionText "Here is a grand epic in the scale of Gone With the Wind Lawrence of Arabia and Fitzcarraldo. It is the best movie I've seen this year and more than that it was one of the most amazing film experiences of my life.It is Caroline Link's Nowhere in Africa which won the Best Foreign Film Award when in actuality it was far better than the Best Picture of the Year. To call it a great or brilliant or majestic film is an understatement in fact I'm at a loss for adjectives to describe it.The film tells the story of a German Jewish woman and her young daughter summoned to Kenya by her husband circa. 1938. Adolf Hitler is on the brink of declaring his final solution of the Jews and it is with great luck that Jettel and young Regina escape.In Africa they adapt slowly to their new rural life.

The film as directed by Caroline Link based on a novel by Stephanie Zweig presents us with a family of survivors who will cling to life by going out of their world into the great unknown and a continent away.In Germany the Redlich family is upper middle class. The household is filled with people going about their lives in an elegant way. That is until Walter and Jettel Redlich decide to leave it all behind to start a new life in Africa thus avoiding a certain death.Walter and Jettel stick out like sore thumbs in the rural part of Kenya where they go. Walter has never done any kind of manual labor or Jettel for that matter. Little Regina who is a sweet and curious girl feels right at home from the beginning. Children will adapt more easily than grown ups.The Redlichs are lucky when Owuor arrives. They employ him right away. He is kindness personified he turns out to be indispensable for all of them. When Walter loses the first post the family has to relocate to another farm helped by the benevolent Susskind his attraction to Jettel is evident but he is too decent to take advantage of the situation. The many difficulties are overcome because Jettel turns out to be the strongest person in this family. She is played by Juliane Kohler with gusto. She makes us feel she is this woman in the midst of a harsh place fighting all kinds of obstacles in order to survive in the new country.The setting feels like the Africa of the 30s and 40s when it was a white man's paradise. This is the Africa where genocides will occur later on as different nations will try to gain independence and some governments will practice what made this family flee Nazi Germany in the first place.".

	schema:headline " Slow but very satisfying";
	schema:reviewBody "I am sure I'll alienate a lot of viewers out there but I didn't particularly like Out of Africa 1985. While the film looked really nice especially on the big screen the story itself was not all that satisfying. Part of this is because I learned about the real events portrayed in the film and they were HEAVILY altered by the author Isak Denisen. Plus you never really got to know the Africans themselvesthey were more like a part of the scenery than real people. Plus and this is a biggie I just didn't care about the characters.In light of this I really really enjoyed Nirgendwo in Africa No Where in Africa as it did not suffer from these same plot problems and yet was also set around the same region of Africa. While there was some decent scenery this film focused much more on characters and was much more enjoyablethough I also must admit that the film may not appeal to everyone because its pacing is a bit slow and deliberate.The story begins in 1937. A Jewish man has recently moved to Africa from Nazi Germany. Now he can finally have his wife and young daughter join him. While it's lonely there in Kenya at least they were able to avoid the direct horrors of the holocaust. Interestingly much of the film is told from the viewpoint of the daughter and it's nice to see her sense of wonderment over this strange land as well as her fast acceptance of new ways and people. Her parents in particular her mother does not adapt so quicklynor is she able to see the Africans as real peopleat least as first.This brings me to something I liked about the film. Although the girl was a very sweet person bright decent and not at all superior in her behavior towards the locals the parents had much more serious flaws. The mother's are very apparent at first though over time you can see the father's as well. This made the film more believable as they were flawed...as we all are.Overall while this film covers about a decade in time it does so in a manner that does not seem episodic nor uninvolving. You really do come to care about the folks and it's like you are an unseen part of the familywith them as well as with a few of the natives. A sweet and extremely well made film. My only reservation at all is that the film has some sexuality and nudity in it. I didn't find it all that sexy but it's probably not something you want to show to younger viewers. With teens use your common sense but it's probably okay for older teens. Highly rewarding and I can see how this film managed to take the Oscar for Best Foreign Language movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am sure I'll alienate a lot of viewers out there but I didn't particularly like Out of Africa 1985. While the film looked really nice especially on the big screen the story itself was not all that satisfying. Part of this is because I learned about the real events portrayed in the film and they were HEAVILY altered by the author Isak Denisen. Plus you never really got to know the Africans themselvesthey were more like a part of the scenery than real people. Plus and this is a biggie I just didn't care about the characters.In light of this I really really enjoyed Nirgendwo in Africa No Where in Africa as it did not suffer from these same plot problems and yet was also set around the same region of Africa. While there was some decent scenery this film focused much more on characters and was much more enjoyablethough I also must admit that the film may not appeal to everyone because its pacing is a bit slow and deliberate.The story begins in 1937. A Jewish man has recently moved to Africa from Nazi Germany. Now he can finally have his wife and young daughter join him. While it's lonely there in Kenya at least they were able to avoid the direct horrors of the holocaust. Interestingly much of the film is told from the viewpoint of the daughter and it's nice to see her sense of wonderment over this strange land as well as her fast acceptance of new ways and people. Her parents in particular her mother does not adapt so quicklynor is she able to see the Africans as real peopleat least as first.This brings me to something I liked about the film. Although the girl was a very sweet person bright decent and not at all superior in her behavior towards the locals the parents had much more serious flaws.

There was indeed little character development and the wife's attitude especially seemed to arbitrarily change for the better not to mention it was never clear why the couple stayed togetherstill loved each other when the trend seemed to be going the other direction. Plus how interested did she really seem in what was going on in Germany in light of how much she professed to worry about it? for example she tries to seduce Suesskind while he's telling her about news of the war she acts completely indifferent towards the great news of the allies arriving in France. On a different note did the husband show any sign of having fought in a war when he returned?Basically themes touched on in the movie have been covered with much more depth feeling believability etc. Exotic setting and a story of refugees in hard times doesn't compensate for a storyline which is in no way dynamic reaching any sort of climax or unengaging characters.Don't believe the hype.".

But Nirgendwo in Afrika  Nowhere in Africa succeeds in just that through a mechanical adaptation to screen mechanical direction and mechanical acting. There are few scenes that take this to a higher level and tons of missed opportunities. Take the grasshopper plague where the family more or less reunites or the whole African setting compared to Europe at that time No parallels are drawn. Reading letters is not the way to convey heavy emotions to the audience. Caroline Link is the main suspect here because she fails in bringing this to a coherent movie. It's also overlong and moves unnecessarily slow probably to tell something about time passing but again there are better cinematic ways of doing this.Beautiful panorama shots of the African landscape so I do advice to see this on the big screen if you can. And the two Reginas Lea Kurka and Karoline Eckertz are very adorable. Most intriguing character in the story is Jettel who is tossed around by her emotions and is in the beginning less an adult than her own child. The wider story here is about problems arising from adaptation to new circumstances.This movie received an Oscar for best foreign film. My guess is that had more to do with the subject than with the adaptation as shown by the undeserved one for De Aanslag  The Assault some years earlier. As usual the Academy had no interest in real filmmaking as Ying Xiong  Hero was nominated in the same year and category.Germany's role in current cinema is diminished severely the last decade in favor of the Spanish and the Danish. Gone are the days of Fassbinder Herzog or Schlndorff. But luckily they still have the enormous talent of Tom Tykwer. Nothing mechanical about his movies.".

This movie must be even slower although many people think it's too slow as it is because many things are left out of our view. And one more thing which is  in my view  very bad. There are too many love lines along with nude scenes which are completely unnecessary which don't exist in the book. I have no idea why the directors tend to show these things so much even when they only spoil the picture. The story is good by itself there's no need to use such methods to draw attention to it.I would highly recommend to read the book which is nothing less than a masterpiece. Its beautiful and unconventional language is unforgettable. The comparisons are fascinating and are definitely something that could be only created by wise people of Africa rather than Western people. Also you can see how wise Owuor and Regina are. You can see some hints of it in the movie but the book gives a much better perspective.

Attorney Walter Redlich and his beautiful wife Jettel live in affluence and culture in a German city.  A friend who fled Germany at the accession of Hitler Susskind writes from Kenya imploring the couple to emigrate with their precocious daughter Regina.Without showing violence or the emergence of growing and perfervid antiSemitism several brief scenes adumbrate what we know will follow.  And true to life the Redlich's relatives refuse to believe that a dreadful future awaits Germany's Jewish communities.  Some may find this theme repetitive  it's been done before.  But the agony of watching complacent good and decent people eschew escape because of their faith in the perceived underlying decency of a liberal German populace hurts no matter how often viewed I wouldn't be writing this review if MY parents hadn't fled at exactly the same time as the Redlichs and their relatives who stayed virtually all subsequently were murdered.The Redlichs arrive in a Kenya that has no use for a Jewish lawyer from Germany in fact little use for Jews at all.  Walter becomes though fits and starts a farmer while his wife complains about the conditions she now must accept.  Little Regina she's played by two actresses one for her preteen years the other for the adolescent girl both are marvelous approaches the unfamiliar African world of tribes children who have different games and customs and the host of wild beasts with the open wide and accepting tolerance of children who haven't learned to discriminate to hate.  Her growth in the story largely aided by a black servant Owuor is touching.Let's take a short escape to reality this film shows a Kenya in which proud Africans coexist with Caucasians. Mutual dependence is the rule.  Africans serve but aren't subservient.  It simply wasn't that way the film ends not many years before Kenya was wracked by the Mau Mau rebellion against the British which I well remember.  There weren't very many Mau Maus but there were lots of supporters of the antiBritish independence movement which had been simmering for many years.  The Redlich's story has perhaps one too many side episodes but the growth of Walter and Jettel as individuals and as a couple which actually trails their daughter's maturation is very well acted albeit a bit predictable. The resolution at the end of the film may surprise some viewers and trouble others.Adjusting to an agrarian life was obviously not easy for cosmopolitan educated Germans. The Redlich's grief at not knowing of their relatives' fate which slowly gives way to dawning knowledge is strongly portrayed.Three languages are used sometimes with no or bare comprehension between speakers by the Redlichs other white people and of course the Kenyans German a Kenyan dialect and some English.  Whether intended or not a remarkable coherence to the Redlich's experience is given by the shifting languages which themselves complement the story line by their changing prominence. Directorwriter Caroline Link deserves kudos for transforming Stefanie Zweig's novel.  In a sense every fictional work about the Holocaust is also a true testimonial.  There is much history in this story.A blind cinematographer could not have failed to capture the awesome commanding beauty of Africa and special kudos go to Gernot Roll for filming breathtaking scenes.810.".

The director did a great job by contrasting the German culture basically European with the culture in Africa and the film features a great cinematography good sets fantastic scenario and a good editing  even if the film is a bit slow. I found this film to be a very sweet film and even if the end is quite obvious I liked it. this is an emotional film filled with contrasting feelings. After watching this movie you just want to go to Africa. i haven't watched all the nominees for best foreign language film Zuz and Zo Hero  but until now this film is the best.  The crime of father Amaro is quite good and has a good script. The man without a past is boring and slow. So if you like foreign cinema like me and you are ready for a beautiful adventure without expecting the biggest masterpiece of all times go and watch it!!! 8.2510.00".

One the other hand the cinematography was a total delight and the kids' acting two play Regina the child a pleasure to watch. Growing up in Kenya during World War II as a German Jewish refugee was obviously a remarkable experience and the filmmakers have captured it well. The British with the exception of Regina's headmaster Anthony Bate are portrayed as boorish clods though Walter the father does at least allow they saved his family's lives. Walter Merab Ninidze is a displaced person in more than one sense he goes from being a lawyer in Germany to being the 'manager' of a marginal bush cattle farm in Kenya. He has no interest or aptitude for farming and is too proud to adapt. His relationship with his wife Jettel Juliane Kohler suffers  that they are still together when the war ends is a surprise. He has virtually no relationship with his daughter but this scarcely matters as she is too busy growing up and drinking in her surroundings to notice.The film focuses both on Regina growing up and the rocky relationship between her parents. The former is mostly pretty positive but the parents find it very hard to cope. One can think of reasons  Jettel on the whole adapts better than Walter and in the end doesn't want to go back to Germany but Walter still sees himself as German despite most of his family having been wiped out in the holocaust. With hindsight of course going back was the right decision Kenya was not a longterm proposition for white settlement but in 1947 this was not obvious. At times they seem to be back in lust if not in love but there is something fuzzy about the relationship. Perhaps it is because we are seeing the child's incomplete view as worked over by the scriptwriters who at times seem to be guessing.Being so Germancentred the film casts the Kenyans as local colour though Owuor the cook is a wellrounded portrayal by Sidede Onyulo. We don't really see the Germans through native eyes  all we see is the deference to 'Bwana' who doles out the shillings. The natives seem pretty tolerant to the strangers in their midst who make such a minimal effort to understand them. The film was shot on location in various parts of the Kenyan Highlands but we are not subjected to shots of exotic wildlife except perhaps the locusts which had a digital look to them. The family's second farm at Ol Joro Orok right on the equator happens to be in one of the nicest parts of Kenya though this was not evident in the film which stresses the hardships. There was a certain amount of comedy in the treatment of the enemy alien women and children put up in the posh Norfolk hotel in Nairobi because there was nowhere else This gives rise to the best line in the film. When a somewhat bemused British officer sees the 'enemy' tucking in to the Norfolk's usual fine buffet and says to the Indian manager 'I say this is a bit too good for detainees what' the manager replies 'We have to maintain our standards sir'. At government expense of course.".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Lawrence is often trusty in the world of comedy.  Maybe I'm just overcoming his awful Blue Streak but I felt this comedythough saggy at timeswas quite funny.  The premise is undoubtedly implausible.  How's a whole neighborhood going to believe that this undercover cop with a latex body that looks somewhat like Big Momma is actually Big Momma?  There's a lot of disbelief to suspend.  But the gags often worked and I can say I laughed about 75 percent of the time.  Some are predictable like when Big Momma takes a karate class and starts beating the teacherplayed by Anthony Andersonto a pulp but they still work due to the way they're handled. And Lawrence turns in yet another fine comic performance with a script that could've used a rewrite but was nowhere near as bad as the crackerjack script he had to work with in Blue Streak.  The talented comic helps keep the movie togehter with a little assistance from the supporting cast.  Paul Giamatti who was great as Pig Vomit in the acclaimed Private Parts is funny as Lawrence's partner.  We also have Me Myself and Irene's Anthony Anderson and Cedric the Entertainer.  The plot is chaotic sometimes predictable and becomes more and more implausible by the minute but the comedy works and because of that we're able to excuse the script's shortcomings.  Big Momma doesn't deliver the biggest laughs but it's good fun entertainment on a lonely weekday afternoon.  My score  7 out of 10".

The premise is undoubtedly implausible.  How's a whole neighborhood going to believe that this undercover cop with a latex body that looks somewhat like Big Momma is actually Big Momma?  There's a lot of disbelief to suspend.  But the gags often worked and I can say I laughed about 75 percent of the time.  Some are predictable like when Big Momma takes a karate class and starts beating the teacherplayed by Anthony Andersonto a pulp but they still work due to the way they're handled. And Lawrence turns in yet another fine comic performance with a script that could've used a rewrite but was nowhere near as bad as the crackerjack script he had to work with in Blue Streak.  The talented comic helps keep the movie togehter with a little assistance from the supporting cast.  Paul Giamatti who was great as Pig Vomit in the acclaimed Private Parts is funny as Lawrence's partner.  We also have Me Myself and Irene's Anthony Anderson and Cedric the Entertainer.  The plot is chaotic sometimes predictable and becomes more and more implausible by the minute but the comedy works and because of that we're able to excuse the script's shortcomings.  Big Momma doesn't deliver the biggest laughs but it's good fun entertainment on a lonely weekday afternoon.  My score  7 out of 10";

His best were when he was trapped in the bathroom behind the shower curtain when the real Big Momma Ella Mitchell was taking a dump a few feet away! The looks of Lawrence's face during that period were hilarious! Lawrence eventually dresses as a big fat woman and provides laughs doing so. Ever since the early days of television and Milton Berle people have laughed at men dressing up imitating women. Pretending to be a 300pound woman makes it even funnier.Throw in a pretty female lead Nia Long and a little drama to go along with the yuks and it winds up being a decent movie.".

Of course no one not even the aunt's suitor can tell the difference. If you can get by this absurd premise Big Momma's House contains some really ribtickling slapstick.

Big Momma is the aunt of Vesco's exwife Sherry Long who is on her way to Big Momma's to hide out after hearing of Lester's escape.In spite of baffling criticsand not finding many casual film viewers willing to say they enjoyed it! the film was a surprise hit and opened as the number two movie in North America. It went on to gross over 117 million at the box office and subsequently ensured that a sequel would follow down the line it arrived in 2006. The film isn't pretending to be anything other than the mindless comedy it is. If viewed on those terms then it can be enjoyed. Sure some of the gags are puerile and Lawrence is an acquired taste tho his energy and comedy timing are first rate here. But it does work to a degree. It's been done better in the likes of Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire and the plot with it's boorish romantic strand is merely an excuse for Big Momma to get into daft scrapes. Yet the action is nicely staged and the pace of the piece never sags. There's also fun to be had in watching Giamatti  Howard looking like they just know they should be doing better stuff than this!.Forgettable juvenile fluff for sure but likable enough in that brain at the doorbucket of popcornway. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I was in my early teens when this was released ten years ago and I never heard of it at the time. In early 2006 I went to the theatre while this movie's sequel Big Momma's House 2 was playing but since I had never seen the original by this point and could see that the sequel was widely hated it was obviously not the movie I was going to see. Instead I went to see The Matador on that particular trip to the movie theatre. It took me over four years after that to get around to watching the original Big Momma's House and just before seeing it I had low expectations thinking it would probably be a very unfunny comedy even if it wasn't absolutely terrible. However while it's unsurprisingly not that great I did laugh.Malcolm Turner is an FBI agent who is very skilled in disguising himself for undercover operations. After it is announced that a murderer and robber named Lester Vesco has just escaped from prison where he was serving his life sentence Malcolm and fellow FBI agent John Maxwell are sent to catch him. The FBI believes that the criminal's exgirlfriend Sherry Pierce was also involved in criminal activity but they haven't been able to prove it. Malcolm and John go to the neighbourhood in Georgia where Sherry's morbidly obese grandmother Hattie Mae Pierce a.k.a. Big Momma lives and begin to spy on her. Sherry is on her way to her grandmother's house with her son Trent but before they arrive Big Momma leaves town unexpectedly so Malcolm decides to pose as the feisty elderly woman! He takes on her lifestyle while trying to get the truth from Sherry and also finds himself falling for the criminal's exgirlfriend! Before it is announced that Lester has escaped from prison and Malcolm and John go to spy on Big Momma's house the film begins with the two FBI agents busting a dog fight and I guess parts of this sequence are somewhat funny but no more than that. The film continues to be mostly straightfaced after this as we learn about the escaped prisoner the two agents are sent on their mission and Malcolm disguises himself as Big Momma. The early part where Malcolm has to hide in the shower while Big Momma defecates is memorable but not in a good way. For a while it didn't seem like I would be able to give Big Momma's House a rating higher than 510. I frequently snickered but it didn't look like I would ever find any BIG laughs in the film. However that eventually changed. While it's still not that consistent later on it certainly can be funny with the things Malcolm has to do while in disguise including a baby delivery. The scene with Sherry seeing Malcolm as himself and the FBI agent claiming to be a handyman is also a really funny part. The story and characters can also be interesting.This 2000 release is definitely not generally considered one of the great modernday comedies and after seeing it I can understand why but I've seen much worse excuses for comedy. I wouldn't have been too surprised if I had thought Big Momma's House was really lame when I watched it but while I'm sure many people think it is I can't say I do. It is uneven but sometimes funny. Also there isn't nearly as much juvenile toilet humour in the movie as that one defecation scene suggests! Martin Lawrence plays the lead role here. I haven't seen him in any other film and have only seen a bit of his standup comedy so I'm not that familiar with his work but think he does a pretty good job with his performance here. This film is a little cheesy and doesn't have the most original plot and more thought could have been put into the ending as well but if you want a silly raunchy comedy this particular one might work at least in some parts.".

	schema:headline " A Boisterous but Barely Original Drag Comedy Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "J. Edgar Hoover would spin in his grave if he saw how the Federal Bureau of Investigation nabs their nemesis in director Raja Gosnell's Big Mama's House. This boisterous but barely original drag comedy thriller casts comedian Martin Lawrence as a streetwise gung ho FBI agent who disguises himself as a rambunctious 325pound AfricanAmerican grandmother in Georgia so he can capture an escaped murderer out to recover 2million in missing loot from a bank robbery. Although not nearly as exciting as Blue Streak Big Momma's House is a hundred times funnier. When Martin Lawrence transforms himself with prosthetics and padding into obese grandmother Hattie May Pierce Big Momma's House makes up for all its lapses in logic with loads and lards of laughter.When Sherry Pierce Nia Long of Soul Food learns that her deadly exboyfriend convicted bank robber Lester Vesco suave Terrence Howard of Pride has bluffed his way out of prison and is on the prowl she packs up her young son Trent Jascha Washington of Three Strikes and they leave Los Angeles. Lester wants to retrieve the 2million in cash that he stole from the bank. The authorities have suspected for a long time that Sherry may have helped him but because they never found the loot they have left her alone. Meanwhile the FBI has anticipated Sherry's move to contact her grandmother in Cartersville Georgia so they dispatch agents Malcolm Turner Martin Lawrence and his white partner John Paul Giamatti of Sideways to set up an aroundtheclock surveillance on Hattie May Pierce Ella Mitchell of Lord Shango. Just as Sherry rolls into town Hattie May rolls out to tend a sick friend. Desperately afraid they will lose their only chance to catch Lester Malcolm mimics Big Momma on the phone and encourages Sherry to visit her. Feverishly Malcolm and John whip together an unconvincing replica of Hattie May that Malcolm wears to hoodwink the gullible Sherry.Martin Lawrence is the whole show in Big Momma's House. If you love Lawrence toned to a PG13 rating you'll laugh your ribs raw at his amusing antics. Most of Big Momma's humor springs from her rotund physique. The bathroom humor may offend some but the scene where Malcolm's Hattie May delivers a baby with Cisco and a toilet plunger is alone worth watching. Big Momma proves that a crowdpleasing comedy need not bow to logic. Hattie May on the basketball court trouncing two tough street kids at hoops defeating a bumbling selfdefense instructor and give a sermon in church is funny but not for a moment believable. Martin Lawrence's energetic performance as Martin again overshadows these glaring mistakes.Never Been Kissed director Raja Gosnell milks Big Momma's House strictly for laughs. Some scenes will split your sides if you aren't careful. Gosnell refuses to indulge himself on the action scenes. Further he gives short shrift to Terrence Howard's felonious escapee. Howard hovers on the periphery but never makes a deep impression. Although the Feds classify Lester as a coldblooded killer he spares a rentacop's life. Repeatedly Lester embraces adversaries with uncharacteristic charity. As a result Big Momma emerges as a slick sympathetic one dimensional screwball comedy with only the stretch marks of serious drama. No antagonism burns like a fuse between Lester and Malcolm and their showdown brawl is absurdly brief. Ostensibly since this lackluster villain poses a minimal threat to either heroine or hero the film lacks any dramatic catharsis. At best as a director Gosnell is efficient at worst he is a hack. Happily he keeps this formulaic fracas moving at a brisk clip and confines it to a trim 97 minutes.The romance between Malcolm and Sherry sputters until he dons latex thighs and flour sack breasts. They make a generic couple and their romance seems like supplemental fodder to flesh. Of course while it adds depth the filmmakers fail to make something out of it. Moreover Malcolm breaks character showing an interest in Sherry. John warns Malcolm that he is treading thin ice in his dealings with Sherry. For somebody who refused to be tieddown to a family Malcolm appears hellbent on courting Sherry and impressing Trent. Naturally since Malcolm loves Sherry any doubts in anybody's mind about the issue of Sherry's guilt should disappear. Any relationship with a character other than Big Momma however takes second place so Malcolm lusts after Sherry in disguise. Sounds rather perverted doesn't it? The flashlight scene in bed between them prominently featured in the film's trailers gets a chuckle.Clearly scenarists Darryl Soldier Boyz Quarles and Don Rhymer derived inspiration for Big Momma's House from crossdressing cinematic classics such as Chris Columbus' Mrs. Doubtfire 1993 Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot 1959 and Sydney Pollack's Toostie 1982 as well as romantic shoot'em ups like John Badham's Stakeout 1987 and F. Gary Gray's Set It Off 1996. Like the Richard Dreyfuss cop in Stakeout Malcolm is determined to help Sherry even if it intrudes on his ethics. Sherry's relationship with a notorious bank robber recalls a similar conflict in Vivica A. Fox's relationship with a bank robber and her subsequent firing in Set It Off. Sadly despite the best efforts of Quarles and Rhymer Big Momma's House amounts to little more than a series of cleverly staged vignettes a la Flip Wilson's Geraldine of Lawrence dodging into and out of character as a mammoth matriarch. Quarles and Rhymer stretch Big Momma beyond the bounds of anybody's credibility to accommodate some of the most absurd premises. A blind man could easily distinguish Martin's Hattie May from Ella Mitchell's Hattie May. Ella is bigger than Martin. Essentially the filmmakers ask us to believe that Big Momma's lifelong friends would not be able to spot an imposter on the spot.Again if you hate Martin Lawrence don't enter Big Momma's House. Despite all of the obvious narrative flaws especially in its flaky logic Martin Lawrence's wideeyed rude humor and his prosthetic posturings redeem this crime comedy.".

	onyx:emotionText "J. Edgar Hoover would spin in his grave if he saw how the Federal Bureau of Investigation nabs their nemesis in director Raja Gosnell's Big Mama's House. This boisterous but barely original drag comedy thriller casts comedian Martin Lawrence as a streetwise gung ho FBI agent who disguises himself as a rambunctious 325pound AfricanAmerican grandmother in Georgia so he can capture an escaped murderer out to recover 2million in missing loot from a bank robbery. Although not nearly as exciting as Blue Streak Big Momma's House is a hundred times funnier. When Martin Lawrence transforms himself with prosthetics and padding into obese grandmother Hattie May Pierce Big Momma's House makes up for all its lapses in logic with loads and lards of laughter.When Sherry Pierce Nia Long of Soul Food learns that her deadly exboyfriend convicted bank robber Lester Vesco suave Terrence Howard of Pride has bluffed his way out of prison and is on the prowl she packs up her young son Trent Jascha Washington of Three Strikes and they leave Los Angeles. Lester wants to retrieve the 2million in cash that he stole from the bank. The authorities have suspected for a long time that Sherry may have helped him but because they never found the loot they have left her alone. Meanwhile the FBI has anticipated Sherry's move to contact her grandmother in Cartersville Georgia so they dispatch agents Malcolm Turner Martin Lawrence and his white partner John Paul Giamatti of Sideways to set up an aroundtheclock surveillance on Hattie May Pierce Ella Mitchell of Lord Shango. Just as Sherry rolls into town Hattie May rolls out to tend a sick friend. Desperately afraid they will lose their only chance to catch Lester Malcolm mimics Big Momma on the phone and encourages Sherry to visit her. Feverishly Malcolm and John whip together an unconvincing replica of Hattie May that Malcolm wears to hoodwink the gullible Sherry.Martin Lawrence is the whole show in Big Momma's House. If you love Lawrence toned to a PG13 rating you'll laugh your ribs raw at his amusing antics. Most of Big Momma's humor springs from her rotund physique. The bathroom humor may offend some but the scene where Malcolm's Hattie May delivers a baby with Cisco and a toilet plunger is alone worth watching. Big Momma proves that a crowdpleasing comedy need not bow to logic. Hattie May on the basketball court trouncing two tough street kids at hoops defeating a bumbling selfdefense instructor and give a sermon in church is funny but not for a moment believable. Martin Lawrence's energetic performance as Martin again overshadows these glaring mistakes.Never Been Kissed director Raja Gosnell milks Big Momma's House strictly for laughs.

	schema:reviewBody "BIG MAMMA'S HOUSE  2000 12 out of Big Mamma's House offers exactly what you would expect in a comedy featuring Martin Lawrence dressing up as an old grossly obese granny this is a onejoke movie in which an undercover cop disguises himself as Big Mamma and participates in things we anticipate Big Mamma normally would not do. There are some big laughs involved with the size of the title character as well as her with breasts attitude sexuality and ignorance but there are also some obvious audience pleasers that feel contrived. Although the makeup effects are astonishing and amusing there are no surprises found within this material. We have already seen this film's punch line in better parodies like Some Like It Hot Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire. This movie is predictable overenthusiastic and does not take off with its ideas. Martin Lawrence stars as a cop named Malcolm who with his partner John Paul Giamatti is assigned to investigate the jail bust of a convicted criminal named Laster Terrence Dashon Howard. They suspect the murderer is after his exgirlfriend Sherry Nia Long and her son Trent Jascha Washington who may unknowingly own the stolen loot of a bank heist years ago. Sherry is somewhat aware of the danger she may be in thus moves immediately to her relative's house whom everyone calls Big Mamma Ella Mitchell. Before Sherry arrives however Big Mamma leaves town for an engagement. John and Malcolm see potential involved with Big Mamma thus they determine that having Malcolm go undercover as this character might originate information on Sherry's involvement with Laster's criminal actions. Martin Lawrence reprising his Blue Streak character is perfect for the fast talking Mamma in which he disguises himself. The actor is in nearly every scene and is basically what the movie structures upon one excessive comic situation after another featuring the concealed Malcolm participating in activities from karate class to a joyful church service and from the kitchen baking goodies to sleeping with the unknowing Sherry. Lawrence makes the movie succeed to the level that it does however his high spirits and willing energy only carry the film so far. It is only a matter of time before he wares out his welcome and becomes the only thing holding the story together. The film does not stay focused on the plot of Laster attempting to reach Sherry if a comedy makes the misconception to take its plot seriously then it requires consistence. Here although the setup contains potential the only tension involved is when Sherry will discover her Big Mamma is an undercover cop. Essentially the movie's story is just an excuse to have Martin Lawrence play a funny character who does funny things.The film's director is Raja Gosnell whose Never Been Kissed and Home Alone 3 provided trifling laughs just like Big Mamma's House does. In this film he and screenwriters Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer attempt to do too much with too little like developing a romantic subplot that feels trite and predictable. No matter how much makeup or covering the filmmakers provide for their characters beyond an occasional laugh there is simply nothing new here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Big Momma's House By Dean KishMartin Lawrence stars in his second Hollywood vehicle but can his film overcome the comparisons to an Eddie Murphy comedy' or the black Mrs. Doubtfire'. Lawrence stars as undercover FBI agent Malcolm Turner who is trying to capture a nasty prison escapee and bank robber before he can escape with the money. While tracking the con Turner discovers the bank robber's girlfriend is leaving the abusive con and fleeing to her grandmother's or Big Momma house. After assembling a stakeout outside of the grandmother's house Turner discovers that the grandmother is leaving for a trip. Panicking Turner assumes the role of  Big Momma and greets her arriving granddaughter. Big Momma has a lot of problems. Lawrence tries his very best to try to make the material funny. It's sometimes sad to see such a talented man so lost in such an ugly script. Why did Hollywood place this poor actor in this so obviously unfunny project? I can remember the 1980's and the huge success of Eddie Murphy but what made Eddie so successful was that the scripts accented his unique comedic talents. In recent years the subtler Murphy has found success with the Nutty Professor' and Dr Dolittle' but they have never recaptured the magic of his earlier works. I believe the key problem with Big Momma' is the script and that it can't seem to bring out the comedy trapped in Lawrence. Also the main comedic elements in this film are things we have seen countless times before. Some of the elements are the fat jokes the man in the woman clothes gags and the dashing around as the main star tries to assume two identities at the same time. Some scenes are a direct ripoff of Mrs. Doubtfire with a black theme tucked in. During the cooking scene I was waiting for Lawrence's huge fake breasts to catch fire but they never did and neither did the humor. Maybe within this film there are some elements that will appeal to some audiences but for me I found the whole experience very trying. 1 of 5 So Says the Soothsayer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hey look people Martin Lawrence is wearing a dress! Isn't that funny?  Hey look there is Martin Lawrence wearing a different dress isn't that still funny?  That seems to be the continuing running gag in the new film staring Martin Lawrence titled BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE.  A film that tries to pull off the same male dressed as female jokes that we've seen before in TOOTSIE SOME LIKE IT HOT and MRS. DOUBTFIRE. Lawrence plays Malcolm Turner a federal agent who is after a escaped convict Lester Terrence Howard who is looking for his exgirlfriend Sherry Nia Long who might or might not have the 2 million dollars that he stole during a robbery.  Before you can say STAKEOUT Malcolm and his partner John Paul Giamatti travel to Georgia to watch over the house that belongs to one Big Momma Ella Mitchell hoping that Sherry will show up to see her big grandmother.  When Big Momma makes a unexpected departure Malcolm decides to play Big Momma so he can help capture Lester. The plot to this film is as routine as Lawrence's last film BLUE STREAK.  And like BLUE STREAK it also has another element missing humor.  The jokes in this film are so predictable and lame. And to get the 12 year olds in the theater laughing they also include some more left over potty jokes from READY TO RUMBLE which were just as stupid in that film.  And to get the audience groaning they have a shot showing Big Momma's behind.  Why they did that I still don't know? Lawrence use to be funny on his t.v. show and in the movie BAD BOYS.  Here he's just playing the same role Martin Lawrence just this time he's dressed up as a woman.  When Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy dress up as women they at least add some personality to their disguises and make their fictional character seem real.  With Lawrence it's just good ol' Martin wearing a wig and dress.  And character actor Paul Giamatti is wasted playing the bumbling partner of Lawrence. Giamatti has been in some excellent films like PRIVATE PARTS NEGOTATITOR and MAN ON THE MOON among many others.  Why is he in this film I still do not know.  And Nia Long is also wasted playing the girl who notices the little differences in big momma but just shrugges them off. What's bad about this movie everything.  There are no jokes ripped off plot stereo typed characters and stereo typed situations that the average movie audience has seen a dozen times already.  I guess the people who never seen classic drag films like SOME LIKE IT HOT and TOOTSIE would enjoy this. But for those who love and enjoy those films will pity the filmmakers of this film.  There is one good thing I can say about BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE it will keep BATTLEFIELD EARTH company for one of the worst movies of the summer.   out of five".

	schema:reviewBody "Big Mamma's House offers exactly what you would expect in a comedy featuring Martin Lawrence dressing up as an old grossly obese granny this is a onejoke movie in which an undercover cop disguises himself as Big Mamma and participates in things we anticipate Big Mamma normally would not do. There are some big laughs involved with the size of the title character as well as her with breasts attitude sexuality and ignorance but there are also some obvious audience pleasers that feel contrived. Although the makeup effects are astonishing and amusing there are no surprises found within this material. We have already seen this film's punch line in better parodies like Some Like It Hot Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire. This movie is predictable overenthusiastic and does not take off with its ideas.Martin Lawrence stars as a cop named Malcolm who with his partner John Paul Giamatti is assigned to investigate the jail bust of a convicted criminal named Laster Terrence Dashon Howard. They suspect the murderer is after his exgirlfriend Sherry Nia Long and her son Trent Jascha Washington who may unknowingly own the stolen loot of a bank heist years ago. Sherry is somewhat aware of the danger she may be in thus moves immediately to her relative's house whom everyone calls Big Mamma Ella Mitchell. Before Sherry arrives however Big Mamma leaves town for an engagement. John and Malcolm see potential involved with Big Mamma thus they determine that having Malcolm go undercover as this character might originate information on Sherry's involvement with Laster's criminal actions. Martin Lawrence reprising his Blue Streak character is perfect for the fast talking Mamma in which he disguises himself. The actor is in nearly every scene and is basically what the movie structures upon one excessive comic situation after another featuring the concealed Malcolm participating in activities from karate class to a joyful church service and from the kitchen baking goodies to sleeping with the unknowing Sherry. Lawrence makes the movie succeed to the level that it does however his high spirits and willing energy only carry the film so far. It is only a matter of time before he wares out his welcome and becomes the only thing holding the story together. The film does not stay focused on the plot of Laster attempting to reach Sherry if a comedy makes the misconception to take its plot seriously then it requires consistence. Here although the setup contains potential the only tension involved is when Sherry will discover her Big Mamma is an undercover cop. Essentially the movie's story is just an excuse to have Martin Lawrence play a funny character who does funny things.The film's director is Raja Gosnell whose Never Been Kissed and Home Alone 3 provided trifling laughs just like Big Mamma's House does. In this film he and screenwriters Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer attempt to do too much with too little like developing a romantic subplot that feels trite and predictable. No matter how much makeup or covering the filmmakers provide for their characters beyond an occasional laugh there is simply nothing new here.".

The actor is in nearly every scene and is basically what the movie structures upon one excessive comic situation after another featuring the concealed Malcolm participating in activities from karate class to a joyful church service and from the kitchen baking goodies to sleeping with the unknowing Sherry. Lawrence makes the movie succeed to the level that it does however his high spirits and willing energy only carry the film so far. It is only a matter of time before he wares out his welcome and becomes the only thing holding the story together. The film does not stay focused on the plot of Laster attempting to reach Sherry if a comedy makes the misconception to take its plot seriously then it requires consistence. Here although the setup contains potential the only tension involved is when Sherry will discover her Big Mamma is an undercover cop. Essentially the movie's story is just an excuse to have Martin Lawrence play a funny character who does funny things.The film's director is Raja Gosnell whose Never Been Kissed and Home Alone 3 provided trifling laughs just like Big Mamma's House does. In this film he and screenwriters Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer attempt to do too much with too little like developing a romantic subplot that feels trite and predictable. No matter how much makeup or covering the filmmakers provide for their characters beyond an occasional laugh there is simply nothing new here.";

Old Surehand Stewart Granger tries to stop the Indians from attacking the innocent settlers.Among the cast you will notice a very young Terence Hill still under his real name Mario Girotti in 1965. Also Milan Srdoc deserves mentioning. He portrays Old Wabble Surehand's friend as a nervous coward with an unexpected tragic edge. Overall the movie is well paced funny and tremendously entertaining. Many scenes stick to my memory the precise shot from long distance which saves the passengers of the train in the opening scene the night at the station when bandits try and poison Surehand and certainly the most unusual battle between the army and the Indians while Pierre Brice as Winnetou and the great landscape of Slovenia and Croatia are strong and trusted trademarks of the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Old Surehand is a coproduction between West Germany and Yugoslavia and this resulted into a Germanlanguage movie from 1965 which means it had its 50th anniversary last year. Of course if you look at the fact that the title character is played by a British actor or at Italian actor Mario Girotti before he became Terence Hill or at all the Yugoslavian actors you will understand immediately that almost everybody in here is dubbed. But this is nothing new when it comes to Karl May's Winnetou films. Or I could also say also say Alfred Vohrer's as he and his writer Fred Denger worked on quite a few of these adaptations. It runs for slightly under 90 minutes and as such is among the shorter films from the series. Lex Barker is not in here but Pierre Brice gets some screen time as usual when they are trying to get smaller characters famous. I guess the idea was people with little interest in Old Surehand to say that they still wanna see it at the theaters because of Brice. But here it did not work out as this film did not result in a sequel although the title suggests it will. There was simply not enough interest by cinemagoers.I may be a bit biased here as I like westerns but these Winnetou movies do very little for me. On a positive note Granger is not that bad and definitely better than Brice in his films but this is not really due to Granger being memorable just because of Brice being a very underwhelming actor. As for the story here it is the same like in the other films one hero EWinnetou as his loyal friend a bad guy a side kick to the hero who brings in some comedy etc. But it is nothing new or creative at all. As with basically all the other Winnetou films the biggest weakness here is the lack of shades. The characters are either 100 good or 100 bad nothing inbetween. The character elaborations are very underwhelming. The bad guys simply shoot some innocent buffaloes so we get to hate them. Not good enough. And the main antagonist to be honest is completely bland and forgettable. He never seemed dangerous at all not even when he is about to shoot a friend of the good guy at the very end. They had to include that because the hero of course does not shoot at good guys. And of course the good guys Surehand and Winnetou are masters when it comes to shooting and never miss a target while the bad guys basically miss every target. Yawn. The more I think about it the more I guess 4 stars out of 10 is still too high of a rating. So lets not think about it any further. I suggest you watch something else instead.".

Tension mounts as she is buffeted by interactions with her abusive husband demanding father and meek paramour. This housewife who initially appears outwardly unassuming and unremarkable is shown to possess an inner landscape of the mind which is twisted and scarred. Techniques of German Expressionist cinema gradually give us insight into her psyche. Why does she write letter after letter to herself stashing them in a living room cabinet? Secret after secret is gradually revealed until the chilling and disturbing conclusion.";

	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge fan of Tykwer's work I felt obligated to check out a very rare US screening of his debut feature Die Todliche Maria. It was being shown as part of a Tom Tylwer film retrospective by the local Goethe institude and the man himself was present for discussion and dialogue concerning his films. It was a pleasure indeed. Tykwer proved to be a very thoughtful and intelligent individual with a real passion for films and the artisticcreative forces guiding them. It was a rare pleasure to meet him in person and something I will never forget.Concerning the film itself I must honestly admit that I was blown away by it. Deadly Maria is a dark film for Tykwer. Do not go check this out if you enjoyed the whimsical frenzy of Run Lola Run or the introspective and methodically paced Heaven. The camera work and most of the basic themes of this film were genuine Tykwer working for the first time here with the remarkable Frank Griebe but the overall atmosphere of the film made this a completely unique and engaging film on EVERY level. I dont think most of the people at the screening were all that moved by it judging by the blank faces at the end of the film and the perplexed sentiment of many people I saw leaving the theatre. I was affected by this film on many levels though because I felt immersed in Marias world for the duration of the film. The character of Maria was displayed as the full package by the director and for the first time in awhile I watched a true charecter study on film. It is relieving to know that some directors still want to have a main charecter that is examined on many levels and not just shallow surface level oriented stuff. We got an appropriate and sufficient amount of background throughout the film of her experience making everything that happened after seem relevant and powerful. The scenes involving the young Maria were I thought very dark and very ominous. The colors were bleaker and the overall tone was different than the present day scenes although they too were quite bleak. I could go on and on about how effective this film was but I guess you just have to check it out for yourself. Nina Petri was just remarkable on all levels. Joachim Krol did a phenomenal job as the guy next door with bizarre obsessions. He is a fantastic actor.I would put this towards the very top of Tykwer's work. In many ways it is the dirty art house flick I think he was trying to make since he first started shooting 8mm as a kid. There are allot of surrealistic elements in this film too and because he was able to convey them so well on such a minimal scale my hat is tipped once again to the fantastic Tom Tykwer.This should be released on DVD in the United States. My collection feels incomplete without it.".

Yes cinema can transform realities altering time and transforming today's listless oppressed housewife back into her avatars as tentative child or as wideeyed adolescent tasting a first unexpected kiss it can magic the lean young suitor into the indifferent casually arrogant husband of later years and it can change the powerful father into a bedridden harsh demanding child. And as Tykwer demonstrates letters become flashbacks an inanimate statute has its own point of view and dreams deliver incomprehensible alterations of reality.But  every character in this depressing story is progressively degraded in the telling of events that develop in confusing fashion over 25 years. The setting is a dark depressing apartment building from which little of the action escapes when Maria goes out to shop the camera follows her gaze down toward her feet rarely looking outward. Tentative stuttering Dieter Joachim Krol lives downstairs hemmed in by towering piles of crumbling newspapers and books so that rather than offering the escape we wish for Maria for we do despite it all hope for her to open finally and to take flight he is no more than one more suffocating prisoner of the gloomy lower middle class German tenement.And then the freudian symbolism please  this is the most arrant pseudopsychological indulgence.

It does  but there is little satisfaction and not much hope in this ending which literally throws Maria and Dieter together on the ground in the grim courtyard of the building.This film available in Germany in VHS only is one for the obsessionists who must own or know ALL of Tykwer. It's a waste of at least two fine actors Petri and Krol. We can be thankful that Tykwer got most of this out of his system and survived somehow as a film maker despite it.".

The fact that it is more known than most other German works from around that time is probably due to this one being directed by Tom Tykwer Run Lola Run possibly Germany's most known director in Hollywood right now as he has worked with Tom Hanks on several occasions in recent years which says a lot about his popularity. But Hanks of course does not appear in this film that runs for slightly over 100 minutes. The title character is played by Nina Petri and two younger actresses. Also in the cast are known names like Bierbichler Franke and Krl. And even if the movie was ignored by the German Film Awards it received a great deal of awards recognition during all kinds of other ceremonies. This was Tykwer's first full feature film so you could certainly call it a breakthrough for him even if it is not among his most known works today at all rather among his least known works.The story is about a pretty disturbed woman but the men in her life aren't really any better and in the end catastrophe is inevitable. Not just for Maria. Still a happy end and a moment of harmony are in the books at the very end for the title character. As a whole I think the film was okay in terms of the story and plot but nothing really too memorable which is why I cannot give it a better rating than 6 out of 10. However all the actors in here definitely elevated the material by a lot and they were all good casting decisions I believe as they really made the characters work and it was easy to care about them and wonder what would happen to them. Thumbs up for that. Another thumbsup for the atmospheric touch. Tykwer's gloomy take on the whole thing in terms of colors sets and cinematography made this an unpleasant watch which was actually not just pleasant but really perfect in connection to the story we get to witness. Overall I applaud Tykwer for what he has come up with here and while I am a lot more critical in terms of his more recent work I must say this one here even if it is mostly thanks to the actors is a pretty strong achievement for a rookie filmmaker. I recommend you to check it out and I personally even like it more than Lola rennt. It just feels more authentic in terms of the whole premise of a young female with deep psychological troubles inside of her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Banned in Germany at the time of it's original release due to fears of the movie of idol worship. This movie is now considered an gem for students of German history particularly those interested in understanding the social class system in Imperial Germany. That's if they can find it. It's a hard movie to find. One of the hard things to figure out is what the name of the movie is because it goes by with many different names. The first title is 'Der Untertan' which means 'the subject' which is the same name of Heinrich Mann's novel. It has been translated into English under the titles Man of Straw The Patrioteer 'The Kaiser's Lackey' and The Loyal Subject to the point you don't know which movie you might get. No matter what title you get the story is the same. Set during the German Kaisereich the film does an excellent job at illuminating the amoral world of nationalism. Diedrich Hesserling Werner Peters is a fearful man whom use any technique to advance in life to become a right hand man to the Kaiser himself. The man really did like the Kaiser and he was a obedient follower to the point that he maintains a rigid dedication to the nationalist goals of the German state to anybody that knows him. Throughout the movie Hessling's inflexible ideals are often contradicted by his actions he is the strongest proponent of the military and preaches bravery but seeks to be excused from his obligatory military service in a cowardly way. When he got into politics he hates greatest revolutionary Social Democrats yet he uses his influence to help Social Democrats candidates win seats at the Reichstag Congress so they can defeat his Liberal competitors in business. After they win he starts vicious rumors against the latter and then dissociates himself from them. He preaches and enforces Christian virtues upon others at his factory but lies cheats and regularly commits infidelity himself. Director Wolfgang Staudte puts a spot on satire comedy of the hypocrisy of bourgeois society and the risk of social collapse in a nation of loyal mindless idolatry of authority citizens with symbolism like the toilet paper containing nationalistic slogans and dance number with pickelhaube helmet wearing dancing girls. Photographed beautifully and intelligently one of the greatest shots in the film is when Diedrich finally get a chance to meet the Kaiser and he's such a fan he is running beside the carriage trying to get his autograph. That is a idolize moment. Staudte's film is expertly made full of verve and wit and a visual vigor that is quite impressive. The director and his cinematographer Robert Baberske shoot the movie at a nearfrantic pace employing extreme angles and comedic manipulations. They enjoy juxtaposing their characters with telling objects crafting deep focus compositions where Diedrich appears in frame with say a symbol of Teutonic grandeur the symbol overshadowing the man that is in service to it. Staudte and his cowriter Fritz Staudte also employ a mocking narrator who barely keeps his disdain for Diedrich at bay. There is never a question that this is a man we are intended to despise. Still the movie is a propaganda film produced in the Deutsche Demokratische Republik East Germany a Stalinist puppet state at the time. The humor is dry and it's hard to watch somewhat. The blackandwhite full frame image of movie is a fairly decent print. It has much dirt and scratches but is otherwise clear and unobscured. The downside is that the interlaced transfer makes the image rather soft. The German soundtrack is given a basic mix that is largely clear. There is occasionally some hiss as well as some unbalanced tones. The English subtitles are easy to read moderately paced and free of grammatical problems they are however burned into the picture rather than optional. People who don't like coolly intellectual literary comedies should not get this. The antihero doesn't change for the better and continues to be unlike by some who can't find themselves caring for the character's story. The ending is rather disappointing. In sum though humorous this film is heavyhanded unlike Staudte's subtle and truly outstanding 1949 film 'Rotation' which explains German history more incisively or the 2009 film 'The White Ribbon' which artfully makes many of the same points about Wilhelmine Germany and the sources of Nazism. This film falls somewhat flat.".

	schema:headline " A skilled depiction of toadying in the Kaiser's Germany. Washington's lobbyists could learn much from it";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not all that often that toadies get what's coming to them. Too often when their political toadying days wind down they join important New York law firms or become Washington consultants toadying in only a slightly different milieu and able now to directly afford their bespoke suits and strip steak dinners at The Capital Grille. But then we have Diederich Hessling. The place is Germany and the time is before the turn of the century. Diederich Werner Peters is a superior toady in this superior East German satire from 1951. Hessling is an unlikable pudgy little man with a small soft mouth. He is a perfect bourgeois inwardly anxious and outwardly pompous. He was a fearful child frightened of his father's cane and his mother's stories. Tattling on others at school was his satisfaction. He was attracted while at university to the shy Agnes but when warned off by her family's boarder one evening he hurriedly left her home. He joined with pride the Neo Teutons to drink beer with careful rituals and fearfully gained a dueling scar. As a cadet in the Kaiser's army he realized we are told that the whole military setup was aimed to reduce one's dignity to a minimum. This impressed him. Despite his misery he was filled with respect. Alas his flat foot hurt he said and soon he was released with dramatic tales to tell. Then he must manage his family's factory when his father dies lording it over the workers and nuzzling the town's leaders. He also manages to seduce the loving Agnes who having acquiesced is now of course unworthy of a man of his stature. His selfimportance is as prominent as his newly upturned moustache identical to the Kaiser's. And now this pompous little man Diederich Hessling respected factory owner leads us into a satire which is not all that amusing with workers abused Jewish blood gossiped about and patriotic Germanic delusions flowering with pride. We have selfsatisfied town councilors careful church leaders and elderly military men toadies all in Diederich's stultifying middle class. His factory which appears to make huge piles of rags from huge piles of rags prospers. Dietrich has found a place for his selfimportance and for his inner fearfulness. The Kaiser becomes his grail and patriotic nationalism strengthens his easilyled tattling proclivities. He is so proud of Germany German power and his German Kaiser that at his wedding to a plump and wealthy woman he introduces his guests to the latest German innovation from his factory toilet paper. But good things even toilet paper never last. The obsequious Diederich Hessling finds himself over his head in a game of anxious brown nosing more complex than simply tattling on schoolmates. We may not know what Dietrich's fate is but the movie gives us with heavy Teutonic irony a vivid look at what Germany's will be. The Kaiser's Lackey is sharp good fun as long as it focuses on the fears and behavior we can find so amusingly contemptible in Diederich. But then the film moves into a more heavy handed satire of complacent bourgeois German nationalism and society. The Kaiser's Lackey is amusing but eventually moves into tedious irony. Still if for nothing more than the satire of a smug society and a weak protagonist as well as for Werner Peter's skilled toadying throughout the movie is worth the time spent. The director Wolfgang Staudte had an unlikely career in films. He started out in the movie business under the Nazi's eager as a young man to protect his film deferment to escape being sent to the front. He directed the first German movie after WWII The Murderers Are Among Us in 1946 with Ernst Borcert and Hildegard Kneff. It is probably the best movie he ever made filmed amidst the miles of rubble in Berlin. It remains a powerful statement of guilt redemption and hope. He directed films in East Germany then West Germany then a unified Germany. Staudte's life itself might make a good film.".

Then he must manage his family's factory when his father dies lording it over the workers and nuzzling the town's leaders. He also manages to seduce the loving Agnes who having acquiesced is now of course unworthy of a man of his stature. His selfimportance is as prominent as his newly upturned moustache identical to the Kaiser's. And now this pompous little man Diederich Hessling respected factory owner leads us into a satire which is not all that amusing with workers abused Jewish blood gossiped about and patriotic Germanic delusions flowering with pride. We have selfsatisfied town councilors careful church leaders and elderly military men toadies all in Diederich's stultifying middle class. His factory which appears to make huge piles of rags from huge piles of rags prospers. Dietrich has found a place for his selfimportance and for his inner fearfulness. The Kaiser becomes his grail and patriotic nationalism strengthens his easilyled tattling proclivities. He is so proud of Germany German power and his German Kaiser that at his wedding to a plump and wealthy woman he introduces his guests to the latest German innovation from his factory toilet paper. But good things even toilet paper never last. The obsequious Diederich Hessling finds himself over his head in a game of anxious brown nosing more complex than simply tattling on schoolmates. We may not know what Dietrich's fate is but the movie gives us with heavy Teutonic irony a vivid look at what Germany's will be. The Kaiser's Lackey is sharp good fun as long as it focuses on the fears and behavior we can find so amusingly contemptible in Diederich. But then the film moves into a more heavy handed satire of complacent bourgeois German nationalism and society. The Kaiser's Lackey is amusing but eventually moves into tedious irony. Still if for nothing more than the satire of a smug society and a weak protagonist as well as for Werner Peter's skilled toadying throughout the movie is worth the time spent. The director Wolfgang Staudte had an unlikely career in films. He started out in the movie business under the Nazi's eager as a young man to protect his film deferment to escape being sent to the front. He directed the first German movie after WWII The Murderers Are Among Us in 1946 with Ernst Borcert and Hildegard Kneff. It is probably the best movie he ever made filmed amidst the miles of rubble in Berlin. It remains a powerful statement of guilt redemption and hope. He directed films in East Germany then West Germany then a unified Germany. Staudte's life itself might make a good film.";

Here as there the film is about the criticism for a social characteristic which is regarded as typical for the German background the Philistine who is fixated on authority and blindly tumbles into war and downfall.The film tells in episodes about the life story of Diederich Heling Werner Peters youth and university days of the son of a factory owner and his gradual rise into better circles of the Prussian small town Netzig in the 80s of the 19th century Germany is already an empire with Wilhelm II. being in power. During his studies and his time in the military service Heling learns how to be subject to superiors to endure humiliation to denounce and to enjoy the power over inferiors to the full. He takes over the father's factory joins the conservativenationalist party and a war club and marries a rich heiress. The height of his career is the opening of a warrior monument in Netzig he appears as the official speaker and baths in the patriotic phrases of national authorities when a thunderstorm interrupts the ceremony and clears the whole place.The alarming final shot of the monumental emperor Wilhelm II. is a direct reference to the nation's dark future WWI and WWII which both  from the perspective of the film  arose from the Prussian way of ruling and the servile attitude of the subjects the German people. The incidental music to this last take is a repulsive potpourri of Die Wacht am Rhein an antiFrench national song the HorstWesselSong a martyr anthem of the Nazis and the fanfares which introduced Die Wochenschau a weekly propagandistic newsreel that was shown in the cinemas of the Third Reich.Without reservation this film can be accepted as a work of art about a weighty epoch in German history the Wilhelminian era. The characters precisely personify the important and guiding institutions like school university military and government. The film succeeds in picturing the fatal relation between philistinism and war enthusiasm whereas the camera excellently describes the subject's point of view and position Heling looks bottomup to the authority. Next to the acting brilliance of Werner Peters it's those camera looks which outfits the film with an outstandingly analytical and aesthetic quality.".

If you do the maths this film was made 65 years ago and Germany already existed as FRG and GDR. These 105 minutes here come from East Germany and are still among the most known the country has come up with in terms of movies. It is a blackandwhite film but of course already has sound. Writer and director is Wolfgang Staudte and he adapted Heinrich Mann's novel together with his father Fritz into this film. Unfortunately I cannot say it was particularly good watch. Lead actor Werner Peters plays his part well though and you could see that he was very experienced indeed. I came across him recently in the Oscarnominated Nachts wenn der Teufel kam for which he won a German Film Award and he appeared in many films in the 1950s and 1960s that are still wellknown today.As for Der Untertan I guess the main reason I was not too impressed was the monotonous script by father and son Staudte. Or maybe it was also Mann's fault. I have not read his famous Der Untertan but I think that it should never be required to read a book in order to appreciate a movie. It does help for sure in understanding the material and plot but I am off the opinion that it should never be essential. There were some political references in here but none got me hooked really. Ultimately the story is about a man who follows one model to perfection Suck up to everybody above you. Look down arrogantly on everybody below you. And he became so obsessed in this pattern that he forgot to honor everything that is dear to him. Or was his wife really dear to him or did he just marry because it fit the emperor's and society's way of thinking? Decide for yourself. The ruins in the end are very telling.And let us be honest These people exist today as well actually far too many of them who follow this concept. And it is pretty despicable. I would not call this film here despicable but I cannot call it a fulfilling watch either. Not recommended.".

The film examines a week in the life of a midlevel drug dealer on the streets of Copenhagen and pulls no punches.  Kim Bodina gives a great nuanced performance as Frank the dealer and main character.  He captures perfectly the snaky charisma emotional detachment and nihilism of a street dealer.  Frank is essentially a sociopath turning on the charm when it suits him and turning a blind eye on the people in his life when they can't be of any use to him.  Especially effective is the portrayal of Frank's relationship with Vic the high priced call girl he obviously cares about but can't bring himself to get physical with because of his emotional coldness.  Frank blames this dilemma on her work suggesting he can't touch her because she's a whore.  However it's Vic he always turns to when things go bad.And things go very bad very quickly for Frank.  Through a series of miscalculations and bad luck he finds himself indebted to a slimy dealer higher on the food chain who's patronizing attitude barely conceals a violent streak.  As the week progresses Frank spirals downward into a desperate attempt to fix his broken life.  Trusts are broken violence and mayhem ensue and the film finishes on a surprising but perfect note.The director Nicolas Winding Refn shows a good command of pacing and camera work.  The real star of the film however is the script.  There is never a moment of Pusher that doesn't seem utterly real.  Though many may find this film dark and depressing I won't argue I think it's strong acting and excellent direction make it well worth seeing.".

And as his story unfolds your blood pressure will rise just like the incredible tension increasing throughout the movie. No wonder the debt grows higher and higher every day. Will Frank be able to ever repay it? Its just like the tagline saysYou've got no chance! Grab it! The fresh thing about this movie is that it shows what is actually happening somewhere in the middle of the 'foodchain' of drug dealing. Not at the top covered by movies such as Casino Scarface Blow or any other high budget movie made in Hollywood. After all Copenhagen is just not a world of amazing luxury and incredible piles of coke here and there. But the movie doesn't follow another clich' either. It doesn't show us the bottom where junkies scavenge on each other sell their mothers for a gram of heroin a topic which is usually covered by some lowbudget offmovies.Pusher is the ultimate pure refined truth about drug dealing. I have a personal experience myself being for a time an immigrant into Denmark I've never been a criminal or ever wanted to be though just to clarify that matter. And some guys that I've came across upon coming here went into this businesses and well they all hit rock bottom. OK the movie is hard to get into with its dramatic realism but I assure you this movie is as close to coarse truth and gritty reality as it gets!".

The film follows his daytoday pusherroutine during a crucial week in his life but in this particular week things go wrong as he sets up a heroine deal with a former mate of him that goes completely bust because the police was informed. He is arrested but is released soon. Problem is he lost the drugs AND a lot of money and now owes big time to one of the most dangerous criminals in town a Balkan lowlife Yugoslav mafia type named Milo. Now he desperately tries to find money to repay him in what is very likely to be the last week of his life.There must have been some buzz about this movie when it came out in 1996 but it completely passed me by. Luckily I managed to catch up at the 2006 International Film Festival Rotterdam when hordes of people were attending a screening of the complete Pushertrilogy  a bit too much for me at the time it was sold out anyway. At the same time Nicolas Winding Refn was giving an intriguing interview for quite a huge crowd. He had a very dry sense of humor and a scene from MEAN STREETS by Martin Scorsese was shown as his main inspiration for this film so it stuck with me and I simply had to see it for myself.A tense exciting storyline executed in a raw almost documentarylike fashion with a handheld camera this film grabs you by the collar and never lets go once it's gets going. Not for the squeamish though as the sometimes very violent and intense confrontations come very unexpected. Kim Bodnia who was equally outstanding in NATTEVAGTEN 1994 is exceptionally good. His character Frank doesn't invoke much sympathy but somehow he manages to make his character very much alive and even touching at times. The rest of the cast is equally good with some truly extraordinary performances.Camera Obscura  910".

The film's speed rhythms convey the nightmare of time running out luck running out and life shot with handheld camera in natural light going around in circles until suddenly damnation beckons.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1990's a new era in the history of Danish cinema began with movies such as NATTEVAGTEN DE STRSTE HELTE PORTLAND and most importantly PUSHER. Nicolas Winding Refn was only 26 years old when he cowrotedirected this arthouse masterpiece debut. I first saw this gem when I was 12 years old. I remember being immediately stunned. It had the stylishness and brutality of Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS or MEAN STREETS the realism and handheld camerastyle of John Cassevettes' THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE and the cool popculture referential dialog of Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION although it easily exceeds being just another postmodernistic Tarantino ripoff. It portrays the milieu and characters in such a realistic and dramatic way that it feels voyeuristic. PUSHER is a docudrama in the truest sense of the word.Storyline Frank Kim Bodnia is a intelligent illtempered young drugdealer who can deliver just the drug for your purposes  hash heroin cocaine etc. Frank's everyday life consists of selling drugs with his partnerincrimebest friend Tonny Mads Mikkelsen in Copenhagen's underworld and hanging out with his girlfriend the prostitute Vic Laura Drasbk in the evening. They are three drugaddicts themselves. One day two policemen interrupt Frank in a bigtime heroindeal with a Swedish customer. Frank outruns the policemen down to Serne where he empties the heroinbag into the water. Frank is arrested but the police are forced to release him 24 hours later since they didn't get the evidence. But now our protagonist has a much greater problem as he owes away 230.000 Danish kroner for the eliminated heroin to Milo one of the most dangerous drugdealers in Copenhagen's underworld.PUSHER portrays a bunch of lost people in the drug milieu of Copenhagen the capitol of Denmark. Nicolas Winding Refn doesn't care about the drugs or the crimes he's interested in the humans behind them. Therefore PUSHER feels very real and heartwrenching. In a very brutal scene Frank locates Tonny at a bar grabs a baseball bat under the counter and smashes Tonny to pieces because the police have informed Frank that Tonny has agreed to witness against Frank. In another scene Frank visits his mother which he apparently rarely does in a desperate attempt to loan money. We discover that Frank unlike most of the lost souls in the crime world actually comes from a normal danish middleclass family without any negative social heritage. Combining these two scenes illustrates greatly that Frank is a threedimensional character because he comes from a socially positive home and still he's cynical enough to beat up his best friend with a baseball bat. What in Frank's life made him so cold? Hatred for his parents? Boredom? Depression? The answer isn't apparent and that's what makes it so great.Kim Bodnia Frank delivers one of the best performances ever seen in a Danish movie. In fact he's often been compared to Robert De Niro although I think that image has changed since. Mads Mikkelsen Tonny shows much promise in his debut role. Today he's one of the highest regarded actors in Denmark and in 2004 he continued the Tonny character in PUSHER 2. But the biggest cast surprise is Zlatko Buric Milo  an actor you have to see to believe. Many of his dialog improvisations in PUSHER have become popular catchphrases in Danish youth culture. For example Du er min veeen Franke or S du er blevet bustet huh? and many more. This is something that you can't preinvent in any manuscript. Zlatko Buric is a natural!The PUSHER soundtrack consists of amazing 80'sstyle glamrock and heavy metal by Peter Peter exmember of legendary danish rock group Sort Sol. The handheld camera work and semiexpressionistic cinematography by Morten Sborg was very innovative for its time and matched the movie perfectly. The aforementioned cast is great but also the small cameoroles played by Lars Bom Cop Thomas Bo Larsen Junkie and Jesper Lohmann Mikkel must receive credits. If you enjoy raw semirealistic gangstermovies such as THE KILLING OF A CHINEESE BOOKIE or MEAN STREETS you have to give this a chance. Don't forget its two sequels which amazingly enough are even better. 910".

The film kicks off with the two of them wheeling and dealing the narrative does not pause for breath for minor details such as background characters and situations we are just pushed straight into the world of drugs dealers and buyers.An offer of a big deal comes along in shape of a large buyer and Frank goes to his suppler Milo to obtain the goods. Milo is reluctant to give him that much without money upfront as Frank still owes a substantial amount but on the condition that Frank pays him the following day Frank accepts. When he goes to do the deal with the buyer things start to go very bad for him as the police are waiting for him and he has to throw away tip all the goods into a lake. In the following few days Frank has to come up with a large amount of money or face the consequences.What comes across you straight away is the immediacy and intensity in the way in which the camera follows our protagonist. Medium close up and long cuts pushes the audience closer into the seedy world of drug pushers and the criminal world. confined spaces in the car and apartments makes it feel claustrophobic and trapped in this underground business.An altogether rawness and close to documentary quality to the picture makes it feel almost real and gritty. As Frank becomes more and more desperate the mood and atmosphere changes making viewing feel ever increasingly uncomfortable.A powerful and harsh look into the world of drug dealers shot with roughness and unremorseless savagery. With the character Frank we not suppose to sympathise with but he shows enough emotion that there is a connection that he is still human underneth it all. A great performance from all involved mesmerizing and montrous in equal measure. It's a film that will burn in your memory for a long time.".

When he is asked to get 200 grams of dope in less than 24 hours he balks but when he is offered 700 on the gram he tries to pull it together. Already 50000 in debt to local gangster Milo Frank takes a risk and gets the drugs on credit ahead of a good sale. However when the sale goes down the police are tipped off and the only thing saving Frank from jail is his quick wits to dive into the lake and destroy the evidence against him. Released by the police within hours Frank knows his problems are only beginning as he now owes even more money to Milo  a man not known for his patience.Although I had not really heard any hype over this film I had heard it compared to Mean Streets in style so I thought I would give it a try. The main thing that struck me was how gritty it was and how lacking in the style and pop culture that the postTarantino audience have become accustom to. For some viewers this may be taken as a complaint but for my money it made the film that much better as a piece of dramatic realism as opposed to a modern thriller. Of course reality is a loose term in regards this film because I hope I never see this as a world I recognise but it is still one that I found convincing.Refn's direction helps it by being handheld and mobile in lots of good locations  the viewer never feels like they are on a set or with jobbing actors. It is perhaps a bit too gritty and slow for some tastes though but I didn't really find much wrong with it in what it tried to do. Perhaps I would have gone for a bit more character development and emotion or maybe it could have lost a bit of running time and been tighter for it but mostly it was effectively desperate gritty and with a good feeling of claustrophobic hopelessness. Bodnia does this aspect really well he is an unsympathetic character but we are taken along with him as he is convincingly real. The film belongs to him but the support cast is mostly good with turns from Buric Drasbk Labovic and Mikkelsen.Overall then a convincing and gritty crime story that reeks of fear and being trapped. It avoids the trappings of modern Tarantino style and instead keeps low to the street meaning that it does well by aiming for its own target and hitting it consistently.".

I know a lot of people who enjoyed it will call it 'gritty' but Reservoir Dogs was 'gritty' and still felt stylish at the same time. 'Pusher' just feels like it was filmed with a video camera without anyone's permission on each location.It's about a gangster who seems to dabble in everything from drugs to armed robbery trying to organise a drugs deal which  guess what  goes wrong and leaves him in debt to an even nastier gangster. Do we care? Not really.I have no problem with films about gangsters or 'bad guys' to use another term. We don't have to like them to enjoy the film just as long as they provide some form of entertainment. Our central character here doesn't. He's bland. He doesn't ever really inspire us to care whether he lives dies or finds a way of paying his way out of the situation. He just sort of spends the film wandering around doing some halfhearted effort of calling in old debts.And that's about it. A cheaplooking film with bland characters who you won't really care about and a plot that's been done to death. Yes the film has Mads Mikklesen in an early role but he doesn't do enough to elevate it to anything other than very ordinary.However this film has seemed to have spawned a couple of sequels meaning many must have seen something in it that I didn't. I guess if you can put up with the subtitles and don't mind the rawest of raw films then you may get something out of it.".

Overall the film is a fantastic watch Kim Bodnia Frank Laura Drasbaek Vic Zlatko Buric Milo Slavko Labovic Radovan and Mads Mikkelsen Tonny are brilliant in this film.What I love about this film is that it has no good guy some people will side with Frank some will side with Milo. Pusher is raw edgy and most of all entertaining.";

From time to time Frank drops some of his drug load at his girlfriend Vic's  Laura Drasbk place.

From there on things progressively get worse Frank is in desperate need of money as the guy who owes it to brilliant Zlatko Buric can change his mood from friendly to psychopathic in a second. So Frank goes on his journey to scrape chunks of money from either past business associates or even his mother. He reaches his first low when he kills Tonny in a violent rush.

The long follow shots over the shoulders of someone walking fearlessly with their hands in their pockets. The love for detail and the spoton depiction of the way these people talk act the way they elegantly exchange drugs on the streets trained by years of experience. As in Drive the very graphic violence serves the purpose of confronting you with the brutality and ruthlessness of that world after initially deluding you into thinking it's inhabitants are in some way cool at the same time making you feel bad for thinking so.As things get more sinister for Frank you are glued to the screen and hungry to know what the other two films in the Pusher trilogy have to offer.".

Come to think of it it reminds me of Harlan County USA documentary it's dirty grungy and perfect for a film with a subject matter this film possesses. Truly it's as if Nicolas Wending Refn assembled a small crew and started following a real pusher who gave you an inside look into a week of his life took you to the seedy dirty nasty harsh and whatever other synonyms you can throw its way underworld of the street life so everyone could get an idea of what's it all about and why you probably shouldn't ever get involved. Certainly not a new concept an average man now understands but it's the way it's all presented that really made me love this film. As I mentioned earlier the documentary feel of this makes me think Refn had it in his mind when he set out to make this film. The vibe and mood of the film is top notch for the film of this caliber but really it's the character of Frankie who was fleshed out the most and in the end made me really dig the guy despite essentially who he was and his profession  though he makes a point later in the film which gives food for thought. What makes it memorable for me is that it isn't devoid of depth and you get a quick look  which was enough  into each character's life by ways of genuine conversations they're having between each other which felt like they were adlibbed but that's what made it genuine for me.".

His only relationships are with his friend Tonny Mads Mikkelsen and with his girlfriend Vic Laura Drasbk. When a Serbian drugcourier comes to Copenhagen and Frank fails to deliver money to him he gets into a debt swirl.Frank is portrayed as an ordinary guy who is a juvenile child under his hard shelf.

The dialog is sharp and it's well made to feel like common everyday chat.The film is very fastpaced and it's colored with some aggressive punk music which I enjoyed a lot. It added a great element to Frank's life full of loneliness and despair. Pusher is a great description of the underworld in Copenhagen Denmark.

	schema:reviewBody "This unfairly obscure early German World War II movie has a lot going for it. For one it has a solid cast with a lot of recognizable German actors who went on to be in a lot of international productions namely Preiss and Frank and put in some solid performances here as soldiers trapped in a hopeless battle.There's a solid share of action with everything on display from the Romanian units crumbling under tank assault to General von Manstein's attempt at relieving the pocket to the bitter street fighting up to the end. Actually the street fighting comes off even better than in STALINGRAD and ENEMY AT THE GATES and feels quite authentic and realistic despite the low budget. Maybe it's because a good share of the actors in the film actually served in the war? I assume the producers were able to find a section of a German city still devastated from the war some 14 years later or else it's some very good set design. Either way I'm impressed. Amazingly they even managed to round up some real hardware with at least two real T34's and a PAK anti tank gun for the battle scenes.The film takes the ingenious step of using authentic stock footage to supplement the battle scenes as was possible only back when films were black and white. This trick also worked well in ITALIANI BRAVA GENTE which also managed to often call into doubt whether the combat footage was original or stock.The only main detractor is a lot of mismatched stock footage often from entirely different battles including some nowfamous shots of the retreat from Moscow and during different times of the year winter to summer and back again. The film tries to play it off by making it look like snow doesn't hit until after the Russians cut off Stalingrad but anyone with a basic knowledge of WW2 history should know better. Also the tanks are off with T3485's appearing too early in the war as usual and a rare case where an IS2 briefly subs in for a German tank of some sort. Mostly minor nitpicks considering that the film's budget was so low. It's amazing what they were able to pull off with such scant resources.".

For one it has a solid cast with a lot of recognizable German actors who went on to be in a lot of international productions namely Preiss and Frank and put in some solid performances here as soldiers trapped in a hopeless battle.There's a solid share of action with everything on display from the Romanian units crumbling under tank assault to General von Manstein's attempt at relieving the pocket to the bitter street fighting up to the end. Actually the street fighting comes off even better than in STALINGRAD and ENEMY AT THE GATES and feels quite authentic and realistic despite the low budget. Maybe it's because a good share of the actors in the film actually served in the war? I assume the producers were able to find a section of a German city still devastated from the war some 14 years later or else it's some very good set design. Either way I'm impressed. Amazingly they even managed to round up some real hardware with at least two real T34's and a PAK anti tank gun for the battle scenes.The film takes the ingenious step of using authentic stock footage to supplement the battle scenes as was possible only back when films were black and white. This trick also worked well in ITALIANI BRAVA GENTE which also managed to often call into doubt whether the combat footage was original or stock.The only main detractor is a lot of mismatched stock footage often from entirely different battles including some nowfamous shots of the retreat from Moscow and during different times of the year winter to summer and back again. The film tries to play it off by making it look like snow doesn't hit until after the Russians cut off Stalingrad but anyone with a basic knowledge of WW2 history should know better. Also the tanks are off with T3485's appearing too early in the war as usual and a rare case where an IS2 briefly subs in for a German tank of some sort. Mostly minor nitpicks considering that the film's budget was so low. It's amazing what they were able to pull off with such scant resources.";

It was produced shortly after the German POWs taken at Stalingrad had returned home so had to deal with a critical and knowledgeable audience. It also walked a tightrope delivering an antiwar message and condemning German leadership in a country which was sick unto death of finger pointing and criticism.The events in the film take place over more than four months. In order to tell the story coherently the film shifts focus from narrative to vignette. As the story nears its end the focus narrows and remains with the troops trapped in Stalingrad starving and written off by Hitler. All in all it is well told and the acting is quite good.On the downside whoever did the subtitles could have done a better job. I speak German and seeing the subtitles while hearing the dialog and knowing a bit of the history created a bit of a dissonance. General Hoth's name is repeatedly written Hooth breakout as in a breakout from the encirclement is translated as Breaking ranks OberLeutnant 1st Lieutenant is written as Lieut. Col. and when von Paulus uses the word Meuterie Mutiny it is translated as disobedience. I suspect that those who are familiar with the history of the battle for Stalingrad and military ranks but who don't speak German may have a bit of a problem. these problems with the subtitles led me to give this movie 4 instead of 5 stars.Still the story is well told and survives the translator's bludgeon. I was left wanting a bit more. Few films these days manage that.".

The actual footage spliced in may be of different battles but given the time  place this was made it seems a reasonable thing to do. In the end getting squashed by a Russian tank or disintegrated by high explosive shells is much the same experience wherever you do it.No 14 years was not long enough for a deep introspection but this film made a solid start down that path.

Their enemy is not just the Russians but the weather lack of food and ammo and the bad decisions of their own High Command.The film features quite a few well done battle scenes among the ruins as the Lieutenant and his men are killed off one by one. There is also plenty of German and Soviet newsreel footage that is blended into the battle scenes. They likewise use quite a lot of actual vehicles and weapons from the era which helps the look of the film.It is well worth hunting this rather unseen war film up if you are a war film buff.The cast includes Joachim Hansen Carl Lange Horst Frank Peter Carsten Richard Munch and Wolfgang Preiss.The director is Frank Wisbar. Wisbar had scored with another German war film in 1957 called SHARKS AND LITTLE FISH. This one is about the German Navy in WW2. This earlier film starred several of the same cast members.".

A little cracker jack of a war movie coming at things from a German's point of view during the Battle of Stalingrad.

The impact is enough to sicken you to your stomach. Away from the antiwar thematic thrusts of the narrative battle scenes are niftily constructed though some of the spliced footage is incorrect to this battle. While the monochrome photography is in turns gorgeous and then potent to the horrors of war. Splendidly performed by the principals as well.As has been noted by others who have reviewed this little seen film the subtitles are poor.

	schema:reviewBody "Die glserne Zelle or The Glass Cell is a West German movie from 1978 so this one will have its 40th anniversary next year. The director and one of the writers is Hans W. Geissendrfer and as his film here was nominated for an Oscar these 90 minutes are perhaps his biggest success. Even in the 1970s there were still many films that dealt with German history especially those that received awards attention but this one here not really. It is more a story and tale about the individual characters. The one in the center is Phillip Braun an innocent man who ended up in prison and who also struggles with the potential infidelity of his wife. So you could indeed really say that he is a victim of society and of his peers. How are things going to turn out eventually? Will there be an outbreak of emotions quiet suffering? Perhaps even death. You need to watch for yourself to find out. Still despite the inclusion of actors like Griem Laser Kohut Wicki and Fossey all of them pretty prolific and successful I would not really recommend the watch. I felt that at times the narrative was not really convincing and also that the bleakness was executed in a way where it missed out in terms of excitement and solid character development. The performances weren't all bad not bad at all really but they can also only be as good as the script lets them. I for once can only say I am surprised that this one got nominated for an Oscar where it lost to a French film starring Depardieu and also was fairly successful at other awards ceremonies like the German Film Awards. When it comes to partially German films with glass in the title from the 1970s The Man in the Glass Booth is still the way to go. That one I highly recommend this one here not so much. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:headline " An admirable attempt at the unfilmable";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it Proust's monumental A la Recherche du Temps Perdu is probably unfilmable. The Chilean director Raoul Ruiz had a commendable shot at adapting the final volume Time Regained in 1999 that achieved a certain measure of critical acclaim in spite of being rather diffuse with not all the characters clearly presented.  I think you have to know the novel well to fully appreciate it. A rather more satisfying attempt appeared fifteen years before with Volker Schlondorff's Swann in Love. By concentrating more modestly on what is really a vignette a novella tucked within the vast structure Schlondorf achieved a work with a real sense of cinematic concentration. There is no Marcel whose endless reminiscences are something of a kiss of death to film narrative and no confusingly vast set of characters to get to grips with. There is simply Swann the man about town his obsessive pursuit of the whore Odette and the characters he bumps into during the course of a short space of time and a brief epilogue some years later. It is a very free adaptation. I cannot remember the Baron de Charlus appearing much at this early stage of the novel but as he is one of Proust's most fascinating creations his presence is welcome even if John Malkovich in the later version is better cast than Alain Delon. What strikes most forcibly is Schlondorff's unflinching look at a thoroughly decadent and degenerate society. In studying only the rich he paints a portrait of the lengths they are prepared to go to satisfy hedonistic pleasure and in the case of Swann lust. In an amazingly frank scene he sodomises a prostitute but is obviously more interested in obtaining information about Odette from her than in what he is doing. Sven Nykvist's camera glides through salons stuffed with rich objects and people this is a world where the poor simply do not exist. All around however are flunkies whose sole purpose in life is to serve their masters uncomplainingly. Just occasionally a look such as the coachman Remi's when he is ordered by Swann to drive him half the night in his pursuit of Odette says it all.".

While it may seem inconsequential it draws the film into a more complex direction than typical period music would have done. I believe that this allows the film to reinvent the quality of emotional space in the material.Contemporary composers of modern chamber music like Hans Werner Henze who'd collaborated with Schlondorff before were brought into the making of the film. The music succeeds by injecting an atonal dissonant aching atmosphere into the story. The piano and violin pieces work well against typical form and aid the narrative in a superbly contemplative manner. I was reminded somewhat of L'Anne dernire  Marienbad simply because the musical cues were not spelled out in simple terms.Avoiding kitsch is part of the problem when adapting an author who discusses subjects in epic detail which have been filmed a thousand times before  in my opinion the music permits yet another interpretation of that subject. At first its quietly unusual becoming a defined twisting voice accenting the growing dissonance Swann experiences with Odette and ultimately with society.It is a beautiful film. My only concerns were the occasionally odd voiceover work which was a little distracting. Ornella Muti is a knockout but her beauty seems oddly contemporary  its as if the filmmakers were trying to make the statement that voluptuousness is eternal while beauty standards shift periodically and culturally.

	schema:reviewBody "I really admire the work of Volker Schlondorff I think he is one of the best German director nowadays with Wenders although in a very different style. His adaptation of Proust is quite good but several things really annoyed me. first the soundtrack why using an atonal composition of Henze when Proust who loved Wagner filled his novel with specific musical references? It simply does not fit the atmosphere! Any chamber music of the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries would have been better! second the acting I am french and I really think Alain Delon is way overrated he's simply mediocre. However I really like Jeremy Irons and Ornella Muti is usually quite good but their dubbing is absolutely awful and ruins totally their acting! So I understand that Irons would have had a very strong English accent if he had been asked to act in french but if Schlondorff decided to shoot the movie in Paris with 90 percent of the cast being french why in the hell didn't he choose two other french actors for the leading roles? I have nothing against English actors on the contrary but then he should have shot the movie in English rather than dubbing miserably these good artists. Third the movie is sometimes a little slow. Usually Schlondorff does a much better job with the editing. If you want to discover the terrific job of this great director you should rather see The Tin Drum The Ogre The Handmaid's Tale or Death of a Salesman before this one.".

	schema:headline " Fails to capture Proust's depth and poetry";
	schema:reviewBody "In Volker Schlondorff's Swann in Love Jeremy Irons is Charles Swann a cultured aristocrat who is in love with Odette de Crcy Ornella Muti an alluring courtesan. Much to his undying frustration however Odette shares her pleasures with numerous men and women keeping the passionate Charles at arms length while continuing to take advantage of his cultural and financial largesse. Written by Peter Brook JeanClaude Carriere and MarieHelene Estienne the film is an adaptation of the second part of Swann's Way the first book of Marcel Proust's epic sevenvolume masterpiece In Search of Lost Time.Set in Paris in the 1880s the film is a recollection by a now aged Swann of a single day in his life as he attends dinner parties and salons mingles with the upper crust and pursues his courtship of Odette. Though Madame Verdurin MarieChristine Barrault a fixture at the gatherings sees Swann as unworthy of Odette and has unkind words about him he evokes sympathy from the Duchesse de Guermantes Fanny Ardant who appears to also have designs on him. Swann's love for Odette feels a bit obsessive when he compares her face to a Botticelli face in a painting in the Sistine Chapel yet we may be able to recall in our own life how love can be all consuming to the point where the lover takes on attributes far beyond the reality of their true nature.Swann in Love is a valiant attempt to translate a literary masterpiece into film and is strongly supported by the cinematography of Sven Nykvist yet it fails to capture Proust's depth of characterization artistic imagination or poetic sensibility opting instead for superficial posturing long glances and shallow voiceovers. The highly educated and artistically sophisticated Swann in a lifeless performance by Irons is depicted as little more than a humorless snob who is rejected by others of his social station because of his love for Odette but who continues to pursue her out of obsession or sheer obstinacy. In the reality of Proust however his love for her is so deep that he can overlook almost any flaw in her makeup her constant lying her lack of appreciation of art music and poetry and her broad tastes in sensual pleasure.There are others ways that Schlondorff gets it wrong. Although Odette is in fact a courtesan with all that it implies she is hardly the unintelligent tart depicted in Muti's characterization. Also the homosexual affair of the Baron de Charlus Alain Delon does not become part of Proust's story until many volumes later and does not belong in the film. One would think that at the very least the director would utilize a late romantic work of Gabriel Faur or Camille SaintSaens as the model for the enchanting sonata by the fictional composer Vinteuil that brings Charles and Odette together yet Schlondorff instead opts for the modern atonal music of Hans Werner Henze a choice that feels totally incongruent with the place and time. With all due respect for Schlondorff's valiant attempt to translate Proust into film Swann in Love is one effort that should have remained on the drawing board with a someday tag attached.".

What can they do to remove him from their ranks? More importantly how can they get rid of him without getting their hands dirty? Many works of art have dealt with Jewish outsiders but few turn antisemitism into such a shrewd game of cloak and daggers. The social circles Swann frequents don't just want to kick him out they want Swann to kick himself out. To condemn himself. Only in this way will their preserve their own chasteness.Of course Swann's downfall soon comes. He becomes infatuated with Odette de Crecy a manipulative woman who seduces Swann into marriage. She just wants his money. He just wants to conquer her and add her to his treasure chest of arts and riches. When they are married and Odette's sordid past is revealed Swann's enemies finally have the pretext for ostracising him. By the film's end Swann has lost everything  money fame power status wife  and becomes yet another victim to human folly.The film's cast is fine particularly Irons Alain Delon and Ornella Muti as Odette but Shlondorff isn't strong enough a visualist to tease out their passions or fully milk his tale's tragedy. Some visuals work tremendously  opera stages used to highlight the fauxgraciousness and playacting of society's upper echelons and a few sensitive fantasy sequences  but similar tales have been better told elsewhere.7.910  Worth one viewing. For a more zany take on this material see Phantom of the Paradise. See too Slondorff's Ogre and The Ninth Day.".

The fact of the film that I really find fascinating is that it is not shot in a later time as other Wende films like Good Bye Lenin but it is really from that time it was shot in Summer 1990 and so it catches the real wall fall feeling  the neighbors in GDR who have now all cars from the west and laugh about Udo and his Trabi Rita's sister and her family in West Germany who make a business out of the fall of the Iron Curtain they rent out their caravan to refugees from Eastern Europe or Udo himself who tries to speak Russian to the people in Rome.

It must have been as the film scored major nominations at the German Film Awards back then. Or maybe it was just solidarity towards film and actors from the former GDR. Of course the reunification of the two German countries has been the big deal back then and it did not take long until filmscomedies on the issue came out. Actually these are still made today. But the problem here is that the references are really minimal. Yes the Trabi was the popular car in the GDR but you have to deliver more than that even if they are driving around for the most part of the film in this car. The rest honestly does not have really as many references as I had hoped about the 2 German countries and the current political climate back then. The acting wasn't too great either but Claudia Schmutzler was of course very easy on the eyes. Overall do not be fooled by how early this was made. This is another of these uncountable GDRthemed comedies from Germany that deliver very little especially in terms of entertaining comedy. 92 minutes not worth seeing. I cannot recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Liar! impressed me more than many other admirable British pictures of this era like Room at the Top The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and This Sporting Life. It managed to generate a more tangible blend of poignancy and amusement. It's not often humour of the laughoutloud nature more of the subtle grim kind. The reality of Britain at that time is I suspect very well conveyed here with the old workingclass represented by Councillor Duxbury astutely played by the fine Finlay Currie and Billy's family very much at odds with what they see as an ungrateful decadent youth. All the performances hit the intended mark with Leonard Rossiter typically Rossiter almost as a younger Rigsby without so much noticeable seediness. Julie Christie is as good as the role allows an odd role very much the dream girl of Billy and I dare say a good few others. The film expertly avoids sentimentalizing matters by its cunning apposite last section. The Danny Boon character is one suspects all too typical of the TV light entertainer mould in reality. His reliance on cheap nongags smug guffaws and audience banter is well conveyed in just a few short scenes. It's interesting that Billy seems to aspire so much to write for him in particular... Helen Fraser's character Barbara is wonderfully quaint a type long gone it seems. One can understand Billy's frustrations with his respectively prudish and plain Barbara and ignorant Rita girlfriends and his anger at his family although some sympathy is correctly reserved for them. The direction is very good by Schlesinger emphasizing all the right things. The fine contextsetting opening montage expertly draws in the viewer and never at any stage henceforth is anyone's attention likely to wane. The film is most of all Tom Courtenay's he gives a truly resonant performance bringing to vivid life a character far removed from the norms of film making at the time. The fantasy sequences are finely done and all add more deep impression of this character. His digressive tendencies selfdestructive habits economy with the truth are well balanced by a sense of yearning and imagination. One cannot help but like and relate to the character a creation that resoundingly rings true. His ambivalence to the class system comes across concisely in particular. A fine film indeed with so many of the smaller touches that many films miss. Witty sad and a seminal film of the era very much a crossroads in British history. Rating  12".

Billy spends the majority of his time daydreaming of a much more interesting life filled with conquests esp. of women.  He'd love to quit his deadend job and become a writer but when the opportunity arrives is he too content living in his head and telling lies to embellish his otherwise mundane existence?  Too afraid to realize his dreams?  This quirky sliceoflife is thematically similar to Le Distrait The Daydreamer a 1975 French release with an entirely different conclusion.  A young glowing Julie Christie appears briefly in Billy Liar injecting color life and hope into Billy's dreary black and white existence. Highly recommended.    David Ross Smith".

He'd love to quit his deadend job and become a writer but when the opportunity arrives is he too content living in his head and telling lies to embellish his otherwise mundane existence?  Too afraid to realize his dreams?  This quirky sliceoflife is thematically similar to Le Distrait The Daydreamer a 1975 French release with an entirely different conclusion.  A young glowing Julie Christie appears briefly in Billy Liar injecting color life and hope into Billy's dreary black and white existence. Highly recommended.    David Ross Smith";

	schema:reviewBody "What makes this little black and white film so absorbing? As I was watching it on latenight TV I found myself on the edge of my seat gripping the arms of my chair trying not to yell at the main character Billy Fisher near the end of the film. How absorbed can you be?The dialogue the acting and the storyline was so realistic and natural that I had completely forgotten that I was watching a film. Years later on the next viewing I had thought it wouldn't suck me in again especially since I knew the ending but I was wrong. In fact I was able to appreciate it all the more on the second viewing.Tom Courtenay plays Billy Fisher who is an immature irresponsible young man living in a Walter Mittyish fantasy world and invents implausible stories to attempt to hide his escapades but his lies keep backfiring on him.His life is rapidly falling apart. He is supposed to mail out calendars from his employers to their clients but he doesn't mail them and keeps the postage money. He even manages to con two girls into becoming engaged to him and that explodes into a catfight over him when they find out. His grandmother is dying his father is continually angry at him and everything he does just makes matters worse.Fortunately he meets Liz played by Julie Christie who is the best thing in this great movie. She is sweet beautiful and understands him completely because of her own need to escape which she does by travelling around the country.He has the opportunity to get away from all the trouble he's in and go to London and make a fresh start with Liz who is so perfect for him. But can he change? Can he summon the courage to break free of the messy but secure life he knows and face the unknown? Will he recognise that Liz is the best thing that could ever happen to him?I'm not going to tell you because that would spoil the film but whichever way he decides any film that has you on the edge of your seat yelling Go with her! Don't miss this opportunity! Go! Go! you know it's a truly wonderful and realistic film!".

I can't quite put it into words but that dour face of his  the pursed lips and his loopy smile... who else but TomCourtney in the role. The plot is simplicity itself. Billy lives in a world of his own making. He's not connected with everyday events  he's a Yorkshire version of Walter Mitty  and who doesn't daydream every now and then? Director JohnSchlesinger who gave us Darling  Midnight Cowboy adds some surrealtouches one comes to mind Billy's reaction to another of his father's lectures. Julie Christie plays Liz. She understands Billy  thing is Billy doesn't quite understand her or if he does it frightens the pants off him. For all Billy's posturing he's a home boy at heart. Billy Liar is one of the truly great British films of the sixties. It's not often it appears on late night T.V. or on cable. If it does or you see it on video at your local video store get it out. See it. then wind it back and see it again!!".

Like small boys cn exaggerate but Billy was not a small boy anymore and therefore really a sad guy. His family had had it with him quarrelling all the time his boss and colleagues saw through him and everywhere his time was running out. That he had 23 girlfriends was a miracle. His lying promises did the trick. Time for a change one would say ! The climax was the end of course. All of a sudden Liz got on his right side with messages of love and persuaded him onto the train to London. She was enthusiastic and dedicated to get with him out of her dullafterwarlife and gloomy city. The message of the movie is grab your chances now or don't. In the 60's that was a coming up and everyday question for many of the young people and still is ! and therefore very actual then and now. I liked the movie and how the actors created their characters. Tom Courtenay did it with very much conviction. A splendid for that time spirited and very good looking Julie Christie as Liz the newage young girl with no ties or limitations responsibility ? whatsoever to withhold her from doing what she wanted to. We saw more of these girls in Holland soon after 1963. See the movie you won't regret it I'm sure. Hans Veldman.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most novels may not necessary translate well to the stage let alone to the Big screen. 'Billy Liar' has achieved all that. I have just recently discovered this 'hidden' gem from among the throngs of DVD shelves. The reason I 'picked it up' was due largely to the director's name John Schlesinger. Having seen his catapult to American fame 'Midnight Cowboy' I reckon why not check out his earlier British work. Boy was I astonished!First of all the script. The adapted screenplay by the original writers Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall is wickedly witty and performative for theatre dramatics yet it crosses perfectly to the realms of cinema. The cutaways to the lavishly staged dream sequences are so effective so in contrast to the stark realism that we get from most of the onlocation filming from the DVD bonus features the two writers actually take you on a present day 'tour' of a couple of the 'real'locations juxtaposed with snippets of the film sequences at exactly the same spots.Also commendable is the black and white cinematography by veteran Bristish lensman Denys Coop. Done in Cinemascope the depth of Hinchcliffe Avenue can only be fully realised in the widescreen format so avoid the reformatted tv release at all costs!And I must say the most amazing thing about the film is still the performance. Schlesinger rarely fails to bring out the best from his actors and this seminal work is no exception. All the supporting cast from 'Mr Shadrack ' Billy's family and girlfriends played very well to be the 'plastic reality' that's driving Billy insane. Hence he seeks solanceaffirmation and escape in his fantasies and lies but ultimately we know which track he ends back on.Tom Courtenay is simply 'Billy Liar'. Somehow he bears an uncanny resemblance to Ewen Macgregor or perhaps that's just me. It was mentioned that Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay who have both played the title character on stage were considered for the the film role at the same time. I can't help but only wonder how it would've turned out if Finney got the part instead...Last but not least who can resist Julie Christie aka Liz. She is Billy's object of desire cum temptation cum salvation very much in contrast to Billy's inhabited world... simply beautiful. The intro sequence of Liz as she walks along the streets of Bradford is another highlight of the film undescribable with words. You gotta see it for ya selfWhat else can I say about 'Billy Liar'. I guess everyone was once a 'Billy Liar' or still has a Billy Liar in him or herself. Well at least I can say it for me self. Perhaps on a finer day I WILL CATCH thee TRAIN to 'London'.......I give it 910 ".

No.  He gets the milk and stands there holding the two containers with his eyes closed waiting for the train to start rolling.

It was at that point that I completely hated his character.  Why did he bother to run for a train he had no intention of catching?  Could he really be that delusional?

Which in the early 1960s is what most gay men and women experienced.Heads upthis is a very British film and it's on the cusp of a new Britain getting out from World War II burdens and about to see the Beatles take over the world. In short Mod England is in full swing and the surprising new actress Julie Christie is key here. Maybe I'm just a guy but I think the charm and honest presence of Christie from the first glimpse in a lorry truck for you Americans is a spark of life that tips the movie over. Great stuff.The star however is the title character played by Tom Courtenay whose real character name is Billy Fisher. He's terrific playing a cad of sorts someone who lives by effect a former soldier in his head who has settled uncomfortably into his beloved England. The pace is crisp and the fast cuts are unusual for the time. There are odditiesearly on he plays blackface in one scene in his imagination a woman in another also daydreaming. It's farce top to bottom and raw comedy. I think the British laughed harder by far than us poor Americans but it's a lark and a fancy through and through. The flavor of it reminds me of A Hard Days Night and in fact they both come out of the so called British New Cinema.The film is imaginative in its structure depending on the wandering thoughts of Billy to change the scene at will. It's cheeky but clever and keeps you looking. And chuckling. As a comedy it might not be uproarious but it never lets up its absurdity. It's called Billy Liar because Billy succeeds with his coworkers and family by making things up. Endlessly.Eventually you have to ask if the film can be read as an insight into being a gay man in these times. Certainly it can. It cheerfully points out how painful it is to be misunderstood and maligned for no good reason. It was easy to understand Billy as a a wouldbe success pushed down by his willing nonconformity. But it is also troubling to admit that this is something that is insinuated by TCM at the startif you see the movie as a straight movie about an eccentric not gay in particular it has a different and less serious feel. Maybe it's fair to let it be both or let it float depending on the viewer. Because it remains fast inventive and funny throughout. Even the camerawork is fun with lots of wide angle and with moving pans across landscapes that distort the world. Appropriately.The final verdict this is a film about the new England the land of youth poking fun at the serious old school England of lore and of WWII. It attacks this with necessary humor not to offend absolutely everyone and with visual pizazz. It wears slightly thin at times and you do wonder what really matters about this aimless chap but in all it's refreshing and revealing of the era. And it has Julie Christie in her first film. As she says with revealing authority I don't want to get engaged I want to get married. Yeah.".

	schema:reviewBody "At number 76 on the BFI's Top 100 this Criterion DVD is a gem with commentary by three thenliving members of the original project John Schlesinger Tom Courtenay and Julie Christie. Set in an industrial NorthofLondon location it easily fits among the Kitchen Sink Realism films. In the DVD commentary Courtenay says that when released the film was loved by the Italians and generally ignored by Americans as being an English blackandwhite version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The similarity of the daydreamingheroofhisownimagination is an understandable connection between the two stories. However this is a far superior as a filmand it is even better than James Thurber's short storyespecially if you are able to understand the insidejokes of the British humor which we Americans surely didn't.If like me you have only seen Tom Courtenay as the stoically determined and grime juvenile delinquent of Tony Richardson's The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner you will be pleasantly surprised by his wacky humorous side here. Also even though Julie Christie only makes a brief appearance in this film it may have represented a breakthrough role for the very successful career that she was to have including three more joint ventures with John Schlesinger. The title character Billy Fisher Tom Courtenay lives with his parents Wilfred Pickles and Mona Washbourne and grandmother Ethel Griffies in a boring North England town. He works as a lowlevel clerk at a funeral home and dreams of being a scriptwriter for a London radio comedian. Thinking that a polite form letter meant that he is hired as the scriptwriter he is ready to quit his job and strike out on his own in London. However before leaving he has a few things to take care of. He has to break up with BOTH of his fiancesthe no nonsense blond Rita Gwendolyn Watts and the sweet and trusting brunet Barbara Helen Fraser. Also he has to explain to his boss why he 'forgot' to send out the funeral parlor's annual calendars as well as what he did with the postage money that he was given to send them out. Billy has a wild imagination and constantly daydreams about being the great leader hero inventor business magnateor whateverof his imagined country of Ambrosia a country where heroes are always losing their right limbs for some reason ?. BUT in his real life his job is a bore his family is a drag his friends know he is a liar and as he says to Barbara 'You know I TEND to exaggerate a bit ..at times' as he describes their future idyllic life togetherwith little Billy and little Barbara. One of the many black humor moments of the film is the scene in which he takes Barbara on a quiet date to the cemetery where the two walk around and read the tombstones. He seems to be stuck dreaming away his boring life until a Liz Julie Christie comes bouncing into town and into his life. Her answers to his dilemmas seem surprisingly simple 'Billy if you want to go to London GO to London.' When Billy asks her if she would like to be his fiance she says 'No I want to be your wife.' But before Billy can go anywhere or do anything he has to overcome his lifelong habits and inertia and make some sort of REAL move? This film wonderfully weaves back and forth between Billy's vivid comical daydreams and his equally comical real life. Both are full of fun imaginative creation and roaring entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Tom Courtenay is the star of Billy Liar and gives an outstanding performance as this British version of a Walter Mittylike character it's a very young Julie Christie who steals the show. Her part isn't large and her onscreen time is limited but Christie's freespirited carefree role changes the dynamics of the film and challenges Courtenay's Billy Fisher to do something with his life besides living in a complex fantasy world of his own making. Fisher is mainly concerned with his standing in Ambrosia a makebelieve European country where he resides as military hero dictator and allaround super human being. He's forever leading the parade in this imaginative world as his real life passes him by. In reality Fisher lives in a drab northern English city and employed as an undertaker's assistant. He's a notorious and habitual liar and underachieving in every facet of his existenceexcept one. He has more than one fiance and is constantly juggling his lies to keep them at arm's distance. In the hands of a less capable director Fisher's problems wouldn't elicit anything more than a yawn and a cheap laugh. But the great John Schlesinger is able to present Billy's story with a bundle of humor tinged with a whiff of sympathy. He's really a lost soul but doesn't know it yet. The ambivalent ending can be taken two different ways depending on the viewer's opinion. The final scene where Christie leaves alone on the train to London stays with you long after the final reel is over.Billy Liar was Tom Courtenay's second major success after The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner was released the previous year. He followed this role with a lead part in David Lean's epic Doctor Zhivago. He's kept himself busy with stage and screen work to this day and he's now Sir Thomas Courtenay. For Julie Christie all the doors opened up for her after Billy and she continued on to international success. Her next film also with Schlesinger directing was Darling for which she took home the Academy Award for Best Actress. But seeing her in this first major role is certainly a treat. It's easy to see why she became one of screen's alltime leading ladies. Actress debuts don't come any better than Julie Christie's in Billy Liar. John Schlesinger's career took off after Billy Liar and Darling. He's probably best remembered now for directing Dustin Hoffmann and Lawrence Olivier in the thriller Marathon Man.".

	schema:headline " A Closer Look at Billy Himself";
	schema:reviewBody "Billy has imagination but can't direct it. He sort of wants to direct it by getting a script writing job with a secondrate entertainer. But he doesn't think beyond that possibility once he's refused. So he falls back into his usual private reveries which are unfailingly about personal power because in real life he has none. So he dreams of commanding armies liberating countries and machinegunning those who bore him when in fact he works as a clerk in an undertaking parlor. In short he's a rather weak but not untalented soul trapped by a lower middleclass existence in a small industrial town where his imaginative social side makes him prone to making up lies.It's this rather vague struggle between individual potential and social circumstance that drives the movie. If Billy were a stronger personality say a Richard Burton the film would take on a very different complexion. But he's not so he muddles along from one predicament to the next vaguely dissatisfied with life but not knowing what to do about it. That's epitomized in the appropriately located graveyard scene with his fiancee the pathetically trusting Barbara. She wants nothing more than a modest married existence and be thankful for that. Billy however can't think beyond the lies he tells her and his other fiancee the toughtalking Rita. So he leads them both on. At some level Billy understands that what was good enough for his father or Barbara or Rita is not good enough for him. But then his dad as the script implies lived through a different era when a man gladly traded luxuries like imagination for the settled guarantees of family and a job. Thus in Dad's eyes Billy is simply ungrateful whereas for Billy Dad is dull and oppressive.Now I'm not a cultural historian but it seems Billy and Liz Julie Christie are transitional figures between the ravages of the Depression and war years of the 30's and 40's and the liberating potentials of the 1960's. It's clearly so in Liz's case. Watch her spirited passage through the downtown past the stores and traffic she so winningly subdues. She's clearly a freespirit in the making a prophet of that swinging London soon to come. Here the screenplay is especially sensitive to emerging trends. Note how quickly she gives herself to the conflicted Billy once she believes a rapport has been established. Thus the pathway to larger liberation her character implies lies through a loosening of sexual repression. Thus a meaningful contrast with the conventionally repressed Barbara is established.But whereas Liz makes an effortless leap to London Billy either does not or cannot. It's not clear which and that's probably just as well. Is he really responding to family duty or is he simply too weak to finally commit himself to a bigcity life that may overwhelm his comfortable little fantasies. All in all it's an interesting movie very well acted with significant themes. My only real complaint is the last scene from the street following Billy's return. There's a light on in his little secondfloor room logically shouldn't it go out?".

	schema:headline " Amazing acting by Tom Courtenay a British classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Featuring an extraordinary acting performance by Tom Courtenay Billy Liar starts off as a farce. Courtney's Billy lives in a fantasy world or a fantasy country where he is the dictator passing back and forth between a Churchilllike autocrat who inspires his people with magnificent Churchilltype speeches to a Hitleresque fascist. The fantasies are played out in real flesh and blood for us and they are quite striking and occasionally hilariously absurd an imaginary series of regiments parades before Billy including one in which all the members have lost their right arms. Billy imagines himself leading each regiment including a corps from India makeup included.Billy also repeatedly turns on his perceived reallife enemies with a fantasy machine gun  quite shocking and probably not doable today. He also has a job in a funeral home of all places but never seems to do any work. The humor is a little dark like an Evelyn Waugh novel. But like I said the first half hour is primarily farce.The genius of the movie however is that Billy grows more complex as the film moves along. Billy has somehow gotten himself engaged to two different girls neither of whom he intends to marry and bizarrely keeps running into both of them. As he increasingly gets more caught in his own various webs of deceit Courtenay's Billy begins to crack and as we see how emotionally vulnerable he really is he becomes much more sympathetic. Courtenay is masterful as he seeks to keep hold of his fantasies and juggle his many lies without getting trapped and caught  and it doesn't always work. Courtenay's genius is that he so effortlessly moves back and forth between weakness and manipulation and we actually become more fond of him as the film progresses.Some Northern British city itself is the costar here shot in glorious postwar black and white. One particularly interesting scene takes place in a dance club. All the locals have gathered to dance to such dreary crap as a song called Twisteralla I am not sure it was not a parody of typical music of 1963 and forming a congaline at one point. To think this took place perhaps just months before the Beatles exploded on the scene to me it is a snapshot of how distressing the music and club world was before the British Invasion yes I know the British did not invade their own country.All the supporting cast are spectacular from the old grandmother who doesn't understand why there are so many Blackies in town to the two girlfriends one an obnoxious bully the other an annoying prude to Billy's ever irritated father who at one point calls Billy a MaryAnne  oh dear!A particularly funny moment occurs when Courtenay has asked one of his girlfriends to go for a walk. The camera suddenly is pointing up into the trees and we hear the girlfriend Barbara exclaim offcamera something like oh it is so beautiful here! then as the camera pans down we see they are walking in a gorgeous but ancient cemetery. Really clever.A great film and keep your eyes closely on Courtenay. Oh and to really appreciate Courtenay watch the film he made after this one King and Country. Tom's character a dimwitted soldier on trial for his life could not be more different than Billy and shows what an extraordinary actor he is.".

This is a story of a young and irresponsible man with an intense  overactive imagination.  With a strong desire to write I'm going to start my novel  2000 words every day he struggles to start because in his mind he only ever sees the established product.  A terrible procrastinator he spends most of the film disposing of calendars that he didn't mail on behalf of the funeral home he works for. He longs for happiness and success but isn't willing to risk the security of home to get it.  Somewhere in his past he never learned to face up to responsibility possibly because he resented being sent to grammar school at the expense of his parents.  As a young adult Billy wants to escape the tangled web of irresponsibility and lies he has woven.  When he is given the opportunity to finally leave and start anew thanks to the beautiful Liz he turns away at the last minute and chooses to stay in the fantasy  it's easier.  Every time I see it I wish Billy would stay on the train and go through with it.  I also wish he would stay with Liz!!!  An incredibly humorous film Billy Liar is one of my all time favourites.  It is especially funny for those of us who grew up in England because of the many jokes about our english ways.  It is a classic  as are many early films of wellknown directors  well worth owning.  I would love to see a DVD version in widescreen released.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Billy Liar reached the screen in 1963 it was considered a little shocking an innovative contribution to the British ashcan school of cinema along with Saturday Night and Sunday Morning Morgan and a few others. The setting was always grimy and urban. The characters always working class. The conflicts were small and trivial to an outsider and the treatment veered from comic to dramatic and back again so that the audience was never quite certain about what was to come next or  far more important  how to feel about what they were watching. The characters were multidimensional as characters are in life off the screen and that's a compliment to the audience. People generally are not good or bad they are good AND bad. Adults can make up their own minds about their responses can't they? This is a good example of the genre. Tom Courtenay is Billy Fisher. He works in an undertaker's establishment in some minor role  mailing out annual calendars and so forth. He's juggling two women as well. One blond bimbo satisfies his physical needs while the virginal brunette offers him a future in which with any luck the wedded couple will live in a shabby flat in the same smoky industrial city and raise a couple of children who will grow up to be as unexceptional as they themselves are. The brunette wanders happily through a cemetery visualizing what THEIR plot will look like. This legerdemain confuses Courtenay who doesn't care about his job anyway and he begins to get into some mostly amusing hot water at work.And so  keeping two young women on the hook and in danger of being fired and not being particularly appreciated by his Mom and Dad at home  Billy Fisher does what any sane person would do. He fantasizes. And we see clips of his fantasies unfold on screen.Probably this was the most original feature of the movie  the fantasies. There were no shimmering dissolves no harp arpeggios to let us know they were coming. Dad insults Billy and  WHAM  a cut to Billy firing machinegun bullets into Dad. None are particularly amusing  this isn't Walter Mitty  but they're all kind of shocking. Of course that kind of editing has been imitated a thousand times since then and we've grown accustomed to it but it was imaginatively done by director Schlesinger a genuine innovation. More extended fantasies show us Courtenay as dictator of his own nation  Ambrosia.Later in the film we get to know Julie Christie's character. She's a knockout she sees through Billy's lies and she wants to run away to London with him. At the last minute when the couple are already seated on the train Courtenay makes an excuse to leave for a moment and deliberately misses the train. The last we see of Julie Christie she is looking out the window of the departing coach in Courtenay's direction her head cocked smiling slightly as if she'd expected him to abort the escape all along.It's sad in the end despite the comic interludes. This is a story in which the system embodies a lifelong inertia and the system wins. Courtenay will wind up with some wife who is full of bourgeois impulses but then he was never very creative himself  except for his daydreams.".

That still works with Julie Christie the symbol of the swinging sixties with looser morals and roots to shake up British society! The acting is a little familiar for those who can remember TV and films at that time but good with Tom Courtenay impressive especially at the end as he struggles to match leaving and staying at home and living for himself. But now the film looks overdone in the fantasy elements  very realistic with a ton of extras but it really does not work properly in black and white and without the background of the time and place viz Walter Mitty characters and their fantasies.

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Courtenay plays the title character an artistic fellow who fantasizes about massacring everybody who gets on his nerves yet longs to escape his provincial community to head to London to follow his dreams. No this is not a story of a 60's version of today's horrific events in schools and movie theatres and at political events. Billy is actually a gentle artistic man with just a bizarre imagination and his fantasy of blowing practically everybody away is simply his way of telling them to shut up. So bored with his routine existence he wiles away the hours with enlightening fantasies that express the longing inside him. There's his babbity familyundertaker father Wilfred Pickles washing obsessed mother Mona Washbourne and TV watching grandmother Ethel Griffies. Then there are several cartoonlike love interests and his neighbors and other townsfolk who consider him a wastrel. In comes pretty Julie Christie the only normal person he encounters and definitely one that any heterosexual young man would abandon their family for.Sometimes aggravating and testy this black comedy is nonetheless a well acted account of one man's desperation to find himself and the adults who couldn't understand his feelings if he were to express them in a fivevolume series of novels. Some of the cockney voices particularly that of the shrill waitress he seems to be being forced into being engaged to are ear shattering but then there are the soothing voices of Courtenay Washbourne particularly memorable and ultra beautiful Christie to balance it. The aged Griffies a marvelous character actress from decades of stage and screen is haunting as the not quite senile grandmother while Pickles even if overly impatient with his son is identifiable as the frustrated papa. The outstanding scene which ties everything together is a final one between Courtenay and Washbourne at the end where human emotions rise out of the stiff upper lip usually associated with the English.".

There's his babbity familyundertaker father Wilfred Pickles washing obsessed mother Mona Washbourne and TV watching grandmother Ethel Griffies. Then there are several cartoonlike love interests and his neighbors and other townsfolk who consider him a wastrel. In comes pretty Julie Christie the only normal person he encounters and definitely one that any heterosexual young man would abandon their family for.Sometimes aggravating and testy this black comedy is nonetheless a well acted account of one man's desperation to find himself and the adults who couldn't understand his feelings if he were to express them in a fivevolume series of novels. Some of the cockney voices particularly that of the shrill waitress he seems to be being forced into being engaged to are ear shattering but then there are the soothing voices of Courtenay Washbourne particularly memorable and ultra beautiful Christie to balance it. The aged Griffies a marvelous character actress from decades of stage and screen is haunting as the not quite senile grandmother while Pickles even if overly impatient with his son is identifiable as the frustrated papa. The outstanding scene which ties everything together is a final one between Courtenay and Washbourne at the end where human emotions rise out of the stiff upper lip usually associated with the English.";

	schema:reviewBody "Emil und die Detektive or Emil and the Detectives is a German film from 2001 in which writer and director Franziska Buch adapted the famous tale by children's books author Erich Kstner. I watched the 1930s and 1950s films about Emil his gang and criminal Grundeis not too long ago and it becomes obvious how different they were compared to this one here. Clearly Buch wanted to give the film a modern rework and there are many many aspects included that do not exist in these old films and probably also not in the book. Not sure about the latter as I have never read the book. One would be the kids rapping on several occasions others would be Gustav's mother working in a church. Emil here lives with his father played by Karl Wiesinger early on. And also the story is about gems that the kids can recover and for which they are rewarded. And there is more criminals in here chasing the kids other than Grundeis. The latter here is played by Jrgen Vogel and he is enjoyable to watch as always even if he gives Grundeis also a completely different approach. Still I must say that he is probably almost the only good thing about this movie. One major problem is that basically all the kids actors are pretty forgettable. The one who played Gusstav is the negative highlight here and Tobias Retzlaff who plays Emil is completely bland and not memorable at all. Sommavilla Pony Htchen is still the best from the gang I guess and even she is nothing special at all. Good to see most of these left film when growing up as I cannot really see a good future for the bunch when it comes to acting. Overall there were just not too many good moments in this 15yearold film. I cannot recommend checking it out especially people who love Emil the book or the old films should stay far far away. It's also way too long at over 105 minutes and that's why you find lots of forgettable filler material like the stuff I mentioned earlier. Thumbs down for this 2001 version.".

I can recommend this movie to everyone who likes the two other PTmovies. You'll find a lot of parallels to especially Bang Boom Bang.

Goldene Zeiten also plays in Unna. Nevertheless the audience of this comedy was very quiet. There were only a few good laughs. A lot of scenes that were presumably meant to be funny didn't really work even for this propitious audience. The characters of this movie were all pictured rather onedimensional and I didn't really feel for any of them. With 130 minutes runtime this movie was at least 30 minutes too long and I was kind of bored at the end. The two previous efforts of Peter Thorwarth Bang Boom Bang and Was nicht passt wird passend gemacht were much more enjoyable for me. So I recommend to rather watch these and to skip Goldene Zeiten.".

Maybe it is the lack of interesting characters or the fact that everything just centers around the Dirk Benedict plot which isn't funny enough to cover for two hours. To sum it up Yes it is kind of boring sometimes. The characters are very weak which is totally different in Thorwarth's other movies and the story has nothing to offer but a simple plot which suffers from the lack of good ideas hidden behind some violence. I think it would be a good TV movie but it's not enough for the big screen. For fans it is still enjoyable and I liked Ludger Pistor's actingcharacter so it gets 6 of 10 from me. Sad that this movie might not win a lot of new fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goldene Zeiten or Eingelocht or Strike! or Golden Times is a German movie from 2006 so this one had its 10th anniversary last year. It is despite how old it is already one of the most recent works by German writer and director Peter Thorwarth and thanks to his previous successes he has a cast at his disposal that includes more than just a few names that German film buffs will immediately recognize. These would be for example Mhring Roth Pistor Steeger Kahrmann Gregorowicz Burkhard Sasha Cortez Knfken... even if several of these only play small parts here. The film runs for comfortably over 2 hours which may also be his very biggest problem because the better moments are just good enough for 8090 minutes and as a consequence I felt there was a great deal of filler material in here and as a consequence of that actually the movie dragged on many occasions. You could perhaps say that it started in a somewhat solid manner but the longer it went the bigger a mess it became.I would not necessarily say it has to do with the acting even if there are some cast members in here that have more recognition value through charisma than through range. With this I am especially referring to Alex Neldel here who just isn't good enough in almost everything she is in sadly. Yes she may be easy on the eyes but that just isn't enough anymore these days with all these actually talented beautiful actresses. One of them is also in here namely Loretta Stern who has been in the entertainment industry for a really long time and I think she maybe gave the best performance here and I really hope she can find roles again as she seems to be struggling a bit as well these days. She is miles and miles better than Neldel and I also think the latter really did not do herself a favor with this unlikable character she is portraying in here.Back to the movie in general and also the plot there are some smart additions in here and I also enjoyed the part about the fake actor but just like almost everything else in here this segment dragged on for way too long that the solution at the very end almost did nothing anymore for me. The consequence is also that several of the characters come off as a bit on the gimmicky side and not authentic. Besides that the film really cannot be taken seriously as anything other than comedy. Not as drama. Not as romance. Not as a crime movie. And if we ignore these failed attempts at making an impact in other genres then the comedy really must have been at an amazing level to get a thumbsup from me here. It is not. There are occasionally mildly funny moments but even these get repeated way too often like the farting reference smh. I give this one a thumbsdown. In terms of quality these 130 minutes are everything but certainly not golden.".

Like The Flight Of The Phoenix and The Dirty Dozen Robert Aldrich's direction delivers the goods in this potboiler of a political thriller. One that was seriously laced with both liberal and conservative politics. Indeed this cinematic masterpiece is very explosive brutal violent and doesn't hold back on anything. One of the finest in action cinema.The action in the film begins on a Sunday Morning in Autumn in 1981 the near future for this 1977 release and centers on former US Air Force Brigadier General Lawrence Dell the late Burt Lancaster a Vietnam veteran who served five years as a POW. Upon his return Dell became a vocal advocate of disclosing the truth behind US involvement in Southeast Asia and IndoChina in the hope that a postWatergate America would forgive its government and have renewed faith in its leaders. Regarded as a dangerous embarrassment by the higherups Lawrence Dell is framed on a manslaughter charge and sent to prison. Still determined he recruits three inmates played by the late Paul Winfield Burt Young and William Smith to help him escape and take over a nearby SAC base in Montana that he helped design. Once in control of the base and armed with the launch codes Dell nonnegiotiably demands from the SAC Command Center that U.S. President David Stevens Charles Durning reveal the truth about the Vietnam War to the American people by reading National Security Council document 9759 on national television. SPOILER ALERT! A security file revealing the United States of America's real reasons for entering the Vietnam Conflict in the first place. Files it would seem that no one in the United States Government wants to be made open to the general public. If these demands that the topsecret Vietnam War files are not made public Dell promises at the turn of two keys to send the nine Titan missiles to their targets in the Soviet Union.In many ways the plea for 'open' government and revealing the shameful if not truthful secrets of both a controversial war and former administrations makes this science fictionaction thriller the first film of the Carter administration.Twilight's Last Gleaming is a stunning indictment of the arrogance if not bureaucratic closemindedness of certain government decision makers and the lengths to which they will go to maintain both the business as usual stance and the covering up of the brutal truth. At the same time it also dramatizes both the cynicism of the Post Watergate Seventies and the danger of our unthinking faith in technology. Tellingly it comes as a deep shock to the military that their usually reliable computer systems and detailed procedures seem to have gone haywire on the day of the siege of the missile silo that Dell and his people are in leaving them powerless to stop Dell.Robert Aldrich's filmshot in the former West Germany with no cooperation from the US militaryis a fascinating tensionfilled effort. One that could be accurately described as a Cold War thriller with a serious social commentary that was ten years ahead of its time. Especially with the United States and the United Kingdom Of Great Britain still recovering from the loss of the Vietnam War.Burt Lancaster contributes a fine performance as the righteous populist Brigadier General. One can definitely understand why this rightwinged patriot resorts to such methods to reveal the truth and the extraordinary lengths that go with such tactics. Charles Durning as alwayswhen he plays heroic and sympathetic charactersis superb as the saintly President Of The United States who comes to empathize Lancaster's viewpoints and high hopes. Paul Winfield offers some sound wisdom as convict Willis Powell. Burt Young has some minor comic moments as the other convicthis messing up of his fake identity to the Military Police guards at the missile silos is memorable. And finally Richard Widmark is excellent as the SAC General who goes out of his way to stop Dell from starting the nuclear countdown to World War III.Further more the late Jerry Goldsmith composes his usual if not excellent soundtrack for the film and veteran director Aldrich uses some remarkable splitscreen techniques that add to the film's tension and speed up the complicated expository passages.The film also has an extraordinary cast of familiar character actors that consist of Shane Rimmer the late Ed Bishop Phil Brown the late William Hootkins John Ratzenberger Garrick Hagon and a range of familiar screen legends that include the late William Marshall Gerald S. O'Laughlin the late Leif Erickson the late Richard Jaeckel the late Melvyn Douglas and the late Charles Aidman.Despite some minor impossibilities Twilight's Last Gleaming is both a gripping rightwinged and leftwinged action conspiracy drama that will have you on the edge of your seat until the very bitter end. Especially where it SPOILER ALERT involves some members of a shadowy branch of American Special Forces determined not to have that secret document about the bush wars in Vietnam revealed.".

The use of 'split screen' to show multiple events unfolding simultaneously really helped in building the tension. It was the first movie I saw using it. It did seem to grind long a little at nearly two and one half hours but that could have been due to my being a slightly restless and impatient 20 YR OLD. I haven't been able to catch it on TV whether it aired or not. Looking forward to its release on DVD in widescreen if not already out I haven't found it. Love to get a petition going like the one for Rolling Thunder but really don't know how.".

	schema:reviewBody "A renegade USAF general Lawrence Dell Burt Lancaster and his band Paul Winfield  Burt Young  William Smith  escape from a military prison and take over an ICBM silo near Montana . They have invaded Silo 3 and are prepared to launch nine nuclear missiles . Head saboteur General Lawrence threatens to provoke World War 3 unless the government and President of the United States Charles Durning  though Paul Newman was offered the role  but turned it down carry out their conditions  as they demand the followings  Ten million dollars  Air Force One it was only painted on one side and you Mr President as he must reveal details of a secret meeting and confess the Vietnam policies and crimes . Thrilling film about nuclear threatening that contains noisy action  suspense  intrigue  thrills and being pretty entertaining . One of the very few films made in the late 1970's to be shown with an intermission and an extended use of split screens functioning to a large degree in tightening the intrigue . The movie's weakest point is the television style and some ridiculous dialogues as when an enemy appears and Paul Winfield tells Perhaps he might be a midgetand Lancaster responds  There are no midgets in the United States Air Force. Based on a novel by Walter Wager titled Viper three with interesting screenplay from Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch . The secret policy is closely based on the 1957 book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy by Henry Kissinger in which the future Secretary of State outlines a strategy committing the US to promoting regional conflicts to deter the Soviets' initiating fullscale war. Topnotch acting by Lancaster as a thinking madman who holds America to ransom by kidnapping atomic missiles . Burt Lancaster initially turned the script down when he was first approached about the project but eventually agreed to do it after Robert Aldrich became attached to the picture. This is Burt Lancaster's fourth collaboration with director Robert Aldrich after Apache 1954 Veracruz 1954 and Ulzana's raid 1972. Very good support cast such as Roscoe Lee Browne as James Forrest  Joseph Cotten as Secretary of State  Melvyn Douglas as Zachariah Guthrie  Richard Jaeckel as Capt. Stanford  William Marshall as Attorney General  Gerald S. O'Loughlin as Brig. Gen. O'Rourke  Richard Widmark as Gen. Martin and final film of Charles McGraw  Lionel Murton and Leif Erickson . Atmospheric cinematography by Robert Hauser  all of the scenes were shot with two cameras running . Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by the master Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was professionally directed by Robert Aldrich  he even turned down a large salary and a 10 profit stake in A bridge too far1977 in order to make this film and he finished the film ten days ahead of schedule . Here Robert Aldrich gave a tense and brilliant direction . Aldrich began writing and directing for TV series in the early 1950s and directed his first feature in 1953 Big Leaguer 1953. Soon thereafter he established his own production company and produced most of his own films collaborating in the writing of many of them . Directed in a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone . He was an expert on warlike Dirty Dozen  The Angry Hills  Attack  Ten seconds to hell and Western The Frisko kid  Ulzana's raid Apache  Veracruz  The last sunset . Rating  acceptable and decent movie  it's a must see for Burt Lancaster fans .".

Topnotch acting by Lancaster as a thinking madman who holds America to ransom by kidnapping atomic missiles . Burt Lancaster initially turned the script down when he was first approached about the project but eventually agreed to do it after Robert Aldrich became attached to the picture. This is Burt Lancaster's fourth collaboration with director Robert Aldrich after Apache 1954 Veracruz 1954 and Ulzana's raid 1972. Very good support cast such as Roscoe Lee Browne as James Forrest  Joseph Cotten as Secretary of State  Melvyn Douglas as Zachariah Guthrie  Richard Jaeckel as Capt. Stanford  William Marshall as Attorney General  Gerald S. O'Loughlin as Brig. Gen. O'Rourke  Richard Widmark as Gen. Martin and final film of Charles McGraw  Lionel Murton and Leif Erickson . Atmospheric cinematography by Robert Hauser  all of the scenes were shot with two cameras running . Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by the master Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was professionally directed by Robert Aldrich  he even turned down a large salary and a 10 profit stake in A bridge too far1977 in order to make this film and he finished the film ten days ahead of schedule . Here Robert Aldrich gave a tense and brilliant direction . Aldrich began writing and directing for TV series in the early 1950s and directed his first feature in 1953 Big Leaguer 1953. Soon thereafter he established his own production company and produced most of his own films collaborating in the writing of many of them . Directed in a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone . He was an expert on warlike Dirty Dozen  The Angry Hills  Attack  Ten seconds to hell and Western The Frisko kid  Ulzana's raid Apache  Veracruz  The last sunset . Rating  acceptable and decent movie  it's a must see for Burt Lancaster fans .";

The original reviewer doesn't realize that several Vietnam Vets overran the Pentagon went to Washington D.C. and literally threw their medals. This was a film that was a catharsis for many overwhelming numbers of PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY FOUGHT THE WAR experienced.The movie is a cat and mouse thriller with Burt Lancaster demanding attention from the White House by controlling a missle silobunker complex. As a former Air Force General with high security clearance he knows how to complete the mission. The film is a study on why a decorated General threatens to start WW III.On the opposite side of the fence lies the President played by Charles Durning whose aim is to stop him. The supporting actors are outstanding on all accounts Richard Widmark Paul Winfield Burt Young Melvin Douglas to name a few. The actors making up the presidents cabinet are outstanding. The cabinetadvisors must decide is the General a mad man or can he pull off his threat of missle launch. What is his agenda? The ending is a shocking uncompromising statement on what happens in a political chess match.

	schema:reviewBody "Twilight's Last Gleaming is a rather far fetched and fanciful tale about a rogue general taking over a missile silo isolating it from remote control at the Pentagon and White House and having 9 Titan missiles with atomic warheads at your command. Burt Lancaster who was railroaded into a murder conviction to silence him escapes with Paul Winfield Burt Young and William Smith and they take over the missile silo and issue demands.The film is fascinating in one respect how this crisis is isolated from the knowledge of the public. The deliberations over the Cuban Missile Crisis had nothing on this and even that went public. The closest real happening in our history was when Grover Cleveland went missing for about 5 weeks to have cancer surgery and that never came out in his lifetime. Of course it worked out far better for Grover than it did for this president.Charles Durning plays the fictional president David Stevens and what Lancaster demands of him is not just the usual money extortion. He wants a document read from a National Security Council meeting from the Vietnam war years which would have a calamitous impact on a lot of people and our national credibility involving our very reasons for being in Vietnam. Durning did not even know the existence of it as his presidency is way in the future. But sly old time Defense Secretary Melvyn Douglas knows and as it works in these cases his reputation and national security seem to blend in.Another sly man from the past is Air Force General Richard Widmark who was once Lancaster's superior. Other members of the cabinet include Secretary Of State Joseph Cotten and Attorney General William Marshall.Despite Oscar winners and big box office names like Widmark and Cotten walking away with the acting honors here is Charles Durning as the president who is thrust into a crisis involving the distant past for him. His scenes with military aide Gerald O'Loughlin have some real feel and poignancy for both men.Twilight's Last Gleaming though far fetched is well worth a look.".

Vietnam the most controversial subject in history. A man who's deranged idea to stop war is by using a missile silo to make his point. General Dell Burt Lancaster is a man who's poised into stopping the black ops with his government so that the people can make a choice in the face of tyranny. Yet to achieve this he had to overtake a missile silo armed with Titan nuclear warheads in order to make his dream a reality. Although no one person wishes to use them in the haste of war in dell's mind it is the only option left other than diplomatic means to which his own fellow officers denied him and placing him in prison for thirty years.I really liked how they had Charles Durning play the president. To find out how the seemingly trust worthy governments kept a well hidden secret from the public eye and ear about what the Vietnam War was all about. To hear about how many lives were lost just because the idea of war is big business to those money cartels all over the world. And to find out that even a few of his own staff members were apart of such devious plots to show the Russians that they meant business in case both countries went to war later in the future.However none of this would ever come to light for his good friend Zachariah Guthrie Sec of Defense was asked by the president to make public the secret meeting for which the war was implemented from in the white house. That the last word would be from Guthrie himself. Except during the last moments of the president's life Guthrie never kept his word and the president died in vain.All in all I thought this was an exceptional film. Emotions running ragged in all corners of the white house dell and his cohorts. To see the joint chiefs combining efforts to hush up the well kept secret so that more wars in the distant future could flourish under the noses of the same American's who wanted nothing to do with wars in the first place. To see a leader gunned down like JFK for believing in the people rather than their own military might or black ops behind the curtain. It was a roller coaster ride of emotional turmoil set behind a stream of deceit lies greed and above all a totalitarian attitude the world can do without.A very gritty film based on the people's views on war and why it has no place among the human populace. Highly recommended to those over 17.".

Aldrich one of Hollywood's great liberals lays an antigovernment stance on pretty thick while making a tense highly enjoyable thriller. Burt Lancaster as a general railroaded by the government on a murderone rap is the head con with Paul Winfield and Burt Young joining him as ne'er do wells with very short fuses. Charles Durning is a rather too good to be true President and his cabinet is populated by the likes of Joseph Cotten William Marshall and Melvyn Douglas. They don't really have much to do or say. The focus of the film lies in the test of wills between Lancaster and military goon Richard Widmark. It's a taut highly suspenseful film despite Aldrich's inflammatory preaching. Lancaster is dynamite as a self righteous career soldier disillusioned with his own government and demanding that it come clean. Winfield  Young offer great support and William Smith appears briefly as one of Lancaster's unlucky cohorts. Set in the US but filmed in Germany. Gerald S.

	schema:headline " They unWagered and lost...but...";
	schema:reviewBody "Things are far too strange here to just say so bad it's good. Far far too strange.Instead let's say there are three ways to make a film out of a Walter Wager novel. First we have the Telefon example do a straightup linear bythenumbers thriller that is so straightforward and escapist that you get a rather wooden unmemorableif somewhat entertainingpotboiler. Nothing risked nothing lost nothing gained. That's Telefon.Or there's the 58 MinutesDie Hard 2 model change maincharacter Malone to John McClane keep the airportinjeopardy setting while massively rewriting the novel so it works as a movie sequel to something it wasn't even connected to in the first place and make sure it's more exciting than Telefon. Your cinematic thriller has soul and is safely attached to a successful franchise. And for goodness sakes stay away from polemic political commentary or deep meaning.This brings us to our third case of filming a Walter Wager escapist thriller tome attach thoughtprovoking sociopolitical concerns to the escapism. Try to address some lingering bitterness or cynicism in the US macropsyche over say the Viet Nam war. Homegrown terrorists as antiheroes trying to out the government's secrets over a futile conflict that lingered on as a political peeing contest that cost too many lives by way of a captured missile base. Rogue Major Burt Lancaster tries to stare down US President Charles Durning with nine nuclear warheads set to ferment unless some dirty laundry is aired right quick. Of course it's previous administrations' decisions that Durning's version of the President is getting slapped around for but that's all part of the...fun? Uh no sorry all part of the moral conundrum. The fun is somewhere else in the movie...and quickly seeping out of the movie the more director Robert Aldrich decides this is not just going to be escapist thrills.Personally I feel the movie gets most obviously unwieldy and dangerously overambitious once it starts to abandon Burt Lancaster in favor of Charles Durning. There's a big shift in focus as soon as we start hanging out with Durning and his boardroom full of muckymucksand shutin Lancaster becomes sort of a bit player in the proceedings even though he's got nine nuclear missiles. This switch in character focus directly corresponds to the diminishing thrills and the emphasis on deeper questions and concerns that Robert Aldrich decided were in tune with the USA zeitgeist of 1977. Less boobytraps ambushes shootouts torture sessions and stealth attacks gone wrongmore talk talk talk by suits suits suits sitting comfortably in chairs chairs chairs who wants more coffee? Meanwhile the splitscreen effect used deftly during action sequences much in the way of the TV show 24 years later gives way to less suspenseful splitscreen sequences showing Burt Lancaster almost looking bored while the President dithers.Then the ending comes along and finds a really unexpected and daring way to combine stark cynical commentary with a shockingly brutal final confrontation such as you would find in only a truly bold and cuttingedge thriller. And so I'm going to do what the movie does I'm going to end a review of what sounds like a bad movie deserving its flop status by shifting gears and saying Bravo! Why? Well 8 out of 10 for this becausedespite everything wrongheaded about the project I can honestly say that there is no other thriller or quasithriller stuffed with deep thoughts and dark commentary quite like it. It's a glorious misfire. I didn't take it seriously but it had me trying. More lively than Telefon less cheesy fun than Die Hard 2 and a unique experiment sort of Inside Man meets Sum Of All Fears meets PointCounterpoint. Crashes and burns in one of the most compelling ways I've ever seen and that ain't hay!".

	onyx:emotionText "Things are far too strange here to just say so bad it's good. Far far too strange.Instead let's say there are three ways to make a film out of a Walter Wager novel. First we have the Telefon example do a straightup linear bythenumbers thriller that is so straightforward and escapist that you get a rather wooden unmemorableif somewhat entertainingpotboiler. Nothing risked nothing lost nothing gained. That's Telefon.Or there's the 58 MinutesDie Hard 2 model change maincharacter Malone to John McClane keep the airportinjeopardy setting while massively rewriting the novel so it works as a movie sequel to something it wasn't even connected to in the first place and make sure it's more exciting than Telefon. Your cinematic thriller has soul and is safely attached to a successful franchise. And for goodness sakes stay away from polemic political commentary or deep meaning.This brings us to our third case of filming a Walter Wager escapist thriller tome attach thoughtprovoking sociopolitical concerns to the escapism. Try to address some lingering bitterness or cynicism in the US macropsyche over say the Viet Nam war. Homegrown terrorists as antiheroes trying to out the government's secrets over a futile conflict that lingered on as a political peeing contest that cost too many lives by way of a captured missile base. Rogue Major Burt Lancaster tries to stare down US President Charles Durning with nine nuclear warheads set to ferment unless some dirty laundry is aired right quick. Of course it's previous administrations' decisions that Durning's version of the President is getting slapped around for but that's all part of the...fun? Uh no sorry all part of the moral conundrum. The fun is somewhere else in the movie...and quickly seeping out of the movie the more director Robert Aldrich decides this is not just going to be escapist thrills.Personally I feel the movie gets most obviously unwieldy and dangerously overambitious once it starts to abandon Burt Lancaster in favor of Charles Durning. There's a big shift in focus as soon as we start hanging out with Durning and his boardroom full of muckymucksand shutin Lancaster becomes sort of a bit player in the proceedings even though he's got nine nuclear missiles. This switch in character focus directly corresponds to the diminishing thrills and the emphasis on deeper questions and concerns that Robert Aldrich decided were in tune with the USA zeitgeist of 1977. Less boobytraps ambushes shootouts torture sessions and stealth attacks gone wrongmore talk talk talk by suits suits suits sitting comfortably in chairs chairs chairs who wants more coffee? Meanwhile the splitscreen effect used deftly during action sequences much in the way of the TV show 24 years later gives way to less suspenseful splitscreen sequences showing Burt Lancaster almost looking bored while the President dithers.Then the ending comes along and finds a really unexpected and daring way to combine stark cynical commentary with a shockingly brutal final confrontation such as you would find in only a truly bold and cuttingedge thriller. And so I'm going to do what the movie does I'm going to end a review of what sounds like a bad movie deserving its flop status by shifting gears and saying Bravo! Why? Well 8 out of 10 for this becausedespite everything wrongheaded about the project I can honestly say that there is no other thriller or quasithriller stuffed with deep thoughts and dark commentary quite like it. It's a glorious misfire. I didn't take it seriously but it had me trying.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a waste of some very talented people. I liked all of the actors but the people who wrote this movie knew nothing of ICBM security or launch protocols. Even when I was 16 it seemed to be full of holes.First off the missileers cannot launch missiles without a series of codes. These codes must be sent to the launch team before they can arm anything. NORAD controls that. If a missile crew got the wild idea to do an independent launch the computers and arming systems would not work until the code was called in. The Air Force does not have a bunch of armored vehicles ready to roll in including the surplus USMC Ontose recoiless rifle carrier they painted blue and used.The snipers had stock M16s with screwon scopes. Cheezy.Even if you can overlook all of that by saying procedures had changed and gotten lax and we had decided to remove the external consent requirement to launch there are 2 BIG issues that were missed.One all the Air Force had to do was open fire on the missiles and they would have burned and probably blown up on the pads without setting off the nukes they have a VERY specific initiation process that is NOT triggered by heat. It is all NASA can do to keep rockets and missiles from blowing up on a perfect launch. In case you did not know a missile is 90 pressurized fuel tank. poke a hole in it and it'll never fly at least not far. Small arms fire could do it but artillery or antitank missiles would be best.Two There is no way the president is ever going to be handed over as a hostage.All of that is just technical trivia. The idea that America would enter a war and stay in it until we had lost 50000 men just to show the evil commies we were serious is beyond absurd. To buy that requires just plain gullibility. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of American History knows that the war in Viet Nam lasted over 3 presidential administrations yet the movie makes us believe that one decided to keep us in the until no less than 50000 Americans died and so it became policy.Nothing about this forgettable film is timeless or relevant. It is a piece of junk that preyed on cold war fears of nuclear missiles and government mistrust which were very much in the public consciousness in post Viet Nam Post Watergate America. If you want to see Burt Lancaster and Charles Durning together in a much netter movie see Tough Guys.".

	schema:reviewBody "A band of dangerous escaped convicts led by bitter disgraced and determined renegade former Strategic Air Force General Laurence Dell superbly played by Burt Lancaster take over a nuclear missile silo. They demand ten million dollars the release of a top secret document which gives the true reason why America fought in the Vietnam war Air Force One as a getaway plane and affable moral President David T. Stevens an outstanding performance by Charles Durning as a hostage. If Dell's demands aren't met he'll launch the missiles and start World War III. Director Robert Aldrich working from a bold hardhitting and incisive script by Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch relates the arresting premise at a constant headlong pace stages several stirring action set pieces with riproaring gusto and builds a tremendous amount of nervewracking suspense. This film further benefits from terrific acting from a firstrate cast Lancaster and especially Durning both excel in their meaty roles with fine support from Paul Winfield as the antsy reluctant Willis Powell Burt Young as the grubby excitable Augie Garvas Richard Widmark as Dell's austere nemesis General Martin McKenzie Melvyn Douglas as the pragmatic Secretary of Defense Zachariah Guthrie William Marshall as the equally wise Attorney General William Klinger Joseph Cotten as the weaselly Secretary of State Arthur Renfew Gerald S. O'Laughlin as Stevens' loyal righthand man Brigadier General O'Rourke and Richard Jaeckel as the disillusioned Captain Standford Towne. William Smith makes a brief yet chilling appearance as vicious unstable psycho Hoxey. Robert B. Hauser's polished cinematography makes inspired frequent use of split screen. Jerry Goldsmith supplies a tense rattling rousing score. The devastating downbeat ending packs a strong sucker punch to the gut. But what really makes this film so effective and impressive is the potent and provocative statement it bravely makes about the unnecessary wastefulness of the Vietnam war. An absolute powerhouse.".

They demand ten million dollars the release of a top secret document which gives the true reason why America fought in the Vietnam war Air Force One as a getaway plane and affable moral President David T. Stevens an outstanding performance by Charles Durning as a hostage. If Dell's demands aren't met he'll launch the missiles and start World War III. Director Robert Aldrich working from a bold hardhitting and incisive script by Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch relates the arresting premise at a constant headlong pace stages several stirring action set pieces with riproaring gusto and builds a tremendous amount of nervewracking suspense. This film further benefits from terrific acting from a firstrate cast Lancaster and especially Durning both excel in their meaty roles with fine support from Paul Winfield as the antsy reluctant Willis Powell Burt Young as the grubby excitable Augie Garvas Richard Widmark as Dell's austere nemesis General Martin McKenzie Melvyn Douglas as the pragmatic Secretary of Defense Zachariah Guthrie William Marshall as the equally wise Attorney General William Klinger Joseph Cotten as the weaselly Secretary of State Arthur Renfew Gerald S. O'Laughlin as Stevens' loyal righthand man Brigadier General O'Rourke and Richard Jaeckel as the disillusioned Captain Standford Towne. William Smith makes a brief yet chilling appearance as vicious unstable psycho Hoxey. Robert B. Hauser's polished cinematography makes inspired frequent use of split screen. Jerry Goldsmith supplies a tense rattling rousing score. The devastating downbeat ending packs a strong sucker punch to the gut. But what really makes this film so effective and impressive is the potent and provocative statement it bravely makes about the unnecessary wastefulness of the Vietnam war. An absolute powerhouse.";

	schema:headline " Crude and Simple but Eminently Fun Adventure Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Liane Jungle Goddess is a simple German Tarzan clone. Clearly aimed at the Saturday matine market it remains a worthwhile family film.It is a straightforward adventure story and was obviously made quite cheaply. There are few twists in the plot and there is a distinct lack of artistry in the storytelling and direction but it remains quite watchable after sixty years.The story tells of how white girl is found living amidst an African tribe and is rehabilitated to her family. As is so often the case in these stories it emerges she is the granddaughter of a wealthy tycoon so fairytalelike she is set to inherit a fortune unless a jealous antagonist's plot is successful.The African tribespeople are initially treated as a marginalised other and have no voice in the initial stages of the film. It is only when one of them travels back to Germany with Liane does he gain a voice and he is shown to be an honourable protector. Nevertheless throughout the black people are shown to be subservient to the white girl who leads them which is interesting given the film was made in a German still coming to terms with the horrific racial policies of its recent past.The early colour in the film is badly faded now. The sets are limited but emphasise the contrast between the rich western world and the jungle life but it condemns neither. Implicitly though there is the feeling the white girl belongs with the white people and that a return to civilisation is a better place for her.The initial mystery of Liane's origins is staged in a very rudimentary way as is the plot at the end. More fun is seeing how she adapts to life in Hamburg and uses her jungle knowledge on her family estate.Marion Michael's acting is passable in a brave performance. Some other reviewers have raised the question of the nudity in the film. It is completely nonsexual in nature so conservative parents need have no concern. Indeed there is no offensive material in this film at all apart from possibly the representations of race mentioned above.Overall this is a very workmanlike film and on one level it is sad to see how the German film industry had declined since the heady days of Fritz Land and the Weimar Republic. On the other hand in its simplicity and wholesomeness the film is clearly trying to capture something of innocence an innocence that had been lost in the horrors of the Third Reich. Marion Michael herself was a refugee from Knigsberg evacuated as a child as her city was annihilated around her so the fact that she was able to survive that absolutely horrific situation and find success in the film industry by personifying a character displaced yet holding onto a hopeful innocence perhaps gave the German populace and indeed all of us a hope for humanity that the civilian victims of war may survive and overcome the trauma to create something so good and so wholesome.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first learned of this film in the 1980s while looking through hundreds of random movie stills for sale in a movie memorabilia store in Hollywood. One of those stills was of a young lady with a cute Hayley Mills type face a lady labeled as Marion Michael squatting down in her jungle outfit while performing a dance her long blonde hair covering her breasts. She's gorgeous! I thought Who is she? I later looked up the movie title mentioned on the still along with her name and tried to obtain the movie but it simply wasn't available back then. I did find a few more stills of her and of this movie however. It wasn't until 2014 that I was finally able to see the movie on YouTube and I wasn't disappointed.The movie left me with a good feeling the same kind of homey jungle feeling I used to get as a kid when seeing Tarzan family movies from the '30s and I thought about the movie the rest of the day. Admittedly it's clearly a B movie with a predictable trite plot and shallow stereotypical characters but the combination of several elements made it work well in my opinion a beautiful young lady in scanty clothing pretty California jungle scenery cool jungle drums wildlife footage a '50s style family movie feeling amusing character foibles downplayed violence and a happy ending. There is a lot of atmosphere a treehouse a toucan a cute lion cub tikis natives attacking with blowguns several topless black tribal women with jiggling breasts as they beat on drums or dance some fragments of spoken Swahili etc. It has the look and feel of Adventureland in Disneyland with jungle tents a bicyclepowered generator for a Morse code radio British pith helmets rifles with scopes palmthatched native huts adorned with antlers etc. I think it would be a great film for boys who are Tarzan fans if only parents weren't so prudish about breasts. Kudos to Germany for being less prudish than Americans regarding the human body then and now Marion Michael must've been only 16 or 17 when this was filmed.Some minor oddball weaknesses... The footage was oddly sped up in some places especially to make it look as if Liane could climb a tree faster. Old Tarzan films did the same thing however. Liane's treehouse is in a disappointingly barren tree with all its limbs cut off. The cranesalligatorsnake scene sequence was used in both the beginning and end in absolutely identical footage would it have been that difficult to at least show those same animals a few seconds later?. Toucans such as the toco toucan shown perched in the tree near the beginning aren't found on the African continent only in tropical America. The pronunciations of Liane Jacqueline and VodosWodos shifted constantly throughout the film.Some miscellaneous observations... Liane still looks great in shorts abbreviated blouse and swimsuit while living in civilization. It's clear by the plant speciespampas grass Washingtonia palms Canary Island Date Palmsthat most of the jungle scenes were shot outdoors in some Southern California studio set but I felt that added to the feel rather than detracted from it since California vegetation is denser and more picturesque than African veldt vegetation and it captured the feel of those great old Hollywood jungle sets of the 1930s. Most likely the native tribe described as VodosWodos with its dances drums and food preparation wasn't authentic but if not it certainly looked very authentic to me. Nowadays it looks funny to see men and women lighting up stinky cigarettes right next to each other during romantic scenes but this was made in the 1950s and we've matured a lot since then except that some of us men still prefer pretty little bubbleheads all the same!If you liked this film films with a similar character you should check out are Sheena 1984 Tarzan and His Mate 1934 Little Indian Big City 1994 Jungle 2 Jungle 1997.".

Much better than Greystoke and much better than most 2010 movies where stupid reigns supreme.Of course we expect a sexy blonde with lots of leg not just for 10 year old boys but for old geezers as well. Not to give the plot away but there are two short scenes taking place in Hamburg Germany where the legs get covered up by a dress! Ugh!Still the entire movie is strictly G rated in spirit and content.Very nice scenes of the African jungle lots of animals including the lake where all the flamingos usec to flock. Hardy Kruger is the handsome young hero who has to contend not only with Liane but with a pretty cute female doctor who's set her eyes on him.The thin plot is never boring and will keep the interest of the kind of audience that loves good movies but wouldn't waste 5 minutes on KickAss or Iron Man 2.LIANE is now in DVD in color doubled with another good B movie about Devil's Island.

The crew kidnap the girl and take her back to the press who has a field day with her and soon it turns out she might be the long lost daughter of a very important man.This is a pretty strange film that I'm sure was loved by teenage boys back in the day. This Tarzanwannabe was filmed in German but it was sold throughout the world and in many locations it played matinees to where kids could watch it. They would have loved that because of the beautiful blonde in the lead plus the fact that she wasn't very many clothes and at times we see a few slips of nudity. Obviously it's easy to see why so many teens from this period have such a fondness for the film.As it stands today the film is pretty weird because it starts off as a Tarzan ripoff but then it quickly turns into some weird drama where people are fighting over who actually owns the title character. I'm really not sure why they decided to leave the jungle because that's where all the fun was. These early scenes contain shots of the wildlife and it was rather fun seeing the young girl in her natural location.All of the fun gets sucked out once we get back to civilization and the girl get taught how to speak English and how to be proper. This stuff is just told in such a boring way that you can't help but wish they were back in the jungle. Michael certainly has the appropriate look for the role and she's certainly fun to watch. Hardy Kruger is fun as the lead male and we also get Reggie Nalder playing a bad guy. LIANA JUNGLE GODDESS really isn't that good of a film. I'm sure when you watch it in life will determine how much entertainment you actually get out of it. For me personally the film is harmless fun at the start but it slowly grows more boring as it moves along.".

This was certainly done to make the film more appealing to foreign American audiences. And it must have turned out successful enough as several sequels followed in the years afterward. But for as much as I care not a single sequel was justified as this film here was extremely mediocre already. It is not a complete failure but I can really only appreciate it for the unintentional comedy. It does not work as a drama as an erotic film or as an adventure story. The action is as generic as it gets. For people who prefer brunettes like myself they brought in Irene Galter as a young stunning scientist. Blonde lovers can go for the late Marion Michael playing Liane. The biggest name in the cast however is certainly Hardy Krger. All in all the writing here was simply too bad to let me recommend it. I am not sure who is the one to blame the original author or the people who adapted her novel. But it's weak television material at best. Watch something else instead.".

A problem arises however when an unscrupulous man contemplates harming Liane because she might be the heir to a family fortuneand he's counting on having this money for himself. For this sort of movie Liane is actually pretty good. While it's not a mustsee or even a very good movie it's a mildly enjoyable Bmovie that has slipped into the public domain and can be downloaded from the link on IMDb. My only serious reservation is that the actress playing Liane was only 16 and I worry that pervs might watch the film for all the wrong reasons. 1218 yearold pervs are welcome...old creepy guys watching it are not!By the way I was really surprised when one of the characters was referred to as 'Mr. Goehring'.

When Greg discovers the big lie of his boss and mentor he has to take an attitude but Boyd is an old fox. Nasser Asphalt a.k.a. Wet Asphalt is a dramatic thriller based on a true story that shows the effect of a swindle in the press. The character Greg Bachmann is too brave and does not accept to sell his soul to the powerful Cesar Boyd and prefers to expose his former boss to the press in a rare example of integrity and ethic. Unfortunately the DVD released in Brazil is dubbed in English. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Asfalto Molhado Wet Asphalt".

Cesar offers a position of his assistant to Greg in return Boyd would write his story about his interviews to war criminals and Greg would help him in other matters. Meanwhile Boyd welcomes the daughter of a deceased friend Bettina Maria Perschy and he becomes her guardian.

Eeerily foreshadowing the 2003 New York Times scandal focusing on Jayson Blair who was fired after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. The film dialogues contain a lot of humor and fast paced generally good to follow. Gert Frbe and an excellent Marti Held create relatively multidimensional characters in addition to Horst Buchholz's main character. Even though the latest dubbed version is obvioulsy in English the subtitles contain one important recurring error The town they talk about is Gdingen a former German town in 1958 Poland. The subtitles however keep referring to Goettingen which is confusing at best but in the plot it is completely nonsensical. I would withdraw the DVD and redo the subtitles and replace them free of charge. Other than that the plot is nicely developed and another example of Frank Wisbar's talent. Wisbar had only come home from the US a few years earlier and would one year later make Nacht fiel ber Gotenhafen in which he described the plight of refugees from former Polish territories from where he was from as well.".

Apparently he is a reporter and was jailed for sneaking into Spandau Prison and interviewing several war criminals. Now released his reputation is poor and he accepts a job ghostwriting for a famous reporter who pays him very well. Buchholz practically worships his new boss and his unquestioned faith in the man will cause a serious problem. That's because his boss is less than scrupulous and concocts a crazy story about a small group of German soldiers who were trapped in a cave filled with provisions for over a decade! And to make this fantastic story worse when people question it the boss just makes the story wilder and wilder. Things spiral more and more out of controlat which point Buchholz finally realizes the truth. What is he to do?! In many many ways this is like a German version of the great Billy Wilder film Ace in the Hole. Both are supercynical films about the power of the press and the gullibility of the public.

	schema:reviewBody "Nasser Asphalt is a West German Germanlanguage movie in blackandwhite from 1958 so this one will have its 60th anniversary soon and it stars some of the biggest names from Germany from that time. Rising star Horst Buchholz and Martin Held both received German Film Award nominations for their performances in this 90minute movie. The female main role is played by Maria Perschy but sadly the longer the film goes the more her character becomes insignificant in the face of the two heroes. And it all seems so different at the beginning. It almost seems like a triangle relationship drama early on but the film turns more and more into another shot at Germany dealing with World War II guilt after all it was the 1950s and an interesting little tale on how press has a major impact on people's lives. The fact that we should not believe everything we are told is more than relevant today as well even if so much time has gone. Other than that Held carries the film strongly as the major antagonist to the protagonist played by Buchholz and Buchholz is pretty strong too. I can see why he got compared to the young James Dean and Marlon Brando. Probably the most gifted German actor from his age group at that point. Strong screen presence and aboveaverage range for such a young man. But even in the face of these two strong performances the heart and should of the film stays the story about a fake news article and what major even diplomatic complications arise from it. 1950's Germany was not exactly known for great filmmaking but here director Frank Wisbar and writer Will Tremper show the inferior competition how it's done profoundly. I certainly recommend the watch. Wet Asphalt is a success.".

	schema:reviewBody "Besides Raymond Massey a whole flock of actors have been known for playing America's sixteenth president Henry Fonda Walter Huston Sam Waterston Hal Holbrook Dennis Weaver Gregory Peck John Carradine. Character actor Frank McGlyn practically made a career of playing The Great Emancipator whenever Honest Abe was a character in a film. But the standard has been set by Raymond Massey who did Lincoln in Robert Sherwood's play for 472 performances on Broadway during the 19381939 season and he repeats the title role in Abe Lincoln in Illinois for this film version. I've no doubt that Sherwood used as source material for his play a lot of information based on Carl Sandburg's biography Lincoln the Prarie Years. At that time Sandburg was considered the unofficial custodian of the Lincoln legend and mythology. Of course he based a lot of his work on the biography of Lincoln written by his law partner William Herndon played here by Alan Baxter. Herndon's well known antipathy for Mary Todd Lincoln as the shrewish wife of his good friend comes through her in Ruth Gordon's portrayal. It should be said that Mary Lincoln regarded Herndon as an opportunist drunk and he certainly did have a substance abuse problem.Gene Lockhart as Lincoln's rival Stephen A. Douglas is well done also though Lockhart was a bit tall for the part. Had Douglas ever been elected president he would have been our shortest president he was barely over five feet tall. The rivalry between these two was kind of like the Yankees and Red Sox with the Yankees always coming out on top until recent years. Lincoln is still our tallest president at 6'4 so the contrast on the speaking platform at the LincolnDouglas debates was really something to see.The only other actor to recreate his stage role besides Massey was Howard DaSilva who played Jack Armstrong. Not the All American hero but the leader of the local gang of roughnecks who Lincoln beat in a wrestling match and who becomes his lifelong friend. All part of the Lincoln legend carefully preserved by Sandburg and Sherwood. It was one of DaSilva's earliest screen roles.Raymond Massey got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in 1940 and he was up against a strong field that included Henry Fonda for The Grapes of Wrath Charles Chaplin for The Great Dictator and Laurence Olivier in Rebecca. The winner however was a longshot James Stewart for The Philadelphia Story. There was a lot of sentiment that year that Stewart should have received the Oscar the year before for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. So the good Academy voters made up for it this year. It goes that way with Oscar every so often. Abe Lincoln in Illinois still holds up very well although today's historical Lincoln specialists might have different interpretations placed on some of the events you see.".

Herndon's well known antipathy for Mary Todd Lincoln as the shrewish wife of his good friend comes through her in Ruth Gordon's portrayal. It should be said that Mary Lincoln regarded Herndon as an opportunist drunk and he certainly did have a substance abuse problem.Gene Lockhart as Lincoln's rival Stephen A. Douglas is well done also though Lockhart was a bit tall for the part. Had Douglas ever been elected president he would have been our shortest president he was barely over five feet tall. The rivalry between these two was kind of like the Yankees and Red Sox with the Yankees always coming out on top until recent years. Lincoln is still our tallest president at 6'4 so the contrast on the speaking platform at the LincolnDouglas debates was really something to see.The only other actor to recreate his stage role besides Massey was Howard DaSilva who played Jack Armstrong. Not the All American hero but the leader of the local gang of roughnecks who Lincoln beat in a wrestling match and who becomes his lifelong friend. All part of the Lincoln legend carefully preserved by Sandburg and Sherwood. It was one of DaSilva's earliest screen roles.Raymond Massey got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in 1940 and he was up against a strong field that included Henry Fonda for The Grapes of Wrath Charles Chaplin for The Great Dictator and Laurence Olivier in Rebecca. The winner however was a longshot James Stewart for The Philadelphia Story. There was a lot of sentiment that year that Stewart should have received the Oscar the year before for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. So the good Academy voters made up for it this year. It goes that way with Oscar every so often. Abe Lincoln in Illinois still holds up very well although today's historical Lincoln specialists might have different interpretations placed on some of the events you see.";

Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning 1938 play by Robert E. Sherwood the screen adaptation tracing Lincoln's thirty years starting in 1831 to his train ride leading to Washington D.C. in 1861 stars Raymond Massey in a role he originated on stage being the best performance of a great American ever enacted by an actor who wasn't. Massey a Canadian by birth is not only the perfect candidate for the title role but an ideal choice. Massey's believability in his role earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Although he didn't win the election for that year it is Massey who very well holds this movie together.A followup of sorts to John Ford's most recent YOUNG MR. LINCOLN 20th CenturyFox 1939 starring Henry Fonda focusing on Lincoln's early years as a young lawyer in Springfield Ill. and a retelling in parts to D.W. Griffith's ABRAHAM LINCOLN United Artists 1930 starring Walter Huston ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS starts off on a rainy afternoon in 1831 with an introduction to the character of Abraham Lincoln Raymond Massey age 22 sitting on the floor in a log cabin reading a book by Shakespeare accompanied by his father Charles B. Middleton and a stepmother Elisabeth Risdon. With the Lincoln family background briefly depicted the next scene follows Abe who had left home to accept a 30 a month job as part of the crew rowing a flatboat hauling hogs down the Sangamon River to New Orleans. Along the way he encounters a very beautiful girl named Ann Rutledge Mary Howard with whom he decides to settle down in her native town of New Salem where he becomes in charge of a general store a position offered him by his employer Denton Offut Harlan Briggs. When he finds Jack Armstrong Howard Da Silva the greatest fighter who cannot be beat a little drunk and annoying Ann who along with his other friends having invaded her tavern Abe a stranger in town comes to the young lady's defense and publicly wrestles Jack to the end defeating his advisory and winning the admiration from all especially the respect and loyalship of Jack Armstrong. The year 1832 profiles Lincoln acting as leader in command of his soldiers with Armstrong being among them during the Blackhawk War period 1835 now finds Lincoln in a new position as postmaster general. He is visited by Joshua Speed Minor Watson and Ninian Edwards Harvey Stephens who introduce Abe to politics by choosing him to serve in the legislature which he would serve four terms. As for Ann having been engaged to John McNeil Maurice Murphy now living in New York for two years finds that after receiving a letter from him that he has no intentions of returning to her. To stop gossip from circulating around Ann's good name Abe admits his love for her from the moment he first saw her and asks her to become his steady. The relationship between them is cut short when she is stricken with an illness and dies. Lincoln quits the legislation to work in the law office with John Stuart in Springfield forming a partnership of Stuart  Lincoln CounselorsatLaw. Slowly improving his social position Lincoln is introduced to Mary Todd Ruth Gordon at a function given by her sister and Ninian's wife Elizabeth Edwards Dorothy Tree. Elizabeth wants Mary to marry an aristocrat someone like Stephen A. Douglas Gene Lockhart but her interest rests on Mr. Lincoln whom she eventually marries on November 4 1842. The marriage produces four sons the movie indicates three eliminating one who died in his fourth year and shows Mary's fight in having her hayseed husband fulfill his destiny to become president of the United States.Ruth Gordon 18961985 a prominent stage actress and playwright in her movie debut gives a remarkable performance in one of the best carnations of Mary Todd Lincoln ever portrayed on screen. Gene Lockhart 18921957 a veteran character actor in many feature film roles goes unnoticed as a very satisfying Stephen A. Douglas 18131861. Lockhart's best moment finds his Stephen Douglas sincerely congratulating his opponent Abraham Lincoln in winning the U.S. election something that should become a prime example with modernday candidates.As mentioned before ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS is very much a retread to D.W. Griffith's 1930 presentation of ABRAHAM LINCOLN with differences being the elimination of Lincoln's birth his trying years in the White House during the Civil War and assassination in April 1865. In many ways ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS is an excellent movie with excellent portrayals. Being a screen adaptation to a stage play John Cromwell's direction makes no indication as such. Minus Technicolor it's full of outdoor scenery and historical detail ranging from costumes to reproductions of small towns. Highlights include the well staged LincolnDouglas debate and one where Lincoln finally losing his temper towards his wife Mary after embarrassing him in front of his committee by ordering her twice You're notnever to do that again!ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS formerly shown on commercial television annually either on or around Lincoln's birthday February 12 later presented on video cassette finally on cable television's American Movie Classics prior to 2000 and Turner Classic Movies. Quite enjoyable as a motion picture and quite informative on a historical point of view this production at 110 minutes succeeds on both counts. Glory Glory Hallelujah his truth is marching on. ".

Lincoln is portrayed by the late Canadian actor Raymond Massey  who amongst many other roles is also remembered from HG Welles' Things to Come the screenplay of which was written by HG Welles himself. Early in Massey's career Lincoln's son Robert Todd Lincoln heard him perform and was struck by the similarity between Massey's speaking voice and that of his father. Since there are no recordings of Lincoln from that era shortly before Edison invented the Gramophone we have to rely on descriptions of his voice. Some from that time state Lincoln's voice was highpitched and that Massey did not do the voice properly  however I tend to give more credence to a living witness Lincoln's own eldest son who though he died 14 years prior to this film still had the opportunity to see Massey on stage and hear his voice. Massey got it right and this is one wonderful film  too bad I haven't found it on DVD  the next time it airs on TMC I'll have to record a DVD of it for myself.".

	schema:headline " Best ever portrayal of Lincoln on film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film probably 15 times or more and have been a devotee of the Lincoln mythology for lack of a better term for nearly 20 years. I remember first seeing the film as a youngster on the same weekend as the death and funeral of President Kennedy in November of 1963. At that time the two scenes that struck me as most memorable to my young mind was the one where the local woman tells Lincoln that he is the homeliest man in the county and the other scene where Lincoln is telling the slightly offcolor joke to a crowd about the man fighting the bear. Also another visual that sticks in my memory is the somewhat haunting scene where Lincoln revisits New Salem after the once thriving city has become a ghosttown. There are several marvelous aspects of this movie. To begin with is the near perfect physical and emotional representation of Lincoln by Raymond Massey. Given the photographs of the prepresident Lincoln making Massey into sixteenth president seems nearly ordained from the beginning. The height facial structure and body type is nearly a perfect fit. Regarding how Lincoln spoke it is hard to determine if that is an accurate representation or not. Historical accounts of Lincoln says that he had a rather high and not necessarily soothing voice. Since it would be another 30 plus years before there is any kind of recording device Massey's voice should seem appropriate enough.Additionally the cinematography is excellent. The onlocation or natural shots are superior by black and white standards. Even though I am a devotee of black and white films color films seem to have the upper hand when filming wideopen or rustic environments. The feel of the indoor scenes such as the ones within the Lincoln Springfield home is nearly perfect for the times. You can virtually smell the cigar smoke or the burning wood stove. Finally the lighting during the campaign speech scenes are awesome. But the best part of the movie is how even with some artistic license the characters surrounding Lincoln are historically strong and represent in a film microcosm a very accurate historical reality of Lincoln's early years. For example starting with Ruth Gordon's portrayal of Mary Linoln Todd. With her character you can easily feel how much she effected Lincoln. Her persistent pressure on Lincoln to achieve political importance and her hardnose sometimes loving sometimes bitter prescience is from my historical reading just about perfect. Since the film takes place before Lincoln is actually president Mary Todd Lincoln's shenanigans within the White House or her emotional unraveling in her later years is not an issue here. The romance demonstrated between Lincoln and Ann Rutledge although later to be historically challenged then even later to be considered historically possibly significant is quite sadly moving. It is nicely juxtapositioned against the image of Mary Lincoln Todd. Howard De Silva as New Salem's local ruffian is although somewhat embellished still represents Lincoln's ability to relate to people from all walks of life. The film just seems to find the vital essence of young Lincoln before he became president. The surreal final scene of Lincoln leaving Springfield for Washington D.C. again although actually happening during the day during a rainstormafter giving one of his many great historical speeches this is where I have lived catches the eerie but profound feel of how important his leadership is going to mean to the struggling republic. The playing of the Battle Hymnn of the Republic although premature is still simple perfect.".

	schema:headline " While not gospel it sure sticks much closer to the truth than other Lincoln films of the era";
	schema:reviewBody "Abe Lincoln is one of the most misunderstood figures in American historyperhaps THE most misunderstood. So much of what we assume are facts are actually myths and misrepresentationssome of which were promoted by writers and some by films of the 30s and 40s. While ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS is far from perfect it is lightyears ahead of the other contemporary works in giving a balanced account of Lincoln's life. While heroic in many ways Lincoln is more of a man in this film and the facts are generally trueand that's a lot more than can be said of such sentimental hogwash as D.W. Griffith's 1930 fiasco ABRAHAM LINCOLNwhich is basically one myth after another strung together!! I can say all this because I am well educated about the man and am an American history teacherso my opinion should mean something.One of the common myths that has abounded was the Ann Rutledge romance. While it's uncertain exactly how much they were in love was it just a passing romance or something deeper it's obvious that they were NOT as they were portrayed in ABRAHAM LINCOLN with all of its syrupy sweetness. Read up on the controversy yourselfopinions vary and there's no concrete evidence to prove either extreme. Here in ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS they seem to take the position that the love between them was just beginning to blossom when she died and that that was about it.Another myth is that Lincoln was 100 against slavery and that he personally freed the slaves that was actually done by Congress and the 13th amendment. The real life Lincoln though opposed to slavery was more concerned with unity and preserving the nation. Fortunately ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS gets this rightthey show Lincoln as being torn by these two divergent interests. Most books and films portray him as the Great Emancipatorthough Lincoln would have allowed slavery to keep the country from war and he did see class distinctions between the races.The other big myth is that Lincoln was sort of a dumb hillbilly and that he stumbled into greatness. While in this film he is a simple man of sorts he also is amazingly clever and has a great way with dealing with people. And occasionally he was a bit devious. While the film doesn't have a chance to show his political savvy and willingness to forget the Constitution during the war in order to keep the country together he is relatively shrewd in this film.As for Mary Todd in the film as in real life she was a conniver and a very unstable woman. While her mental instability was only briefly shown in this film as in realityher mental condition greatly deteriorated after her husband was President as well as his death but at least it was mentioned. Plus her intense drive was a major focus of the filmas it was in Lincoln's own real life. She was a harddriving and rather nasty woman if you read more about her and rather mentally unstable in her later years.As a longwinded teacher I could go on but probably should wrap it up now. The film is reasonably accurate and tends to show Lincoln warts and allsomething films up until then neglected. Additionally Raymond Massey's performance was superb and the film was both entertaining and inspiring. Interestingly enough Massey was a Canadian and did a much better job than the Americans who have tackled this role.".

While it's uncertain exactly how much they were in love was it just a passing romance or something deeper it's obvious that they were NOT as they were portrayed in ABRAHAM LINCOLN with all of its syrupy sweetness. Read up on the controversy yourselfopinions vary and there's no concrete evidence to prove either extreme. Here in ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS they seem to take the position that the love between them was just beginning to blossom when she died and that that was about it.Another myth is that Lincoln was 100 against slavery and that he personally freed the slaves that was actually done by Congress and the 13th amendment. The real life Lincoln though opposed to slavery was more concerned with unity and preserving the nation. Fortunately ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS gets this rightthey show Lincoln as being torn by these two divergent interests. Most books and films portray him as the Great Emancipatorthough Lincoln would have allowed slavery to keep the country from war and he did see class distinctions between the races.The other big myth is that Lincoln was sort of a dumb hillbilly and that he stumbled into greatness. While in this film he is a simple man of sorts he also is amazingly clever and has a great way with dealing with people. And occasionally he was a bit devious. While the film doesn't have a chance to show his political savvy and willingness to forget the Constitution during the war in order to keep the country together he is relatively shrewd in this film.As for Mary Todd in the film as in real life she was a conniver and a very unstable woman. While her mental instability was only briefly shown in this film as in realityher mental condition greatly deteriorated after her husband was President as well as his death but at least it was mentioned. Plus her intense drive was a major focus of the filmas it was in Lincoln's own real life. She was a harddriving and rather nasty woman if you read more about her and rather mentally unstable in her later years.As a longwinded teacher I could go on but probably should wrap it up now. The film is reasonably accurate and tends to show Lincoln warts and allsomething films up until then neglected. Additionally Raymond Massey's performance was superb and the film was both entertaining and inspiring. Interestingly enough Massey was a Canadian and did a much better job than the Americans who have tackled this role.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Robert Sherwood's Abe Lincoln in Illinois1940 Raymond Massey was Abraham Lincoln and it showed. Abe Lincoln in Illinois is the best of the Lincoln movies. I don't believe it can be surpassed. Raymond Massey a born and bred Canadian portrayed Lincoln as a melancholic persona due to the losses he had suffered. In spite of these painful memories such as the deaths of his mother Nancy and sweetheart Ann Rutledge Lincoln moved forward with his life. Lincoln started his law practice in Springfield Illinois. He met the sisterinlaw of friend Ninian Edwards Mary Todd. Lincoln jested that God spelled His Name with only one D but the Todd's needed two. Mary was interested in Abraham her sister wasn't. She felt Mary needed to meet a more refined fellow not a backwoods lawyer. But Mary saw a winner in Abraham.As a lawyer Abe tended to show a great deal of interest in all people in helping the poor and in politics. With his humor and ability to use stories to make points Abe was very popular with the citizens of Springfield. Mary liked those positives in his personality.During these years Lincoln worked hard and readied himself for a successful law and political career. With a 'hard' push from Mary Abraham was going to make something of himself.He and Mary Todd were engaged. Then due to a deep depression Lincoln abruptly broke it off. According to some he missed Ann. Mary tended to be Ann's polar opposite. Around this time Lincoln and Douglas held their famous debates. Lincoln was antislavery. Douglas believed it was the state's right to decide on slave issues. Douglas won. He went to the U.S. Senate as the Honorable Stephen Douglas of the State of Illinois. Soon after despite her family's opposition and Stephen Douglas's hard work to prevent it Mary Todd went on to marry her Abraham. During their years in Springfield Lincoln built a successful practice. He and Mary had 4 sons Robert William Edward and Thomas Tad. Eddie died while they were still in Springfield.While practicing law Abe continued to keep his foot in politics. He was asked to run for president in the new Republican Party. Lincoln won the White House. Mary had won the greatest prize of her life. Little did she know what she was going to lose.Just a few little asidesRaymond Massey had done this as a play. Writer Robert Sherwood and director John Cromwell asked him to do the movie. The MasseyFerguson Farm Machinary Company of Canada was founded by his Grandfather. In his later years Massey became a U.S. citizen.Gene Lockhart Bob Cratchett of A Christmas Carol1938 played Stephen Douglas. Lockhart was the father of actress June Lockhart who played one of the Cratchett children. Wife Kathleen was Mrs. Cratchett. Ruth Gordon known as the fun 80 year old Maude of the cult film Harold  Maude 1971 played Mary Todd. She was the feisty fighting 80 plus year old in Every Which Way But Loose 1978 and Any Which Way You Can 1980 Senovia 'Ma' Boggs Clint Eastwood was the star but IMO Ruth was the favored comic relief.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you compare John Cromwell's Abe Lincoln in Illinois with John Ford's Young Mister Lincoln  and how can you NOT  you immediately notice both similarities and differences. Ford's movie appeared a year earlier but Sherwood's play had been around for a while and can probably be considered earlier.Some isomorphisms are so conspicuous that it's likely that the craftsmen for Ford's movie lifted them from the play. Example It just can't be coincidental that both movie have celebrants doing a polka to the same tune which we learn in Young Mister Lincoln is Lovely Susan Brown. Even individual lines of dialog were shamelessly ripped off. If in Abe Lincoln in Illnois Howard Da Silva boasts I'm the big buck of this lick in Young Mister Lincoln the line is given to Jack Pennick.Those similarities are superficial and in fact the differences turn them into two almost entirely different movies about the same subject. Abe Lincoln in Illinois is more of a biographical sketch that gives us far more of Lincoln's political rise as well as his romances with Ann Rutledge and later Mary Todd. Ford's movie mostly sketches the character of Lincoln and then turns into a courtroom drama leavened with comic incidents.Comparing the two leads it can be said that Raymond Massey is a more convincing Lincoln than Henry Fonda. Massey simply looks more like the gangling Lincoln even without Fonda's false nose. Also for whatever reason in this instance Massey gives a better performance. Some viewers might wince at Massey's quivering oratory during his debate with Stephen Douglas but that was the custom at the time. The film prunes this house divided against itself speech. But  I'll try to keep this short  aside from Cromwell's movie covering Lincoln's maturation from a slow youth to his departure with his new whiskers for Washington while Ford's movie covers a much shorter time span and includes virtually no politics  Ford's movie is helped immensely by Alfred Newman's multivaried musical score. The Anne Rutledge theme is simple nostalgic innocent and elegant. There's nothing like it in Abe Lincoln in Illinois. On top of that Sherwood's narrative he did the screenplay too has more serious drama in it including the conflict between the compliant and peaceable Lincoln and his fiery and ambitious wife who was later to spend time in an insane asylum. We get far more than an occasional domestic squabble. Sherwood isn't afraid to hit us over the head with reality.Ford on the other hand throws history out the window in favor of sentiment and even an attempt at art in some of the incidents and certainly in the photography and lighting. There are two instants of melancholy both connected with Ann Rutledge's death and one dramatic incident involving a possible lynching but that aside it's more comic than dramatic. Even the murder trial has several amusing moments. Francis Ford called for voir dire puts aside his jug stumbles to the bench and pleads Guilty. Massey may be the better performer but Ford is the more subtle director. During moments of gravitas Cromwell's camera dollies in for a close up of Massey's face obviously and unnecessarily drawing our attention to the fact that something important is going on as Massey's voice hesitates before launching some impassioned pronouncement. Ford does it once when a woman asks Who are you? and Fonda replies I'm your lawyer Ma'am. I'm not counting the end of Ford's movie when Fonda wanders off to the top of a distant hill under an El Greco sky full of menace. Cromwell spells it all out in a final farewell address to the people of Springfield while Ford keeps it symbolic. Kids It's symbolic of the immanent Civil War fought over slavery and state's rights between the North and the South. A lot of people got hurt and the South was wrecked. The thunderstorm is a symbol because it stands for all that impending tumult. In the end it's just about impossible to argue that one movie is generally better than the other because they're so different in their intent and execution. Let's call them unordered variables.I suppose historically the movie is kind to Mary Lincoln and her shopping sprees and family background. A TV movie starring Sam Waterston fills in some of the blanks.".

Lincoln is portrayed here as a melancholy and complex man reluctant to accept his destiny. Mary Todd Ruth Gordon is portrayed as a demanding ambitious somewhat unstable woman. Both representations have some basis in fact although we can never truly paint a clear portrait of people who lived so long before our time. Biographical pictures are never 100 accurate but that doesn't stop them from being enjoyable and informative. This movie gets a lot more right than it gets wrong but that will never stop the nitpickers from trying to tear a good film down. It's a dramatization of a man's life not a documentary. If you want to learn more details about Lincoln's life I'm sure your local librarian would fall over his or herself to recommend some good books for you to read.Surprisingly the movie was a huge flop for RKO at the time. I'm not sure why but perhaps it's because the John Ford classic Young Mr. Lincoln had come out just the year before. The direction and overall production of the Ford film is probably superior to this one. But the script and more accurate casting Massey was just born to play Abe probably leans in favor of this film. Both are great films and I recommend you see each one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film portrays Abe Lincoln's political rise as a man of the people from his wrestling brawl with town bully Howard da Silva to his failure as a general store owner and his humble beginning in politics as a town postmaster. The film portrays the women in Lincoln's life and the influence they had on him. Perhaps the most influential woman is the one not shown his mother but he shares a moving scene with his step mother as he's leaving home and then with Ann Rutledge and finally with Mary Todd played in an unusually interesting way by Ruth Gordon. It's perhaps the influence of these women and their uncertain fates that more than balanced Lincoln's well developed humor with a dark and secret melancholy. That aspect is captured through some of the scenes of Massey's Lincoln shot by legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe. Between him Massey and Ruth Gordon this film seems to carry some serious cinematically induced psychological influences.".

I also enjoyed the depiction of early frontier life in the turbulent years before the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln tackling a runaway hog? It was easy to share the joy this episode brought to both he and the lovely Ann Rutledge.Yet it was sad to witness this homebody getting sucked in by the needs of others from his statushungry snob of a wife to plain old folks who wanted a great leader. Abe starts out in life a thoughtful perhaps melancholy lad and evolves into a dutybound man who is clearly depressed if not henpecked to boot.I hadn't recognized Ruth Gordon until the final credits. It's ironic that her career spans this role in which she's dour and unlikeable and that of Harold and Maude where she epitomized a zest for living. My only complaint about this film is its limited focus. I know it was based on a play that was similarly circumscribed but I'd have loved to accompany Abe on that train ride and beyond to observe the really historic part of his career.".

Isn't that what great acting is all about? Moreover even if you appreciated our 16th president before this movie will make you feel that your appreciation was severely lacking. My hope is that these fine gentlemen are now in a place where they can both be proud to be associated with the other.Some irony though.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it be a foolhardy endeavor to look to this motion picture for an answer about Abraham Lincoln and the life thereof.This film does not provide an answer but more or less an idea about the times which immediately preceded Abraham Lincoln into office.It is nonetheless a very fine film about a truly great man in Abraham Lincoln.I think if there is one thing about these Hollywood films they due tend to mix things up a bit and this particular film is no exceptionhowever that being saidRaymond Massey was as close to the real thing as I have ever seen.A truly remarkable rendition is made by the casting of Raymond Massey as Abraham Lincoln.In so far as his performanceit is equal to his likeness to Abraham Lincolnunmistakable.The attempt to place certain events as having occurred in Abraham Lincolns life is not without peril because there is next to no information about Ann Rutledge.This seems to be very much the way that these films like to mix things upI don't think there was such and historically there is no real evidence of any such relation.However it is not unattractive and it is more to the credit of this medium than to Abraham Lincoln.The addition of these false attributes are of another sort and provide only a glance at an underlying problem associated with Hollywood and its film making proclivitieshowever it is well maintained that this is a top rate motion picture.Perhaps one of the most stirring moments in this picture was the depiction of the LincolnDouglas debates and here itthis film and its starRaymond Massey as Abraham Lincoln shine as the star in the sky.It is perhaps one of the defining moments in this film and indeed it drew much attention in its time as well.Abraham Lincoln did provide for a dramatic farewell however the placing of the Battle Hymm of the Republic was poorly timedhowever some of the speeches were stirring then and even nowperhaps Abraham Lincoln does walk at midnight.Mary Todd Lincoln was played by Ruth Gordon and though it can be difficult to judge what life can provide for in the proposal and the subsequent life that Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln hadhere we have almost an ill suited pairing that provide for a wealth of humor and pathos in both the performances by Ruth Gordon and Raymond Massey.There is such a genuine appeal of this backwoodsman in Abraham Lincoln that pleasure in his life and times proceed beyond our ability to judge.It is a film that has the uncanny ability to keep your attention through character development rather than special effects.The performance of Ruth Gordon as Mary Todd Lincoln is as well worthy of the man and his times.It is very dutiful and devoted though no less engaging to watch these two bare three children as time passes.Abe and Mary were to lose there youngest while Abraham Lincoln was in office.The loss had a devastating effect on both parents with special mention in particular to Mary Todd.Howeverthis film does not start here but ends up here and perhaps some mention about the earlier time in the film is worth consideration.It seems that Abraham Lincoln was very much self taught and possessed a desire to know more through his efforts and others efforts in his behalf.It is a little bit confusing as to why they would wish to suggest that Abraham Lincoln did'nt know Shakespeare from one of his plays or sonnets for that matter.I think that is Hollywood and such are there proclivities to a particular kind of thinking.This illusion may in fact suggest something of a racial nature which is not necessarily black but does court influence.The influence here like then was of an arrogant nature and it promised only ridicule and a unreasoning demand.This is one of the sorrows that this film hides in its colloquial attempt to include all in its nature.It is worthy of note that there was cause as to the Civil War and indeed this film showed some of that.The highlighting as to the flint of the fire being the story of John Brown is only the beginning and even more so this film was not so much an attempt to know the causes as to the conflict but was an attempt more so to present the life leading up to that point in time of Abraham Lincoln.This time in history has that about itit is a flint by which the fires of everlasting virtue are brought upon the life of our greatest president.This film provides in its own right a category which I refer to as Americana.Though indeed we are looking at a motion picture and further we may suggest that there is nothing like the real thing it remains a film as popular and as worth enjoying as any the likes that have come from HollywoodUSA.It has been graded a 10 because it rates great Americana story telling.The only suggestion that I wish to conclude this comment with is that when I saw this film as coincidence would have itI was in a class entitled Civil War History in an institution of higher learning and it made this all the more enjoyable.If you wish to know more about this very dramatic time you might be well served to purchaseThe Civil WarA film by Ken Burnsor maybe become a historian like Bruce Catton because there is more drama in this time period then Hollywood can produce.This comment is being submitted in honor of Presidents DayFeb.212005.".

Raymond Massey received his only Oscar nomination as Abe Lincoln in Illinois and it's s superb performance and unlike Ford's movie this covers the whole spectrum of Lincoln's life from the earliest days right up to Washington and the presidency his courtship of Ann Rutledge a charming Mary Howard and marriage to Mary Todd a wonderful Ruth Gordon.Other standouts in a good cast include Gene Lockhart as Stephen Douglas and Howard Da Silva as the town bully who becomes Abe's best friend. The source material is a Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert E Sherwood and it was Sherwood himself who brought it to the screen while Lincoln's 'House Divided' speech magnificently spoken by Massey could be culled from today's headlines and sadly is just as appropriate today as it was back then.".

Raymond Massey received his only Oscar nomination as Abe Lincoln in Illinois and it's s superb performance and unlike Ford's movie this covers the whole spectrum of Lincoln's life from the earliest days right up to Washington and the presidency his courtship of Ann Rutledge a charming Mary Howard and marriage to Mary Todd a wonderful Ruth Gordon.Other standouts in a good cast include Gene Lockhart as Stephen Douglas and Howard Da Silva as the town bully who becomes Abe's best friend. The source material is a Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert E Sherwood and it was Sherwood himself who brought it to the screen while Lincoln's 'House Divided' speech magnificently spoken by Massey could be culled from today's headlines and sadly is just as appropriate today as it was back then.";

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of April 1940 Frank S. Nugent resigned as chief film critic of The New York Times in order to pursue a career as a Hollywood screenwriter. His last review Rebecca was published on 29 March. His deputy B.R. Crisler took over for less than a month before Bosley Crowther the paper's Hollywood correspondent began his long reign in New York. This wrecked Abe Lincoln in Illinois's certainty of a place in the Times Ten Best. While agreeing that the film was the best Lincoln picture the screen has ever had Crowther felt it did not elevate screen biography to new heights although it was certainly fine and interesting. These comments fall a long way short of Nugent's endorsement which declared Although the Pulitzer committee may smile skeptically we have no hesitation in calling the film the play's superior in calling Raymond Massey's screen Lincoln better than his play's Lincoln in finding it not only a more complete record of the man and his times but a far more dramatic and a far more significant biography than the Pulitzer committee saw.Other critics across the nation were equally enthusiastic With 221 votes the film placed 6th in the annual Film Daily poll.COMMENT One of the best films ever made this movie features a brilliant performance from Raymond Massey in the title role. It's unbelievable that Massey missed out on Hollywood's most prestigious award. His Lincoln repeated from the Broadway stage is easily the most moving portrait of his entire screen career. It's true as a few overfinicky critics have complained his acting tends to be stagey and that the director occasionally seems to be forcing him to pose in carefullywrought tableaux but Massey brilliantly forcefully overcomes all obstacles to make his Lincoln totally sincere totally convincing he may be too old for the early scenes but no matter and overwhelmingly sympathetic.If you're in a faultfinding mood and you want to pick at a mannered performance go no further than Ruth Gordon. Odd quixotic stagey she certainly is but she's always an interesting player  and I like her!More conventional but equally fascinating portrayals are etched by Gene Lockhart an everreliable actor and Roger Imhoff a player who is not usually cast in such prominent roles  more's the pity. Also to be warmly commended are Aldrich Bowker Mary Howard Harlan Briggs and the unlisted actor actually director Cromwell himself who plays John Brown. All told it's a grand cast with many capable faces filling in the background.Abe Lincoln has been most lavishly produced. It's anything but a photographed stage play. Grover Jones opened out the action of the play so that it's truly a colorful movie and then Sherwood came back and filled in the dialogue. A perfect combination of writing talent which has resulted in a screenplay that is both full of incident and excitement yet has dialogue effectively fired with humor drama even poetry and romance.The makeup and costumes look incredibly realistic while the sets and their appointments have a sparse unHollywood lack of glamour and ornamentation which seems totally authentic. Not that the film looks bare  it is often crowded with people and is always appealingly and most attractively lit by James Wong Howe.Cromwell's direction is most assured. It also has been criticized for being too stagey and too static but a recent viewing of the film makes nonsense of these claims. True Cromwell does effectively employ stage compositions  even tableaux  at times. But not only are these moving and dramatic in themselves who could forget the picture's final scenes or indeed the final shot of all as the train pulls out carrying Lincoln to Washington? This is real emotion but they are skillfully contrasted with scenes of vigorous action in which both camera and players move with a speed that is only possible in the cinema.Roy Webb has provided a rousingly familiar nonetheless stirring music score. Other technical credits are as proficient as unbounded Hollywood largess can make them.Abe Lincoln in Illinois is not the dry bones of history but a living moving portrait that is as vital and relevantly dramatic in 2015 as it was 75 years ago. Sherwood has not penned a museum piece but a convincing fascinating wellrounded and above all deeply sympathetic picture that will live for all time. In fact the more times I see the movie the more I enjoy it. After viewing the superb Warner Brothers DVD I regard it as one of the best movies Hollywood ever made. Certainly Raymond Massey rendered one of the alltime great performances of the cinema. Despite its great entertainment qualities and the plaudits of most critics the film was not overly popular on first release. RKO's initial domestic loss was nearly 750000 and it seemed the film would in no way duplicate the success of the play which opened on Broadway on 15 October 1938 for a highly profitable run of no less than 472 performances. Oddly enough the picture proved more popular overseas playing with great success in England and Australia. For example it was aired at least 30 times on Oz television making it one of the most frequentlyseen RKO releases of the 1940's.".

Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a rarity in that it was directed by that master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. The film pays in ways that only a crafty Hitchcock would know how. The director takes Norman Krasna's screen play and gives it an elegant treatment.The idea of a technicality annulling a marriage is at the center of the story. When David Smith is told about it he sees the possibility of not telling his wife. Ann and David have a strange marriage life. They love each other dearly and they seem to work at maintaining their union as a fun enterprise where they are playful and do unexpected things to please one another. David miscalculates Ann's reaction to his playing a joke and not telling her about their new status.The revelation at the beginning of the film is made known to Ann who goes along with the joke expecting to be asked that same day to run to a justice of the peace to get married again. When David doesn't act on what for Ann seems to be essential she flies into a rage and vows to get even with David. This is the basic premise of the comedy. Things get complicated but we know all will be right at the end as Ann will come to her senses. David also is expected to legalize their status.The film is a joy to watch because of the two stars. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery were two charismatic performers that had an uncanny sense of timing. They make a delicious couple that deserve to be happy even at the expense of making each other crazy in the process. Just to see a playful Carole Lombard giving a razor shave to Robert Montgomery is well worth the prize of admission!The rest of the cast is outstanding. Gene Raymond plays David's partner Jefferson Custer an upright man who admires Ann from a distance. Their scene when they get stuck in the rain at Coney Island's parachute has to be one of the highlights of the movie. That whole sequence after they return to Jeff's apartment and he gets the liquor medicine from Ann is hilarious.There is a cameo from the director that passes by too quickly and if the viewer is not paying attention it will be missed. Jack Carson is excellent as the bad influence for David. Philip Mervale and Lucile Watson are seen as Jeff's parents.This film proves Alfred Hitchcock could have tried his hand at more comedies because he seems to be a natural to the genre. Of course any director was going to excel with Carol Lombard and Robert Montgomery playing the lead roles of any movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's unfair to look over this film because it is not a true Hitchcock film. It's still a great film and a great screwball comedy. It is very funny and contains at least two of the funniest scenes I've ever seen the one where Robert Montgomery plans to have premarital sex with Lombard thinking she doesn't know that they aren't married and the restaurant scene where Montgomery pretends to talk to a really pretty girl who's sitting next to him. You can just barely see Hitchcock in this film  there are a few marvelous camera movements and angles that seem like Hitchcock was sighing saying God I'm bored! The two leads Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are wonderful. Everyone else Gene Raymond as Jeff and Jack Carson as Chuck he's especially hilarious I wish he had had even more scenes! and everyone else too is constantly hitting bullseyes.Unfortunately in the last 20 or 30 minutes of the film it begins to fall apart after the plot moves to Lake Placid. First off it's begins to grow tiresome. Lombard is starting to come off as unnecessarily cruel. The faux drunken mumblings of Montgomery aren't as funny as they're supposed to be. Jeff's parents are getting in the way. At least the final scene makes up for some of that! 810.".

	schema:headline " Mr.  Mrs. Smith";
	schema:reviewBody "The most surprising entry from the filmography of Alfred Hitchcock is his 1941 film Mr.  Mrs. Smith. Hitchcock claimed he made the film as a favor to lead actress Carole Lombard Mr.  Mrs. Smith is the only screwball comedy the famous suspense director ever made. Starring along with Carole Lombard is Robert Montgomery the pair plays a married couple who find out that their marriage is unofficial and instead of going through the legal paperwork to make their union legal they question each other and their feelings. Out of his element Hitchcock put forth a classic comedy that oddly still feels like a Hitchcock film a true treat for the serious fan as they wade through Hitch's body of work. Elite New York couple Ann Smith Carole Lombard and David Smith Robert Montgomery have enjoyed an affectionate loving wedded bliss for three years. After individual visits from their lawyers however they learn that a municipal technicality prevented their union from being legally recognized. What should be a simple fix turns into a possible breakup for the couple as they start to wonder how much in love with each other they truly are. The day the couple was told of the technicality David commented over breakfast that if he were to start his life over he would never marry. Despite his love for his wife David feels as though an immense amount of sacrifice of himself has taken place due to his marriage to his wife. That comment has stuck with Ann as she decides what to do about her defunct marriage to her husband. Ann decides that a separation is in order and she begins to live the life of a single woman even readopting her maiden name. As Ann enjoys her new life and freedoms David sets his sights to stop at nothing to win back the devotion of his wife. Winning back Ann's hand becomes much more difficult as she begins dating other men. As David becomes increasingly more disgruntled with life without his wife he begins to realize that maybe he wouldn't remove his wife from his life if he had the chance to do it again.As a fan of classic cinema I was both surprised and embarrassed to realize that this was the first film I had seen of classic star Carole Lombard. I was happy to change that status and finally see her of a film I found Lombard's acting exceptional and engaging and cannot wait to see more of her work. This film is a lot of fun with the slight nods to silent cinema it seems to employ. The ways in which Mr.  Mrs. Smith plays out like a silent film prove to be a perfect match to the plot of men's and women's relationships of the 1940's. As Lombard gains independence she enjoys life without her husband more therefore illustrating the liberation of women in the 40's. Although Mr.  Mrs. Smith has a very Howard Hawks feel to it it is also clear that there are many aspects recognizable as Hitchcock touches. For instance this journey through Alfred Hitchcock's filmography I have grown quite fond of the way in which the auteur films faces. That same unique way faces are filmed are present in this film and are fun to watch. Sure the film is a comedy therefore Hitchcock touches are few and far between but the film doesn't feel foreign to fans of Hitchcock and one can see his touches in it throughout the film. Fans of Hitchcock must see this film if for no other reason just to see the famous suspense director trying his hand at comedy although if given a chance one won't be disappointed with a Carole Lombard film either.".

Robert Montgomery is extremely funny with both excellent physical comedy and great comedic timing with his dialogue.  What surprised me most was the excellent comedic timing of Carole Lombard.  She is extremely funny but her chemistry with Montgomery in their scenes together is fantastic.The direction of course is excellent.  Not standard Hitchcock suspense but classic Hitchcock comedy and romance elements of his film making that a lot of people overlook.  Honestly this is a fun movie.  The humor is intelligent and never sinks to an infantile level.  I had never heard of this movie until about two days ago and I watched it and I was pleasantly surprised.  8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Lombard  Montgomery  Hitchcock  Mediocrity";
	schema:reviewBody "Because it is somewhat unique in Hitchcock's works there has been a continuous attempt in recent years to upgrade public opinion about MR. AND MRS. SMITH. Hitchcock explained to Francois Truffault in HITCHCOCKTRUFFAULT that he always wanted to work with Carole Lombard and she prevailed on him to do this film with her. But that does not really explain the choice of material.Lombard of course is best recalled for her wonderful daffiness in screwball comedies like NOTHING SACRED TRUE CONFESSIONS and MY MAN GODFREY. Her costar Robert Montgomery had been in many delightful comedies PETTICOAT FEVER PICADILLY JIM too. But both performers had been in dramatic films. In this period Montgomery fresh from his great performance as Danny in NIGHT MUST FALL had made RAGE IN HEAVEN with Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders and Lombard did VIGIL IN THE NIGHT with Brian Ahearn. They were both highly capable of dramatic performances.So why couldn't they have sought a more typical Hitchcock screenplay? My suspicion is that Hitchcock chose to make a screwball comedy as an experiment. He did that frequently when he felt like stretching his abilities and sometimes the results were not too good. When it was a technical experiment like ROPE or DIAL M FOR MURDER he still had the strength of the film script to fall back on if his nine minute shots or his use of three dimensional film did not quite work wonders with the audience. But when he tried humor he had less success.Hitch's sense of humor is not bad  but it works best when he uses it sparingly. In THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH 1956 Hitch sets up a delayed joke involving Hillary Brooke and another actor coming to visit their friends Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day in London. Stewart and Day leave their flat because they are going to try to rescue their son in the hands of the kidnappers. They apologize and tell Brooke and her husband they'll be back presently with their son. Brooke and her husband look confused as they leave. The remainder of the film and the melodrama in the embassy is played out. Final scene shows Brooke and her husband have fallen asleep waiting for them. Day Stewart and their son come in wake up Brooke and her husband and proceed to act as though nothing has happened for three or four hours.That is an example of when the Hitchcock humor works. But then comes his full scale black comedy THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY and the viewer has mixed feelings. Individual moments work like the manipulation of the dull sheriff Royal Dano. But one finds most of the humor about moving a dead body fairly unimaginative...surprisingly so from Hitch.MR. AND MRS. SMITH is not a black comedy but it's type of bedroom farce situation would have been better handled by Ernst Lubitsch or Leo McCarey or Preston Sturgis. The joke is that the surfacewarring Smiths are really in love but discover that their marriage was illegal. Montgomery had said he'd marry Lombard again if he had to prior to the discovery of the illegal marriage but instead of rushing Lombard off to any nearby church or justice of the peace he hesitates. And Lombard wonders what kind of man she has been illegally married to. So she turns to his partner Gene Raymond who is interested in her.There are some interesting moments in the film Hitchcock has to be of interest always. The scene where Montgomery pretends to be talking to the pretty woman sitting next to him incurring the ire of her date is good culminating in Jack Carson trying to stop a bleeding nose on Montgomery by using a cold knife as a cauterizing instrument. There is also a funny moment when Lombard and Raymond on a trip to an amusement park get stuck on a ferris wheel on top of it during a heavy thunder storm. But these moments are far and few. As a romantic comedy it is mediocre despite it's stars and unfortunately because of it's director. Hitchcock must have realized it too  until THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY he never attempted a straight comedy again and as mentioned before THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was not a romantic comedy but a black comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "There seems to be little consensus on this movie most people love it or hate it. I can see why. The movie has its golden gleaming moments and then it has its moments that fall flat with a hollow thud. Unfortunately the ending of the movie is the hollowest thud of all and smacks almost of soap opera.Also Lombard hardly seems herself in this movie she plays the foil to Montgomery's gleefully devilish protagonist and only occasionally does she steal a scene. Hitchcock or perhaps the screenplay seems almost determined to keep her locked down. A pity.Still Montgomery's leering eyes and wicked yet boyish halfsmile are by themselves reason enough to watch this movie. The whole issue of forbidden illicit sex is handled beautifully because after all the two are man and wife in everything but legal technicality. It seems odd that Lombard's character reacts with such savage anger about the whole thing. Considering the way she plays fast and loose with the affections of her husband's partner even though she can't deny that she has been a common law wife of three years standing one wouldn't expect such a prudish attitude from her. More likely she would have joined her erstwhile husband in enjoying the hint of illicit passion. But it's best in movies like this not to examine the logic behind the story too closely.Although Montgomery is the heart of the movie nevertheless perhaps the best scene in the movie is when the straitlaced genteel Gene Raymond proceeds from tipsy directly to deaddrunk and delivers possibly the funniest because the most realistic rendering of inebriation ever filmed. There's a point where he plants a foot on a step in front of him a very low step and one would think that in so doing he had just climbed Mount Everest. Priceless.Others have noted and I agree that outside of Lombard Montgomery and Raymond the other characters are mere cardboard props and simply not funny. One can see that Hitchcock himself recognized this. When Raymond is closeted with his concerned parents in the bathroom at his office the director is reduced to using gurgling plumbing sounds to punctuate the dialogand for no apparent reason other than for some kind of comedic effect because the dialog so clearly lacks any. When plumbing steals the show you know you're in trouble.One might see in the trip to the rustic resort an echo of Shakespeare's comedies in which the scene always changed from the banal to the fantastical to underscore or even effect the transformation of the characters. But that doesn't happen here. Everyone continues to act the way they did before. That's not surprising for in Shakespeare the change in scene always happened at the beginning not the end. You can't teach an old dog new tricks and the personalities of the characters are engraved in marble by this point.These scenes mark the final transition of a movie that was already verging on stagebound into more or less just another play on celluloid. That isn't necessarily a bad thing but it does little to revive the movie's already fainting comedic momentum. It attempts the usual farce doorslamming rushing toandfro characters affecting dramatic poses but it doesn't really work and that devilish grin of Montgomery's seems long long in the past. He becomes a cipher for the last part of the movie Raymond's character was a cipher to begin with and that leaves only Lombard whose character was hemmed into a cage of shrewishness by the script or the director from the very beginning. The ending therefore is arbitrary and unsatisfying and worst of all not the least bit funny. The movie turns too late to pratfall comedy and the image of Lombard tangled in skis simply doesn't work. She's been far too efficient and capable until now to be believable as the hapless helpless lovelorn buffoon.Nevertheless the movie was well worth watching. I'll never forget those gleaming eyes and that almost forwardleaning stride of Montgomery as if he just couldn't wait to barrel into the next scene. One is almost tempted to forgive him his chumminess with the House UnAmerican Activities Committee.Almost.".

The source print looks to be in immaculate condition but the image is a bit soft suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video. The framing is far too tight so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the movie is cropped. I gather from other IMDb reviews that there is a much better version available.Mr and Mrs Smith is just a footnote to Hitchcock's career.In his lengthy interviews with Francois Truffaut in the Sixties Hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to Carole Lombard and that he didn't understand the characters so just photographed Norman Krasna's screenplay.In truth there is not much more that needs to be said.It is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as It Happened One Night His Girl Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of pretexts and spends most of the picture being 'adorably' unreasonable.Robert Montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband but it is hard not to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the movie the audience is saying dump the silly cow she's not worth it.Gene Raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged. He is supposed to be a courtly 'old family' Southerner although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene which he otherwise plays very well. He is an honourable generous teetotal gentleman so of course he is bullied and patronised by Robert Montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes  although he is not as badly treated as the similar Ralph Bellamy character in His Girl Friday.This movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation but hadn't actually seen one. For example a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of ongoing comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap. Here all the comedy elements are just strung out like beads on a necklace. This is screwball comedy by the numbers.It is the same with the direction. Typically these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end. Hitchcock doesn't get this. His direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly overwritten but undernourished and slightly too long. He was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it. They do OK.Hitchcock had a good sense of humour which he frequently used in his thrillers but he had no feel for comedy as a genre. His later Trouble with Harry was also a misfire for similar reasons to this movie but at least he was involved in that picture. Here he is just going through the motions.All the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad. It just feels a bit derivative overfamiliar overlong and ultimately rather flat.Mr and Mrs Smith is one for Carole Lombard fans and Hitchcock completists only.".

	schema:reviewBody "A married couple Montgomery  Lombard suddenly find out they're not legally married and thanks to hubby's reckless remark the wife decides not to make it legal. Now hubby has to work at winning her back despite his best friend and her new independence. Fairly amusing comedy. For me the storyline was a little too talky especially several later extended scenes that appear to grant actor Raymond's character more screen time. What's needed I think is more spark the kind provided by Jack Carson's steam room Lothario or the lively nightclub scene that's a real hoot. Otherwise Lombard shows her comedic skills in a rather difficult role while Montgomery mugs it up in unMontgomery fashion. However pity poor Gene Raymond who's stuck with a boring role that appears out of sync for a comedy with the exception of his one welldone drunk scene. Overall this sophisticated farce is a little too smooth and polished to really impress. And despite scripter Krasna's many crafty innuendos likely overwritten as well. Nonetheless many amusing moments do remain. It's just not frontrank or what we might expect from an alltime great like Hitchcock. Rather Hitch excelled at amusing moments but as this effort shows comedy as a format was not his worldclass strength.".

	schema:headline " Weirdly Sadistic";
	schema:reviewBody "The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombard's character is as another user put it unnecessarily cruel. Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith who believes she is married to David Smith played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling Robert Montgomery. The movie has some funny moments especially when Montgomery's character goes to great lengths to try to get his wife back. Understandably she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal but she only finds out three years into it.Lombard's character seems quite cold to her husband's sincere attempts to woo her back. While not being highly adept in that effort Montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving and yet Lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice. There are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie and it is hard to see any sort of comedy even dark comedy in that aspect. To some extent the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone with Lombard's character getting a kick out of her husband's feeble efforts. While one might consider this another 'Battle of the Sexes' type of movie the reality is that it is a highly lopsided battle if that Montgomery's character while certainly flawed is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinistmisogynist an excellent example of that is Michael Douglas in 'War of the Roses'. In fact the character is largely effeminate as revealed by not only the sharp dress of Montgomery which probably owes largely to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself but also to his discomfort in attemptingbut failing to play the role of a womanizing bachelor. His only major flaw is his vanity but that fault does not balance out with his partner's excessive cruelty. And there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love. This is what makes it so cruel and sad. Montgomery's character simply looks weak. In reality no wife would want a man so weak unless she wears the pants in the marriage. But then again a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on. Hence the whole theme seems weird. This movie is neither a champion of feminism Lombard's character does show some signs of the sort of independentoriented woman of the 60s but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s nor an evensided battle of the sexes as Montgomery's character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause.This movie is on the surface a slapstick but beneath that veneer it is really much darker with sadistic undertones. All of which makes its resolution appear well odd. Maybe that oddity was the whole point?. In any case slapstick this movie is not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sandwiched between two more typical Hitchcock directorial offerings Foreign Correspondent and Suspicion 1941's Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a screwball comedy based upon an unlikely premise and teased to the limits of credulity and beyond. So far beyond that the screwball formula fails and the film falls flat. Though it is tempting to hypothesize that romantic comedies were so far out of Hitchcock's wheelhouse that his direction failed the blame should be given to the screenplay.It is said that Hitchcock strayed so far afield because he wanted to work with Carole Lombard Ann Smith. And that he directed the film as written because he recognized his limitations in the genre. He certainly had a dark and mischievous sense of humor and the story could have used more of his sensibilities. One has to wonder if wartime concerns for his homeland left him distracted or somewhat alienated from comedy.The film starts with the happy title couple enjoying one of their tiffs with playful give and take and humorous teasing. David Smith Robert Montgomery is later notified that their marriage is not technically legal. Viewing it as comical he plans to inform his wife later but she learns of the technicality first. Initially she downplays the news but her humor quickly turns to suspicion and then anger. And this is where the film turns from comedy to comedy failure. From that moment on her actions are that of a woman bent on revenge with no intentions of continuing her marriage. Within twentyfour hours she goes out with another man and makes no attempts to reconcile.This is not to say that there are no humorous elements in the remainder of the film. It's just that are undercut by the film's prevailing dark tone.The film is firmly rooted in the mores of its time which is something of an annoyance for modern viewers. Concern over What will the neighbors say? is a common theme in many films but here it feels inflated to an unnecessary level especially since there is no reason to believe any neighbor would ever be aware of the glitch.This could have been a marvelous film considering the talents of Lombard and Montgomery. One can imagine an alternative script that would have been lighter in tone with both character's actions escalating to limits of silliness. Then Lombard's fire would have been channeled into a comedic battle of wits and wills. And Montgomery would have been less a victim and more a combatant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a good comedy about a couple who learn that they haven't been legally married the past three years as they thought they were. The unmarriage is based on an absurd notion but it sets the stage for what follows. And what follows is a comedy of errors and airs in which the groom pursues his bride all over again while she plays hard to get.Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard are the leads as David and Ann Smith. She reverts to her maiden name Ann Krausheimer when they split up. This isn't one of Carole Lombard's funnier roles but Montgomery is funny as he jumps through hoops to try to win his wife back. His law firm partner Jeff Custer also wants to woo Ann. Gene Raymond plays his part superbly as a real male wallflower. He's straight faced overly considerate and straightforward about a relationship with the onetime wife of his best friend and partner. It makes it that much funnier  and frustrating for David.Some of the funniest scenes are with Jeff's parents. Lucille Watson plays Mrs. Custer Jeff's mother. She was one of the consummate Hollywood supporting cast who played superbly the role of a shocked mother or motherinlaw or snobbish Puritanical society dame. Philip Merivale is equally aghast as Jeff's father Ashley Custer. An uproarious scene occurs when Jeff introduces them to Ann. Just as they think she is a sweet young thing David enters the office and talks about their coffee together over the morning breakfast table the past three years. The crunch comes when he asks about his laundry and says he doesn't have any more clean shorts. A type of this scene replays toward the end of the film  with hilarious portrayals of the dumbfounded and astonished Custers.It's a good thing that David and Jeff owned their own law firm. No one else would have been able to take so much time away from work as David did to pursue Ann. Some reviewers are surprised that this film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hitch was well established as a versatile director before he came to the U.S. just before the start of World War II. He became known for his mastery at mystery films. But he had done a number of comedies romances and dramas before and even did one successful musical drama.This film came out at the end of January 1941. A year later Carole Lombard would be dead. She was killed in a plane crash in Nevada while returning home to California from a war bond drive. She was only 34 years old but she is remembered today from some of the wonderful films she was in especially her comedy roles. She was in 80 films in a 16year career.On the other hand Robert Montgomery isn't as well known today. He played a variety of roles in more than 60 films but ended his silver screen career at age 46 in 1950. He spent the rest of his career in television. His last acting was in 195051 in his longrunning TV series Robert Montgomery Presents. After that he continued to produce that show until 1957 and did some more TV production until 1960. He continued to work in the theater in the 1950s and won the 1955 Tony Award as best director for The Desperate Hours. In 1968 Montgomery wrote a book entitled An Open Letter from a Television Viewer in which he lambasted the TV industry for its programming of violence.A favorite scene of mine in Mr. and Mrs. Smith has Jeff and Ann riding in a sleigh to the cottages they have booked at Lake Placid in the Adirondacks. Ann says I love the smell of snow. Jeff says No one can smell snow. And Ann responds I can. Jeff looks around as though he's sniffing then looks down at the horses pulling the sleigh and says That isn't snow.".

Montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like Groucho a study in smugitude.The only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's law partner Jeff Custer who makes a play for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond underplays his many reaction shots and even a drunk scene all to good effect.SPOILERSo decent a guy is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting David after she goads him into a confrontation calling Custer a lump of jelly.

	schema:headline " If you had to do it all over again";
	schema:reviewBody "This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the screwball pictures of the 1930s.Hitchcock's formal method on the other hand had by now settled into something consistent so much so that he was unable or at least unwilling to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca it was actually great to see Hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text forced to turn his technique to heavy Gothic drama but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words Hitchcock was no Ernst Lubitsch.First let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock films were wild passionate and slightly dangerous  the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have? situation and he was great at depicting that. This is something that makes a much earlier film Rich and Strange one of the few Hitchcock nonthrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light tender touch is required and Hitch doesn't have it.Secondly take the comedy. Of course Hitchcock films could be funny  The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example  but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. The master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones. He cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller  snappy opposing angles of people talking inserted closeups of hands and feet pointofview shots  but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags. For example the business with Carole Lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of closeups but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point and have no comedic impact. Occasionally Hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy  for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far between.Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength lay and he is boring here. This was of course exactly where Queen of Screwball Carole Lombard's strength lay and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera fails to perk things up at all. Of course neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place even if the basic story is a fairly good premise.The only fullon comedy Hitchcock made after this was the Trouble with Harry and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness. However it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour when the basic framework was suspense  as it is in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot  that Hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.".

Occasionally Hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy  for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far between.Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength lay and he is boring here. This was of course exactly where Queen of Screwball Carole Lombard's strength lay and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera fails to perk things up at all. Of course neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place even if the basic story is a fairly good premise.The only fullon comedy Hitchcock made after this was the Trouble with Harry and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness. However it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour when the basic framework was suspense  as it is in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot  that Hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.";

'The Terminal' is a charming adaptation of a true story about a foreign civilian stuck in an American airport terminal lounge after his country faces war. The thing that makes this film worth watching are the excellent performances from the amiable cast and the sympathetic direction from Spielberg. After watching some of the behind the scenes as well I was amazed at how the crew had built a fullsize replica airport in a hangar in LA complete with working escalators the attention to detail is astounding and this makes the film that much more worth sitting through.

Instead of reaching for new heights of filmmaking like including the latest in special effects or new original ways of storytelling and editing Spielberg goes back to a simpler form. That in itself is surprisingly refreshing. Filmmakers try so hard to be inventive and change the typical form of the classics that when someone finally does go back to that Capra or Wilder fashion it ends up seeming original. That's what The Terminal goes for. A movie about characters not plot. About emotion not CGI. It's a true heartfelt piece of work. It's funny it's cute and it always keeps you interested.Tom Hanks leads an exceptional cast as Viktor Navorski a man stranded in JFK airport not welcome in the U.S. and having no country to come home to. Throughout the experience he makes friends a love interest and a rival. He changes all of their lives of course. That's to be expected from a movie like this. Tom Hanks is totally believable accent and all. It's a performance well worthy of an Oscar nod.I loved The Terminal for many reasons but one big reason is it's simplicity. And more importantly because it is good at being simple. It doesn't contribute anything new to movies it doesn't try to. It is what it is. A great feelgood film. Something that is getting rarer and rarer these days. Sometimes you'll want to see a gritty wrenching melodrama but other times you'll want to see The Terminal.My rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen some really good movies in 2004 but so far this maybe the best. The Terminal is an incredible fairy tale of a movieit's quietly captivating rich in interesting colorful characters and superbly acted and directed.Tom Hanks as Victor Navorsky is quite simply entrancing to watch. He is an amazing character actor and in The Terminal he again creates a character who is instantly embraceable. You care about Victor and want things to turn out OK for him as much as his friends in the Terminal do.This is a movie that actually got some bad reviews and I'm baffled by why. Although I usually can see flaws in even the movies I think are 8's and 9's there isn't much to be critical of here. Some people have said it's to feel good. That it's lacking in reality. I don't necessarily see those as negatives there are many good movies that are feel good or unrealistic just as there are some bad ones. The Terminal has a lot that's likable about it. Firstly there's Hanks himself and I will admit if any other actor had played Victor it might not be the movie it is Hanks is simply amazing you forget who he is within the first five minutes. I won't mention everyone by name but the rich array of supporting actorsactresses were all good as well. It is an unusual movie that really isn't either a straight comedy OR a straight dramait perhaps falls through the cracks of genres but I'd call this mostly a heartwarming and completely absorbing character study of one man's attempt to make a life for himself in an airport terminal. It's a very different type of moviefor all the strategically placed product adds there's something quietly uncommercial about Terminal and watching it is an interesting experience. The movie is about 2 hours and you get a lot in those two hours. For me what was striking was how genuinely interesting this movie turned out to be. I'm one who finds airport terminals fascinating anywayall the hundreds of and thousands of people rushing about to hop on a plane and start some new adventure....but to actually live in a terminalan interesting and rather strange conceptHanks acting here is quiet and understated and at a level surpassing merely talented. He manages to make nibbling a cracker fascinating. I would give this a 10 of 10 and know there are many who may think it's not for them but I found this movie to be a beautiful fairytale of a picture and hope at least Hanks gets an Oscar nod. I also hope that skeptics give this movie a chanceas good a movie as any Hanks film I've ever seen. 10 of 10.".

While all this goes on Hanks falls in love with 30something flight attendant Catherine ZetaJones perfectly illuminating and beautiful as usual. ZetaJones is sad and disillusioned with men Michael Nouri of Flashdance in particular and past relationships that have failed for one reason or another. Director Steven Spielberg has never really been known for romantic pictures Always in 1989 is an exception but he proves that he can definitely handle a production like this. The cast is excellent with Hanks making all those around him better. This story was cowritten by Andrew Niccol even though he strangely did not pen the final script an underrated screenwriter who struck gold in 1998 with The Truman Show. Many of the good things from that script are also presented here in diverse and creative ways. By the way the art directionset decoration is amazing as everything within the titled location was built from scratch in a studio. Spielberg was not allowed to film any airports due to obvious security reasons. From top to bottom The Terminal flies high. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

I thought the second half of the film suffered a little from becoming a bit over emotional the love story seemed out of sorts and the way the entire airport staff seemed to know every thing about everyone else was a bit far fetched I worked in an airport for many years and knew virtually noone from outside the people I worked with on a daily basis but maybe that's just me!

	schema:headline " A happy movie lots of fun...";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Terminal' is the latest HanksSpielberg collaboration and though it's not quite as good as 'Catch Me if You Can' or 'Saving Private Ryan' it still makes for a fun watch. The plot as everyone already knows is about Krakozhian sp? immigrant Victor Narvorski Tom Hanks whose home country  the fictional land of Krakozhia think Russia or Czechoslovakia  is torn apart in war while he is in a plane headed for New York. When he lands JFK airport head Frank Dixon Stanley Tucci tells him that since he literally doesn't have a country he must stay in the airport terminal until all the hoopla settles. Dixon thinks that Narvorski will ignore him escape into New York and 'become someone else's problem'. What Dixon doesn't know is that Victor is an honest man and he will obey the rules and stay in the terminal until he's allowed to leave.The character of Victor Narvorski is one of those classic movie characters who has no conceivable flaw other than a minimal understanding of the world around him  and an accent and dose everything he can to help everyone else. Similar characters that spring to mind are Peter Sellers' Chauncey Gardner from the 1979 satire 'Being There' and John Goodman's Charlie Meadows from the Coen movie 'Barton Fink'. All of these characters are dimwitted but great people who put their own lives on hold to help their friends.Some of these friends include Airport worker Enrique Cruz Diego Luna who Victor helps get hitched with a beautiful security guard Zo Saldana and Amelia Warren Catherine ZetaJones a nice flighty flight attendant who Narvorski inspires to get out of a troubled relationship with a married man.The Hanks and ZetaJones characters strike up a little romance but luckily its not too overblown it's more of a subplot than anything.It takes sometime but soon Narvorski is accepted into a small group of Airport workers including Cruz kindly Joe Mulroy Chi McBride and janitor Gupta Raja Kumar Pallana who at first thinks that Narvorski is a federal agent out to get him. These characters are all well written and even better acted but I thought they could've been awarded with a little more screen time. After all the three are very good actors. But I guess Luna is still riding off the success of 'Y U Mama Tambien' and McBride despite the fact that he's been working for many years is still trying to find a big role that's right for him which I doubt he'll get from 'I Robot'.It's Pallana who has the biggest role here and man does he deserve it. Very old and very foreign he was brought to surprising cult fame when Wes Anderson gave him the role of 'Pagoda' in the 2001 hit 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. Who doesn't remember the short quiet hilarious butler of the Tenenbaum family? His role in this is a great followup he is funny and surprisingly touching and dramatic in a very tense scene near the end that I wont spoil. In any other movie the role of the Indian janitor would be an easy target but this character isn't funny because he's Indian but instead funny because he's clever a little cynical and wily. He stole every scene he's in from under Tom Hanks or ZetaJones or whoever. This is a long shot but I think the man deserves an Oscar nomination.The acting in this movie is the greatest factor  well that and the huge Terminal set built only for the movie. Some critics are complaining about an underwritten and underused Catherine ZetaJones. Whatever. I call her undernecessary Note not UNnecessary UNDERnecessary. I'm glad that her lessthaninteresting character wasn't overused I'm glad the movie wasn't turned into a straightout romance.The films deepest and most interesting character is Tucci's Dixon. On the surface he looks like your usual villain but that's only to simpleton viewers who don't make any attempt to understand their movie characters. Dixon is not a villain. As it's established in the beginning Dixon has been working the same job at the airport for seventeen years and wants desperately to climb up the latter. Because of this he makes sure that he follows every single rule he's the epitome of every bythebook bureaucrat that we all love to hate. His motto is that in his work there're three important things 'The person the document and the story'. In the best scene of the movie Dixon refuses a Russian man to bring medicine to his dying father in Canada because he doesn't have the right form. This scene represents everything about the character of Dixon.I was also interested in the relationship between Dixon and Narvorski. Dixon is at first refusing Narvorski because it's the rules but as the film goes on and Dixon is further perplexed by Narvorski it stops being about rules and starts being about hatred and jealousy for Narvorski's joyful existence. He refuses to let Narvorski go to New York when he should be allowed to. In the film's most fulfilling scene Narvorski escapes and Dixon decides to give up chasing him and you can see in his eyes that he's realized how ridiculous and stubborn he's been acting. This is Tucci's best performance. An Oscar for him I say!It is flawed of course in a few things. Narvorski's character is never developed he stays the same person throughout the entire film but that's fine because Hanks keeps your interest and is at his most lovable. Also the ending stretched on just a little bitif I had my way it would've ended with Dixon happily watching Narvorski escape in his cab the rest could've just as easily been implied. I think the ending is a very important part of any film and this one was  in a way  ruined.But no movie is perfect and I have no problem accepting this as a lighthearted picture with a few interesting characters. Have fun. 7.510.".

Navorski was kind gentle and wise as acting as their Cyrano. He neither fell in love with nor did he take advantage of her.The Terminal is a romance in the tradition of say Picnic. As a teenage I watched with envy as William Holden easily courted a beautiful vulnerable younger Kim Novac. What did it matter that he was old enough to be her father? The girls in movie houses still drooled over him and wished they were her. So with this. Most male reviewers take exception to Zeta Jones in The Terminal. Much more sophisticated these days. Pity. She was actually quite good. She was like the little Mermaid much of what she conveyed could not be done with her voice. The same thing with the Zeta Jones character everything she said had to be done with her eyes and tears. She knows Navorski's value. She knows his character and how good he is. She wants him and is certain he wants and deserves her but she knows that sooner or later she will betray him and that would devastate him. She knows herself so well that she feels unworthy of him. She cannot betray such a good and honorable man. What then does that make her? Is she any less honorable and worthy? Should she be any less desirable for the boys than William Holden for the girls? This film is not Schindler's List. But it's not Beach Blanket Bingo either. It is a wonderful character study well worth seeing.".

The Terminal is a lightweight movie. It doesn't get into any deep discussion on the human condition but it still manages to show how love can break the barriers of language and regionalism to bond people so strongly. The cast is great and all of them have delivered commendable performances. The writing offers enough laughter and some touching moments. One negative aspect of the film is the littering of product advertisements in nearly every scene. To sum up Spielberg his actors and writers have woven the movie into a crowdpleasing and entertaining film about humanity and heart that creates sympathy for all its characters through its entire flow and leaves the viewer unreasonably happy at the end.

Yet in the hands of Steven Spielberg he makes it great and contains that artistic appeal. Based on the true story of Viktor Navorski Hanksin his impressive role as an illegal alien who gets stuck in an airport in New York and can't risk to step a foot out in N.Y without being arrested. While there he befriends a flight attendant Amelie Warren the beautiful ZetaJones who he happens to have his eye on. Spielberg makes even the worst sounding movie one of the best of the year.

Instead make the main character a simpleminded pseudoRussian put it in New York NEW YORK!! America!! and instead of a story about a refugee make it a story about collecting an autograph from a jazz musician.The whole thing is frivolous and clichd. Tom Hanks' accent is straight out of a bad sitcom from the 80's. So is the ooh ahh I love America land of freedom so much better than Russia shtick. Old tired rubbish... not to mention the 'romance' between the border official and cargo man. It's called stalking! This movie is just a dumb fairy tale. Probably the best audience are people who've never heard of Merhan Karimi Nasseri and just want some junk food for the mind. This is it.In the DVD extras I was hoping perhaps to see some reference to Mr. Nasseri.... but there isn't a single one. The authors didn't even acknowledge the inspiration. All they did was narcissistically discuss themselves. Boring boring. They built a whole terminal from scratch for this movie? What a waste.".

Such a waste of talent and money.Spielberg obviously believes that his audience has a mental age of 10 and an exceptionally low IQ as that is probably the only target group that would enjoy this very silly and soppy romantic drama. Shame on you Steven Spielberg for offering adult cinemagoers this sugary pap!Hanks' performance is no worse and no better than his recent stint in The Ladykillers i.e. mildly amusing in a cartoonish sort of way. If I were Russian I would be seriously insulted by the borderingon racist portrayal. Miraculously Hank's character moved from speaking almost no English to being extremely fluent within a very short period and gaining a posse of bumbling friends within the airport. The genre should have been listed as fantasy rather than romantic drama. And as for the comedy aspect  I seem to have totally missed it unless it's deemed funny to laugh at foreigners in a difficult predicament.With some character development and a decent script this could have been an interesting film however it's two leads were sadly wasted in this saccharine turkey.".

	schema:reviewBody "What was the reason for Spielberg to make this film? Was it to showcase how well he works with Tom Hanks? Or was it because he wanted to force audiences into a theater or Video Store to pay to watch him sell out and build a very forced film? I would have to go with a combination of the two.Now I will say that Spielberg's eye is one of the best in the industry. He continually raises the bar for each film that he makes see Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan but for some odd reason with The Terminal it feels like he didn't even have a bar he was trying to reach. The forced feeling of everything that happens around Tom Hanks from the unlit flame of Catherine ZetaJones to a fallible inflight wedding to even the corny climax when a character decides to play chicken with the plane it doesn't seem to work. Even Hanks' accent is poor. It felt as if I was watching Spielberg's table scraps from other films fall down on the floor and get gobbled up by the projector. This film just didn't work. There was not one scene in this film that I can say I enjoyed. Let me explain.Hanks was Hanks. What more can we expect from him. I do not believe he did anything above and beyond his normal call of duty in this film. I never felt like I saw Viktor in Hanks. All I could see was Hanks with a terrible accent. Whether learned or created the words that came out of Hanks' mouth seemed like rubbish. It felt more like audiencecute instead of a definite control of the words. Perhaps it was just me but it felt as if Hanks learned English exceptionally fast. Strange but this was a huge plothole that Spielberg left wide open for us to fall into. Outside of Hanks being Hanks there was ZetaJones who chose to go with the 'bimbo' slant with her character. She seemed ditzy dull and completely unfocused in this film. Her chemistry with Tom Hanks seemed completely plastic and created. There was nothing between them that said to me that they were a match made in heaven. While others will argue that Spielberg had them in the film to show two sides of living in an airport the literal and the figurative I thought that it was a cheap shot to guide in female viewers. What a better way to do so than with a forced romance. It makes me laugh just typing about it. Second was Tucci even a villain? Along the same lines as my ZetaJones comment there was not enough character or structure for me to even believe Tucci as a bad airport director. One moment he is asking Viktor for help and another time is yelling at him. These two characters had about as much consistency as oatmeal. Oddly this was the general feeling of this film.Outside of the characters the major flaw in this film is the story. By the second hour of the film we have lost all hope in our characters and fearless director that we don't care what happens to anyone. Viktor's dramatic conclusion is overshadowed by the two hours of garbage that had been slowly piling up. I couldn't get excited or care what was going to happen next in this film and that is a sign that something is doomed. I continued to get a sense of claustrophobia wondering if Spielberg would finally take Hanks out of the airport and build upon something new and fresh. Alas that never happened. Instead we are forced to repeat the same steps over and over again in a way that almost makes you nauseated. Did Spielberg have a goal or vision with this film or was it just made up along the way? Also was his editor on vacation? I realize that his epics are normally long but this one just seemed to drag beyond belief. I needed something actually anything to keep my attention in this film and yet nothing arrived. It felt like opening that Christmas present that you think is what you really want but instead it is just socks. Boy don't you feel let down?Overall I was highly disappointed with this film. When I see a Spielberg film I expect to be blown away by sharp images infallible characters and a compassionate story. He has built so much notoriety on his name and style of film alone that there is a certain expectation when going to see one of his films. I do not feel it is bad to request these three elements in his pictures. Sadly in The Terminal I saw nothing of the sort. It was as if Spielberg was attempting to just create a big clich instead of a film. It was as if he was doing the complete opposite from what he normally does. In this film he had shoddy images underdeveloped and lost characters and a repetitive repulsive story. I do not recommend this film for anyone that is a fan of Spielberg's work. It will only bring a tear to your eye.Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I've never much liked Steven Spielberg's films  Jaws  being the sole exception I've never confused my dislike with his ability to please a crowd.  The man is undoubtedly a showman . . . I suppose my quarrel is with what he shows us.  Even while despising his sentimentality I've always grudgingly admired his sheer filmmaking competence.  In other words I would never give his movies a 110 rating.Until now until  The Terminal.  This is without equivocation the worst film of his career.  It has absolutely nothing to recommend it.  They should pay US to see it really.  First of all the movie has to set some kind of record for relentless productplacement.  You thought Hanks shilling for FedEx and Wilson Sporting Goods was tacky in  Castaway?  Wait till you see him scarf down his seventh Burger King greaseball sandwich in  The Terminal.  Wait till you watch him wander aimlessly over and over past Sbarro Starbucks Hugo Boss Outlets . . . but this is a hint to stop because I don't want to be the pot calling the kettle black.  Basically Spielberg  the Gang at Dreamworks came up with the most brilliant synergy  concept yet  base the story on some nut who was stranded in Charles de Gaulle Intl. Airport in France make up a bunch of  dramatic funny  stuff about this character and bingo!  you got over 2 hours of CONTINUOUS ADVERTISING.  One retail outlet after another panning slowly on the big screen.  Hanks can't escape the Terminal and neither can the targeted audience!  It sometimes helps when viewing a film to know the reasons WHY a film gets made  please remember that DreamWorks is having a bit of financial trouble lately.  Not a LOT but some.  The TV shows never materialized the musicunit was sold off to some other conglomerate and worst of all their movies have been stinking up the boxoffice for the past couple of years.  In fact their last major  hit  if we must call it that  was  Gladiator.Hence The Terminal  gets dumped on an unsuspecting public.  Make no mistake kids  Spielberg did this hackjob with the hopes of covering his own studio's backside.  It is no coincidence that the only element in the film which looks as if any effort was applied is the set of the airport terminal itself.  Indeed it's an astounding set the best of its kind ever built and deserves an Oscar . . . but remember the set's main function  to hawk Starbucks and the like.  And since this is the movie's main function with the  entertainment  part hopefully taking care of itself under the auspices of popular showmen like Spielberg and Hanks it should really come as no surpise that the airportset is awesome.  There's money to be made and burgers to be sold.As for the other aspects of the movie  you know the stuff we usually talk about like the direction photography acting story and so on  only the most pedestrian efforts are exerted from the principals  Spielberg Hanks ZetaJones.  In the direction category you would never guess that Spielberg was behind the wheel.  The story has terrible pace the camerawork is nondescript  except when panning slowly across yet another advertiser's logo and the script is devoid of the  magical moments  the director has occasionally pulled off in his other films.  In the acting category Stanley Tucci tries his damnedest to give an honest performance as the head of security at the terminal but the script betrays him by making his character for no clear reason more villainous as the movie wears on. Tucci's hung out to dry mouthing dialogue.  As for Hanks and ZetaJones watching them here only made me consider how much I enjoyed them in separate films by the Coen Brothers  Intolerable Cruelty  for ZJ The Ladykillers  for Hanks.  I ended up wishing that I was watching either one of those films again which not surprisingly were directed by artists instead of a huckster.".

This marks the third collaboration between director and star after previously helming Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can. Tom Hanks is superb as someone out of his element yet adapts when all else fails. Catherine ZetaJones plays a stewardess down in relationships yet she finds friendship and freedom with this peculiar foreign fellow. Stanley Tucci plays an airport commissioner who tries to maintain order yet ultimately must face the fact that his terminal sleepover guest is not quite the hindrance he at first thought. Chi McBride plays a security guard who sympathizes with Hanks. He shifts through disjointed moments yet performs with appeal. Zoe Saldana plays an immigration officer and like McBride the role is standard fair and barely elevates above plot conventions. This is a rewarding film about conquering life's hardships.

The developing relationship between Navorsk and U.S. airline flight attendant Amelia Warren Catherine ZetaJones provides a good subplot adding intrigue and drama to the movie.Steven Spielberg provided solid direction to the cast whose acting I thought was pretty spoton including Tom Hanks' European accent. John Williams provided another great music score for the movie.Overall it's a steadypaced movie but also a feelgood film that doesn't rely on action and gritty melodrama to make it entertaining.Grade B".

The book is a difficult readfull of legal terminology and political machinations but in shortthe story of a Jewish judge sent to Berlin notsomany years after WWII to try East Germans for hijacking an aircraft to freedom in the West. The movie misses a lot of the subtleties but is detailed enough to give a good picture of the political climate at the time. A federal prosecutor Judge Stern was selected to head this trial after many other judges resisted taking on this political hot potato. The theory is that a Jewish judge in postwar Germany would go along with what was originally envisioned as a sort of sham trial intended to lead directly to convictions. Stern insisted that the defendants receive according to the American Constitution a trial by a jury of their peers fellow Germans. An interesting concept for our country which offically occupied West Berlin until the 1990s. Could conquerors try the conquered in occupied territory with a jury of their conquered peers? For anyone who is cynical of our position in the world arena as the unofficial watchdog of freedoms this is a wonderful drama showing that justice will if given the chance win out. Highly recommended for anyone interested in our legal system or our nation's postWWII history.".

I HAVE PUT THREE ASTERISKS BEFORE AND AFTER THAT PART OF THE REVIEW.I just found a copy of Judgment in Berlin 1988 which stars Martin Sheen Sean Penn and Carl Lumbly Syney Bristow's partner in the TVseries Alias among others. It's an excellent story cowritten and directed by Leo Penn Sean's father.Synopsis Before the fall of the Berlin Wall an East German man hijacks a plane bound for East Berlin and diverts it to West Berlin. Because he did not merely escape but committed hijacking which the US government claims is terrorism he must stand trial in West Berlin in a speciallyconstituted American court. Sheen plays the judge. Penn plays a young German who testifies for the defense Lumbly a prosecutor. The government argues among other things that constitutional rights do not apply since the court is an occupation court which is a tool of the Department of State in its exercise of foreign policy not an independent Article 2 federal court. DON'T READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE END! The judge disagrees and in the end refuses to allow the defendant to be put into the hands of the government at all since he says he believes them when they say they won't respect his rights.Many of the legal arguments and aspects in the film mirror those being used today in US detentions and prosecutions both in the US and overseas. For example unlawful enemy combatants held in the US in military brigs Guantanamo detainees and several cases being prosecuted in Iraq. In other words the film is accurate in its legal and political framework. The film moreover raises the same moral questions often NOT being raised or considered now in cases analogous to the one in the movie. The film is an excellent teaching tool about these issues.Jennifer Van Bergen J.D.

However what makes INDPI so refreshing and different from other films in the genre is that it also shows us that the uh proletariat can be just as bad especially when pushed by the bigotry of a rigid ideology. I totally agree with Risi's comment that if forced to choose he'd rather be the openly corrupt guy than the hypocritically ambiguous one.Gassman and Tognazzi are brilliant as usual.

Ingmar Bergman's 'Sawdust and Tinsel' is one of those films. I'm not exactly sure why the film was regarded so lowly but thankfully it is now recognised for what it is.The film isn't quite Bergman's best but it is certainly close. 'Sawdust and Tinsel' is a pessimistic yet truthful study of human nature in relationships. The film's central character Albert is a ringmaster of a travelling circus and is passing through the town where his wife and children are living. The pair have been separated for some time and are clearly dealing with the situation in different ways. His wife Agda has moved on. Albert is still affected and has been unfaithful to his wife as he is travelling along with his mistress. What unfolds is an interesting character study that looks at human insecurity disloyalty selfishness unhappiness and emotional strain.It's no wonder that Ingmar Bergman is titled 'The Swedish Master'. 'Sawdust and Tinsel' is full of insight and certainly shows Bergman's talent. He does some excellent things with mirrors in certain shots and creates a lot of mood throughout the film. The highlight is without question one of the first scenes in which Frost the circus clown comes to collect his wife Alma from the ocean where she is swimming with an army regiment. Every element works and Alma's selfishness and Frost's pain are clear in the scene adding to the effect. Practically everything that Bergman has done in this film is excellent. The only point of criticism though is that the cinematography is a bit hit and miss as some scenes are too bright giving them an overexposed look. Then again it could be that the film has just deteriorated with age.This is an underappreciated film that is certainly worth viewing. It is quite hard to come by but maybe one day someone will do a proper release on DVD.".

It has not been easy to catch again and then I think that when the time since you have last seen a favourite gets too long you begin to have concerns as to whether it will live up to your memory of it. There was particular concern here because although in the 60s and 70s I would bore people by going on about this film whenever talk of Bergman's more well thought of films came up this was never considered to be one of his best. Having just watched it again I am blown away all over again. I cannot believe how much of the fantastic visuals I remembered and the extent to which the power of the film is still so affecting. There is not a wasted frame this is pure cinema throughout. The acting is stupendous the cinematography outstanding and the bitter sweet tale so seemingly simple yet so devastatingly all consuming. I know Bergman has made more poetic films and more profound ones but I still think this one is hard to beat for so eloquently presenting those basic issues that matter to everyone.".

But he also has a love whom he has his problems with and her with him as well leading to an infidelity drama that plays out harshly. Ingmar Bergman said this was a personal film for him in a big sense because of the connection to the excitement of the profession being played out against personal turmoil and trouble in professional terms Bergman even said it was easier for a scrawny director to have a fat actor play the part of Arthur. It was reviled by critics and a boxoffice flop one of the more expensive films relatively to others Bergman made up to that point.It's a film that seen years later now through the prism of Bergman as one of the world's true artists in the profession also is deceptively highbrow about the world of lowbrow where experimentation filters in early on and Bergman makes one of his more distinctive marks as a director moreso than a screenwriter usually however much Bergman is always an absorbing and challenging director of scenes writes like no other. The opening scenes with the story of the sadpathetic clown Frost could be a distraction if overdone but it's an interesting sidenot throughout the film as a reminder of true melancholy are shot like some crazy silent movie where all we hear are sounds of laughter and little sound effects brightly lit shot and composed like some manic tale of desperation and defeat and humiliation stylized so highly one might think a mad German too control of the reins and made it his own. It's not something all of Bergman's fans will like but it shows him even in 1953 trying new things letting himself be free with the material as he sees fit.Then after this we get into the typical Bergmania a sort of squareblock played out between Arthur who is meeting his exwife in the town he's at for the circus performance the actress playing his wife I forget her name is brilliant at displaying just enough pragmatism to show her as the most sane of anyone in the film and Arthur's current beau Anne is somewhat attracted to a sneaky actor named Frans who plays a wicked game of arm wrestling and leading to a somewhat Albert and Anne and how this casts a dark shadow on the rest of the proceedings including through the circus performance which becomes a daring act of do by Bergman where he makes things effective once squaring in on the 'duel' between Arthur and Frans. For those that love Bergman doing relationship drama this is solid if not exceptional stuff on display. And the ending truth be told might just be one of the most engrossing and completely bleak if you could imagine that Bergmanites that he ever made who doesn't cry with the scene with the bear? It might sound like Bergman has made a depressing little tome on circus life the sorrows of living with the filth and lice and reckless frivolity of life as vagabond entertainers. But it's also a lot of fun as the lowbrow material displays another side to Bergman which is something close to weird comic excess. Sometimes Bergman even mocks his own world a scene with Albert asking Gunnar Bjornstrand's theater director the latter always shown in lowangle a smart choice makes the theater come off satirically compared to Bergman's more serious treatments of the profession in his films. And seriously where else will we get a dwarf tossing in a work by this filmmaker? And meanwhile he also has a great turn from his wouldbe Emil Jannings in ke Grnberg who is big and overemotional and strungout on his excesses of anger and resentment mostly with himself watch for that gun! And Andersson of course is ravishing as she was if not erotically as such in Monika filmed the same year.Now finally available just a bit easier than previously thanks to Criterion Sawdust and Tinsel is a fine spectacle of a director branching out stylistically if not to the spectacular Felliniesque aspirations it might have as a pre La Strada or The Clowns while keeping his feet tethered to his personal cinema.

Profound darkness seems to me an integral part of Bergman's work at least the earlier films like this one.  If you're looking for action adventure or romance you're certainly barking up the wrong tree here and the idea of identifying with the characters in this film scares the hell out of me.  Maybe it's just not suited to some viewer's personalities.You're not likely to come across Sawdust and Tinsel' much these days unless it's at an arthouse museum or festival screening or on video. Here in the U.S. Public Television used to show Bergman films in the distant past.  That time is long gone but I can well remember seeing it on TV as a kid and its imagery lingered in my mind like a vivid nightmare. The black and white cinematography with wonderful use of darkness and silhouettes makes it a very beautifullooking film but it is unrelentingly dark and gloomy.Not for everybody but it is what it is and Bergman is Bergman.  Its dreamlike imagery and brutal primal view of human nature can leave a deep impression especially on impressionable viewers.  This is undoubtedly why having seen it when growing up I've never forgotten it.  Though it doesn't seem to be particularly wellregarded these days I regard it as great and powerful cinema in the BergmanNykvist tradition.  At the very least its cinematography should be wellappreciated by anyone who admires the look of films like The Virgin Spring  or The Silence.'".

The introduction sequence is a brilliant example of Bergman's work...we see a long shot of 5 horse carriages moving across the plains at dawn which dissolves into a reflection of a single horse  carriage in the water below a bridge which dissolves into a series of shots...windmills foggy paths the carriage driver and the finally a fade into the carriage where our protagonist Albert Johansson sleeps with his girlfriend Anna. Bergman is the king of the dissolve...a style he no doubt picked up from 1920's German expressionism. Bergman's mise en scene is a blend of sequences which depict a very dreamlike orientation of our immediate surrounding.The result We are passive observers watching the alltooreal reality of our modern world subside into something very mysterious and surreal. Bergman's style removes time from the equation of film. Time as we know it takes a backseat to objects people and places. Real life becomes more dreamlike than any dream and the darkest and most mysterious corner of the universe becomes the human mind.This is a fantastic movie.".

Sven Nykvist's cinematography is seen as excellent as ever especially those brooding cloudy skies. The story moves along nicely and Bergman's women are clearly their own people most of the time anyway. The tawdry lives of circus folk is a film clich but the characters do live and breathe in this movie rather more completely than we could have hoped. Special attention should be paid to the music of Swedish Modernist composer KarlBirger Blomdahl. Those punching dissonant chords at the beginning of the film are not unlike much of his music for the outerspace opera he wrote Aniara. There is a recording of that work but it's hard to come by. But you can try to find his Symphony No. 3 Facetter and you'll be delighted by how it grows on you. Nevertheless Bergman pretty much left Blomdahl behind in his subsequent work and you can see why Much of it doesn't really fit which is something you can say about a lot of famous composers who try their hand at film music.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sawdust and Tinsel 1953  12 out of 4A circus troupe arrives in a small town where the owner Ake Gronberg plans on visiting his family who he hasn't seen in three years. This sets his mistress Harriet Andersson into a jealous fit and she runs to a local theatre group where an actor offers her a priceless necklace in exchange for sex. This here is without question the best of the early Bergman films I've seen and I think it's the first to show the masterful director at full force. Like a lot of Bergman pictures this film really isn't about anything yet it's about everything to the people involved. The way Bergman could settle on small characters and shine a light on their personal issues has always been one of the director's strong points and he does the story justice here. The film is mainly about jealousy and what it can lead to and Bergman creates a very moody and at times depressing look at the subject. The film is very very dark and comes off like a bad dream that mixes fantasy with reality. Another strong point is an opening sequence where we hear the story of a clown who loses his mind when he catches his wife swimming naked with some soldiers. This sequence is filmed completely different than the rest of the film and the lightness of this segment really brings you into a different type of movie. The performances are all incredibly strong with Gronberg stealing the show as the circus owner who slowly loses his mind over a matter of hours. The actor goes through a breakdown towards the end of the film and this comes off very realistic and is at times painful to watch. Andersson is her typical brilliant self and really sells the loneliness and confession of her young character. The scene with her and the actor is charged with some dark sexuality which just shows what a master Bergman was. The cinematography Hilding Bladh and Sven Nykvist is remarkable as is the music score by KarlBirger Blomdahl.".

His cruel vision of human nature took the shape of this wonderful piece of art. But The Naked Night didn't make the critics happy and it was also a financial flop. The cruel truth didn't please the audience.It's a story about a touring circus group which all members are in different ways dependent on each other and in result of that prisoners of each other. They all want to leave the circus and start a better life. But the attempts to detach and break free lead only lead to bigger embarrassments. The world around the group keeps it apart because they keep attacking to it even more ruthless.This situation between the world and the circus can be seen as an allegory for our world this is where the social stand of the film stands. But it goes a lot deeper than that researching the soul of man and the truth of human nature. It's a survey of the cruelty of man but it's also a story about love and jealousy.The Naked Night is European modernism which started in the 1940's50's. The camerawork is the best example of this. It shows true humane emotions sweat and tears on face anger shame and love. The movement of the camera is also very unusual for other films of that time. Ingmar Bergman's story about the cruel truth of human nature is a true classic from the European modernistic era.".

Just as Summer with Monika Sawdust and Tinsel was released in 1953 and was the second Ingmar Bergman film Woody Allen was exposed to so I've taken the lead from him as far as beginning this project. I did not enjoy Sawdust and Tinsel nearly as much as Woody Allen did. This is going to be an entry in Ingmar Bergman's filmography that I appreciate rather than enjoy. On an overcast and grim morning the circus rolls into the town where the ringmaster's family lives. The ringmaster Albert Johansson ke Grnberg hasn't seen his wife or two sons in three years. Albert gives off the impression that he loves the nomadic life the circus offers whereas his wife who hated that life decided to stay behind and establish roots. Albert has since taken a mistress Anne Harriet Andersson who is desperately against the idea of Albert visiting his estranged wife and sons as she believes he will use the reunion as a way of getting out of the circus. Jealous hurt and looking for a way out Anne visits another traveling group in the same town and is seduced by an actor who promises her a rich life because he is in possession of an expensive necklace. While Albert visits his wife and learns he is not welcome to return to his family Anne finds out the necklace is worthless. Both are stuck in the same position as when the audience first meets them broken and dejected stuck with the circus and with each other.Several times in Sawdust and Tinsel Bergman uses silent film techniques which so alter the tone of the film I struggled to get back into the narrative each time we returned to the plot advancement. Typically I enjoy methods like this but they didn't work in Sawdust and Tinsel. The circus metaphorwhere the emotions and deepest feelings of human beings are revealed was striking. Bergman's camera got increasingly closer to each subject as more of their desires were exposed. The film is a tough watch full of humiliation and despair where we continue to see characters humiliated and broken in a worse manner than the previous character was humiliated and broken. The symbolism was nice and Bergman being the talented director he was layers the film in subtlety never losing faith in his audience.".

He's having an affair with the trick horseback rider Harriet Andersson but tensions arise when he plans to visit his wife and family. It's not a happy troupe in general  they're short of funds and costumes and in a very artistic flashback we see the clown Anders Ek humiliated by his wife the beartrainer as she frolics in the nude with a bunch of soldiers to a large regiment's delight. Anyway as they look to borrow costumes Andersson is hit on by an actor from a local theater Hasse Ekman and at first she has the upper hand and is cruel to him but later with the rift with Grnberg increasing she's duped into having sex with him. Meanwhile Grnberg's wife firmly declines his offer to come back saying she's not willing to sacrifice her peace of mind for anyone.Harriet Andersson is stunning in this film and turns in an excellent performance and Grnberg Ek and Ekman are all great as well. It doesn't feel like an overly heavy film but everyone does seem trapped in cages I suppose like the circus bear leading diminished sometimes violent lives and that seems to be one of the movie's messages. The circus ultimately keeps moving along despite all the mistakes they've made and Bergman seems to be relating it to the human condition one that's invariably tinged with cruelty and sadness.".

	schema:headline " This film should be categorized among Bergman's juvenalia but there are still some memorable aspects";
	schema:reviewBody "That life is a circus that one cannot escape from is the overriding theme of Ingmar Bergman's 1953 film GYCKLARNAS AFTON The Evening of the Clowns but released in the Englishspeaking world under the titles Sawdust and Tinsel and The Naked Night. As the film opens a circus is on its way to a provincial Swedish town in the early 20th century. In an introductory sequence a coachman tells a story of an embarrassing episode for one of the clowns and his wife which introduces the motif of humiliation that runs throughout the film. In the ensuing flashback scene the characters' mouths move but we cannot hear what they are saying a tribute to silentera director Sergei Eisenstein.Only then do we get to the main plot circus director Albert ke Grnberg will use the opportunity of revisiting this town to see his wife and children whom he abandoned three years before. His mistress Anne Harriet Andersson gets jealous and wants to leave the circus so she lets a local actor Hasse Ekman seduce her. The climax of the film comes with the circus performance where all the tensions boil over but not quite in the way I expected.This is not a mature Bergman film. Anyone expecting the great depths of his later efforts those powerful meditations on God and interpersonal relationships will probably be disappointed by this fairly straightforward melodrama. The symbolism is too heavyhanded and even with a mere 90minute running time the film seems too long for what it has to offer. I never expected to get from Bergman a long drawnout scene where a overstressed character sweats and swoons for what seems like forever... and then that same kind of scene is repeated again later.Nonetheless there are some things to enjoy here. Anders Ek's performance is the most memorable here. His supporting role is as a clown with very distinctive physical gestures. It's a huge contrast to the severe priests he went on to play in two later Bergman films. One wonders if his funny way of moving his mouth inspired the buckteethed drunks of Saturday Night Live's Bill Brasky skits. The music for the film was composed by KarlBirger Blomdahl who ultimately gained a reputation as Sweden's most controversial avantgarde composer but here offering a score rather in the vein of Hindemith full of references to popular dances that capture the riotous and vulgar fun of the circus performers and townspeople.Before Criterion released this DVD the film was unavailable in the United States and known only for its original run in cinemas where the American distributor sold it as a salacious smut film. I'm frankly baffled by this and the 1950s must have been a very repressed era. While Harriet Andersson plays a sex kitten as times and her entire role comes down to her looks the eroticism is not that intense.".

This film is a constant stream of humiliation  but as cruel as it gets it never feels like Bergman is mocking these characters. They are quite likable as pathetic as they are and you suffer along with them. It's pretty much a perfect film. Shot for shot I am in awe of it. And each performance is one for the ages. Anders Ek in particular is memorable as a rubberfaced alcoholic clown. A flashback near the beginning of the film where he humiliates himself to protect his wife from the leering of soldiers which she gladly invites is one of the most gruelling sequences in the cinema  and yet it's only the beginning.".

Grnberg himself IS memorable and the bit where he visits his wife at the tobacco store stirs up interest momentarily... but this is easily the crappiest piece of Bergman I've seen so far. Stark moody cinematography is among its few virtues.To illustrate my disappointment the opening sequence with the tale of the clown Frost's wife taking a nude swim in front of a military squad relates to absolutely nothing that follows and again ridiculously overacted so what exactly is the point of including it in the first place?

Before you can blink he has seduced the couple into joining him on his raids on the houses of the rich.

Ultimately it becomes in it's absurdist way a meditation on how power and sex work in relationships as well as letting go of one's selfimage.

A complex film part crime comedy part transvestite film Blier seems to lose his way at the midpoint and the ending seems tacked on. Depardieu and Blanc in particular are excellent but the script lets them down. A homophobe becomes a fully dressed transsexual in about 90 minutes hardly realistic and the misogynistic tone of the film can be draining.

Check this fun film out to see for yourself!I expected this to be a really bad film but was very surprised to find that I enjoyed it tremendously. Christopher Lee's performance is all menace but with just a smattering of black humour to keep things moving. Lex Barker more than a decade after playing Tarzan looks great and is a perfect heroic figure. Karin Dor is lovely and does a fair bit of over the top shrieking but still manages to give a convincing performance. This was a whole lot of fun! A bit of dark humour Grimm's fairytale mixed with a Mario Bava sensibility and a little Poe thrown in for good measure makes for a superior European horror flick. Hopefully a nicer print will turn up or a DVD release as the Magnum Entertainment video that I viewed was murky faded and very badly edited.".

If this movie is any indication Reinl is a major talent ripe for rediscovery by fans looking for a cinema that revels in flamboyant visual pyrotechnics rather than in quotidian literacy and a politically correct 'sensibility'. Reinl may not be Mario Bava but his extravagantly baroque camera style is nonetheless extremely impressive. The Castle of the Walking Dead is relentlessly designed each shot has been carefully thought out and executed to its fullest illustrative potential. Set decoration lighting and camera movement are all carefully integrated there is almost no shot that is arbitrary accidental or unnecessary. Reinl is an obvious practitioner of the great expressionist tradition in cinema in which the significance of each shot is determined by the director's architectural and illuminative insight in opposition to current film dogma in which the subordinate elements of the shot the acting the script dictates its formal structure. Significantly only Christopher Lee a performer who like Lugosi his predecessor understands the physically revelatory importance of the actor to the overall impact of a film is able to rise to the director's challenge. The Castle of the Walking Dead is ultimately derivative badly acted and pointless but for fans of cinema can be a joy to behold. I should note that the DVD that I watched was faded and crappy one can only hope that in the future the rest of Reinl's output will be rediscovered and restored with the loving care that it deserves.

	schema:reviewBody "Beautifully photographed fastpaced unique colorful atmospheric and even surreal at times this combines elements from Gothic films popular at the time not only limited to Bava but stretching into Roger Corman's Poe series and the Hammer costumeperiod horrors of the day but somehow manages to distinguish itself entirely. Definitely not a movie to be judged on literary faithfulness it is based  very very loosely  on Poe's 'Pit and the Pendulum' then again it doesn't really need to be. The film open with a standard prologue where hatefullooking Satanistsadistscientist Count Frederic Regula Christopher Lee is in prison awaiting execution for killing 12 virgins and using their blood in his experiments. He has a spiked gold mask slammed onto his face by a redhooded executioner shades of BLACK Sunday is dragged into a small town's city square tied to four different horses and then drawnandquartered pulled apart. Before dying he promises to get revenge on the descendants of both the judge who sentenced him Lex Barker who was a big star in Germany at the time and the woman who managed to escape from his torture chamber and warn authorities Karin Dor the very lovely former wife of the director.Thirtyfive years later strapping manlyman Roger Mont Elise Lex Barker again arrives in the same town to claim an inheritance. Said inheritance is Castle Andomai a remote crumbling castle far from the main town. Superstitious townspeople try to warn him not to go near the place but he shrugs them off and decides to hire an apprehensive coachman Dieter Eppler to take him there. Accompanying them on the trip is a very strange priest named Father Fabian Vladimir Medar who claims he just needs a ride. And what a strange coach trip it turns out to be! At first the countryside is serene and picturesque with a clear blue sky mosscovered trees and quiet ponds. Suddenly blackhooded men on horseback blaze the trail. They attack another coach steal it and leave behind two female passengers the beautiful Baroness Lilian von Brabant Karin Dor again and her cute blonde servant Babette Christiane Rcker. Roger learns that Lilian is headed to the same exact location he is she and Roger being of course the two descendants of the 'cursed' people from the opening segment so he gives the two ladies a lift. And then things get really weird almost fairytale like in the dark imagery. The carriage marches across a blood red sky... Every house on the way seems to have been burned to the ground... The fog grows thicker and thicker... At dark the trees take on a sinister life of their own with body parts protruding from the trunks squawking ravens lining limbs and corpses hanging from the branches. It's all too much for the harried coachman who promptly keels over from a heart attack! A strange man named Anathol Carl Lange also shows up long enough to kidnap the women and steal the carriage.Roger and Fabian finally come across Castle Andomai and find Lilian and Babette unharmed inside. The four then discover why it has been nicknamed The Bloody Castle. Inside is a virtual treasure trove of visual beauty and horrific set design with prominent shades of blue purple green and gold in the backdrop. The art direction is exceptional. Many walls are covered with demonic abstract paintings. Others are made entire of skulls. There are tons of secret passageways and every room is sealed off by razor sharp gates when characters enter or exit. Vultures line corridors. Many of the rooms are designed solely for torture including one with a rack over a bed of spikes one where the floor slowly pulls back to reveal a pit of poisonous snakes underneath and another where a huge pendulum emerges from the ceiling. All kinds of creepy crawlers snakes scorpions rats lizards tarantulas make appearances and so does an undeadlooking Christopher Lee again at least long enough to explain his attempts to create a special life elixir and how he needs a virginal thirteenth victim to accomplish his goal. And Anathol the guy who stole to coachgirls turns up once again as Lee's ghostly accomplice.Aside from the production design the makeup effects are also good and there are several surprising visual effects using stopmotion animation. There's also some nonobtrusive comedy elements both dark humored and lighthearted. Former Tarzan Lex Barker's dubbed performance is tolerable enough even though these romantic male leads in Gothic horrors are easily forgotten when the other crazy cats pop up. Future Bond girl Karin Dor who'd star in Hitchcock's TOPAZ the following year does very well as the heroine Vladimir Medar is great comic relief and Lee does an equally fine job with limited screen time as the dour bluefaced crosshating Regula. However the movie is pretty much stolen by Carl Lange as Lee's sinistergleefully sadisticoverthetop sidekick.Anyway I totally loved every second of this one. It's very underrated has awesome setsart direction great cinematography a great cast a great score is wonderfully atmospheric and has the best Pendulum scene of all time much better than the one Corman's crew staged in 1961. Anyone who loves Bava Hammer Horror Corman's Poe flick Gothic horrors etc. should really enjoy it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Beautifully photographed fastpaced unique colorful atmospheric and even surreal at times this combines elements from Gothic films popular at the time not only limited to Bava but stretching into Roger Corman's Poe series and the Hammer costumeperiod horrors of the day but somehow manages to distinguish itself entirely. Definitely not a movie to be judged on literary faithfulness it is based  very very loosely  on Poe's 'Pit and the Pendulum' then again it doesn't really need to be. The film open with a standard prologue where hatefullooking Satanistsadistscientist Count Frederic Regula Christopher Lee is in prison awaiting execution for killing 12 virgins and using their blood in his experiments. He has a spiked gold mask slammed onto his face by a redhooded executioner shades of BLACK Sunday is dragged into a small town's city square tied to four different horses and then drawnandquartered pulled apart. Before dying he promises to get revenge on the descendants of both the judge who sentenced him Lex Barker who was a big star in Germany at the time and the woman who managed to escape from his torture chamber and warn authorities Karin Dor the very lovely former wife of the director.Thirtyfive years later strapping manlyman Roger Mont Elise Lex Barker again arrives in the same town to claim an inheritance. Said inheritance is Castle Andomai a remote crumbling castle far from the main town. Superstitious townspeople try to warn him not to go near the place but he shrugs them off and decides to hire an apprehensive coachman Dieter Eppler to take him there. Accompanying them on the trip is a very strange priest named Father Fabian Vladimir Medar who claims he just needs a ride. And what a strange coach trip it turns out to be! At first the countryside is serene and picturesque with a clear blue sky mosscovered trees and quiet ponds. Suddenly blackhooded men on horseback blaze the trail. They attack another coach steal it and leave behind two female passengers the beautiful Baroness Lilian von Brabant Karin Dor again and her cute blonde servant Babette Christiane Rcker. Roger learns that Lilian is headed to the same exact location he is she and Roger being of course the two descendants of the 'cursed' people from the opening segment so he gives the two ladies a lift.

	schema:reviewBody "Castle of The Walking Dead is the video version of the Constantin Film Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel and as such is shortened by approximately 15 minutes from the original. This film released in 1967 is interesting for several reasons although it is certainly no classic. The careers of Lex Tarzan' Barker and Christopher Lee crossed briefly here and the presence of the lovely Karin Dor wife of director Harald Reinl whom readers may recognize from her role in the Fu Manchu films which also starred Lee of the same era added a bit of grace to an otherwise grim story. Castle of . . . is an interesting mix of excellent atmosphere hampered by odd editing and sometimes laughable storyline. I was impressed by the sets and grim mood the film projected from beginning to end and the presence of Lee makes this must see viewing for his many followers. However this was far from his best work and one wonders if he was not overextending himself during this very busy period in his career. Set in what appears to be 17th or 18th century Germany Count Regula Lee is drawn and quartered for his offenses. 35 years later his manservant Anatole ably portrayed by Carl Lange initiates a rite to bring him back to life on Good Friday. The good Count requires the blood of 13 virgins for this to be achieved and you guessed it Dor as Baroness Lillian Von Brabandt is to be number 13. So the countess and Barker as Roger Montelise son of the judge who condemned the count many years before are duped into visiting Regula's castle. One of the few scenes in the film which combines outstanding atmosphere with sold story line comes when Montelis and his party are being coached to the castle. A very frightening and disturbing ride it was through a forest of hanging bodies and detached limbs giving some much needed credibility to a mostly mediocre offering. At the castle the flow of the story breaks down. Several scripting mistakes are painfully obvious. Two examples In one scene Anatole is shot in the chest by Roger's man and we see a small amount of dark red blood before the bullet hole supernaturally closes. A few minutes later Anatole cuts his wrist and green blood drips to Regula's coffin. In another it is established that the undead' Anatole and Regula cannot bear the presence of a Christian cross in the same room with them. Yet instead of throwing it in his face and escaping Dor meekly obeys Anatole's harsh command to remove it from his sight!     But in the end the good guys win vanquishing the risen to life Regula and the evil Anatole. They are taken away by the same coach they came in on and we are led to believe they lived happily ever after. Castle of . . . will be of interest to fans of European andor obscure horror and the previously mentioned Lee cultists. Years ago I viewed the longer version released under the American title The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism and the added 15 minutes enhances the story greatly so find that copy if you can. Castle of . . . was another release from InterGlobal Home Video whom collectors like me owe a huge debt to.".

In another it is established that the undead' Anatole and Regula cannot bear the presence of a Christian cross in the same room with them. Yet instead of throwing it in his face and escaping Dor meekly obeys Anatole's harsh command to remove it from his sight!     But in the end the good guys win vanquishing the risen to life Regula and the evil Anatole. They are taken away by the same coach they came in on and we are led to believe they lived happily ever after. Castle of . . . will be of interest to fans of European andor obscure horror and the previously mentioned Lee cultists. Years ago I viewed the longer version released under the American title The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism and the added 15 minutes enhances the story greatly so find that copy if you can. Castle of . . . was another release from InterGlobal Home Video whom collectors like me owe a huge debt to.";

	schema:reviewBody "This Castle of the Walking Dead contains  hands down  one of THE creepiest sequences I've ever seen. A carriage with four people inside is on its way to a sinister castle with a dark past when suddenly the driver notices they're going through a woods where there's a dead body hanging from nearly every three! The sight of and atmosphere during this particular sequences is truly horrific. In fact the entire film somewhat relies on powerful isolated sequences of the macabre as the story itself is quite familiar and routine Gothic stuff. Castle of the Walking Dead is another loose adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's legendary tale The Pit and the Pendulum which also already existed in a version directed by Roger Corman and starring Vincent Price. The film gives topbilling to veteran actor Christopher Lee but apart from the intro sequence and the exquisite finale his role isn't too extended. Lee plays the malicious and murderous Count Regula who gets quartered for the all the vicious crimes he committed but of course not before placing a curse on the judge who pronounced the death sentence and the last female victim who managed to escape and get him arrested. 35 years later their unaware relatives are lured to the castle where the score shall be settled once and for all. I'm a big fan of Gothic horror and generally speaking rather forgiving when there are shortcomings. That's why I'm still very fond of Castle of the Walking Dead even though it definitely could have been even better. Many isolated sequences are terrific but the wholesome is a bit incoherent. Once the almighty Christopher Lee is resurrected again the quality level of the film rises again. His character is masterfully malevolent another evil count consuming the blood of virgins to gain eternal life and this great actor's natural horror charisma already delivers half of the powerful impact. The scene with the giant pendulum remains a brilliant highlight regardless of how many times you've seen this before in other films. The titular castle is like a theme park full of wondrously sinister Gothic attractions. It even has vultures patiently waiting outside of the pendulum room!".

There are some really tense scenes the snake pit and some haunting images the hanging corpses.however with so much editing and poor dubbing most of the story gets lost. granted i was presented with the really interesting parts the story was never boring but i felt we needed a bit more exposition.other than that the only gripes i have with the movie is the lack of explanations.i got the impression while the coachman was driving he was only imagining the bodies in the trees and the corpses on the road because he doesn't get scared until he sees....three black crows.  But the movie doesn't bother to tell us that.  The other problem i have is with the black riders.  were they the guys who were hanging later on?  this is never explained either. And then there is the lack of good special effects.  I said before the snake pit scene was tense and yes it is noone wants her to fall but the pit has about five or six black snakes in it.  better effects would have had the entire pit swarming with hundreds of different snakes.  and the laboratory scene was pretty cheesey too just various liquids bubbling and steaming. all negative points aside this movie is really really entertaining.  like i said it is never boring.  the reviewers who compared it to bava are correct it is very similar to his style.  the other reviewer who said the movie feels evil was also correct.  the entire movie seems to have been shot in hell.  and perhaps that is what this movie is all about hell or nightmares.  when the movie is over i was left with questions but i was still pleased. i can only imagine what the uncut original is like.  Anchor Bay if you are reading this is a prime candidate for you!".

	schema:reviewBody "My review of The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadismcontains spoilersThis movie went by so many different names. I think I like the title that most people know this movie by The Castle of the Walking Dead best. The title The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism is very misleading and offputting. It evokes images of Eli Rothstyle tortureporn movies and this movie is nothing like that.This movie is a delight to watch. The movie was very well shot by director Harald Reinl. The color palette of this film was rich with blood red sky's and marine blue spooky dungeon walls. The lead actress Karin Dor wore a dazzling purple dress. Count Regula's laboratory had bubbling viols of every color of the rainbow. Visually this film has an artistic quality to it from the elaborate murals painted on the dungeon walls to the surreal colors of the cave walls.In a nutshell this movie is great example of West German krimi cinema of the late 1960's spooky but not bloody. It is clear that no expense was spared to make sure that this movie looked great. The costumes and settings and props and lighting were all topnotch. I thought that the casting was also fantastic. Christopher Lee played a perfectly creepy Count Regula. The leading man Lex Barker managed to portray a rugged masculine confidence in his role as Roger Mont Elise. Lex Barker is used to the strong silent physically imposing roles as he played Tarzan in a number of movies earlier in his career. German actor Carl Lange brought a wonderfully spooky presence to his role of Anatol henchman to the evil Count Regula.Brian Bly in his review wondered if this movie actually qualifies as Horror. Maybe not. But it does seem like an appropriate movie to watch during the Halloween season. In fact doesn't this movie seem like something that might have been shown at 600pm on Halloween night in the late 1970'searly 1980's? This movie certainly has a safe but spooky feel to it that seems like it was made for a younger audience. While young movie goers of the late 1960's might have been creepedout by the spiders snakes skulls skeletons and death traps ultimately no major character dies. In fact the monsters are dispelled by a simple crucifix. This movie might better be described as thrilling rather than horror.Rather than market this movie as a Horror movie I think this movie works better as a buddy adventure movie. If this movie had been filmed in the 1980's I imagine Danny Devito in the role of Father Fabian the thief. This movie fits in perfectly with more familiar 1980's adventure movies like Romancing the Stone or Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In fact the movie might not have been to different had it cast Dean Martin as Roger Mont Elise and Jerry Lewis as Father Fabian. The script of this movie seems to contemplate two swinging guys hooking up with two hot chicks while a whole bunch of spooky stuff happens around them. For sure the musical score evokes a kooky happy 1960's we are all going to get laid tone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel of 1967 aka. Castle Of The Walking Dead is a cheesy but amusing little German Gothic Horror film. This was arguably made to cash in on the earlier success of Roger Corman's brilliant Poecycle starring Vincent Price. And while the film is quite entertaining overall this German Gothic attempt can in no way come anywhere near the brilliance Corman's films or the many ingenious Italian Gothic masterpieces and British Hammer flicks that were made in the 60s. While this has a partly nice atmosphere and most memorably the great Christopher Lee who sadly has way too little screen time as the villain it is sadly less stylish and incomparably tamer and more wellbehaved than its Italian British or American counterparts. While the film does occasionally build up a mood it lacks aspects such the macabre touch of the Corman films or the nastiness of Italian Gothic gems. This is not to say of course that the film is a complete waste. On the contrary it is pure camp fun which I highly recommend to any of my fellow Gothic Horror fanatics.The cruel count Regula Christopher Lee is drawn and quartered for tormenting twelve virgins to death at his castle. Thirtyfive years later Roger von Marienberg Lex Barker and Lilian Von Brabant Karin Dor are invited to the count's castle. The two are the spitting image of the judge who sentenced the count to death Barker and the count's only surviving victim Dor...The film is very loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story The Pit And The Pendulum. Roger Corman had made a film based on the story in 1961 namely the brilliant The Pit And The Pendulum starring Vincent Price my favorite actor and Barbara Steele my favorite actress which became one of the greatest Gothic masterpieces ever in cinema. Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel which translates The Snakepit And The Pendulum  also the German title of Poe's shortstory is of course no masterpiece of the kind. Harald Reinl who is mainly known for Edgar Wallace films the naive German Karl May Westerns and his interpretation of the Nibelungs was no Roger Corman. Lex Barker was certainly no Vincent Price and while Karin Dor is certainly no Barbara Steele either she is still beautiful enough to make this film worthwhile. The film's greatest quality is of course the great Christopher Lee another favorite actor of mine who plays the sardonic villain. Sadly he has far too little screen time. The overacting Carl Lange also fits in his role of the evil count's sidekick. This one's negative aspects lie mainly in its very German harmlessness and partly also in the censorship which was stricter in Germany at the time green blood?  you gotta be kidding me. Yet it is an amusing film which may be highly entertaining to some of my fellow Gothic Horror lovers. Just make sure to watch all the Gothic masterpieces from Mario Bava Antonio Margheriti Roger Corman the Hammer Studios etc. before giving this a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have the Aikman Archives 2003 DVD release which has a quoted running time of 81 minutes but I do not know if it is uncut. It says that it is digitally remastered... but that is a pretense only. The opening scenes have some severe film scratches on it and minor scratching is visible in many later scenes although the color is not too bad. The charm of this film is obviously the sets and general creepiness. Story wise it is typical of the Revenge and Curse plot lines in horror movies but adds a few twists to make it a little more bizarre. It's mostly a vehicle for the wellrealized castle and torture chambers. Huge Hieronymus Bosch paintings dominate the walls while trained vultures greedily peck at bloody leftovers. Corpses hang along dimly viewed roadside trees and with every move a spiked portcullis or oaken door closes behind the protagonists sealing their passage. With a more coherent plot and more subtle and cohesive dialog and editing this would have been more than a B movie. To me it lacks some measure of suspense although the torture chamber sequences aren't too bad. Christopher Lee needed more screen time and better lines and Lex Barker could have been replaced with Ron Ely or Gordon Scott my favorite Tarzans.".

	schema:headline " A German horror film inspired by Bava";
	schema:reviewBody "Just as the German krimi of the 60s proved to be a big inspiration for the Italian gialli this film is in turn inspired by the 1960s Italian Gothic horrors perhaps best exemplified by Mario Bava's Black Sunday. Like Black Sunday this film concerns an executed practitioner of the black arts returning from the dead to get revenge on the descendants of those who executed them. In this case it is Christopher Lee rather than Barbara Steele and thankfully he dubs himself.Like the films of Bava this is filled with moody photography and baroque Gothic visuals such as a forest filled with corpses a hallway lined with skulls and walls painted with Boschean landscapes. It is difficult to judge how great the photography itself was in relation to Bava's since the print was so poor but the direction was definitely as competent. None of the characters were particularly interesting except for Fabian a highwayman disguised as a priest suffering from major Falstaff syndrome. The man even resembles the Orson Welles incarnation of the character so I can't help but wonder if it was intentional. The film is pretty entertaining for the most part and doesn't suffer so horribly from its dubbing like many films from the period do. It is only during the pendulum sequence that I found myself getting bored. While it had not been at the time the sequence has been done to death and it always ends the same way hero comes up with a clever plan and escapes just as the blade gets driven into the ground. Maybe they could've shaken things up by having the hero get sliced in two and had the poor man's Falstaff save the day!So all in all not a particularly significant Eurohorror entry but it benefits from some awesome visuals one amazing character and an occasionally effective score though it sometimes lapses into some painfully inappropriate and thus hilarious happygolucky music. Personally I'm just glad to have finally seen it after reading about it for all these years!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a kid I tried watching THE TORTURE CHAMBER OF DR. SADISM one of MANY alternate titles for this movie. However I never got past about the first half of the filmit scared me do much I turned the TV off and spent the rest of the night worrying. And for 35 years I've wondered if the movie was really THAT scary or was I just a wimpy kid. Well after finally getting a copy of the DVD I realized that most any kid would indeed be scared watching this Gothic horror flick. That's because the atmosphere in the film is truly horrificwith more disturbing images that you'd find in three or four horror films. And although the film stars Christopher Lee and Lex Barker it is not a Hammer Film and is much more visually disturbing than any of their movies.The film begins with Christopher Lee being condemned to death for the murder of 12 virgins. Due to the number of victims he is ordered to be drawn and quartered. While not all of this is shown enough is that it might be a bit of a shock. Years pass and the memory of this maniac pass as well. Now 35 years later hmm...the same length of time since I was first traumatized by the movie the townspeople have only a dim memory of him or his horrors. When Lex Barker arrives in town he is told that he needs to meet a Count Regula at his castle but no one seems to remember him or the castleeven though he was the guy drawn and quartered decades earlier.Finally Barker is able to find a priest who knows where the Count's castle is and the two of them set off for the meeting. On the way they pass through countryside that SHOULD have warned them to go backespecially when the woods near the castle is littered with body parts and people who had been hung. Obviously the Count is no saint!! Why they didn't go back is beyond me!! Whatever the Count needs to tell him it certainly isn't worth continuing the journey! However Barker and the priest are apparently idiots so they continue. On the way they meet up with another carriage which contains a couple nice looking young ladies one of which looked a lot like Barbara Steele a famous Gothic horror star of the age. Unfortunately the ladies are soon kidnapped and it's up to the two men to continue the journey and save the damsels.Once at the castle the place looks much more like a twisted torture chamber than a castle. A drawbridge with knives protruding from it paintings on the walls inspired by paintings by Hieronymous Bosch trap doors sick torture devices and dead bodies litter the place and this is not a segment for the squeamish. How as a kid I was able to watch this much is amazing as it looks like the interior decorating was done by the Marquis de Sade and Satan! A zombielike servant appears and announces that the Count is dead but will be coming back to life that night to meet his guests. Wownow THAT'S going all out for company! And so in a sick little ceremony the zombieservant cuts his wrists and green blood pours from his veinsall over the glass coffin containing the dismembered Count. At this point the arms and legs all reattach and the guy wakes upand that is when 35 years ago I turned off the film!!! As far as ambiance go you can't get much scarier than this very disturbing film and the movie had a nice lookeven though the DVD print was awful. While audiences in the 21st century might laugh at it a bit back in 1967 this was quite a shocker. Skulls corpses vultures picking apart bodies etc.it's all very graphic and intense. And as for the town in the first portion of the movie it looked very old and authentichaving been filmed in the town of Rothenburg Germany. I've visited this very quaint town and quickly recognized the buildings.The acting despite being a very international film is just fine. Most of the actors originally spoke German and I know that Barker was fluent in the language as well. I don't know if Lee spoke German as well but in the American print he and Barker are not dubbedthey speak English.As for the plot up until the very end the movie was well done. Not exactly deep but very well done. The various graphic images and plot devices really were effective. It's just that the end occurred so quickly and almost randomlyleaving you feeling like they just threw a cheap ending on the film because they were running out of film! While not a bad ending it was the weakest part of the film.Overall this is a scare the pants off you type of film. Not especially deep it still will have you on the seat of your pants and amazed at the brutality of the evil Regula and his henchman.FYIIn addition to being a very bad print the film also was not captioned or closed captionedsomething that might have been helpful.".

The suspects ride off in the distance as Rev and Lex arrive and help the shaken women into their carriage. Pleasantry are exchanged and you get to see and appreciate the loveliness of Karin.The afternoon turns to twilight as dead bodies appear. The devastation around the coachman is to much and he dies from the stress. Enter Pater caretaker for the castle and count Regula's right hand man. He steals the cab as Lex and Carl watch in disbelief as the two travel on foot a short distance to the Castle to rescue to the abducted ladies. The structure is downright gloomy filled with self opening doors and endless corridorsdescending bars of steel as the two stroll inside. Piano music is heard as the two men are drawn towards the sound as they meet up with Man servant Pater. He directs them to the gorgeous Lilian playing a melody on a baby grand donning a lavender Hooped dress. She is under the influence in sort of a trance as she fans her way around the room Foul play is in order as Babette tips off our guests as the drinks being served are filled with acid. Pater just drinks his acid glass vintage without a burp. The trance wears off and Lilian comes back to reality. The rest of the movie you just watch Karin sashay around the worn torn castle filled with snakes vultures scorpions trapped doors and a moving wooden plank. An anomaly of extreme as blood and guts filled the hallways of this weathered old edifice as our Froline dashes along in lavender and lace. I would have loved to see some outtakes of her skirt blowing over her head but they didn't save those things in those days. In the end goodness prevails and evil fails. Was this movie scary? Of course not! I rated this movie a five just for gazing into her beautiful face. Now it's off to German Class 101 Karin meine liebeIhre so schon.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard such good things about Castle of the Walking Dead aka The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism that I've really been looking forward to seeing it. I was a little disappointed. The movie seemed to be little more than a series of interesting but unrelated ideas and scenes stuck together with a very flimsy plot. The castle scenes are basically one torture device after the other. Christopher Lee is underutilized. He plays a onenote character that highlights very little of his acting abilities.One scene in particular points out many of the problems with the movie. As our unsuspecting heroes make their way to the castle they must travel through a forest. This is no ordinary forest. The trees seem to have dead bodies actually growing out of their trunks and branches. Do they turn around and home like sensible people? NO. Dead bodies in trees must be a common sight in their part of the world.Regardless of what I've written so far it's not as if I didn't find something to enjoy. The rating I gave the movie 610 would indicate that. What I did find enjoyable were those very scenes that I've previously described as unrelated. Most are so overthetop in their imaginative use of torture devices that I couldn't help but enjoy them. The scene of our hero tied helplessly as a ax blade pendulum slowly drops toward his body was truly an amazing sight. It's actually better than a similar scene in Corman's Pit and the Pendulum a movie I actually enjoy.".

He plays a onenote character that highlights very little of his acting abilities.One scene in particular points out many of the problems with the movie. As our unsuspecting heroes make their way to the castle they must travel through a forest. This is no ordinary forest. The trees seem to have dead bodies actually growing out of their trunks and branches. Do they turn around and home like sensible people? NO. Dead bodies in trees must be a common sight in their part of the world.Regardless of what I've written so far it's not as if I didn't find something to enjoy. The rating I gave the movie 610 would indicate that. What I did find enjoyable were those very scenes that I've previously described as unrelated. Most are so overthetop in their imaginative use of torture devices that I couldn't help but enjoy them. The scene of our hero tied helplessly as a ax blade pendulum slowly drops toward his body was truly an amazing sight. It's actually better than a similar scene in Corman's Pit and the Pendulum a movie I actually enjoy.";

Whilst the latter would describe a film that focuses on its vampirism and might be judged on the sharpness of its fangs this film involving vampires has all the merits of the very best cinema and at its core is nothing but a fantastic story carried by compelling believable characters.For those who may not be able to overlook the vampiric content look again. The vampirism herein is a plot device a way of presenting characters who cannot die or age or be harmed so that the philosophical questions of life itself can be explored. But equally for those who will be interested in the vampiric content this film presents a rich mythology backed by a trilogy of books which fleshes out the concept of the vampire in a much deeper way than any other production.Every person has their own world view their own way of living and thinking. People can be brooding contemplative cautious reasonable carefree hedonistic optimistic emotional  and every shade in between. But these are all worldviews based on the knowledge that life is short. What would happen if told their lives would never end? Who would be happiest? What would they do? How would eternal life affect each person? And most importantly if a way of living was bringing meaning to a person's life would that still work once life was infinite? All of these questions help us explore philosophical ideas as old as time and that exploration is the focus of this film.The story is propelled by vampires Louis Pitt and Lestat Cruise each representing a different take on life. Whilst Louis who began as a depressive wanting to die thinks of eternity as an extended curse Lestat who seems to live every second as it comes barely even considers the future three minutes hence. Told from Louis' viewpoint as he struggles to find some meaning in a life he knows will never end we are taken on a ride across the centuries as Louis' outlook and happiness undulate whilst characters and relationships come and go.Alongside Louis' turmoil in coming to terms with his now eternal life a secondary theme is explored which is the notion of survival. Even though Louis is clearly dissatisfied with life he never attempts to end it despite this option being open to him. In other words surviving in and of itself was a motivation that outdid any other. Most importantly survival outdoes Louis' trouble over the fact that his only source of nourishment is now the blood of living animals preferably humans. Despite attempting abstinence and then attempting to drink only the blood of rodents this basic feeding instinct proves too much for Louis. And yet as Lestat points out what is the problem? The fittest always survives and whoever is lower down the foodchain will be eaten. Humans eat animals and vampires eat humans  it's all natural. But nonetheless are there moral limits? Even if you have to kill a human is there a more moral way to do it? Monstrous Louis exclaims as he watches a group of vampires murder a defenceless girl. Yet might survival require the forgetting of moral consciousness like Lestat?'Interview with the Vampire' explores all of these deep important issues whilst delivering an incredibly powerful story populated by charismatic characters haunting and diverse settings and immortal dialogue.

	schema:reviewBody "I like Anne Rice was initially dismayed that Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat. But when I saw the film I had to admit that he absolutely nailed the role. I had always thought of Cruise as a pretty boy and not really a serious actor especially since he failed in his attempt at a Streepian accent in Far and Away. However he perfectly portrayed Lestat for what he is a monster with a monstrous ego.  I think that this was the first film I had seen with Brad Pitt followed shortly by Legends of the Fall so to me his acting credentials were impeccable in spite of my female friends swooning over him. The rest of the cast was excellent as well with the only minor quibble that Antonio Banderas was too old for the part of Armand. Kirsten Dunst was adorably evil. The cinematography was beautiful considering that almost all of the film of course takes place at night.  One note on the supposed homoeroticism in the film. I have the advantage having read Rice's books so here is the deal on that. In Rice's world the vampires are absolutely sexless. Therefore gender has no meaning to them. When a vampire loves another or a mortal it is truly from the heart as no sexuality of any kind ever enters into it. The only thing to them that is close is the kill. Killing is highly erotic to vampires. However this too is really asexual and so again gender has no bearing on the eroticism of the kill. I think that some elements of this which apparently came across as homoeroticism were included in the screenplay just to emphasize how different how nonhuman that vampires are.".

Cruise plays a seasoned killer who revels in bloodthirsty excess while Pitt is a conscientious objector who balks at the prospect of drinking human blood until Cruise creates a 'companion' for Pitt in the shape of a little girl Dunst who refuses to grow old gracefully with tragic consequences.Scored with melancholy grace by composer Elliot Goldenthal and beautifully designed and photographed by Dante Ferretti and Philippe Rousselot respectively the film is epic in concept and execution spanning the social upheavals of 17th and 18th century America and the horrors of 19th century Europe where a nest of ancient vampires led by scenestealer Antonio Banderas and a miscast Stephen Rea wreak terrible revenge on those who transgress against vampire lore. But for all its spectacle director Neil Jordan THE COMPANY OF WOLVES  working from a script credited to Rice herself  maintains a leisurely pace and never loses sight of the characters. The movie contains some beautiful transcendent passages including a breathtaking transition from 19th century Europe to modern day America via the introduction of motion pictures everything from SUNRISE A SONG OF TWO HUMANS to GONE WITH THE WIND and SUPERMAN! and an incredibly moving sequence in which a onceproud vampire is discovered in exile laid low by his own vanity.The film's delicate tone is upset by a trick ending which comes completely out of leftfield though Jordan has denied any suggestion of studio interference. And as with the novel the homoerotic undercurrent is mere windowdressing an unconsummated tease which the filmmakers and Rice herself refuse to explore in any detail lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly the movie is dedicated to the memory of River Phoenix  originally cast as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title  who died of a drugs overdose during preproduction his role was taken by Christian Slater.

But Interview With a Vampire was a movie that excelled my expectations.I refused to see this film for 3 years because I believed it would be what I perceived it to be glitzy Hollywood garbage geared toward adolescent girls with posters of the 3 main actors all over their walls. I finally broke down and rented it and I was astonished by the incredible performances delivered the thrilling dialogue and the way it was delivered by the actors the scenery the plot the score...everything. I never thought that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise could act but their performances made their unbelievable characters a reality. However the true star of the film was Kirsten Dunst. At 12 years old this girl was able to hold her own against her costars and often stole the scene particularly the incident in which Claudia tries to cut her hair and subsequently Lestat discovers the corpse in her bed.You don't want to look for the meaning of life in this movie. It's a story. The plot is basically the history of a vampire's life and I don't understand why people are compelled to trash a movie because of its simplicity. Look at the title. That's all it is and if you expect more you're setting yourself up for disappointment. It's not the deepest of movies that's why it should be enjoyed for the intense dialogue and the great production that went into it. Others trash the movie because of its homoerotic undertones. This aspect is so fleeting that it's ridiculous to dwell on it and if you dwell on such an insignificant aspect of the movie then you were obviously looking for something to bother you. One additional thing to even suggest that the violence in this film could be responsible for incidents such as the Columbine High School killings is beyond moronic.This isn't the greatest movie that has ever been made it's certainly not a complex analysis of life or a parable with a moral dictating the enjoyment of life. It's a brilliantly produced gothic tale of a vampire nothing more and nothing less. In respect to the book I've never read it and I don't particularly care to read it. But for all of you who have been complaining about the movie not living up to the novel here's a clue that might prove useful in the future the book is ALWAYS better than the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I have a passion for films with dark settings. What's even better is when the film is not only dark and dismal but also deep and engrossing. With a combination of Anne Rice's script and Neil Jordan's direction the overlooked Interview with the Vampire not only looks great but contains good material. Most of the time when a film is based on a novel it will try to capture the themes of the novel by choosing areas to work from. Luckily Anne Rice also writes the screenplay and understands more than anyone else what areas need addressing providing the backbone to the dialogue and plot.Set in 1791 Orleans and progressing through different periods of time IWTV is technically excellent and aware of its surroundings. From the first moment your eyes are fixed on the screen. This is the sign of great art direction coupled with costume design and set pieces that are more than pleasing on the eye. Far from in your face the film allows a taste of each period with a mixture of light and colourful scenes to the more prominent dreary settings it encompasses. Moonlit streets abandoned plague ridden residential and underground gothic architectures all add to the great detail that has been taken in creating a believable and picturesque look to the films periods it contains. Helped also by a musical score that really lurks in the background depicts the time and in some areas the feeling aptly.The story told with a mixture of narration from the protagonist Brad Pitt in this case and a screenplay with enough room for all the stars makes a tight little package. At just over 2 hours long though this may put off the viewer looking for an all out action vampire piece or those with little patience. Interview after all is a drama at heart with horror elements but what sets it apart from others is the humane way in which it's dealt with. A point in the film that leans on stereotypical vampire views sets the tone of the film perfectly fiction aside Vampires aren't so unlike humans which is portrayed through the emotions or rejection of them throughout. One of the key players in such a task is surprisingly Tom Cruise as the bad influence Lestat. In one of his more challenging roles Cruise conveys a charm that fits the theatricals of his character perfectly. Through excellent makeup and clothes from a period he refuses to break free from Cruise is less distinguishable but all the more better for losing the usual side of him that may have been too familiar. Left only with a look of ferocity and impertinence Cruise works his role to a brilliant combination that really brings out the character of Lestat making him extremely fun to watch. Lestat's mood swings and cruel insinuations really spark the film up stealing every scene he's in.What makes the film interesting is how every character has a background and each character has different things that make them tick. Along for the ride with Cruise and Pitt is a very young Kirsten Dunst as the disillusioned vampire child Claudia. It seems that Jordan is a good director for getting performances as Dunst gives a fine performance at such a young age definitely showing more promise than the usual teenage focal points she has set herself on since. While Lestat is the most enjoyable character and practically the teacher Louis and Claudia are the key elements to a story of selfdiscovery concerning the dark world they have joined. Other than this Christian Slater and Antonio Banderas share little screen time but enough to make their characters wholesome enough.One area that I applaud but others may disclude is the vivid scenes of a gory nature used profusely throughout. Jordan going for realism and with blood being an important part of vampire life includes graphic details.. and with no holds barred. Jordans realistic touches add only to the plausibility of the vampire way of life emphasising the grotesque way of living they are lumbered with for eternity. Such a eternal damnation is one of the main themes of the film exploring the depreciation of Louis and Claudia and how they come to terms with their new life. It would seem that such a serious tone to a fictional tale would make it hard to enjoy but with a mixture of dark humour throughout the film knows not to take itself 'too' seriously. The end clearly establishes this fact nicely.Minor quibbles aside like some hokey dialogue from time to time and despite Pitt underplaying his performance a little among the Vampire genre and even as a drama this is a classy piece of work from a intelligent director with a flair for dark style in most of his other films too and more importantly produces a epic tale with sturdy direction. If you have the interest for a drama specifically based around vampires there is little other choice than this. Through its fine performances and stunning look one things for sure you wont forget this one easily.7.5 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "I have a passion for films with dark settings. What's even better is when the film is not only dark and dismal but also deep and engrossing. With a combination of Anne Rice's script and Neil Jordan's direction the overlooked Interview with the Vampire not only looks great but contains good material. Most of the time when a film is based on a novel it will try to capture the themes of the novel by choosing areas to work from. Luckily Anne Rice also writes the screenplay and understands more than anyone else what areas need addressing providing the backbone to the dialogue and plot.Set in 1791 Orleans and progressing through different periods of time IWTV is technically excellent and aware of its surroundings. From the first moment your eyes are fixed on the screen. This is the sign of great art direction coupled with costume design and set pieces that are more than pleasing on the eye. Far from in your face the film allows a taste of each period with a mixture of light and colourful scenes to the more prominent dreary settings it encompasses. Moonlit streets abandoned plague ridden residential and underground gothic architectures all add to the great detail that has been taken in creating a believable and picturesque look to the films periods it contains. Helped also by a musical score that really lurks in the background depicts the time and in some areas the feeling aptly.The story told with a mixture of narration from the protagonist Brad Pitt in this case and a screenplay with enough room for all the stars makes a tight little package. At just over 2 hours long though this may put off the viewer looking for an all out action vampire piece or those with little patience. Interview after all is a drama at heart with horror elements but what sets it apart from others is the humane way in which it's dealt with. A point in the film that leans on stereotypical vampire views sets the tone of the film perfectly fiction aside Vampires aren't so unlike humans which is portrayed through the emotions or rejection of them throughout. One of the key players in such a task is surprisingly Tom Cruise as the bad influence Lestat. In one of his more challenging roles Cruise conveys a charm that fits the theatricals of his character perfectly. Through excellent makeup and clothes from a period he refuses to break free from Cruise is less distinguishable but all the more better for losing the usual side of him that may have been too familiar. Left only with a look of ferocity and impertinence Cruise works his role to a brilliant combination that really brings out the character of Lestat making him extremely fun to watch. Lestat's mood swings and cruel insinuations really spark the film up stealing every scene he's in.What makes the film interesting is how every character has a background and each character has different things that make them tick. Along for the ride with Cruise and Pitt is a very young Kirsten Dunst as the disillusioned vampire child Claudia. It seems that Jordan is a good director for getting performances as Dunst gives a fine performance at such a young age definitely showing more promise than the usual teenage focal points she has set herself on since. While Lestat is the most enjoyable character and practically the teacher Louis and Claudia are the key elements to a story of selfdiscovery concerning the dark world they have joined.

	schema:reviewBody "Now that some time has passed Neil Jordon's beautiful work can be watched without obsessing so much over the stars who were involved. 'Interview' is an extravagant assault on the senses filled with beauty erotic and graphic violence and wonderful at times poetic dialog. To be sure this is a Hollywood production but with director Neil Jordon in charge the film possesses that special arthouse film look with many scenes being too strange and dark to come across as typical Hollywood. Pitt is fine as Louis the centuriesold vampire who recounts his sad and fascinating history to a nameless interviewer played a bit too light by Christian Slater. If you dislike Tom Cruise and his films as i do you should not let his participation in the film dissuade you from seeing this As the sinister Lestat Cruise is barely recognizable and gives here what might be his finest performance. Obviously due to the subject matter 'Interview' is a relentlessly dark film. There are a few short scenes of daylight in the beginning until Louis is transformed. Then begins his life of eternal darkness. When I saw this in the theater the effect of sitting in a darkened room watching a film that takes place entirely at night really felt strange. Coming out of the theater I felt as though I had been away from the real world for a long time. Jordon's aesthetic vision supported for once by the huge Hollywood budget insured that Interview looks gorgeous. The plantation that is Louis' first home and then the Paris apartment are filled with exquisite antiques ornate furnishings gold framed mirrors lace and velvet fourposter beds etc transporting the viewer into the 18th and 19th centuries and lends an extra level of decadence to the lifestyle of these vampires. The costumes as well are breathtaking and accurate to the time. The finest thing about this production though is the beautiful dolllike Claudia the childvampire played by Kirsten Dunst. It is always terrifying and strange when a child is cast in such an evil role. Claudia's thirst for blood exceeds that of Lestat himself and her total lack of remorse for the people she kills is the most haunting and disturbing thing about this. The approach to her character was very unHollywood thankfully. Anne Rice's book evokes feelings of loneliness and a profound sadness and those feelings translate well into Jordans film. Interview With the Vampire is a very special and at times superb cinematic delight that was not ruined by it's overexposed stars and commercialism. And those that love Gothic horror and period films should see this and ignore it's Hollywood origins.".

When I do get past that however I find that Interview with the Vampire is a very beautifully told tale that looks deep into the heart of what evil truly is.Based on Anne Rice's novel and also her screenplay Interview is the retelling of Louis's a vampire story of how he became a vampire.

A vampire named Lestat Tom Cruise gives him this opportunity with the expectation of companionship. When Louis has trouble disconnecting his human moral compass from his bloodlusting monster of a self Lestat tries to test him and eventually brings him another companion when he makes Claudia Kirsten Dunst a vampire as well. The story is Louis's search for an understanding of this immortal life that he can come to terms with which results in a film that explores deep into the notion of immortality with a price.The film's beauty comes from the very lavish sets and the strong mystical element that is worked into every set. Though the setting is all real world because the film explores the fantastical world of vampires everything seems surreal and magical. Dante Ferretti has created another beautiful movie world and Neil Jordan makes it shine through his camerawork. Jordan really brings Rice's screenplay to life or else you'd be looking at a particularly boring film.Cruise as Lestat was a good choice. He is downright creepy and conveys the sense of moral ambiguity that Lestat represents. Pitt also shows both the strong and the weak sides of Louis though he is not as skilled with handling some of the film's melodrama. Dunst is probably the most praiseworthy. Having to portray a child who technically has wisdom beyond her appearance is a challenge and Dunst is behind some of the film's best scenes and most suspenseful moments. Her fits of rage are probably the most interesting as is her character's predicament with never growing up which really starts the conversation about mortality and the film's themes.Though some plot clarity would have been nice and a little less melodrama would have helped make the themes really significant to the rest of the film Interview is a successful film from a visual standpoint. The craftsmen of this film everyone from production design to costumes and makeup truly made this film take off from okay to good and very interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "In San Francisco the journalist Daniel Malloy Christian Slater interviews in a hotel room a man called Louis Brad Pitt that claims to be a vampire. Louis tells that he was the owner of a plantation in New Orleans and happily married with a daughter. In 1791 he grieves the loss of his wife and daughter and has no wish to live anymore. Out of the blue he meets the vampire Lestat Tom Cruise that attacks him and asks Louis to choose whether her wants to die or to turn into a vampire. Louis accepts to be a vampire but is reluctant to kill humans drinking animal blood to survive while Lestat feels pleasure in killing human. When Louis meets the girl Claudia Kirsten Dunst who has just lost her mother in an outbreak of plague in New Orleans he does not resist and drinks her blood. Lestat turns Claudia into a vampire to keep Louis with him. Louis treats Claudia as a daughter while Lestat teaches her to be a killer. Years later Claudia gives laudanum to kill Lestat and flees to Paris with Louis where they meet the vampires Armand Antonio Banderas and Santiago Stephen Rea that pose of actors in a theater with other vampires. But a tragic event changes the saga of Louis in Europe.'Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles is a Gothic film that discloses the saga of Louis a vampire initially with human soul. His grief and pain for the loss of his wife and daughter his transformation into a vampire and relationship with the Lestat his love for the vampire girl Claudia his wrath for the vampires in Paris his return to New Orleans are told in a screenplay written by the author of the novel Anne Rice and directed by Neil Jordan. The changing of behavior of the immortals Louis and Lestat along the centuries is intriguing with the bon vivant Lestat losing his interest in life and Louis questioning the meaning of many things that he has experienced. The cinematography and the art direction are amazing and the haunting music score complete this good film. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Entrevista Com o Vampiro Interview with the Vampire".

Years later Claudia gives laudanum to kill Lestat and flees to Paris with Louis where they meet the vampires Armand Antonio Banderas and Santiago Stephen Rea that pose of actors in a theater with other vampires. But a tragic event changes the saga of Louis in Europe.'Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles is a Gothic film that discloses the saga of Louis a vampire initially with human soul. His grief and pain for the loss of his wife and daughter his transformation into a vampire and relationship with the Lestat his love for the vampire girl Claudia his wrath for the vampires in Paris his return to New Orleans are told in a screenplay written by the author of the novel Anne Rice and directed by Neil Jordan. The changing of behavior of the immortals Louis and Lestat along the centuries is intriguing with the bon vivant Lestat losing his interest in life and Louis questioning the meaning of many things that he has experienced. The cinematography and the art direction are amazing and the haunting music score complete this good film. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Entrevista Com o Vampiro Interview with the Vampire";

	schema:reviewBody "Interview with the Vampire is hands down probably the number one vampire movie. We got to see a story so unique and original the eyes through a vampire and his world. Normally we see Dracula getting chased around by Van Helsing all we know is vampires are usually bad and must be destroyed yatta yatta yatta. But this time we not only experience how Louis became a vampire but what his life became of it. Anne Rice would truly be proud of how much a great movie her most famous book turned out to be.We have some great and very attractive actors who star in this film like Brad Pitt Tom Cruise Antonio Bandares Christian Slater and Stephen Rea not to mention a very young and new Kirsten Dunst. The story starts off with Christian Slater interviewing Brad Pitt who plays Louis he makes the most interesting statement to Christian that he's a vampire. Obviously Christian doesn't take this seriously but Louis offers him one thing his story.Louis was born and grew up during the time when America was just being discovered in the late 1700's he just lost his wife and child in labor a little different than the book but anyways but his misery brings him to wanting death and Lestat played by the brilliant Tom Cruise brings him that with becoming a vampire. Of course Louis doesn't realize what he gets himself into but Lestat does what he can to show Louis the perks of being a vampire even if it means bringing in a child Claudia played by Dunst and turning her into a vampire to keep Louis with him. But Claudia and Louis look at Lestat as a warden and won't let them go so they attempt to kill him and flee the city of New Orleans to France.In Paris they meet a group of thespian vampires they kill people on stage as if they were in a play. Vampires pretending to be humans pretending to be vampires. Louis meets Armond played by Bandares and Santiago played by Rea. Armond is obsessed with Louis and tells him that Claudia shouldn't be a vampire since she is so young and ends up destroying the thing that means most to Louis I won't spoil it. Which leads Louis back to the interviewer where Christian is starting to question his doubts of Louis being a vampire.Interview with the Vampire is a terrific film that is just beautifully directed and the actors are just so brilliantly charismatic it's just impossible in some ways for someone not to enjoy this movie. I know my friends who are not into horror films ended up loving this one because of it's interesting story. It's just a great film that I think everyone should get the chance to see.1010".

The casting for this movie is pure inspired genius although Cruise did cause absolute uproar when he got the part of Lestat. Let's face it he's not portrayed as the most likable of people not to mention being a tad unhinged or even as a decent actor remember 'Legend'? but he does an amazing turn as Lestat. He's vicious villainous camp and demonically gleeful in this role. Even Anne Rice sent him a letter of apology after she saw his performance. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Louis is a fair show too he manages to maintain constant melancholy without crossing the line into whiny annoyance although his constant pouting detracts from his character somewhat you're a vampire not Zoolander!. Kirsten Dunst's Claudia is pure childlike evil. Hard to believe she was only 12 when she made this film.Having read Anne Rice's infamous 'Vampire Chronicles' a hundred times it wasn't until I saw this movie that I'd even heard of them shameful no?. Even after reading the book it was one of those rare moments when you think well the film was just as good. And to say that a LOT of the narrative was cut it retains everything about the original story that it should the atmosphere the gloom the characters it's all there. Even the gore factor is stylishly done for one the blood looks real which let's face it is one of the most important yet overlooked elements in most vampire films  in Blade they used what looks like ribena in Dracula they used red jelly and in The Lost Boys they used something resembling passata. The vampires themselves also look absolutely amazing. To quote Louis Do you find us beautiful magical? Our white skin our fierce eyes The makeup and contact lenses for once do more than just make the actors look like they've got flu.Unlike Queen Of The Damned this movie sticks to its content and gives the audience the story remaining true to it at every stage. There's no story jig no idiotic and pointless changes to plots and the whole thing is as stylish and sinister as you can get. It does justice to the book and remains a brilliant film in its own right. One to add to any filmjunkie's collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "As with Queen of the Damned so it was with this movie that I made what I thought was a rather hideous mistake in watching the movie prior to reading the book. Those fears were well based with queen of the Damned the book is utterly fantastic whereas even without having read the book the only part of the movie I liked was the soundtrack. My fears were groundless with Interview. Granted there were parts missing and parts changed but not in such a way that it detracted from the story in general. Where the book is a horror novel which almost parallels Bram Stoker's Dracula in its ability to terrify the movie is a drama which alternates between inducing laughter sorrow and in some parts nearly reducing the viewer to tears. Pitt's performance in this regard is particularly fine.However the one thing that everyone who has seen this movie cannot fail to agree on is the fact that whilst there is indeed an allstar cast notable characters are Brad Pitt Tom Cruise Antonio Banderas Christian Slater and Kirsten Dunst it is the twelve yearold Kirsten Dunst playing Claudia who steals the show. In the book she was a truly terrifying child whose alternate flashes of rage love and complete and utter lack of emotion serve to unsettle the reader to the point of wanting to close the book and calm down for a few minutes. In the movie she is a little less coldhearted and the relationship between her and Louis Pitt is bizarre seeming at times like the relationship between father and daughter and at other times like the relationship between lovers.Many viewers who have not had the pleasure of reading the book in particular the jocks criticize the movie for the homoerotic undertones which define the relationship that begins to build between Louis and Armand at times like that between a teacher and their student and at other times again like lovers. This relationship is underdeveloped in the movie and is not given the chance to blossom into the full fledged bond that Louis and Armand share for a brief period in the book.A strong performance is put in by Banderas as Armand albeit slightly different in temperament than the Armand of Rice's books. Unfortunately the role was too brief a one and Banderas did not get nearly long enough a role.Louis' progression through the years is another example of the areas in which this movie excels. Whilst he physically does not change his surroundings do and his dress sense changes with the years. This was a strong adaptation of a brilliant book which fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles should all enjoy. The main plot of the movie stays true to the book and in some places the dialogue is perfect straight from the book line for line. It has the power to disturb induce laughter sorrow and excitement and is a visual feast for the eyes. The vampires look exactly like Rice describes them except dissapointingly in the case of Armand. And even with the screwups in Armand's appearance Antonio Banderas plays him extremely well. The fact that I happen to despise Tom Cruise can only serve to add to just how good this movie must be.".

I am not inferring that creatures like this really exist  this is fiction  but if they did this probably would be the most accurate account of them because vampires are not glamorized here. In fact the film pictures the vampire existence as a lonely depressing one. At least we see that in the case of Brad Pitt's character here a vampire who needs the blood but knows it's morally wrong to kill human beings for it.The acting in this movie is excellent which includes the star of it Tom Cruise and young Kristin Dunst. The latter was a surprise hit to me as the young vampiress is there such a word? who is trapped in a little girl's body. Dunst was about 11 or 12 years old and not that wellknown at the time of this release.What I was a little uncomfortable with were a few of the bloody scenes particularly in the first third of the movie. They were too graphic and just plain disgusting at times. Also there also were definite homosexual overtones between a few of the vampires. Was this film another attempt to push that agenda? Probably but it seemed out of place in a vampire movie.Perhaps the final song of the movies sums up its contents best Sympathy For The Devil by the Rolling Stones. Hmmm.....an interesting choice for a closing song.".

His story begins in New Orleans in 1791 Louis is a wealthy plantation owner but he can't get over the loss of his wife and child a year previously. He deliberately puts himself in dangerous situations but rather than getting himself killed he meets the vampire Lestat. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire but he seems no happier and can't bring himself to feed on people instead he survives by drinking the blood of rodents something that disgusts Lestat. Eventually he feeds on the housemaid before heading to a plague infected area of New Orleans. Here he bites the young Claudia Lestat then turns her into a vampire. Louis treats her like a daughter but as the years pass she has difficulties accepting the fact that she will always be a child and eventually takes her revenge on Lestat for turning her into a vampire. Louis and Claudia then travel to the Old World looking for other vampires what they find isn't what they hoped for.Vampire films usually centre on those seeking to destroy them of their potential victims so it is interesting to see the story told from the point of view of a vampire. Brad Pitt does a fine job as the emotionally tormented Louis and Tom Cruise is impressive as he plays against type as Lestat. Young Kirsten Dunst is great as Claudia beautifully portraying the girl who is doomed to never grow up. The story is told in an interesting way and the old New Orleans setting provided plenty of atmosphere. As one would expect from a vampire film there is some bloody violence although less than one might expect. The action is important but not as important as the characters and looking at the question of what it means to be a vampire. Overall this is an impressive film that fans of the vampire genre are likely to enjoy.".

Directed by Neil Jordan has the participation of Brad Pitt Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst as a child. It received two nominations for the Oscar Best Art Direction Best Original Score.This is the film adaptation of one of the greatest horror novels of this American author and is even more appealing when we realize that she actively collaborated with the production signing the adaptation of the script. Indeed it's a great script faithful to the novel and original story. And for me this movie has another good note fully escaping the recent sex symbol vampire clich fueled by movies like Twilight this film depicts vampires as they really should be monsters with some psychological depth.The actors are excellent in their roles. The highlight goes obviously to Pitt and Cruise who were not only perfectly able to give charisma to the characters but also not ignore the importance of the psychological characteristics. Pitt took it to the extreme in his character torn between the love of his own humanity and the overwhelming desire for blood he feels. The way both actors share the scene is irresistible such as how Cruise transforms his character in evil genius of his friend.The film contains several very intense scenes with moments that can hurt some sensibilities. Nevertheless its not a very bloody movie. The atmosphere is dark sinister something largely enhanced by the cinematography dark and misty and the soundtrack worthy of a good horror movie something that this film is definitely not. The special visual and sound effects are good such as the characterization and makeup. The costumes are exceptional portraying accurately the clothes of the several historical periods portrayed throughout the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "ActorDirector George Clooney pays tribute to truth and decency amid distrust and uncertainty in the Communist witchhunts with his recreation of its greatest hero the newsman of newsmen Edward R. Murrow in Good Night and Good Luck.In the early 1950's the Communist scare and the subsequent subversion of citizens' rights was at its apex with blacklists and rampant accusations resulting in ruined lives and careers. Edward R. Murrow David Strathairn was the grand master of the news airwaves in the infantile medium of television. With his show's director Fred Friendly George Clooney and his production team he picks one obscure news item regarding an Air Force serviceman who is dismissed due to unspecified charges. Murrow and CBS essentially take on the US Air Force amid this climate of suspicion and presumed guilt. Later Murrow's team takes on Senator Joseph McCarthy by making critical comments of the senator's own words and contradictions. McCarthy retaliates with accusations of Murrow's supposed association with unAmerican groups just as the parent network CBS reels under sponsorship pressure and the unpredictable whims of network president William Paley Frank Langella. As Murrow and his own staff come under tense scrutiny by McCarthy and even CBS public reaction and the response of the print media come to the forefront.Nothing can compare to the words that were written and spoken with such conviction and honesty as those uttered by Murrow.

One wonders what TV veterans like Sidney Lumet or Robert Altman could have brought to the table.Murrow's show was kind of a precursor to the current granddaddy of all prime time news shows 60 Minutes. It was interesting to see that his was not a perfect career having to mix fluffy showbiz interviews with such personalities as Liberace on his PersontoPerson show with legitimate news reports. At 93 minutes the film surprisingly seems a bit short. You almost feel like this is a big budget episode of the famous You Are There reenactment shows. The story ends almost abruptly as it begins being bookended by a formal event honoring Murrow in 1958.A couple of things don't quite work in the film. The characters of Joe and Shirley must come to terms with the network's policy forbidding marriage among its coworkers but this subplot doesn't significantly serve to move the story forward. Clooney shows a workmanlike approach to directing the film but it just doesn't grab you as emotionally as you would like. You sit there entranced by the history but are never fully given to the pathos of its characters. Instead the film becomes almost a quasidocumentary bereft of much feeling.As previous films have dealt with the Red Scare and blacklists this film compares favorably with The Front and the great television movie Fear on Trial. Although the Soviet Union was a major threat to the United States during the Cold War the accusatory enemy from within was perhaps as great a menace. The implications and parallels to today's political climate and the role television has in shaping perception are clearly the point Clooney and gang are trying to make. Murrow's formal speech which begins and ends the film's story is itself a prophetic and sobering commentary and indictment of the possibilities of television and foreshadows the future with amazing prescience. It shows that one man made a difference. Such is the testament to a heroic reporter whose integrity this film manages to capture albeit in a brief history lesson.".

	onyx:emotionText "ActorDirector George Clooney pays tribute to truth and decency amid distrust and uncertainty in the Communist witchhunts with his recreation of its greatest hero the newsman of newsmen Edward R. Murrow in Good Night and Good Luck.In the early 1950's the Communist scare and the subsequent subversion of citizens' rights was at its apex with blacklists and rampant accusations resulting in ruined lives and careers. Edward R. Murrow David Strathairn was the grand master of the news airwaves in the infantile medium of television. With his show's director Fred Friendly George Clooney and his production team he picks one obscure news item regarding an Air Force serviceman who is dismissed due to unspecified charges. Murrow and CBS essentially take on the US Air Force amid this climate of suspicion and presumed guilt. Later Murrow's team takes on Senator Joseph McCarthy by making critical comments of the senator's own words and contradictions. McCarthy retaliates with accusations of Murrow's supposed association with unAmerican groups just as the parent network CBS reels under sponsorship pressure and the unpredictable whims of network president William Paley Frank Langella. As Murrow and his own staff come under tense scrutiny by McCarthy and even CBS public reaction and the response of the print media come to the forefront.Nothing can compare to the words that were written and spoken with such conviction and honesty as those uttered by Murrow. The title of the movie is a direct quote that Murrow employed to sign off each week at the close of his interview shows. The filmmakers including director Clooney and writers Clooney and Grant Heslov were wise to let the text stand on its own.

Its presentation of McCarthy is limited strictly to the thread of the storyline and never does it waver toward namecalling or character assassination. This is particularly striking given that MCarthy was a wellseasoned alcoholic and clearly suffered from a narcissistic personality disorder. He was ripe for parody because his eccentricities were so pronounced but this film is remarkably evenhanded about the Senator's deeds and behavior. There are no allusions either to his peculiar friendship with Roy Cohn whose notorious homosexual relations with private G. David Schine eventually led to McCarthy's demented charge that the Army was infested with Communists. Some have even suggested that McCarthy was no stranger to gay trysts. All of this could have made for an explosive  and typical  Hollywood movie and would indeed have been propagandistic shallow and simpleminded.

There is so much smoke wafting around that it becomes the element in which these guys function like the water in a fish tank. Clooney didn't need to pound the point home by showing the ad for Kent cigarettes but I did get a chuckle out of it. The heady mixture of nicotine and testosterone palpably drives the news crew toward their fateful piece on Sen. Joe McCarthy which for all they know in advance may be the cliff over which their lives and careers plunge. Clooney has impressed me hugely with his ability to keep this great ensemble cast including himself not as the star on pace. I avoided his Confessions of a Dangerous Mind having had my fill of that Gong Show guy back in the Seventies but I look forward to his future directorial efforts. D. Strathairn is quietly masterful as Edward R. Murrow I look forward to being disappointed when the Academy snubs him for an Oscar nomination. The comparison between the anticommunism crusade then and the antiterrorism crusade now is merely made available to be observed not trumpeted to the heavens. The line Dissent is not disloyalty sums it up pithily.Given what Night does so well it seems almost churlish on my part to mention some things it doesn't do and probably couldn't have done without disrupting it's artistic confines. I personally would have liked a sense of how the Red scare permeated the populace as a whole I would recommend Cedric Belfrage's book The American Inquisition which includes annual fever charts detailing that in 1953 the town of Moscow Idaho demanded that the capital of the Soviet Union change it's name or when citizens in Wisconsin were asked What is a Communist responses included A crook I suppose or A person who wants war. In 1954 a woman legally changed her name from Allred to Allgood and a high school in Idaho expunged the word comrade from the school song. Sound a little silly? Does anyone remember freedom fries recently? It also would've been a big mouthful to chew if Night had made the point that Tailgunner Joe was essentially a figurehead. He himself had little interest in communism until it became a ticket to fame he got most of his headlinegrabbing tidbits from the American Reichsfuehrer J. Edgar Hoover McCarthy was a frequent guest in Hoover's private box at the local racetrack and he was tolerated by General Eisenhower until he went too far and denounced the army as pinko. Night mentions several real persons whose names were besmirched but not Major Irving Peress the pink dentist whose family received threatening letters and phone calls and rocks thrown through their windows. Night just barely hints at the antiSemitic undercurrent of the phobia culminating in the public burning of the Rosenbergs for giving away the Bomb based on evidence that would get laughed out of most courts today. After McCarthy was allowed to twist in the wind and drink himself to death Hoover continued his policestate activities with other allies but we never heard about any of this until Watergate. Read The Boss by Athan Theoharis and John S. Cox for the whole sordid story.By all means see Night which deserves a ton of credit for getting people thinking about this again if nothing else. By the way beware of revisionists like Ann Coulter claiming that McCarthy was validated by the Venona Project the secret program to intercept and decode Soviet diplomatic telegrams. Only a fraction of the cables were decrypted some only partly and their meaning is still debated by scholars. The Soviets apparently did have two sources within the Manhattan Project Quantum and Pers who are still unidentified. To assert like Coulter that hundreds of agents of an enemy foreign power were working for the U.S. government is the kind of logical leap much favored by the Far Right .never mind where that lands.I wish that Night had ended with a brief text mentioning that Murrow a true American hero died of lung cancer thus completing the cigarette motif. I'm sure he would have ruefully allowed that there too the fault lies not within our stars but within ourselves".

Whether these points are right or wrong in the minds of the contributors most seem to disregard the film on that criteria alone.In fact Good Night and Good Luck shows a time in the American past that served as the model in the way television introduced the format in which the news was going to be shown to the country using the emerging technology to keep people informed. As such CBS under William Paley's leadership amassed a lot of talent and it became the yardstick in which other news programs were going to be judged against.

Most of it occurring in the CBS studios in New York during the fifties. The crisp black and white cinematography by Robert Elswit gives the movie a nostalgic look to the way things were done in those days. Mr. Clooney has inserted scenes where a black jazz singer interprets some standard songs as though it might have been the next program following the actual news hour and act as a buffer in the events being presented.At the center of the story is Edward R.

His take on Murrow's mannerisms and the way he spoke to his audience in front of the camera is captured with great detail. Mr. Strathairn gives a good performance but one never really knows much about the man in the way the screen play has been written.

	schema:headline " Strathairn and documentary footage produce a winner";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was a real treat with Strathairn's deadon performance as legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow a sure bet for at least an Oscar nomination. Perhaps the best decision by writerdirector George Clooney was to cast no one in the role of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Instead Clooney uses actual footage of McCarthy in the HUAC hearings and press conferences. Movies based on actual historical events often sensationalize events but the extensive use of documentary footage brings home the reality of this movie's story line.In addition to Strathairn's best performance to date the entire cast delivers from Clooney himself as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly to Frank Langella as CBS chairman William Paley to Ray Wise as the insecure anchorman Don Hollenbeck. If there is a weak point in the cast it is Jeff Daniels who was given little to do in the role of news director Sig Mickelson and did little with it.As most people today are acquainted with the 1950s through blackandwhite images the decision to film in blackandwhite also feels appropriate and helps the documentary footage to blend in seamlessly with the filmed actors. The only real failing of the movie is the lack of real drama. Throughout Murrow and the gang are seen to have the upper hand although they sweat about the potential consequences of every action. The slice of history the ideas presented concerning the proper role of news media and the terrific performances all more than make up for this however and I strongly recommend this film to those who lived through the McCarthy era and to those such as myself who only have witnessed it in the rear view mirror.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was a real treat with Strathairn's deadon performance as legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow a sure bet for at least an Oscar nomination. Perhaps the best decision by writerdirector George Clooney was to cast no one in the role of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Instead Clooney uses actual footage of McCarthy in the HUAC hearings and press conferences. Movies based on actual historical events often sensationalize events but the extensive use of documentary footage brings home the reality of this movie's story line.In addition to Strathairn's best performance to date the entire cast delivers from Clooney himself as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly to Frank Langella as CBS chairman William Paley to Ray Wise as the insecure anchorman Don Hollenbeck.

As a previous poster said by concentrating on what was actually presented Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts rather than the tragicomic personalities involved.

He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast using the actual record to tell the story.There are minor but significant embellishments mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck who was one of the cocreators of You Are There a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being there when he didn't really want to be.What really enhances the show is the black and white photography actually according to the notes it was The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set then colorcorrected in post  whatever that means.

His performance has the complexities mannerisms and subtleties that you would expect from Murrow. His performance does for Murrow for what Adrien Brody did for Wladyslaw Spilzman you truly do believe him. Count on a Oscar nomination.George Clooney's direction writing and acting are all very strong this side of Roberto Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful'. Clooney may direct himself to his first Oscar.Another revelation in this movie is Frank Langella who plays Bill Paley the head of CBS. He backs Murrow and Friendly to the end but also tells them the cold hard truth . He tries so hard not to jeopardize the both of them.All that being said this may be the underdog movie at this year's Academy Awards. Strathairn and Clooney both give outstanding performances but this year their competition is stiff. Straithairn going after Philip Seymour Hoffman for his performance in ' Capote ' and Clooney going after Peter Sarsgaard for his performance in 'jarhead'.A very good film and worth the 90 minutes of your time.".

Otherwise it is nothing but wires and lights in a box. Thus spoke Edward R. Murrow somewhat a legend of broadcast journalism. Better than average but less than legendary is Good Night and Good Luck a new film about Murrow's historic confrontation with Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The timely themes of the film will not go unnoticed by even mildly aware viewers and though the film is certainly competent that it perhaps its greatest contribution.The films opens with Murrow David Strathairn giving a speech to the Radio Television News Directors Association. His speech encapsulates much of the problems of that television had then and still has now. The film shares the beginning of the speech at the beginning of the film and ends with the end of the speech. In between are scenes of the decision making that led to See it Now's confronting of McCarthy and McCarthyism. Other journalists had been poking at McCarthy for some time and Fred Friendly Clooney and Murrow found an opportunity to do an excellent piece on television that would add their names to the growing ranks of dissenters. The first shot fired was on Oct. 20 1953 when See it Now broadcast the story of Air Force reservist Milo Radulovich. He was discharged from the service after his father and sister were labeled as communist sympathizers. Ending the program with the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father even though that iniquity be proved beyond all doubt which in this case it was not Murrow and Friendly had for the first time taken their personal misgivings about McCarthyism public. This confrontation and subsequent ones missed a vital point that the film misses as well. In a free society what's wrong with being a communist if you want to? Instead of labeling all kinds of people as communists incorrectly what if McCarthy had been 100 correct? Clooney does not investigate what the problem would have been about having competent professionals who are communist in government or private industry position. One can only imagine the laughter that would loose should an agitator for a singlepayer health system be labeled a subversive Canadian agent. Being a docudrama perhaps it would have been a bit out of place for the film to go there but it was the fundamental flaw of McCarthyist and anticommunist ideologies that communists had no place in America a purportedly free nation.Clooney does an excellent job fitting the archival footage of McCarthy and others into this film. He guides the film with a good pace but it still seems to be padded a bit. A subplot about the secret marriage of Joe  Shirley Wershba Robert Downey Jr.  Patricia Clarkson is neat enough and good for a few oneliners but there doesn't seem to be any reason for it to be in the film. It stands in contrast to the subplots of CBS' wavering support for Murrow and the pressures applied to coworker Don Hollenbeck Ray Wise about his supposedly subversive activities. The transitions between scenes are welcome each time with wonderful jazz vocalist Dianne Reeves performing old time pieces in the CBS sound studio. The strength of the performances by Strathairn Clooney and especially Frank Langella as CBS head William Paley help keep the flaws of the film fairly well hidden.Though perhaps mildly overstating the importance of Murrow's influence on the downfall of McCarthy Good Night and Good Luck does a good job of elucidating the atmosphere of paranoia that pervaded many parts of the country at the time. It makes a strong and enjoyable contribution to the body of work involving the Red Scare but in the opinion of this reviewer it still misses an important point. After seeing it if you're taking public transportation home be sure to listen for the recordings that ask you to look out for suspicious activity around you. Then the real strength of the film will be even more evident.".

The very root of filmmaking seems to have been forgotten. The film we must remember is also an agent of communication. It puts forward a message. Good Night and Good Luck is such a film.As we hear David Strathairn's Edward R. Murrow speak we are reminded of the positive points of what we call television. He asks the public not to underestimate or overlook the fact that television has a potential to inform and educate. Good Night and Good Luck is basically a political drama playing out an event that took place in the early 1950's in the Columbia Broadcasting System. The war of words between CBS' broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and Republican U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. It is more of a docudrama with actual footages and dialogue from the happenings.Directed by George Clooney who also stars in the film Good Night and Good Luck is completely in black and white. It is exceptionally stylized. The repeated shots of Strathairn holding his cigarette the light reflecting off his welloiled hair and his chiseled expressionless face the glare he gives the viewers at the end of each broadcast is the very point of the film. There is no added material here no extra ingredients to spice up the events and modernize it no effort to make it more appealing except for giving it the actual look and feel of the 50's. Almost the entire film is inside the CBS newsroom or its adjacent offices. The music that occasionally plays in the background is more often than not a part of the diagesis perhaps a jazz recording or a broadcast in an adjacent room.Then there is Edward Strathairn's performance. Flawless. His acting more than anything else takes us into understanding and realizing the consequences of the events that are taking place. The calm yet ruthless nature of him the clarity with which he speaks in the broadcasts is perfect. The supporting cast is also top notch with the likes of Frank Langella Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson. Frank Langella is exceptionally brilliant in the sequence in his office with Clooney and Strathairn.At ninety minutes the acting and the stylization make the film a visual treat. It is however suggested that one be informed of the events that the film portrays beforehand. It is the mere representation of an event without any explanation any commentary any justification whatsoever. The film never tries to be something it cannot. It is not meant to be an entertaining actionpacked film. It's action lies in the play of dialogue between characters and the facts that the conversations eventually reveal. It is man against man. One trying to bring out the truth about the other. It is a debate. It is a fiery battle of words between two men. It is about one man who dared to tell the truth and went to all ends to bring it out into the open. Good Night and Good Luck is a detailed and accurate account of the feud between broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.Dare.".

Good Night and Good Luck is a detailed and accurate account of the feud between broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.Dare.";

Yet underneath the facade of a We Like Ike complacency propagated a myriad of ideological and cultural dilemmas!! Segregation signified a rudimentary lack of tolerance for another individual regardless of his race color or creed!!

The most disturbing aspect to this convoluted logic otherwise known as Communist trepidation via McCarthyism was not that some extremist was expounding about the enemy of Communism being ubiquitous!! ..More to the point this unwarranted paranoia had a strong American market to support it!! What the film Good Night and Good Luck focused on was the fact that television was not just about watching Superman and Steve Allen but also it served as a vehicle for dissecting the truth ..Now enters Edward R. Murrow !! A newscaster who cogently believed that television was not just tubes and wiring which provided an onslaught of innocuous entertainment more significantly it should act as a bevy of information to expose facts to the American public! Countering an issue brought on the potential for depicting lies and distortions about the issue... In this case...McCarthyism!! The small screen communication known as television which was nationwide negated the long enjoyed sovereignty for the hegemony of America's revered institutions..in this film namely the Air Force!! Television had interpretive reporting to contradict facts issued by military intelligence this in essence nullified their impunity and carte blanche disposition!!!! McCarthyism was destructive dogma which motivated Edward R. Murrow's professional integrity... Two sides of an issue brought on a liberal view!! Not liberal in the pejorative sense whereby it manifests itself through patterns of irresponsible behavior but liberal in the context as a euphemism for intellectual diversification!! This movie was incredibly substantiated by remarkable directing paramount acting performances and camera angles which made the cold war motif of this film extremely authentic!! In 1954 television became a tertiary source of information today it is a primary source of information..This is largely due to the fact that less than 12 of Americans read newspapers!! I recommend to anyone who recognizes that on occasion we encounter milestones in our perception of what reality means in the United States that they see this film....Ultimately Edward R. Murrow became the calculated guinea pig for the faulted America...His philosophy of making the distinction between disloyalty and dissent reaffirmed this nation's understanding of our constitutional right of freedom of speech.. Murrow's succinct tenet of how the truth is the truth whether it is heard half way across the world or at the other end of the bar inevitably prevailed as the television industry's accountability for standards and practices!! Edward R Murrow died a very fortunate man as he accomplished something most of us do not his obituary had an added codicil to it that he made a difference in this world... Such a feat is commensurate with the accomplishments such as having a lot of people who love and respect you or the gratifying reward of raising a child properly!! The inadvertent cultural and social conflicts that television besieged the American people with let the proverbial horse out of the barn hence television would change America forever!! George Clooney the director of this film who has had a fabulous acting career sought perhaps a vehement empathy for Edward R. Murrow in his quest to set an occupational precedent!! A producer of the film Steven Soderbergh who also produced Sex Lies and Videotape A fantastic film possesses a knack for delving into the domicile for the disconcerting this makes him very effective in his ability for articulating realism!!

So he structures his projects in ways that are well serviced by what he has to give. The last one was an actor playing a character who created a character within. The structure of the thing was all focused on building and exploiting those ambiguities. Especially clever were the staging devices. Many were novel and a few were particularly striking.Now this is a more serious but has the same values. It is after all a character study and one that deals with these same two worlds. The man when off the camera and the man on. Fabricated truth as an act by politicians. Journalism as way of piercing through those layers.Two evils McCarthy and Paley. Clooney's point is that control over the pipeline is what matters in delivering the real. So he works with some very studied staging. This movie has some of the best staging in recent memory. It must have taken forever to set the angles and lighting. Fortunately these are so powerful that no scene needs more than two setups. This is the way this cinematographer works for PT Andersen too.The switch in lighting from when Murrow is on the air to just after he goes off is rather thrilling both are intense in fact the onair lighting is stark. But there is a powerful and visible shift from external to internal energy.If you just saw the script as words on a page it would seem boring and preachy. It is the staging that makes this thing come alive that gives a container for the great acting. The only actor who seems off is McCarthy which is telling.I have the book Clooney's dad wrote about movies.

	schema:reviewBody "An American citizen working abroad I watched a preview screening of Good Night and Good Luck in early December 2005 in Melbourne. David Straitharn Murrow was on hand to introduce the film and he commented that journalists in the U.S. covet the Edward R. Murrow Award. Having won one myself I had to suppress an Arnold Horshacklike desire to jump up and seek acknowledgment.Born five years after the See It Now that became the flash point for the decline and fall of Joseph McCarthy I always felt uncomfortable in a lifetime of hindsight watching conventional wise men excoriate the junior Senator from Wisconsin. Yes his rapacious lust to seize on America's postwar postBerlin Airlift postnukes paranoia was unforgivable.But while McCarthy was reckless with his grabbed power I often wondered if the backlash against The Red Scare wasn't itself tinged with counter abuse.Fearing this would be another case of a good point made badly see Fahrenheit 911 I was pleasantly surprised to find Good Night and Good Luck to be evenhanded even paying some lip service to my lifelong concerns.It wasn't so much the quiet understated confidence of Murrow in this film that sold me on the fact Clooney provided an untilted platform. It was more the balance offered by the characterization of Paley who fortunately was not portrayed as the rightwing bad guy. Nor was he fairytaled into some crusader either as the whydon'ttheymakeexecutiveslikethatanymore liberals would have us believe.For this Clooney deserves a great deal of credit. Yes the long unwieldy stretch of HUAC testimony made the second half of the film a bit ponderous. But that's a quibbling point against a foundation of overwhelming cinematic excellence.The '50s were never more beautiful than this film. The longgone mood of unabated scotch and cigarettes the anachronistic antinepotism policy at CBS the heavy woolen clothing the horrible eye wear the great jazz  the forgotten art of how to light a film for black and white. It's all there  and a wonderful tribute to the son of an oldschool broadcaster like Nick Clooney.A little spoilage though from Down Under. As I sat in the nearly full cinema on a Monday night the crowd  mostly in their 20s60s  giggled at the oddest places. The quaint Kent commercial. The occasional goget'em dialog. The news anchoring tragic and his endorsement of Murrow's broadcast. Giggles. Very offputting almost disrespectful to a time goneby.It was almost as if they were saying Yeah we know better and we were born that way. Glad to know somebody got to skip the '50s in order to get to the 21st century.".

	schema:headline " Astonishing!";
	schema:reviewBody "Good Night and Good Luck is a singularly gripping powerful movie about the epic battle between a blustery Redobsessed senator and a resolved veteran newsman. Photographed in stark black and white and infused with a real 1950s feel George Clooney's sharp homage to one of the greatest journalists America's ever known is utterly captivating and discomfiting.Edward R. Murrow David Strathairn was one of the biggest stars in CBS News as the host of Person to Person and See It NoW. When he gets wind of a soldier who's been fired from the Air Force for a tenuous Communist connection Murrow springs into action choosing to use Senator Joseph P. McCarthy's own words and actions against him rather than attacking the man.What Murrow did was nothing short of astonishing. This was the mid1950s. The press genuflected to royalty i.e. politicos much more than exercised genuine critical analysis of it. What's more McCarthy's fellow senators did little to prevent the man from running roughshod over the rights of those suspecting of being cardcarrying Communists. With no press to question him and no colleagues to rein him in McCarthy had carte blanche to root out the evildoin' Reds from all facets of American life.The stand that Murrow took  putting the reputations of himself producer Fred Friendly Clooney and the CBS network on the line  took an incalculable amount of courage. One misstep by Murrow and his team and his career would be over. As it turned out his undoing of McCarthy was also his own undoing but that was less his fault than the fault of CBS chief William Paley.More than fifty years have passed since Murrow won by decision over McCarthy the senator was censured by his colleagues which allowed him to remain in the Senate but severely diminished his influence but the events that take place in this film resonate deeply today. Indeed it is not unimaginable to see a politician like McCarthy run amok in a avaricious grab for power and prestige. The passage of time however allows us to reflect perhaps a bit more objectively to examine the fight for the civil rights of every man woman and child in the United States. How far have we come in the ensuing halfcentury? Who are the Murrows of today?Strathairn is nothing short of remarkable. He's not an especially large man but he has such gravitas in this film that he seems to fill the screen even when he's merely sitting in the background. He is a man of many faces and expressions and every one of them seems to ring perfectly true. Strathairn has knocked around Hollywood for more than a quarter century earning scores of accolades from his peers and the media but he's never been a leading man in a such a widely praised film. Indeed he's the kind of actor who disappears into roles who is a superb character actor adding color and depth to every role he touches. He's been nominated for an Academy award at this writing and he stands a good chance at bringing home the statuette. It's long overdue.Strathairn is ably supported by a wellpicked cast including Robert Downey Jr. in his fortieth comeback Frank Langella as Paley and Clooney as producer Friendly. Even more beneficial though is the look and feel of the movie and the nearflawless direction by Clooney. Clooney wisely stuck to the main tetatet between Murrow and McCarthy rather than building up Murrow as a character first indeed there's little else in the movie besides the row with McCarthy. For one thing we learn virtually nothing about the personal lives of Friendly and Murrow. And that omission works very well within the structure of this film.Good Night and Good Luck is a mesmerizing glimpse at how the power of the press can be used to uphold the rights of man and a chilling snapshot at what can happen if ego and authority go unchecked.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the critically friendly 'Oscar Contenders' of 2005 Good Night and Good Luck was the one that stood out the most for me. Not because I have an interest in the plot or any confidence in the people that made it even but merely because it seemed to come out of nowhere and it's often these films that become the surprise hit of the year. With that in mind I am disappointed to say that given the task of describing this film in one word I would have to select the word 'dull'. Director and star George Clooney has done a great job of ensuring that his film looks and feels as it should we are given a convincing portrait of the USA during the 1950's and the film is always lovely to look at. However it's good points end there as there is barely any plot to speak of and the film simply feels like a timeline of events. The plot revolves around the cold war and Senator Joseph McCarthy. Two journalists reporter Edward R. Murrow and producer Fred Friendly decide to take on the senator and expose him for inspiring fear in the American people.The way that George Clooney uses archive footage instead of an actor cast in the role of the senator is a really inspired move but the inspiration stops there. We are never allowed into the heads of any of the characters. Their actions show but we are never given any motivation and this makes the film very hard to care for on an emotional level. David Strathairn fits the film in that he looks the part but like the rest of it he is never given a chance to shine. Robert Downey Jnr and Patricia Clarkson are entirely wasted in a subplot that has little point while George Clooney fails also to make any kind of impression in the acting department. To be honest I'm really surprised that this film did go down well with the critics. Good Night and Good Luck is a purely aesthetic experience and despite the fact that it looks great surely great films cannot be called such merely because of how they look. I'm sure that George Clooney thought he was making a great film here but it's missed the mark entirely. If you're really interested in the subject of this film you might get some kind of enjoyment out of it but since this film is basically a glorified documentary you'd probably be better off seeing an actual documentary. Disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cinema can be entertainment it can be art it can be a popular voice. It can be eyecandy or sometimes it can be a force for good. Modern U.S. cinema and its audiences have long been primarily regarded sometimes unfairly as entertainment only. A few Independents have stood out but works of significant art or important social comment have been largely seen as uncommercial.Leading filmmakers set out to challenge that with a company called Participant Productions. Their hypothesis was quite simple there is a mainstream audience for wellmade films that have the power to inspire on important issues. They believe in the power of media to create great social change. Good Night and Good Luck like North Country and Syriana succeeds in attracting critical and commercial success.Good Night and Good Luck is about the struggle to protect democratic freedoms. It came on general release in the UK the day after the United Nations called for the closure of Guantanamo Bay  a centre where people are detained without due process of law and for lengthy periods merely on suspicion of involvement with terrorism. It went on general release on the same day that Channel 4 Television aired a programme by Walter Wolfgang the lifelong Labour Party activist ejected from last year's Labour Party Conference for speaking out against the Foreign Secretary on Iraq  a programme showing how the British Government has gradually reduced dissent within its own ranks and that new legislation designed to prevent terrorism is being used by the police in ways that are effectively eroding our civil liberties. Footage included peaceful protesters who had been stopped under the Terrorism Act including an elderly man held in Brighton for wearing an antiBlair tshirt and the 11yearold girl stopped and searched while participating in a peace march.Good Night and Good Luck is set in the 'McCarthy' era of American history one of the blackest periods for U.S. civil liberties when the merest hint that a person sympathised with 'communists' was enough to lose them their job. The Junior Senator Joseph McCarthy used people's fear of the communists who were making real and frightening advances in Korea Eastern Europe and China to round up people with witchhunt hysteria. Disagreeing with McCarthy was tantamount to being a 'dangerous communist' and could mean blacklisting for oneself and one's family or even imprisonment without proper trial. It took a long time for people to speak out. Broadcaster Edward Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly was one of those who lead the charge using their own money when CBS and television sponsors refused to publicise their programme. The public was overwhelmingly supportive. Emboldened televised Senate investigations led to McCarthy's downfall even as he attacked Murrow.In only George Clooney's second experiment in the director's chair he has scored both a palpable hit of a movie and also dug his feet in for integrity in filmmaking  both in content and style. Parallels between the McCarthy indictmentwithoutevidence and the U.S. detentionwithouttrial of Guantanamo Bay or the UK's powersofdetention under the Terrorism Act are exceedingly and intentionally plain. If we sacrifice the freedoms that are the bedrock of what we claim to be protecting whether it be from Communism or Terrorism then the struggle ceases to lose much of its meaning. What makes Good Night Good Luck so powerful however is that it leaves viewers to make the connection themselves by the careful telling of history rather than the dubious rantings of left wing softies. The evils of McCarthyism are no longer disputed by many  nor was Murrow's patriotism ever in any doubt  he had a magnificent track record of upholding the liberties of which America is so proud so the film stands first and foremost as a patriotic clarion call to freedom. Neither does it embroider  the only scenes of McCarthy used are archive footage just as when Murrow attacked him he only used actual footage of the Senator speaking. Murrow claimed that Americans were not only able to be strong militarily but they were able to be strong in robust debate. This movie 50 years later is a tribute to that robust debate.Stylistically the use of black and white throughout reminds us of the magic of that medium especially on modern high quality 35mm film. The 50's are lovingly recreated from the deep jazz soundtrack with Dianne Reeves and Rosemary Clooney's band the handwritten prompts for announcers in TV's early days to the less acceptable today world of ubiquitous cigarette smoke and a maledominated business world. The mannerisms haircuts dress and even the way the film is edited all persuade us that we are watching a film made closer to that era and miraculously brought to us with digital sound and wide aspect ratio. Admittedly the shots of McCarthy and the Senate are of noticeable poorer quality and with poorer makeup but the real and symbolic importance of using original footage outweigh the slight visual inconsistency. Clooney has not only directed admirably but has excelled himself in coproducing a taut script as well as delivering an excellent performance as Fred Friendly. David Strathairn as Ed Murrow establishes himself as an actor of major strength the indelible picture of Murrow he projects is one of towering humanity moral probity belief in self and a courageous judgement free of bias  an icon for any reporter to hold high.In the USA today we see vigorous debate and the rule of law replaced by religious conviction and secret knowledge. In the UK rigorously scrutinised laws and debate within Cabinet and political parties has been replaced by a mass of hasty legislation authoritarian politics. Safeguards in the political systems of both countries have failed. It was against such moral vacuity that the broadcast media defeated McCarthy and returned common sense and democracy to America. Films such as Good Night Good Luck can be seen as a small step in a similar direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wellacted across the board I loved the Patricia ClarksonRobert Downey combo so much that I kind of wish they had their own movie. Stylish and effective cinematography the darting to and fro the perpetual smoke the use of shadow and silhouette. All very well done. And the overall message of the film that the media and the American public need to wake the beep up and pay attention is one that I heartily commend.Part of my problem with the film stems from the fact that I am a history student with a keen interest in the time period. And Clooney does nothing to place his story in historical context. He's just taking pieces of a story and expecting the audience to fill in the rest. Like the loyalty oath piece. It really has nothing to do with the rest of the film. It is not explored further in any other scene. It is not really debated. Just one scene designed to get the audience to recoil and say wasn't that horrible? Then it's not mentioned again. No reference to Stalin...hell no reference to the Cold War the atomic bomb the Korean War or even any aspect of the Red Scare other than McCarthy. There's one line about Alger Hiss near the end but it provides little context or explication. The film makes it seem like McCarthy was a oneman wrecking crew instead of a particularly ruthless and ambitious politician taking advantage of a fear that was already widespread and deeply penetrating.And loyalty oaths still exist by the way and the truth is that for the most part we accept them. I had to sign a loyalty oath to be a public schoolteacher.As for the idea that Clooney is trying to make commentary about how society has changed in the past 50 years I agree that such is his intent. In this regard he is clearly inspired by Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven which his company produced and which he vigorously promoted. But Haynes does it much more elegantly. He shows his characters confounding their stereotypical roles Clooney merely reinforces them. I wanted to see Patricia Clarkson's character do something other than fetch newspapers. I wanted to see a black character do something other than belt out jazz tunes that lay out the plot like something in an old musical. Otherwise their presence smacks of tokenism of the worst kind of liberal condescension. Also Haynes' film is a fiction commenting on the fictional representations and actual reality of a bygone era. Clooney's is at least in its central scenes practically a documentary. Having subplots whose primary purpose is smug contemporary commentary detracts from the versimilitude.The scene near the end in the office between Langella and Strathairn is the thematic lynchpin of the film. However this is where I think Clooney most clearly falls short. It seems to me that they address Murrow's earlier complicity in the Red Scare reAlger Hiss surreptitiously by burying it in a set of defensive comments that are presented like a bunch of excuses for the network's moral cowardice. It's scripted in such a way that Murrow does not have to respond. As for the idea that corporations run the media for profit and that the nightly news is more distraction than edification ...well that was a bold statement when Network came out 30 years ago not so much now anything more than stating the obvious. I wanted more from this.I almost feel like Clooney was torn between making a documentary and making something truly scathing in the Network vein. As documentary the film is brought down by its lack of context which is a shame because Strathairn's line readings are chillingly good. As social commentary the film simply doesn't say anything particularly perceptive and at times it comes across as liberal bourgeois moralizing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good Night and Good Luck is an uplifting confrontation between longtime news journalist Edward Murrow and the infamous Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy who once accused Mr Murrow of being a Communist in 1950's America. The script was penned by George Clooney which is apropos since Clooney was a journalism student in University and was cowritten by Grant Heslov. The movie provides a plethora of archives that would make this movie almost documentary like rather than a political drama. In addition to that Clooney also directed and performed here as well. The movie begins with Murrow David Strathairn being honoured at a dinner ceremony which then quickly shifts gears to a heated battle with Senator McCarthy. Murrow defends himself with a CBS executive based on a news story about an Air Force officer being dishonourably discharged after McCarthy claimed he was secret spy. And from there the heat takes off from there. There are tow other worthy subplots one that involves the marriage of two CBS employees and a news anchorman on the brink of suicide.There is no doubt that George Clooney is one of the best performers in the world today. He's come a long way from the 80's sitcom The Fact of Life to the hospital drama ER to the big screen. Edward R. Murrow was an iconic journalist in his time and became a public figure back in World War II when he was doing broadcasts in London during the air raids.The movie itself is a gripping and and upbeat political drama that leaves no stone unturned. And sure we never look into Mr. Murrow's personal life but the blackandwhite images have that certain nostalgic look of what and how the news was covered in the fifties. I was expecting something a little more satirical almost to the point of being like a farce. Boy was I wrong! But I digress this movie was serious in delivery and everything looked and felt authentic. The stories and coverage being shown felt like I was on a class. The release done in blackandwhite was symbolic and yet very scintillating. Even the cigarette smoking tolerance was pretty much in the 1950's.If I was to pinpoint a weakness to Good Night and Good Luck it would have to be that it was way too short and a lot of coverage was still underdeveloped. The Red Scare fiasco could have been more further explained and more of the fear and paranoia that materialized towards the civilians during the 1950's. McCarthy didn't intentionally wanted fear and doubt on America but he surely relished it like a conductor holding his baton.This is a good film for those who are studying journalism or pursuing goals in journalism and too see the physical and metaphorical black and white of journalism in the 1950's. The script by Clooney and Heslov was truly a masterpiece that truly earned its Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Historians will love the film for its accuracy and how television news that was in its infancy operated. The dramatic and excellent dialogue make this film all the more poignant.".

But I digress this movie was serious in delivery and everything looked and felt authentic. The stories and coverage being shown felt like I was on a class. The release done in blackandwhite was symbolic and yet very scintillating. Even the cigarette smoking tolerance was pretty much in the 1950's.If I was to pinpoint a weakness to Good Night and Good Luck it would have to be that it was way too short and a lot of coverage was still underdeveloped. The Red Scare fiasco could have been more further explained and more of the fear and paranoia that materialized towards the civilians during the 1950's. McCarthy didn't intentionally wanted fear and doubt on America but he surely relished it like a conductor holding his baton.This is a good film for those who are studying journalism or pursuing goals in journalism and too see the physical and metaphorical black and white of journalism in the 1950's. The script by Clooney and Heslov was truly a masterpiece that truly earned its Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Historians will love the film for its accuracy and how television news that was in its infancy operated. The dramatic and excellent dialogue make this film all the more poignant.";

The instrument can teach it can illuminate. Yes and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is merely lights and wires in a box Good Night and Good Luck is a very intelligent film and it has some great performances as well as it focuses on real events from the 50's dealing with TV journalist Edward Murrow and his confrontation with Senator McCarthy. It is a political film and one of the best movies about television journalism as well. Murrow was one of the pioneers in journalism when TV was in diapers and he set the standard for serious and intelligent news reports. This film was nominated for Best Picture in 2006 and received five other nominations although it went home empty handed. George Clooney directed this film and cowrote it along with Grant Heslov who later directed Clooney in The Men Who Stare at Goats and received two nominations for it as well. His portrayal of the CBS studio feels so real and it is enhanced by filming it entirely in black and white. The atmosphere and set really contributed to the success of the film as did David Strathairn's performance as Murrow. Clooney manages to enlighten us as to the importance of Murrow's stand against McCarthy and warning us that sometimes patriotism disguised can be used for evil. It is not wrong to question certain acts just because we fear to be labeled unpatriotic we must learn to question things and television can be an important instrument when serious and fair journalism takes place. The problem is that most of the time it doesn't and TV just becomes an entertainment device. The same can be said for Hollywood and its movies but Good Night and Good Luck is one of those rare films that enlightens us and isn't just another popcorn flick.We all remember studying from History class about the communist scare in the 50's and hearing about Senator McCarthy's communist witch hunting tactic. Clooney directs this historical event focusing on Edward Murrow's David Strathairn confrontation with Senator McCarthy himself since newsreel footage was shown every time he appeared during his TV show on CBS. Murrow decided to expose the Senator for using the public's fear of communism and exploiting it to accuse people of being communists without having credible evidence. CBS boss William Paley Frank Langella gave Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly George Clooney liberty to attack the controversial Senator despite losing some important advertisers for it. The struggle came at a great cost for CBS and its crew. The film focuses entirely on this issue as we see glimpses of the early years of television and know now how several news shows have modeled themselves after this one. The only side story the movie has is that of the relationship between CBS reporters Joe Wershba Robert Downey Jr. and Shirley Patricia Clarkson who had to keep their marriage secret because CBS policy prohibited spouses to work together.The film works very well and it sometimes has a documentary feeling to it because of the way the movie was shot in black and white. Robert Elswit does a great job with the cinematography. David Strathairn really captures Edward Murrow's mannerism and impersonates him very well and he is one of the reasons this film works so well. George Clooney has directed a great movie focusing on an important era for television and has written a decent script along with his close friend Grant Heslov. Overall the film works really well and manages to entertain while enlightening us at the same time. Good Night and Good Luck is a rather short film barely over 90 minutes long and its title comes from Murrow's classic farewell signature after ending each show. Dianne Reeves is shown several times throughout the film singing jazz music while we see in the background several journalists smoking and drinking margaritas and I guessed it served to evoke the era. Clooney really did a great job of making the film look real and overall it has a nostalgic effect on the viewer over that time period where television was just being discovered.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

I myself just did a review of This Boy's Life which has some of the same themes as Huckleberry Finn. Hannibal Missouri of the 19th century sure had more charm than Concrete Washington of the 20th century. Yet Eddie Hodges as Huck Finn had to leave it to fulfill his destiny as surely as Leonard DiCaprio had to leave Concrete.In fact the most riveting performance in this film is Neville Brand as Huck Finn's Pap. He's as bigoted and narrowminded though more explicitly racist than Robert DeNiro in This Boy's Life. Today we would call someone like Neville Brand trailer park trash.Because the two are on screen for nearly the whole time the players essaying the parts of Huck and Jim have to be good and have good chemistry. Archie Moore who was the reigning Light Heavyweight Champion when this was made delivers a great performance as the runaway slave Jim. As does Eddie Hodges as Huck. One theme of Twain's that remains intact is Huck's growth as a human being after being thrown together with Jim who he now sees as a person instead of property. In fact MGM put together an excellent supporting cast for tyro players Eddie Hodges and Archie Moore. Tony Randall and Mickey Shaughnessy as con men King and Duke are a joy to watch.

His scene where he's talking about his deaf child is heartwrenching quite a feat for a cross over athlete. The child actor who plays Huck is very good as well. My honourable mention goes to Tony Randall and Mickey Shaughnessy who make a great comedy team as the King and the Duke. They are simply hilarious. Although many of Twain's adventures are deleted most of the better known and interesting characters and scenes are included. Many of these characters are played by Hollywood legends like Sterling Hollowaythe voice of Winnie the Pooh and Jiminy Cricket Judy Canova John Carradine Neville Brand and Buster Keaton.

It made think back to my boyhood days and honestly it made my boyhood adventures look dull. The plot hearkens back to a time when life was simple and offered more freedom to boys then today's world does. I'm not sure the movie is entirely realistic but that's quite all right with me. The acting was well done the colour quality was great for 1960 and the whole plot flowed quite smoothly. I didn't quite understand the ending which I won't spoil for you. If you like tales of boyhood adventure from an America the world will never see again you have to see Huck Finn. And it's got some of the greatest actors of the day in it as well.

He is joined by JimArchie Moore a runaway slave who wants to get to the free lands and become a free man. This movie is filled with classic supporting characters from two con men who want to rob the rich to line their own pockets to a circus owner who paints a donkey black and white to make a fake zebra. There are many classic scenesalmost too many to mention so i will name the most memorable.They include Huck and Jim finding the reason for feudingHuck dressing up as a girl to rescue a captured Jim and Huck passing off Jim as the emperor of Patagonia. This film is also filled with beauty physical and spiritual including the two friends sitting on their raft talking about sin while looking at the stars . The thing that overrides the whole movie though is the vibrant colour that brings out the beauty of the river. At the end of this film you would have to have a heart of stone not to shed a tear as the adventure comes to an end. It may have a happy ending but hey don't we all deserve a happy ending. My score has to be 1010".

Crucial character elements are either weakly represented or altogether missing from the movie. In the book Huck Finn a young boy and Jim a runaway slave travel far down the Mississippi River from their starting point in Missouri. In this movie they only get a mile or two past Illinois. The book portrays Jim as a kindhearted loving person who wants freedom for himself and his family. In this movie he is seen as a simpleton and gives the impression that the entire story is racist. Although the movie may not show it Twain was an abolitionist. In the book Huck overcomes the prejudices of his upbringing and helps Jim to become free even if Huck must go to hell for doing so.Eddie Hodges and Archie Moore performed decently in this movie from a pure entertainment point of view but neither of their characters showed the elements which Train created in them. Michael Curtiz and James Lee allowed elements of Twains book to be reorganized or left out altogether. They even created two scenes which never existed even in part in the book. If you don not mind mediocre acting by all means go ahead and watch this movie but do not think for one second that it reflects accurately the image or message which Twain created in his book.".

For example in the book Huck never becomes a cabin boy and the Kind and the Duke never try to kill Huck. These differences however kept me wondering what would happen next. The ending was unpredictable and that made the movie interesting. Mark Twain's message about the moral injustices of slavery is very prominent in the book but not so prominent in the movie. This movie however was intended for entertainment purposes. If you have read this book you will enjoy the movie. If you haven't read the book you will also enjoy the movie but keep in mind that it is nothing like the book. There has been much controversy about the portrayal of Jim and how it denigrates blacks. I do not agree. Jim is actually very smart and he has another side that he doesn't let Huck see. For example Jim knows all along that Huck's father was dead but he cared about Huck enough to not tell him. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a great movie. I recommend it to all audiences!".

Although Eddie Hodges as Huck Finn and Archie Moore as African American slave Jim are the principle characters I vote for Tony Randall as giving the stand out acting performance as con man the 'King' along with his accomplice Mickey Shaughnessy as the 'Duke'........In general I found it an entertaining experience. Neville Brand plays Huck's scary ne'er do well alcoholic father Papy who is always criticizing Huck. He even accuses Huck of murdering his mother since she died in childbirth. Jose Hutchinson plays the widow Douglas who takes Huck in being essentially an orphan. Jim slave to the widow runs away after he heard that she was planning on selling him to raise money to meet Papy's demand for not taking Huck way. Jim is also accused of probably murdering Huck in Huck's staged suggestion that he had been attacked and thrown in the river. These two runaways meet and steal a raft to float down the Mississippi.......I have several reality issues to discuss. Jim's stated goal is to float down to Cairo Illinois a free state and head north. But Hannibal  Missouri where he started from is well north of Cairo. So why couldn't he simply raft over to the Illinois side of the river and claim freedom?? 2Jim recognizes the corpse in the derelict house boat they run into as being that of Papy and refuses to allow Huck to see in that room. How did Papy's corpse wind up there? He lived in a shack. 3Why are the King and the Duke on the steamboat that picked up Huck and Jim? They were arrested by the sheriff and presumably put in jail unless they simply paid a fine for impersonating with the intent of robbing an inheritance. See it In color at YouTube".

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 1272010  7 out of 10 DirMichael Curtiz Charming adaptation of Mark Twain's novel is fun and well played for the most part. The story revolves around an upstart boy of the title who has an alcoholic father and overly religious aunt that brings him to a point of faking his own death in order to escape and debark on an adventure to New Orleans by way of the Mississippi River. He brings along a slave named Jim and they meet up with various characters with Huck always playing himself out of messes by pretending and making up stories. Eddie Hodges as Huck and Archie Moore as Jim make up a good team as the pair who really need each other. Jim was blamed for Huck's death so his goal is to escape North into Illinois so he can be a free man as well escaping the law. Huck is just avoiding his sad life in hopes for an adventure. He actually makes the adventures happen as he goes along including an escapade with a couple of crooks posing as the King of France and a Duke.

	onyx:emotionText "1st watched 1272010  7 out of 10 DirMichael Curtiz Charming adaptation of Mark Twain's novel is fun and well played for the most part. The story revolves around an upstart boy of the title who has an alcoholic father and overly religious aunt that brings him to a point of faking his own death in order to escape and debark on an adventure to New Orleans by way of the Mississippi River. He brings along a slave named Jim and they meet up with various characters with Huck always playing himself out of messes by pretending and making up stories. Eddie Hodges as Huck and Archie Moore as Jim make up a good team as the pair who really need each other. Jim was blamed for Huck's death so his goal is to escape North into Illinois so he can be a free man as well escaping the law. Huck is just avoiding his sad life in hopes for an adventure. He actually makes the adventures happen as he goes along including an escapade with a couple of crooks posing as the King of France and a Duke. Huck is a pretty smart cookie though and knows when to escape from them but they come back later in the story to try and turn Jim into the authorities for the ransom money. Tony Curtis plays the King and is supposedly the star of the movie but doesn't really add much to the movie by his performance  the real stars are the actors in the main characters already mentioned.

In fact with its beautiful photography large budget and fine music score one wonders why this really superior version of the Clemens' classic has rarely been shown on TV and then of course in a grossly mutilated version. As far as I'm aware it's not at present available on DVD either. Amazing! Episodes such as that on the deserted boat tipped at a crazy angle lapped by the green slime of the swamp and the scene on board the steamer in which Finlay Currie expounds in his delightfully resonant voice the splendor and treachery of the Mississippi are absolutely unforgettable.".

From there it is a series of events involving a steamship a circus and a couple of thieves. Families will likely enjoy its charm but the ending is sudden and unsatisfactory. Director Michael Curtiz achieved stardom with Casablanca but his family films are lacking in the screen writing department. This film along with The Adventures of Robin Hood are well made but exist more for production than writing talent. Eddie Hodges as Finn is bumped about through numerous subplots along with Archie Moore as the loyal slave Jim. Both performers are charming and rise above plot conventions. The supporting work from the likes of Tony Randall and Patty McCormack are saving graces in an otherwise lukewarm story build around useless subplots. There is much that doesn't play into a realistic set of events which results in shabby screen writing. Strong themes regarding adventure courage persistence and friendship make this worthwhile fine viewing for families. Score 7  10".

These liveaction Disney flicks don't seem to get a lot of attention nowadays but when I was a kid I was more into movies like Candleshoe than the animated Disneys.Obviously the charm of Candleshoe is the talent involved. Helen Hayes and David Niven are on hand and Jodie Foster is splendid as the American orphan who becomes part of a con man's plot to swindle Hayes's Lady St. Edmund out of a fortune that is hidden somewhere in her very own manse. Goaded by Leo McKern Foster poses as Hayes's longlost granddaughter in order to gain admittance to the mansion where she must follow up on a series of clues regarding the hidden treasure's location. Although definitely made for kids the best thing about Candleshoe is that it's just as fun watching as an adult. The plot has a certain giddy excitement to itafter all who could resist a treasure hunt in an old mansion?and David Niven's many disguises are pretty funny especially his grouchy Scottish gardener who has an amusing argument with Lady St. Edmund. The other kids in the movie are enjoyable too. What really strikes me about the film today are the two surprisingly adult scenes between Hayes and Foster. The way Hayes wins over the distant Foster is a little abbreviated but the film's denouement between the two of them at the train station is genuinely touching.".

Although definitely made for kids the best thing about Candleshoe is that it's just as fun watching as an adult. The plot has a certain giddy excitement to itafter all who could resist a treasure hunt in an old mansion?and David Niven's many disguises are pretty funny especially his grouchy Scottish gardener who has an amusing argument with Lady St. Edmund. The other kids in the movie are enjoyable too. What really strikes me about the film today are the two surprisingly adult scenes between Hayes and Foster. The way Hayes wins over the distant Foster is a little abbreviated but the film's denouement between the two of them at the train station is genuinely touching.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are so many rave reviews here by so many who cherish this film that it hardly seems necessary to add anything because everyone said it so well. But because I have always truly loved this film and have always tried to endorse it as one of Disney's finest classics I'm going to add my two cents worth. Heck I've added a review when there were over 750 reviews of a film already. I find reviewing our movies is good mental exercise for us all. Especially the ones that are near and dear to us like this film are an obligation.I have always raved 'Candleshoe'. Even when most adults thought I was crazy for heaping so much praise on such a simple children's film. I think that Helen Hayes was one of classic Disney's best stars and at the time one of their most bankable. She has all the charm sweetness and above all wholesomeness that is most appropriate for Disney family films. Any true classic Disney film buff will recognize her right along the other Disney stars like Fred MacMurray Dean Jones Don Knotts Haley Mills and of course Jodie Foster who was also one of Disney's very best and most profitable money makers. The film is almost flawless to perfection which always impresses me since anyone who knows the classic Disney live action product knows they were usually produced on a modest budget with lots of cost cutting. You can never really tell since the films always look neatly and tightly crafted. Everything clicks. Even the obligatory 'Donald Duck' slapstick ending that is trademark Disney formula doesn't taint the sweet gentleness of this film. Sure it's a little low level to see villains getting hit on the head with frying pans funny how in many ways the ending here predates John Hughes 'Home Alone' filmand just a little creepy to see small children being chased with knives and maces and things but it all works out well in the end. There is also toward the end one breathtaking moment with a train and a Helen Hayes staging a stand off.It's nice to know the film is obtaining some cult status in England. It is a funny little film. But it deserves much more than cult status amongst adults. This film should be thought of as a family classic and a true perennial. It really does deserve it for it seems to have acquired some faithful and loving fans.".

The cast is legendary...Helen Hayes David Niven Jody Foster and Leo McKern...the plot will have you on the edge of your seat and the locations are beautiful. Jody Foster is superb as the tough as nails I ain't deprived I'm delinquent. There's a difference you know Casey Brown who is swept away to England to play the part of the long lost granddaughter of Lady St Edmund of Candleshoe. Her partner in crime is Harry Bundage who has long been searching for a girl he can use to infiltrate Candleshoe the St Edmund family estate. The home was built by the notorious ancestor Joshua St Edmund a pirate who had allegedly hidden clues to a treasure that was hidden in the house. Mr Bundage's sister who was once employed at the home found the first clue in the man's long lost will which she discovered hidden in a bedpost. To the sunrise student there is treasure among books. Once Casey is accepted into the family she sets about searching for the subsequent clues to the treasure. Unfortunately she also begins to soften after learning the secrets of the 'family' The old lady is almost broke but doesn't know. The butler Priory and the orphans who she has taken in are working very hard to make money to save the house and most importantly the old lady's feelings. All of the other 'staff' are actually Priory playing the different parts in order to save money and make the old girl think she has a full staff. He even plays the part of her best friend the Colonel who comes to tea. Casey finally realizes the meaning of family and also that the treasure she's been looking for could save the home of the people she's come to love. This leads to a fantastic train race with an edge of your seat climax and a great battle scene between the orphansPriory and Harryhis thugs in order to get to the hidden treasure! This is a great family movie and my favourite of the Disney live action films. I used to watch it on the Disney Channel as a kid back when the Disney Channel was great! Because of it I even became a huge fan of Robert Gray whose Elegy Written In a Country Churchyard is used as one of the clues in the film The paths of glory lead but to the grave. So much of a fan that I begged my mother to buy me an old leatherbound Victorian copy at an auction which I treasure and always reminds me of Candleshoe! Such a lovely and memorable film! I love it so! 1010!!!!".

My many thanks to DisneyHelen HayesJodie FosterLeo McKern and all of the rest of the crew for a wonderful story and great memories. I give the movie a 10 for any parent wanting a good clean movie for their young ones and even for a young teenager to watch something other than the sexdrugs and violence that is so prevalent in today's movies.".

The orphan leaves for America but Lady St Edmond catches up with her at the railway station and makes her make Candleshoe her new home as they have grown rather close to one another.A lot of Candleshow was filmed on location in the Midlands Warwickshire with the railway scenes being filmed on the Severn Valley Railway.Now to the excellent cast a young Jodie Foster plays the orphan Casey Brown David Nivern who has four roles in this Leo McKern as the conman and Helen Hayes as Lady St Edmond.Candleshow is a mixture of drama and comedy and is Disney at its best. Great fun.Rating 3 and a half stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Candleshoe when it was new in the theater.  Disney in the 70's was a pale shadow of its former self.  Walt's death seemed to take the soul out of the company and much of the creativity.  Most of the Disney films of this era are entirely forgettable but not this one.  Jodie Foster turns in a fine performance and proves she can keep up with masters like David Niven Helen Hayes and Leo McKern.I was eleven when this movie came out.  I was a sucker for movies about hidden treasure and castlesmanor houses with secret passages.  The setting was perfect and the characters were fun.  Yes most of the other child actors are rather bland but that is not unusual for these kinds of films. Thankfully the main cast makes up for it in spades.Foster is at her cynical tomboy best here.  I grew up watching her in movies and on tv in these types of roles and she always handled them well. McKern is both comical and menacing as the crook Harry Bundage.  Helen Hayes is the kindly grandmother who is far stronger than she lets on.  David Niven gives one of his better performances of this era as Priory the Butler.  He gets to indulge in a bit of character acting as he assumes his many disguises.Unfortunately the bulk of children's films produced today are forgettable fluff often vulgar with little to redeem them.  At least Robert Rodriguez is trying to make films in the spirit of old Disney.I find it curious that Disney has seemingly abandoned many of their live films to other distributors.  They seem to want to be remembered only for the films produced when Walt was around and not all of those.  Still some us enjoyed those films even if Walt Disney or Michael Eisner weren't involved.I still enjoy this film as an adult.  It brings nostalgia for my youth and the dreams I had.  It also makes a pleasant departure from a much darker world.  If you have kids forget Air Bud.  Show them this.".
