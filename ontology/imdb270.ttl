I'm not sure of the reasons myself but this movie has remained at the top of my Favorite Movies list since I first saw it in 1969.  Maybe it was the outofcharacter role of McQueen.  Maybe it was the excellence of his supporting cast that includes Mitch Vogel Rupert Crosse and Will Geer. Maybe it was the direction by Mark Rydell.  Or maybe it was the outstanding score by John Williams which has remained my favorite movie score of all time. Most likely it is a combination of all the above. All I can say is that this movie has never lost its appeal for me.  Watching the movie is like visiting an old friend with whom the passage of time will only strengthen the bonds of affection.  This movie may not be for everybody but I recommend it on the chance that you may be smitten by its special charm.".

It's true that McQueen may have been in fact older than his character was supposed to be but his attitude and style seems to bring it off. Mitch Vogel as the young boy Lucius who is lured into stealing his grandfather's Will Geer new Winton Flyer automobile for a wild weekend in Memphis by Boone Hoggenbeck McQueen is completely believable as a kid who wants the adventure but has to be drawn into it because he respects his grandfather so much. Rupert Crosse as McQueen's other reiver thief in this caper adds an extra comic relief as the one who gets them into a real fix in Memphis. Ordinarily I hate movies with running narration but the narration in this by Burgess Meredith as the grown old Lucius remembering his exciting weekend in Memphis adds a real touch of poignancy to this tale of youth lost. Additionally Sharon Farrell as McQueen's prostitute girlfriend Clifton James as a vicious southern sheriff and Juano Hernandez as a kindly old black farmer add real dimension to the film. Throw in a beautiful score by John Williams his first film score and you've got the makings of a warm charming story accurately drawn from the turn of the century. The scene at the film's end where the grandfather has a hearttoheart talk with the boy is wonderful and very authentic.  The director Mark Rydell did a terrific job. I've seen this movie many times and it never fails to entertain me.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie holds a special significance to me as it was one of my late father's favorites. It's a William Faulkner comingofage story about a boy named Lucius Mitch Vogel in early 1900s Mississippi. Lucius looks up to Boon Steve McQueen the immature handyman on his grandfather's plantation. Boon convinces Lucius to help him borrow the grandfather's brand new car and drive to Memphis to see Boon's prostitute girlfriend Sharon Farrell. Tagging along for the ride is Lucius' older cousin Ned Rupert Crosse who's almost as irresponsible as Boon. Once in Memphis a lot of things happen and they wind up needing to win a horse race to get the grandfather's car back.McQueen is good in a role a little outside of his wheelhouse. Vogel Farrell and Crosse are all good as well. Will Geer plays the grandpa. Lighthearted but with some serious moments. In many ways it plays like a Disney film of the period except with whores and people using the Nword. William Faulkner is probably my favorite Southern author but his work hasn't been considered easy to translate to screen. This is one of the better efforts.".

The John Williams score is superb. The acting is wonderful from all the leads including the boy. This is one of the underrated Steve McQueen's best roles and Will Geer is perfect in the small but rich part of Boss. The characters are all wonderfully and richly fleshed out and there are many moments of human insight. To top it off the cinematography makes the movie simply gorgeous to look at. Considering the movie's manifold virtues it's interesting to note that one never sees it on any of the cable channels. The reason is obvious and it's political correctness. The movie uses the n word multiple times although always in the same way Mark Twain used it i.e. to demonstrate the inhumanity behind the use of the word. Also Corrie has her eye blackened by Boone and Ned explains to Lucius what better sign can a woman want from a man that he has her on his mind. All this racism and sexual violence is of course abhorrent but the forces of political correctness would rather pretend that it never existed than to look it square in the eye.So to see this movie you'll have to buy it on DVD which I strongly urge you to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite Steve McQueen film has to be The Reivers. He was so right for the part of Boon Hogganbeck handyman and general all around troublemaker he should have been considered for an Oscar nomination. It's definitely by far his funniest film.The Reivers is a posthumously published novel by William Faulkner and it's set in the Mississippi in the turn of the last century. The protagonist is a child Mitch Vogel a most properly brought up child and grandson to the big kahuna in that delta county Will Geer. Geer is a man who believes in progress in fact he's brought the first automobile into his area a brand new yellow Winton Flyer. That car proves way too much temptation for McQueen who'd like to use it to go courting his girl friend a hooker who works in Michael Constantine's and Ruth White's Memphis bordello Sharon Farrell. But to hatch his scheme McQueen entices Vogel to tell some well placed lies about which relative the young man might be staying with and then taking Vogel and the car to Memphis after McQueen's been left in his charge. Stowing away in the Winton Flyer is Rupert Crosse.Crosse who did get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor is a mixed racial cousin of Geer's family and it does entitle him to some perks in the racist society that was early 20th century Mississippi. But Crosse is as smart and resourceful as McQueen and knows how to play up to people and make the racism work his way. Unfortunately Crosse lost his Oscar bid to Gig Young for They Shoot Horses Don't They. And sad to say Crosse died a few years later at too young an age very much like star Steve McQueen.It's one rollicking ride our intrepid trio is on from the bordello to a horse race where Crosse swaps Geer's new automobile for a race horse that he discovers runs like lightning with a trick gimmick. Laughs mixed with some serious Faulkner social commentary.One person who does not credit enough in this film is Sharon Farrell. Her role as McQueen's girlfriend is tender and touching and in the end she actually becomes an honest woman. But a great deal of the enjoyment of The Reivers is in how that is accomplished.For any fan of Steve McQueen The Reivers is an absolute must. And I guarantee you one will become a fan of Steve McQueen after seeing this fascinating tender funny film.".

It's based on a William Faulkner story his last I believe and may be slightly autobiographical. I always saw this movie on television in the 70s  80s and didn't realize so much of the film was cut and watered down for TV. The video VHS or DVD is much more complete and has more uncensored dialogue as well as including excised TV scenes such as when the trio arrives at the 'bordello' and Lucius is introduced. While the movie takes on a Disney or Hallmark heritage type of look it is not that. It is much more mature with spicy dialogue as mentioned and mature scenes that round out a longer running time. One thing I noticed is that this movie hails from 1969 when certain sexual situations were now being allowed in American productions. This movie reflects this change while being basically family fare it 'just' escaped an R rating presumably as the MPAA system was still new and unfamiliar with how to rate certain subject matter. If this movie had been made just four or five years before it no doubt would have captured the rural early 20th century innocence familiar to Faulkner but the sexual situations which make the story more believable wouldn't have been included. Alas this is a great movie to have in your collection to take out and view when you're lonely and want something to look at or if it's raining outside. 12 stars and it deserves to be much more well known than it is.".

The cinematography the magnificent score by John Williams flawless acting and of course Faulkner's story create an atmosphere that few movies achieve.  In terms of acting McQueen is probably the weakest link but he still deserves points for successfully suppressing his characteristic squint and openmouthed grimace  and he is as close to lovable as he can be.  The movie also has more than it's share of memorable scenes especially between Will Geer as the grandfather and Vogel.I would be wary of letting young children see this film.  The story conveys the undercurrents of racism and sexism that existed then and now.  I was 12 when I saw it and I understood it.  As a parent be ready to explain some things though and preview the film.".

	schema:headline " Not Your Standard McQueen Car Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen tools around in a classy car dodging bad guys loving the ladies and not giving a cuss. This may read like your typical 1960s effort from him but that's something The Reivers ain't.What is it? I guess it can be summed up as a broad comingofage comedy set in the American South in 1905 featuring a boy named Lucius Mitch Vogel who against his better judgment sets off with a couple of olderbutnotwiser friends in his grandfather's stolen automobile to visit the wicked city of Memphis. In no time he is holed up in a local bordello trying to help win back his grandfather's car in a desperate horse race.At the center of Lucius's worries is the man who talked him into the whole adventure Boon Hoggenbeck who wants the car to impress one of the pretty Memphis prostitutes he has set his cap on. He knows no obstacles counts no costs fears no dangers Grandpa Will Geer warns young Lucius of Boon.Okay that does sound like McQueen the way Gramps put it there. But McQueen's Boon is more of an overgrown boy than stolid icon. A bucolic comingofage comedy based on a William Faulkner novel The Reivers seems McQueen's attempt at stretching out from actionhero mode. He's quite a bit of fun with his sometimes outsized comic reactions a bit old for the part but certainly a capable center in what amounts to his first ensemble piece since The Great Escape.Director Mark Rydell made lifeaffirming Americanheartland flicks that celebrate homey characters and downhome values and The Reivers certainly fits his oeuvre. He is abetted wonderfully by the sunny lenswork of Richard Moore and a graceful jaunty score by John Williams. In its elegiac seriocomic tone it is a lot like the film McQueen chose to make this over Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid.More a situation than a story The Reivers introduces us to a shifting cast of characters and lets each spend some time with the viewer. Some leave stronger marks than others.Rupert Crosse leaves the deepest impression as Lucius' distant black relative Ned who drives Boon crazy asserting his rights as a member of the McCaslin family by virtue of a greatgrandfather who impregnated a slave. Ned is a proud man who likes to push his point beyond the bounds of reason stowing away on Grandfather's car when Boon and Lucius make their Memphis trip.If I wait until I'm invited I'll never will go anywhere Ned points out when Boon tries unsuccessfully to toss him. Ned is the agent provocateur in The Reivers somewhat dangerous in his ways but valuable too played with a vulnerable humorfilled grandeur by Crosse who got an Oscar nomination for his work. You laugh more with him than at him but it's a bit of both.Where The Reivers goes a little wrong is with some of the other characters. Sharon Farrell is the proverbial prostitute with a heart of gold who bonds with Lucius while other smaller parts are filled by memorable character actors who get little to do. We were a pleasant and courteous people tending to our business Burgess Meredith explains in the voiceover narration and often they seem a bit too much of just that. Even the bad guys like a racist sheriff played by Clifton James seem a bit toothless and tooeasily handled.Still I enjoyed this film if more around the margins than in the main. It's not unusual to see McQueen wielding a pistol but it is to watch the target josh him about his lousy aim between shots. Aided especially by Crosse and Vogel The Reivers isn't maybe as wise or knowing as it tries to be but does leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling that doesn't stale with repeat viewings. A sleepy charmer it shows even a king can make for a capable jester once in a while.".

	onyx:emotionText "Steve McQueen tools around in a classy car dodging bad guys loving the ladies and not giving a cuss. This may read like your typical 1960s effort from him but that's something The Reivers ain't.What is it? I guess it can be summed up as a broad comingofage comedy set in the American South in 1905 featuring a boy named Lucius Mitch Vogel who against his better judgment sets off with a couple of olderbutnotwiser friends in his grandfather's stolen automobile to visit the wicked city of Memphis. In no time he is holed up in a local bordello trying to help win back his grandfather's car in a desperate horse race.At the center of Lucius's worries is the man who talked him into the whole adventure Boon Hoggenbeck who wants the car to impress one of the pretty Memphis prostitutes he has set his cap on. He knows no obstacles counts no costs fears no dangers Grandpa Will Geer warns young Lucius of Boon.Okay that does sound like McQueen the way Gramps put it there. But McQueen's Boon is more of an overgrown boy than stolid icon. A bucolic comingofage comedy based on a William Faulkner novel The Reivers seems McQueen's attempt at stretching out from actionhero mode. He's quite a bit of fun with his sometimes outsized comic reactions a bit old for the part but certainly a capable center in what amounts to his first ensemble piece since The Great Escape.Director Mark Rydell made lifeaffirming Americanheartland flicks that celebrate homey characters and downhome values and The Reivers certainly fits his oeuvre. He is abetted wonderfully by the sunny lenswork of Richard Moore and a graceful jaunty score by John Williams.

The basic storyline is fully represented and the amount of license taken is quite trivial. This is probably Faulkner's only attempt at a real comedy and that is what this film reproduces. Purists may disagree but I have no sympathy for them. They are the architects of their own frustrations. I would caution families however that the PG13 rating is fully warranted and I would not deem it appropriate for my own children when they were below that age. Car stealing lying to family whore mongering and gambling on horses are not good examples of conduct and although the story teaches a valid lesson about growing up I do not think that most children under 13 need to be exposed to much of it. Better that they like the 11yearold Lucius retain their innocence unless they are precocious enough to understand the consequences of such behavior which many adultage children today still are not.".

Music by John Williams and novel narration by Burgess Meredith. Superb cinematography. Fine period locations sets and costumes. Just beautifully done. Also one of Steve McQueen's best comedy films. A bumpy automobile journey by a 1905 Winton Flyer to Memphis involving a beautiful prostitute and a spellbinding horse race. Comments from the DVD cover The horse loves sardines! From a great novel by William Faulker. Most enjoyable. Worth watching and worth owning. Some drama but a lot of good humor as well. Quite respectful of the black actors. It portrays them as real honest people and not stereotypes. Not suitable at all for children under 13. See the 1st two lines of this review.

After being asked to leave several countries when they're discovered cheating at gambling they travel to America and San Francisco high society.

I intend to become a lady and there are no character references necessary for that. Garson plays her role in a very cool offhanded manner that is very effective.

This version is more romantic than its predecessors.Here Garson is a former housemaid with golddigging aspirations who falls in with Wilding the nogood brother of her last employer a wealthy English nobleman. With Garson posing as a widowed aristocrat Lady Loverly the two hop across the globe conning wealthy men at casinos before setting their sights on San Francisco society widow Marjorie Main and her oneofakind diamond necklace.That's where the Mrs. Cheyney plot starts kicking in with Garson infiltrating Main's house as a weekend guest and Wilding securing a position as Main's butler after a glowing recommendation from Lady Loverly. Over the weekend Garson meets the dashing and Hispanic Fernando Lamas whose romantic overtures annoy Wilding who's grown rather fond of his partnerincrime. All this romantic tension complicates the jewel heist scheme.While nothing substantial this movie is enjoyable as a light romance with a criminal twist. And Greer Garson's beauty outshines any shortcomings the film may have although some plot points don't seem fully developed. Having seen the two previous MGM versions of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney it's refreshing in a way to see a remake that feels like its own movie telling its own story in its own way. A charming film especially for Greer Garson devotees.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Law and the Lady is a delicious caper comedy. It's also a great spoof of upper class society and the rich. And it's a romance and love story to boot. The capers are in the form of scams and schemes to filmflam the rich. So they are crimes. But fair warning  it will be very tempting to not regard them as such in this film. In the end justice triumphs  in a most unexpected humorous and satisfying way. One knows he or she is in for a real treat from the very start. The film opens with a text that reads This story begins in London at the turn of the century 20th. If they had known what was ahead they never would have turned it. What follows is one of the funniest wittiest and most clever plots ever put on film in such an endearing story. It's a wonderful satire and hilarious spoof of royalty and high society. One normally doesn't think of Greer Garson in comedy. She acted in just a few light or comedy films. We know her mostly for some wonderful dramatic roles and movies. She had the theater persona of a dignified and proper yet warm and caring woman. Yet her film persona fits perfectly for her role as Jane Hoskins aka Lady Lovely in this film. Her costar on the other hand was an old hand at comedy as well as drama. Michael Wilding is the perfect English gentleman and gadabout Nigel Duxbury. He was born five minutes too late to be first in the family's royal line. He actually does double duty as his twin brother the Baron of Duxbury in the short film opening. Nigel is the witty disinherited man with a zest for life  just the right person to lead Jane astray. It's all very innocent well except for the scam operations and very funny. There are no slapstick pratfalls or antics. Just a brilliant script with associated demeanor and behavior. I can't think of any other film that can outwit the dialog of The Law and the Lady. The supporting cast all contribute to this superior comedycapersatireromance. There are some lengthy hilarious scenarios in the film but with little space left I'll just share a few of the short quips.Baroness But you'll get no character reference from me. Jane I'm not interested in the character baroness. I'm thinking of becoming a lady and for that no character is necessary.Jane Mr. Duxbury you are without question the most dishonest the most immoral the most unprincipled man I ever met in my life. Nigel That would sound more convincing if your hot little fist wasn't stuffed with money. But if it will make you any happier we can always give it back  your half. Jane Let's not be too hasty Mr. Duxbury. We can think more clearly when we've had a little wine.Nigel You talk like Gladstone and look like Helen of Troy. Jane You look like a duke and act like the Artful Dodger.Jane I shall find a man worth 10000 1.2 million in 2015 a year and marry him. Nigel What about love? Jane I have no objection to love as long as he still has the 10000.Jane This would be purely a working arrangement? Nigel Oh incredibly pure. Jane Then why the diamonds? Nigel Because without them you are Jane Hoskins but with them you are Lady Lovely.Jane You promised that our relationship was going to be incredibly pure. Nigel Yes now it's purely incredible.Tracy Collans played by Hayden Rorke Hoskins place me next to Lady Lovely at supper. Nigel That might be a bit of a problem sir. Collans Solve it Hoskins and I'll make it worth your while. Nigel Bribery sir? Collans Yes. Nigel I just wanted to make sure.Juan Dinas played by Fernando Lamas astride a horse Is she married? Nigel A widow sir. She was heartbroken by her husband's death  vowed to never look at another man. Juan Well I do not want her to look at another man. I want her to look at Juan Miguel ... Dinas   that's me. Nigel Well I suggest you stay where you are sir. Her ladyship could never resist an attractive horse.Juan Do you like pigs Lady Lovely? Jane I've met so few.Julia Wortin played by Marjorie Main You oughta marry again Jane. Jane You didn't. Julia At my age a good cook is more important than a husband.Jane He offered me a hundred servants a house of my own and 8000 pigs. He wants to marry me Nigel.Jane Nigel I've been thinking.

	schema:reviewBody "The Law and the Lady is an unnecessary remake of The Last of Miss Cheyney which was filmed twice before there is a Norma Shearer version and a Joan Crawford version both of which are superior. This was resident MGM queen Greer Garson's turn in the role in which she is miscast as a lady jewel thief. Although Garson was a beautiful woman and aged extremely well she is slightly too mature for the role. At 46 she is still very pretty but not effective at playing a mysterious and alluring femme fatale. As a poor woman masquerading as a lady in turn of the century San Francisco society she is just a little bit too convincing as a lady. Greer Garson was perhaps unable to portray women of the lower class. She is entirely too classy to make this character work.Furthermore this appears to be a lowbudget production tailored for a fading star rather than a brilliant one. It is shot in black and white the sets are nothing too extraordinary and it has a shotonthestudiolot feel to it which makes it seem both dated and stuffy. This story had been around a long time by 1951 and it comes to the screen as tired as one would expect.The writers apparently tried to inject some life in it through rewriting the script and changing some story elements but overall it's nothing new. It's a mediocre film with mostly mediocre performances even by the usually radiant Garson. One bright spot is Marjorie Mainshe is indeed a hoot.The Law and the Lady is however not a complete waste of time and if taken as light entertainment is a somewhat enjoyable movie for a rainy afternoon.".

Although Garson was a beautiful woman and aged extremely well she is slightly too mature for the role.

She has so much class and sophistication that it's impossible to believe she's anything less than an aristocrat from head to toe. In fact the revelation that she's really a working class girl comes as a shock of disbelief.

But the comic presence of MARJORIE MAIN as a rich tough talking widow who keeps her jewels in a wall safe saves the film from becoming static as it weaves its way through the slight story of two jewel thieves Garson and Wilding going about their business as partners in crimeuntil the law finally catches up with them.It passes the time pleasantly enough but amounts to little more than a trifle.".

Garson teams up with her employer's brotherinlaw Michael Wilding after telling him he looks like a gentleman while acting like the Artful Dodger. From there Garson who doesn't need the Pygmallion transformation like Eliza Doolittle becomes a lady with Wilding's assistance. Even more than Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady there is no doubt from the beginning that Garson is already a lady even in her servant clothes. She somewhat resembles a young Rosalind Russell more than she does her classic role of Mrs. Miniver in her shortdark wig. Garson then disguises herself as European royalty on holiday in Europe. After being kicked out of Monte Carlo when their con game is discovered Garson and Wilding head to several elaborate destinations where the same thing happens. They end up in San Francisco where their aristocratic ways fool the local wealth lead by welldressed but rough and tough Marjorie Main playing a role similar to the one played by Jessie Ralph in San Francisco. With such highsociety folks as I Dream of Jeanie's Hayden Rourke and Gilligan's Island Natalie Schaefer in Main's circle Garson's presence is soon considered to be the social event of the year. This leads to a comedy of manners with Garson fooling the general population although she definitely seems too gentile for the role. As Garson gains Main's trust she plans to steal her jewels but doesn't count on falling in love with a handsome Latin Lothario Fernando Lamas. And with Wilding breathing down Garson's neck while posing as Main's butler Garson is in great danger of being exposed. This is light comedy at MGM's most sophisticated perhaps not as polished as the two previous versions The Last of Mrs. Cheyney 1929 with Norma Shearer 1937 with Joan Crawford but still fast moving and entertaining. The conclusion however is totally preposterous and seems entirely forced.".

I was always amazed how many properties MGM found for both Lamas and Ricardo Montalban during their time at the studio that were not necessarily Hispanic per se.Unlike the other two versions The Law And The Lady give the origin of the partnership of the two society crooks. Greer is a maid accused of stealing Phyllis Stanley's earrings but her scapegrace of a brotherinlaw Michael Wilding saves her from Scotland Yard. Wilding is a twin brother younger by five minutes. The two team up and go into the fleecing and thieving business.Which brings them to Marjorie Main in San Francisco where they board and attempt to fleece. But Marjorie's also hosting Fernando Lamas whose got a distant connection to Spanish royalty. So it's a choice between Wilding Lamas the con artist life or jail if Inspector Rhys Williams of Scotland Yard ever catches up with them. Maybe some of more than one choice.This English comedy of manners is a great example of how MGM fit Lamas into nonHispanic subjects with a bit of rewriting. Wilding and Garson do their lines well I can't imagine original author Frederic Lonsdale having any objections or even someone like Oscar Wilde if he ever heard it.This version holds up well compared to the other two perhaps we'll see more remakes yet.".

I once considered her to be lovely with exotic eyes. In this role however her eyes just looked puffy. Worse her makeup accentuates her puffy eyes rather large nose and weak chin. She looked like a caricature of herself. And her hair was not the soft radiant red with which I am enamored but very dark brunette providing a stark contrast with her pale complexion and bad makeup. I could have suspended my disbelief enough to accept her as a working class woman but her appearance was simply jarring. A real pity. The story is pure contrivance the worst part being that despite the ease with which it could be done nobody except Lamas' grandmother the princess has the sense to actually check out Garson's story. I have a feeling that passing one's self off as a member of the nobility would take a little more effort and preparation than simply inventing a title and surname at a fancy restaurant.I was immobilized at home after surgery when I saw this movie.

The characters are well written which include the obligatory villains who are also on the blue rose trail and evil women who pack a deadly punch  or perhaps that should be deadly potion.I think this rates as a classic of its genre.

Steve's moviestar looks and physique didn't hurt the movie either. An inspiration for a 11 year old who made a lifetime of physical fitness as a result. I highly recommend this movie if one is willing to overlook the comparison of special effects from the time period of the early 1960s in comparison to the 2000s. Nine out of ten stars in my opinion.

If it really is as good as I remember it's a crime it hasn't been given a proper release on DVD and doesn't appear on TV more often.

	schema:headline " Mythological Tale with Magic and Laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "The Thief of Baghdad is a wonderful fantasy with plenty of battles puzzles and obstacles that you would expect in an epic adventure. Steve Reeves stars as Karim an Arabian Robin Hood who cleverly thieves his way into the royal palace charading as a prince. While he's there he falls in love with the princess who also falls in love with him.Even though forbidden love motivates the storyline The Thief of Baghdad is more like Homer's Odyssey. The film focuses more on the quest Karim must complete to prove he's worthy of Princess Amina's hand in marriage. With the help of a man in white who keeps appearing and disappearing Karim battles tree monsters Arabian sirens and much more.There's a lot of humor in the film which is probably due to the director Arther Lubin he was primarily a comedy director. There are also battle scenes along the lines of Braveheart where clever tactics are used.Overall The Thief of Baghdad is a very lighthearted fantasy. It was a childhood favorite we had an old betamax copy that we taped off the TV when I was a kid. My older brother was a huge scifi fantasy fan and introduced it to me. I hadn't seen it in over 20 years when it got brought up in a conversation with friends who play D  D. We were talking about the skeletons in the 7th Voyage of Sinbad and I remembered this curious little film from my childhood. There isn't as much animation in The Thief of Baghdad but the storyline is excellent. Steve Reeve's does all his own stunts too.I found a copy on eBay. It was totally worth the 20 I spent on it. After viewing it as an adult and showing it to someone who had never seen it before I can truly say this is a classic and people of any age can enjoy it.You can vote for The Thief of Baghdad to be reissued on DVD at the TCM site. Be sure you choose the 1961 version there are several movies with the same title but they are not the same story as the one starring Steve Reeve's. The original film was in in Italian but I'm only familiar with the Englishdubbed version. The voice acting is excellent. The Thief of Baghdad should be required viewing in dubbing school if there is such a thing.".

Reeves got his big break playing Hercules and then decided to branch out doing historical characters of all types.....two of his very best were Morgan the Pirate and The Thief of Bagdad.....both films were reportedly made in 1960 and released in 1961. For some strange reason both of those films are nearly impossible to find on DVD or video...back in the early 90s there was an ample supply of Morgan the Pirate VHS films available at the video stores and then they disappeared bought up by collectors. Thief of Bagdad was one of Reeves most enjoyable films.....beautiful technicolor photography and that haunting soundtrack at the start of the film and when Reeves was riding Pegasus the winged horse. Reeves combined with his love interest Princess Amina played by the gorgeous Georgia Moll are a treat....some might remember they also teamed up in The White Warrior.....Reeves is totally out of his element playing the rogue thief who prowls over Bagdad making a living out of thievery.....however he finds his love for Princess Amina too great and must go on a mission with several other brave men looking for a mysterious blue rose that will restore the Princess to health after a mysterious illness plagues her. Georges Chamarat plays a genie who comes and goes throughout the film and is a real delight playing an imp who admires the Thief....some good special effects for that time with trees that strangle men invisible oafs on a boardwalk flying horses and as always a beautiful queen Edy Vessel to tempt Reeves with sex and mystery. All in all people of all ages will love this film since it seems to appeal to all ages....tales of the arabian knights have been around for many years played by Sabu in the 40s and 50s but Reeves gives an upper crust presence to the Thief no other actor could give.....too bad Reeves career did not last longer than it did but he made his millions and bought a horse ranch in Montana and died in 2000.....he was the most admired bodybuilder of all time and still remains very popular to this day.".

The atmosphere usually works the story is OK but the acting is often on the hokey side except for Giorgia herself who comes across as real every time.  The main reason I watch it now is to see a lady that must have been planted in my subconscious mind at a very early age as the ideal of feminine beauty.".

When I learned the real title I found it on a classic movie channel.  Once again I was enchanted but now it's more by the lovely princess Amina than any other merits the film has.  The atmosphere usually works the story is OK but the acting is often on the hokey side except for Giorgia herself who comes across as real every time.  The main reason I watch it now is to see a lady that must have been planted in my subconscious mind at a very early age as the ideal of feminine beauty.";

	schema:reviewBody "Winners and Sinners aka Five Lucky Stars is a film that I liked better the second time I watched it. After shaken off all expectations of a Jackie and Sammo film and accepted the uneven and scattered nature of this ensemble movie I enjoyed it more. This movie was more important though when it came out then it is considered today. Jackie had a recent flop in Dragon Lord though I did enjoy the movie and Golden Harvest had been in a bit of a slump. Producer Leonard Ho got the idea from Cannonball Run which Jackie Chan and Michael Hui had parts in to create an assemblage of popular Hong Kong stars to star in this film. Winners and Sinners was a success spawning several sequels and reunited Jackie with Seven Little Fortune alums Sammo and Yuen Biao who helped with martial art choreography though his cameo as a fellow CID officer is less than a minute as a quick fight versus Jackie.The Five Lucky Stars are cons who after spending their time in jail take a straight job with a cleaning company led by Curly aka Jack So played by real life democracy advocate John Shum who was framed for instigating a crowd to do harm in a parody of his reallife exhorts. The other four are Ranks aka Larry Stanley Fung Teapot Sammo Hung who also directed this as a cat burglar Vaseline Charlie Chin a slick thief and Exhaust Pipe Richard Ng who performance was nominated as Best Actor for the Hong Kong Film Awards who is bad at thieving automobile parts. They all live with Jack's sister known as Sis Cherie Chung. Unfortunately they spend way too much time trying to get her attention leaving a lull in the early parts of the film. However there are some great gags such as Richard Ng thinking he is invisible with Wu Ma's great response to shatter his misconception  ...pretty good vision even when it comes to small objects and a blind couple playing a Rod Stewart song at a carnival.There are some great stunt and fight scenes led by 7086 Jackie Chan a bumbling CID officer who beats up wrong suspects kills his superior's turtle and accidentally throws a kid's ice cream away. When he is not destroying everything in his path he is part of an awesome stunt scene involving skates at least he learned something good from The Big Brawl though he is doubled on some of the trickier roller tricks and part of a good fight scene in a cafeteria with a little person with horrific teeth. The ouch factor is quite high in one scene where a villain gets kicked out of a window and lands on a concrete ledge than falls to the ground. I have the highest respect for these stuntmen who kill themselves for our enjoyment. This film definitely deserved the Hong Kong award for best Action Choreography.The story is mostly nonexistent until the boilerplate briefcase full of counterfeit bills makes it's appearance. It belongs to Chan Chiu James Tien always good as a cigar chomping villain who is head of a triad gang. He was going to trade it to another triad gang led by Ho Man but it got intercepted and eventually and unknowingly in the possession of the Five Lucky Stars Cleaning Company. Of course Agent 7086 wants this briefcase too.But this film was not made for the plot. It was made to be a crowd pleasing mixture of comedy and action both of which it does very well. It parodies the more serious films with scenes such as Charlie Chin and Fung Hark On doing a martial art posedown fight and the final action scene that blends comedy and stunts takes place in a warehouse which gets me thinking on how many films I have seen that have the last fight scene in a warehouse rhetorical thought of course. There are some problems with the film besides the inert beginning including he abysmal electronic soundtrack that is eerily reminiscent of Heart of Dragon's soundtrack and the misuse of Lam Ching Ying as Chan's butler Chan. Overall this is an enjoyable film that is fun to watch that showcases several outstanding Hong Kong comedians and several outstanding action performers.".

Now 'Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars' makes a whole lot more sense even though its been a few years since I've seen it. Five inmates befriend each other in prison and when they are released they form the 'Five Star Cleaning Service' only to find themselves in the middle of a Triad war.'Winners and Sinners' is much more of a Sammo Hung film than a Jackie Chan film. Sammo directed and starred in this while Jackie had a minor role as CID officer. Yuen Biao and Moon Lee even had a short cameo in a scene where Biao and Chan have a short fight. However most of action is performed by Hung and he pulls it off very well.Apart from some entertaining action 'Winners and Sinners' is one of those rather silly Hong Kong comedies that fans of Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan  especially their 80s work  should be somewhat familiar with. Some people will find it funny  I did but others might not be amused.'Winners and Sinners' is a nicelydone action  comedy maybe not for everyone though  710".

	schema:headline " Fun action comedythough weighted towards the comedyand Jackie's hardly in it!";
	schema:reviewBody "Winners and Sinners is the first of three films in which Jackie Chan 'costarred' alongside Samo Hung and five Hong Kong comedians called the Lucky Stars. Actually'costarred' is not really the wordbecause Chan's role in these films was little more than a glorified cameoespecially in this one. Chan puts in small appearances in quite a few filmsand distributors often give the impression that his role is larger in a film than it actually is.StillWinners and Sinners is quite a fun filmactually one of the first Hong Kong films set in the present day that would combine comedy and action. Chan would in time perfect the formula in later filmsand Winners and Sinners has rather more comedy than actionwhich may disappoint action fans. As is often the casemuch of the humourmainly revolving around the antics of the five 'Lucky Stars' does not really work for western audiencesthe silly slapstick usually works wellslapstick always travels wellsomething Chan had already learnt but some of it is humour that will only be understood and found funny by a Hong Kong audience. Stillthere are some laughssuch as a scene when Richard Ng easily the funniest of the Lucky Stars thinks he has become invisable and the rest of the group decide to play along with himand two very funny comedy fight sequences in which the Lucky Stars try and conceal the fact they can't fight by using silly moves and techniques.Even if there isn't a great deal of actionwhat there is is still good. Chan's two scraps are two briefbut his chase scenewhich has him rollerskate down a busy road and UNDER a moving lorryclimaxing with a car pileup involving about thirty carsis terrificwhile Samo Hung has some great fight action in the climax. It's a funbreezy romp which entertains as long as you don't expect too much. And even if you don't find it funnyyou can laugh at gaffs such as the fake grass which has creases in it!".

	onyx:emotionText "Winners and Sinners is the first of three films in which Jackie Chan 'costarred' alongside Samo Hung and five Hong Kong comedians called the Lucky Stars. Actually'costarred' is not really the wordbecause Chan's role in these films was little more than a glorified cameoespecially in this one. Chan puts in small appearances in quite a few filmsand distributors often give the impression that his role is larger in a film than it actually is.StillWinners and Sinners is quite a fun filmactually one of the first Hong Kong films set in the present day that would combine comedy and action. Chan would in time perfect the formula in later filmsand Winners and Sinners has rather more comedy than actionwhich may disappoint action fans. As is often the casemuch of the humourmainly revolving around the antics of the five 'Lucky Stars' does not really work for western audiencesthe silly slapstick usually works wellslapstick always travels wellsomething Chan had already learnt but some of it is humour that will only be understood and found funny by a Hong Kong audience. Stillthere are some laughssuch as a scene when Richard Ng easily the funniest of the Lucky Stars thinks he has become invisable and the rest of the group decide to play along with himand two very funny comedy fight sequences in which the Lucky Stars try and conceal the fact they can't fight by using silly moves and techniques.Even if there isn't a great deal of actionwhat there is is still good. Chan's two scraps are two briefbut his chase scenewhich has him rollerskate down a busy road and UNDER a moving lorryclimaxing with a car pileup involving about thirty carsis terrificwhile Samo Hung has some great fight action in the climax. It's a funbreezy romp which entertains as long as you don't expect too much. And even if you don't find it funnyyou can laugh at gaffs such as the fake grass which has creases in it!";

Every single one of them is very memorable particularly goofy 'Exhaust Pipe'. Teapot is a typical protagonist of Hung's movies but very uplifting none the less. Jackie Chan's supporting role is also great and though I probably would have preferred him in the lead he is still incredibly funny as the clumsy cop of the film.Overall the film is simply hilarious.

They just try to make their living but soon they get involved with local gangsters by taking their brief case filled with counterfeit money. What results is a mayhem of trouble and actions relating to the six of them. They find themselves in all sorts of strange situations and compromising positions but they use their ingenuity to get the best of the gangsters.It's hard to tell if this is a comedy or an action movie. Most of the actors are not action stars but regular movie actors so it's not like endless action scenes in Jackie Chan's movies.

In fact the title is misleading when packaged as a Jackie Chan film as the superstar only appears in a minor supporting role with about twenty minutes of screen time. The rest of the movie really belongs to Sammo Hung once again flexing his directing muscles and the rest of the fivestrong team of leads all of whom are given equal screen time as criminalsturnedcleaners who find themselves up against some serious muscle when they decide to rob a guy working for a local crime boss.At first I thought this film wasn't up to much and was a little disappointed by the first hour which stresses comedy over martial arts action. In fact there's only one major fight scene in a fastfood restaurant that I can think of. Instead the film slows down and takes time out to introduce the leading characters and put them through many comedic situations most leaning towards the slapstick end of the genre and appealing to the lowbrow crowd. At around the hour mark suddenly the film kicks into gear with a major chase on rollerskates no less! and then doesn't let up until the exciting finale expertly mixing laughs with thrills into another winning combination that left me smiling at the end of it all.As for Jackie Chan his main contribution is participating in the rollerskating chase where he performs some of his usual dangerous stunts jumping over cars and sliding literally between the wheels of a speeding truck to the awe of the watching viewer. The major thing that sticks in my mind about the film is this chase scene which is topnotch stuff climaxing in a slowmo car pileup packed with fantastic stunts of cars flipping and flying through the air all captured lovingly on camera.Central performances from the leads are good and mostly played for laughs understandable when the character names are 'Teapot' 'Exhaust Pipe' and 'Vaseline' in fact all of the five actors as an ensemble are excellent and have some great comedic interplay which keeps the film going through the slower moments. Sammo Hung is underused but gets some great martial arts action at the finale set in a warehouse where he takes on dozens of villains including veteran James Tien and the like. Although the film is frequently silly it's also innocent and the comedy is likable with fastpaced humour and jokes that don't outstay their welcome although the longrunning invisible situation is a goodie. Fun unserious forgettable but entertaining laughs and thrills from our Chinese friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Hong Kong movie was one of my favorites from my childhood and still remains a definite must for pure entertainment after all these years. It features an allstar cast including Sammo Hung Richard Ng John Sham Stanley Fung and Charlie Chin who star as five reformed criminals that open up a cleaning business. While on the job they are caught in the middle of a dealgonebad between rival triad gangs bent on controlling the counterfeit currency market. Soon they find themselves having to deal with these bad guys and bring them to justice.The main plot is loosely tied together and not very solid however what you get throughout the movie in addition to the main counterfeit currency plot is interesting subplots one after the other from the five friends' hilarious trip at an outdoor market to Exhaust Pipe's Richard Ng embarrassing attempt at being invisible and from CID 07's Jackie Chan pursuit of two petty thieves to the massive car pileup you would ever see on screen.It's nonstop laughs and gags from start to finish with a good helping of KungFu action especially during the wellchoreographed and funny ballroom showdown at Jack Tar's James Tien mansion and excellent acting by all the actors involved. In addition to the starring roles of the five friends and the costarring role of Jackie Chan you also get a wide range of cameo appearances from Yuen Biao Moon Lee Lam ChingYing Wu Ma and the team of stuntmen who appear on screen from Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan's team. And the beautiful Cherie Chung starring as the female lead is definitely a treat.Any fan of Hong Kong movies would appreciate the action and HK humor this movie has to offer. It's a great good guy vs. bad guy story that all would find very entertaining.Grade A".

The only problem is that the fights are few and farbetween. The fact that Yuen Biao is only on screen for a couple of minutes adds insult to injury and leaves you wanting more.Overall you might enjoy this film if you're into the kind of comedy that this film clearly aims to produce.

	schema:reviewBody "Having jumped from THE TALL TARGET to PRINCE OF PLAYERS you can now turn to this excellent film by John Ford.  It's star Warner Baxter has had a very unfair posthumous reputation.  He was the second actor to win the Academy Award for best actor for the role of the Cisco Kid in IN OLD ARIZONA 1928 and was overused in Hollywood for the next seven years.  As a result most of his movies were duds.  This and the fact that his Oscar was partly based on a fakeMexican accent downgraded a fine acting reputation.  It should be remembered that he was the first actor before Alan Ladd and Robert Redford to portray Jay Gatsby on the screen. His credits include his tragic warweary French army officer in THE ROAD TO GLORY Alan Breck Stewart in KIDNAPPED and Dr. Mudd in this film.  But most people recall him as Julian Marsh the struggling ill producer in FORTYSECOND STREET who tells Ruby Keeler YOU HAVE TO COME BACK A STAR!Historically Mudd's innocence is still up in the air  he had met Booth the previous fall and winter when Booth was going through southern Maryland studying possible escape routes.  But Mudd was a doctor and whether or not he knew Booth that April 1865 nightwas bound by the Hippocratic Oath to treat him for his broken leg.  It really was the image of a southern and proConfederate doctor treating the leg of the man who shot Lincoln that annoyed Northerners.  It is that which convicted Mudd unfair as it really is.While Ford's direction and the performances of Baxter and the cast hold the film well together Ford does get the atmosphere of hate that permeated the trial of the Conspirators  look at the sequence of witnesses Arthur Byron produces against Mudd at the trial and how Byron instructs the army officers who are under him and Secretary of War Stanton to ignore Baxter's sensible outburst Would John Wilkes Booth have intentionally broken his leg to see me?!.  John Carridine's performance is fine but what is not mentioned is that his sadism against Mudd is based on his fanatical devotion to Abraham Lincoln. There is great subtlety there. Also after Mudd beats the Yellow Fever epidemic Carridine is the first soldier to sign a petition for Mudd's release.It is not a great film but it is a fine one for all that.  Now if only a modern John Ford can do the definitive movie about that other tragedy of the conspiracy trial the judicial murder of Mary Surratt.".

	onyx:emotionText "Having jumped from THE TALL TARGET to PRINCE OF PLAYERS you can now turn to this excellent film by John Ford.  It's star Warner Baxter has had a very unfair posthumous reputation.  He was the second actor to win the Academy Award for best actor for the role of the Cisco Kid in IN OLD ARIZONA 1928 and was overused in Hollywood for the next seven years.  As a result most of his movies were duds.  This and the fact that his Oscar was partly based on a fakeMexican accent downgraded a fine acting reputation.  It should be remembered that he was the first actor before Alan Ladd and Robert Redford to portray Jay Gatsby on the screen. His credits include his tragic warweary French army officer in THE ROAD TO GLORY Alan Breck Stewart in KIDNAPPED and Dr. Mudd in this film.  But most people recall him as Julian Marsh the struggling ill producer in FORTYSECOND STREET who tells Ruby Keeler YOU HAVE TO COME BACK A STAR!Historically Mudd's innocence is still up in the air  he had met Booth the previous fall and winter when Booth was going through southern Maryland studying possible escape routes.  But Mudd was a doctor and whether or not he knew Booth that April 1865 nightwas bound by the Hippocratic Oath to treat him for his broken leg.

	schema:reviewBody "This moving story does have some actuality. One of the interesting details is some legal argument about the place of residence of doctor Mudd. The lawyers argue that if he could be transported from Shark Island the prison on Dry Tortugas to a place where normal US legislation is applied then a writ of habeas corpus could be served and he would go free. Therefore Mudd's supporters launch a failed rescue attempt to that effect. On Dry Tortugas an island off the Floridy Keys the prisoner has no chance to appeal for territorial reasons. In my understanding I am no lawyer however this pretty much reflects the Guantanamo situation of today and one just hopes that no doctor Mudds are holed up there and that all open legal questions in that context can be resolved satisfactorily.I am always amazed how outspoken movies of the great Hollywood Studios could be on political issues or social or legal injustice. This movie is an important product of this tradition. The Prisoner of Shark Island is almost an Anti Yankeemovie. The soldiers are uncouth and brutal the carpet baggers sleazy double talkers. The authorities panic after President Lincoln's assassination. Somebody anybody has to hang for the crime. And fast. One of the memorable moments of the movie has one of the military judges in charge say something like we owe it to the people clearly meaning the enraged mob in the square below. Thinking of who else claimed to fulfill the wishes of the people around 1936 this could also be an appeal to legal authorities to serve the written law and not give in to those who shout the loudest.Director John Ford certainly knew how to stir up emotions some of the pathos might be regarded as slightly overwrought by contemporary viewers. However The Prisoner of Shark Island certainly is one of the most beautiful and memorable movies of his.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film coming out at a time when the nation as a whole and Hollywood in particular tended to be sympathetic toward the South presents a onesided account of the events surrounding the Lincoln assassination of 1865. This was due to some extend by the visual impressions created by D. W. Griffith of Kentucky especially his seminal The Birth of a Nation which made heroes out of the clandestine hate organization the KKK. From a political standpoint the South had become important as a result of many powerful congressmen and senators being from that region which by now had become the stronghold of the Democratic Party The Solid South. Pecuniary matters are usually the deciding factor for Hollywood and there existed a large ticketbuying public in that part of our nation. The Civil War became The War Between the States or the War of Northern Aggression. The volatile issue of slavery was replaced with the states rights rationalization forgetting that South Carolina and the other ten Confederate slave states withdrew from the Union so their right to own chattel would not be bothered. The right to own slaves became one of the main planks in the Confederate Constitution.The Prisoner of Shark Island presents the Southern view of history. It also conveniently omits the incriminating evidence against Dr. Mudd that he knew Booth well. In fact he was the one who had introduced Booth to a leading conspirator John Surratt. After setting Booth's leg Booth did not leave the Mudd house but stayed the night and was ably assisted by Dr. Mudd. Evidence indicates that Mudd knew much more than he ever admitted about Booth and the assassination conspiracy. The murder of Lincoln occurred in the federal district of Washington D.C. not in a state hence the reason for the military tribunal. Needless to say the conduct of the trial would have been much different had it been a civilian rather than a military one. The fact that the one who pulled the trigger Booth was killed before coming to trial also muddied the water.The part of The Prisoner of Shark Island that sticks with history best is Dr. Mudd's heroic efforts to combat disease at the prison. This justifiably led to his pardon by President Andrew Johnson.The acting direction and cinematography are first rate. Written by a Southerner Nunnally Johnson the historical facts are a bit skewed but otherwise the script is a good one. If the viewer keeps an open mind this is a very entertaining picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND 20th CenturyFox 1936 subtitled Based on the Life of Samuel A. Mudd directed by John Ford with screenplay by Nunnally Johnson brings forth an obscure factbased story about one country doctor whose name has become unjustly associated with conspiracy and treason. The preface that precedes the story gives the indication as to what the movie represents ... FORWARD The years have at last removed the shadow of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd of Maryland and the nation which once condemned him now acknowledges the injustice it visited upon one of the most unselfish and courageous men in American history George L. Radcliffe United States Senator of Maryland. THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND recaptures the tragic event in American history forgotten through the passage of time. Aside from the fact that this could very well be a sequel to D.W. Griffith's biographical depiction of ABRAHAM LINCOLN United Artists 1930 with its concluding minutes depicting the assassination of Abraham Lincoln Walter Huston seated along side his wife Mary Kay Hammond by John Wilkes Booth Ian Keith while watching a play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater. What happens afterwards is never really disclosed until the release of THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND six years later. The Civil War has ended. Soldiers are seen parading home accompanied by a marching band. Abraham Lincoln Frank McGlynn Sr. comes out on his upstairs balcony and not quite up to making a speech asks the band to simply play Dixie. The reconstruction of Lincoln's assassination at Ford's Theater soon follows with Lincoln becoming the fatal victim of a bullet aimed at his head shot from the gun belonging to John Wilkes Booth Francis J. McDonald. Injuring his leg after jumping onto the stage Booth accompanied by David E. Herold Paul Fix make their escape from the theater riding on horseback into the rainy night bound for Virginia. Unable to stand the pain of his leg much longer the two fugitives from justice locate the home of a country doctor named Samuel Alexander Mudd Warner Baxter a happily married man with a beautiful wife Peggy Gloria Stuart daughter Martha Joyce Kay and his livein fatherinlaw the outspoken Colonel Turkey Dyer Claude Gillingwater Sr.. Unaware of who this injured man is true to his profession Mudd attends to the fracture of this stranger's leg before moving on. The next morning officers trace Booth's whereabouts towards Mudd's property and when one of them finds a cut up boot with Booth's name nearly smeared off Mudd is taken away from his family put to trial and charged with being part of the conspiracy to Lincoln's murder along with seven others including the captured David Herold. Wilkes fate is described through intertitles as being killed while resisting arrest in Virginia leaving eight strangely assorted people guilty as well as the innocent to face trial and an angry mob. In spite of his pleas Mudd is sentenced serve life of hard labor at Dry Tortugas a prison located on the Gulf of Mexico along the Florida Keys surrounded by maneating sharks better known as Shark Island. Once there Mudd finds his name associated with conspiracy and treason and must cope with Sergeant Rankin John Carradine an evil jailer and Lincoln sympathizer who once learning of Mudd's identity pleasures himself in abusing the doctor with punches to his jaw and forceful shoves every chance he gets.Other actors featured in this historical drama include Harry Carey as the Commandant Francis Ford as Corporal O'Toole Fred Kohler Jr. as Sergeant Cooper along with O.P. Heggie 18791936 as the prison physician Doctor McIntire and Arthur Byron 18721943 as Secretary of War Erickson each making their final screen appearances. Child actress Joyce Kay as Martha Mudd looks somewhat like a pintsize Shirley Temple with curls and all. Extremely cute her movie career became relatively shortlived.Whether the story about inhuman injustice to an innocent doctor is historically accurate or not really doesn't matter for that John Ford's direction recaptures the essence to the post Civil War era along with brutal hardships of prison life depicted on screen as America's Devil's Island. Warner Baxter gives one of his best dramatic performances of his career of the doctor condemned for following the ethics of his trade. The yellow fever sequence where Mudd who has contacted yellow fever himself shows his true dedication by working continuously in heat and rain and making all efforts possible to save those hundreds of near death prisoners. Even more dedicated is his wife Peggy wonderfully played by Gloria Stuart who like her husband stops at nothing either in this case trying to prove her husband's innocence in countless efforts in getting Sam a new trial. Right from the start viewers are very much aware of Mudd's innocence and as with many noted historical figures who have faced similar situations he finds himself punished along with the guilty with the indication that everything happens for a reason. One man's fate Lincoln becomes another man's Mudd destiny.As with the biographical sense of Samuel A. Mudd the film version to THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND is unjustly forgotten. Out of circulation on the commercial television markets since the late 1970s or beyond THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND frequently aired on the American Movie Classics cable channel until 1993 and brought back one last time in August 1999 as part of AMC's annual film preservation and tribute to director John Ford. In later years THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND has played on the Fox Movie Channel as well as Turner Classic Movies where it premiered December 10 2007. Of great interest to American history buffs THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND is the sort of Hollywoodstyle history lesson director John Ford does best. ".

Once there Mudd finds his name associated with conspiracy and treason and must cope with Sergeant Rankin John Carradine an evil jailer and Lincoln sympathizer who once learning of Mudd's identity pleasures himself in abusing the doctor with punches to his jaw and forceful shoves every chance he gets.Other actors featured in this historical drama include Harry Carey as the Commandant Francis Ford as Corporal O'Toole Fred Kohler Jr. as Sergeant Cooper along with O.P. Heggie 18791936 as the prison physician Doctor McIntire and Arthur Byron 18721943 as Secretary of War Erickson each making their final screen appearances. Child actress Joyce Kay as Martha Mudd looks somewhat like a pintsize Shirley Temple with curls and all. Extremely cute her movie career became relatively shortlived.Whether the story about inhuman injustice to an innocent doctor is historically accurate or not really doesn't matter for that John Ford's direction recaptures the essence to the post Civil War era along with brutal hardships of prison life depicted on screen as America's Devil's Island. Warner Baxter gives one of his best dramatic performances of his career of the doctor condemned for following the ethics of his trade. The yellow fever sequence where Mudd who has contacted yellow fever himself shows his true dedication by working continuously in heat and rain and making all efforts possible to save those hundreds of near death prisoners. Even more dedicated is his wife Peggy wonderfully played by Gloria Stuart who like her husband stops at nothing either in this case trying to prove her husband's innocence in countless efforts in getting Sam a new trial. Right from the start viewers are very much aware of Mudd's innocence and as with many noted historical figures who have faced similar situations he finds himself punished along with the guilty with the indication that everything happens for a reason. One man's fate Lincoln becomes another man's Mudd destiny.As with the biographical sense of Samuel A. Mudd the film version to THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND is unjustly forgotten. Out of circulation on the commercial television markets since the late 1970s or beyond THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND frequently aired on the American Movie Classics cable channel until 1993 and brought back one last time in August 1999 as part of AMC's annual film preservation and tribute to director John Ford. In later years THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND has played on the Fox Movie Channel as well as Turner Classic Movies where it premiered December 10 2007. Of great interest to American history buffs THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND is the sort of Hollywoodstyle history lesson director John Ford does best. ";

Mudd obfuscated the facts and that might just have earned him the trip to the Dry Tortugas.The Prisoner of Shark Island overlooks these details. What it does not do is overlook the complete disregard for due process. Booth his confederates in the assassination plot against top government officials and those like Mudd who got drawn into the orbit of Booth were tried by drumhead military tribunals as is shown. It's also to be remembered that we were five days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Other armies like Joe Johnston's Richard Taylor's were still in the field. Confederate elected officials like Jefferson Davis were also at large. It was by no means an easy time for the justice system. Abraham Lincoln himself had suspended habeas corpus during the war and Dr. Mudd got caught in that order.Warner Baxter and Gloria Stuart make a fine Dr. and Mrs. Mudd. Baxter articulates well the man caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare. Also note some fine performances that John Ford elicited from Claude Gillingwater as Baxter's unreconstructed rebel fatherinlaw Harry Carey Sr. as the prison commandant and John Carradine as the stockade sergeant who has a burning hatred for Mudd the man accused of complicity in Lincoln's death. Such was the public opinion of most in the north.The Prisoner of Shark Island also graphically illustrates Mudd's heroism in fighting the yellow fever epidemic in the Dry Tortugas prison. That part is completely factual and did win him a pardon in 1869 from outgoing President Andrew Johnson. That by the way is no accident. Johnson by that time had broken with the Radical Republicans and had escaped removal from office via impeachment by one vote in the Senate. The power to pardon however remains the sole property of the president and I'm sure that was Johnson's way of thumbing his nose at incoming President Ulysses S. Grant. There was no love lost between those two. We've recently seen an example of the abuse of the pardoning power with Bill Clinton's last days in the White House and I'm sure Scooter Libby will get a similar pardon from George W. Bush as he leaves office.Dr. Mudd however really earned his and if you watch The Prisoner of Shark Island I'm sure you'll agree.".

It stars Warner Baxter Gloria Stuart Harry Carey John Carradine Ernest Whitman Francis McDonald Joyce Kay Claude Gillingwater and Frank McGlynn. Music is by R.H.

Mudd Baxter is tried as a coconspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln McGlynn. Sentenced to life imprisonment at the military prison of Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas Mudd desperately tries to stay sane and fight a vicious regime in the hope of one day proving the unjust nature of his sentence. A personal favourite of Ford's it's not hard to see why given that The Prisoner of Shark Island is supreme film making. Based on the true story of Samuel Mudd there is perhaps unsurprisingly some little fudging of the facts but this in no way detracts from the truthful basis of this incredible human interest story. Time is afforded to the joy at the end of the Civil War Lincoln's weariness McGlynn classy as usual the assassination on that desperate day April 14th 1865 Mudd's family life and moral fibre and then the night he abided by his Hippocratic Oath and administered medical aid to the man who had just murdered the president. These are all delicately handled scenes by Ford who aided by Johnson's screenplay manages to hit home to us the fragile nature of the Mudd incident that is harnessed by a country grieving with anger. Once the trial arrives the film shifts to another level the delicacy of Ford's framing of characters and Johnson's rich dialogue passages are replaced by striking imagery and an impassioned performance by the wonderful Baxter. The hooded prisoners on trial for their lives and the wooden gallows outside the court chill the blood then Baxter delivers his heart tugging three pronged defence monologue that is as good a piece of acting as was given in the 30s. Sentenced passed execution off camera strikes a chord and then Mudd sits alone and forlorn in a darkened cell filtered light shards imprison Mudd and let us know that Glennon has arrived to takes us up yet another notch. What then unfolds is a superb depiction of the horrors of prison life Fort Jefferson is a dank and desperate place a place of misery for the prisoners especially for Mudd who has the patriotic but sadistic Sergeant Rankin Carradine brilliant after his blood. Ford is alive to the benefits of Carradine's nasty performance so has him lighted as malevolent and angled like a horror movie protagonist. Some of the shots during the prison sequences are clinical on impact value such as Mudd on his cell window sill or one capture as he stares down through a floor grate shadows and light showing Glennon at his best and giving us a shot fit to grace the best film noirs of the 40s. The rest is history as written the desperation of an escape attempt the yellow fever outbreak and his eventual pardon by President Andrew Johnson this would be 1869 in reality. Nicely packaged by Ford who closes the picture down by having Mudd and Buck Whitman an impressive presence throughout the picture his one time black slave and loyal friend return home to their families harmony restored after such hardships. There is inevitably some annoyance by critics and film fans alike that the black characters are racial stereotypes but this is a 1936 film depicting a story unfolding in 186567 Ford and Johnson's work here is representative of its times. And in no way to my film loving mind hurts this picture in any way. Classic cinema in its purest form from the writing table to finished product it's highly recommended viewing. 9.510".

I was surprised at how little my rating of them had changed over the years with the sole exception of The Horse Soldiers which seems to get better and better.  I think my alltime favourites will always be How Green was my Valley and The Quiet Man while time can do nothing to redeem the sheer awfulness of What Price Glory?  However what really did surprise me about one of the most uneven of the great directors was the tremendous visual flair of his films of the '30s.  True there were some potboilers such as Wee Willie Winkie and Submarine Patrol but the period contains a Western Drums Along the Mohawk that is right up there with the finest The Searchers and The Horse Soldiers The Hurricane arguably the finest disaster movie of all time and The Prisoner of Shark Island a fascinating story of wrongful imprisonment.  The latter is based on the true story of a country doctor who had the misfortune to treat the assassin of Abraham Lincoln during his flight an action that prompted his arrest and incarceration in a prison island off the Florida coast.  Anyone wishing to study action film montage at its most skilful need look no further than the first halfhour of Prisoner.  The reconstruction of the theatre assassination Booth's flight his encounter with Dr Mudd Mudd's arrest and trial are shot with a breathtaking urgency of pace.  If the last twothirds seem a little conventional beside the whirlwind opening this is partly due to the fact that the genre of prison drama with attempted escapes has become something of a cinema commonplace.  It should not cloud the issue that this comparatively early example is still one of the best.  Nevertheless the film is not without faults that largely arise from genre expectations of the period.  John Carradine hams it all the way as a prison office oozing malevolence Mudd's daughter is a Shirley Temple lookalike simperingly coy and cosy and all the darkies although thoroughly nice and obvious goodies in a troubled world are portrayed as if they hardly possess a brain between them.  Still this is the sort of tosh it is wise to overlook in order to fully appreciate films as wonderfully crafted as this.".

However it doubtful if he knew Booth had just assassinated Lincoln and was in flight from pursuing soldiers after breaking his leg while leaping from the Ford Theatre balcony onto the stage. It is now believed by many that Dr. Mudd allowed Booth to remain in his home overnight due to the strain put upon the recently set leg. The next morning Mudd went into town to get a newspaper and then discovered that Booth was wanted for Lincoln's murder. He was thus placed in the uncomfortable position of unintentionally harboring a murderer and if he had notified the police at that time he would never have been implicated in the tragedy. He unwisely chose not to do so and instead returned home to tell Booth to leave. The pusuing troops discovered that Booth had been at the Mudd home and the doctor was arrested and later tried. The movie does give a good presentation of the trial which was a travesty conducted by the military with orders from the authorities to convict and hang all those charged. Booth did luck out a bit by escaping the death penalty. Many legal experts now believe that the trial was illegal since the civilian courts were still functioning.

I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was NOT all treacle and it was easy to find myself engaged in the plot. Plus the subject matter of the movie is an enigmatic person in that NO ONE alive knows for sure what if any role he had in Licoln's death. It really got me thinking and as a result I did some researchand ultimately learned that this debate will probably never be decided! But based on excellent writing and acting I strongly recommend it.

I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was NOT all treacle and it was easy to find myself engaged in the plot. Plus the subject matter of the movie is an enigmatic person in that NO ONE alive knows for sure what if any role he had in Licoln's death. It really got me thinking and as a result I did some researchand ultimately learned that this debate will probably never be decided! But based on excellent writing and acting I strongly recommend it. Plus as a history teacher I am happy that in general the facts seem to be presented well. THAT'S a rarity for any biographical movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "I chanced upon this movie today on television and could not stop watching it until its end. I am glad I did not miss much. It is a fascinating story of the doctor who treated President Abraham Lincoln's assassinator John Wilkes Booth's broken leg. I feel that Mudd certainly knew it was Wilkes who came to his house that early morninghow could he notbut he was a doctor and thought that treating his leg was justified. Apparently the court did not and sentenced him to a life term. In any event he proved invaluable when a yellow feveryellow jack epidemic ran rampant in the prison he was confined in on the island called Dry Tortugas in the Gulf Of Mexico now a national park and monument in Florida 70 miles west of Key West. For his selflessness and bravery in aiding his fellow man and his doctoring skill he was pardoned by the President and was able to live the rest of his life as a free man and of course rejoin his family. It is debatable whether the real Samuel Mudd knew he was aiding an abetting John Wilkes I feel he did but as said was just doing his service as a physician. This is a excellent old fashioned good movie to watch and you should not miss it.".

None of the movies of this period were concerned with historical accuracy.  See They Died With Their Boots On for a good example.  This movie is worth watching because it is an excellent example of 1930s studio craftsmanship and because however subdued there are touches of Ford in it.  Mudd's fatherinlaw while tearing apart a trunk of his throwing clothes right and left comes across a bottle of booze and sets it carefully aside.  As far as the narrative goes it's fairly interesting and exciting although it isn't a landmark in the Ford ouvre as The Informer was for good or bad.Samual Mudd is an innocent Southern country doctor.  A couple of odd people show up in the middle of the night one of them Booth with a broken leg but Mudd doesn't know who they are and fixes his patient's foot before sending them on their way.  That was a big mistake.  Well two big mistakes. Mudd fixed the guy's ankle.  And Booth a handoms devil shot Lincoln and killed him while Lincoln was at that time the greatest hope the South had.  Lincoln had NEVER called the CSA the enemy.  On the contrary he sometimes referred to them as our misguided friends.  And his intention after the war was to welcome them back to the Union as if nothing had happened.  What we got instead was Tennessee Johnson and reconstruction. Lincoln could also be thought of as the last truly literate president we had and he nothing more than a rural railsplitter selfeducated.  He would never be elected President today because some press operative would dig up the fact that he'd once suffered a severe depressive episode.  That's what happened to Eagleton in 1972.  Lincoln was also considered homely which would have worked against him.  And suppose he sounded like say Truman Capote.  Doomed I would guess.Back to the film.  Poor Doctor Mudd.  My name is Mud comes from his experiences.  Roger Mudd is a descendant as Gore Vidal is a descendant of Aaron Burr.  He winds up on trial.  The most terrifying moment in the movie comes when the half dozen or so defendants are marched into the courtroom in chains and their hood are yanked off their heads.  Everybody else is hanged including a woman whose skirts were taped discreetly around her calves so that they wouldn't flare out and reveal her bloomers when she dropped on the gallows..  Mudd spared the death sentence is sent to a hell hole in Florida despised by all except his family.  There is an epidemic of yellow fever and lots of people get sick and die including the prison doctor.  Who is left to save them?  Well Doctor Mudd is.  I can't help adding at this point that doctors in 1865 didn't carry the cachet they do today.  Nobody knew what caused yellow fever.  Which brings up the question of what sort of medicine the government ship managed to get ashore during the storm.  There was no medicine.  Antiobiotics became available in the 1930s.  Aspirin is an effective antipyretic but wasn't synthesized until after the turn of the century.  It was a common belief that diseases were caused by bad air.  This is exactly how malaria translates.  If you needed a surgeon at the time you usually went to a barber who would do the necessary.  Those spinning poles of red and white signified bandages and blood.  The particular way in which Dr. Mudd solves the yellow fever problem is skipped over.  It HAD to be skipped over because he couldn't have done it.But I recommend this movie for all its historical flaws because it is a good tale in its own right and because it is a firstrate example of Ford's craftsmanship.  Also come to think of it because a lot of people may not know about this episode in our history.  And its minor allusions  Leave Behind All Hope Who Enter Here.  It's a quote from a classic in Western literature.  Can high school students identify it?  If so I give them a B plus.  Do catch it if you can.  It's not a masterpiece of filmmaking and not a landmark in Ford's ouevre.  But it's a good welltold tale.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of John Ford's more underappreciated movies is this biopic of Dr Samuel Mudd the doctor who set John Wilkes Booth's broken leg after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Dr. Mudd Warner Baxter is convicted of being a part of the assassination and sent to a Union prison on the Dry Tortugas a small group of islands off the coast of Florida. The prison island is surrounded by sharks hence the movie's title. While there he endures brutal treatment and living conditions. When the prison is stricken with an outbreak of yellow fever Dr. Mudd rises to the occasion and heroically saves lives.It's solid entertainment directed by one of the greats with a script from Nunnally Johnson and starring a fine cast. In addition to Warner Baxter who does an excellent job in the lead the cast includes Gloria Stuart Harry Carey and Claude Gillingwater. Ernest Whitman is good as Mudd's friend and his former slave!. John Carradine shines as an abusive Union guard Hiya Judas!. Ford's direction is superb as one might expect and he wrings every ounce of emotion out of each scene. While some parts of the movie are historically accurate or at least close it's inaccurate in many places. The primary example being the portrayal of Dr. Mudd as a complete innocent who knew nothing of Booth before the man showed up at his door with a broken leg. In reality Mudd was a Confederate sympathizer who had met Booth on more than one occasion. It is true there is no concrete proof that Mudd knew about the assassination plot or knew that Lincoln was dead when Booth arrived at his house but there is enough room for doubt that we still don't know the extent of his guilt or innocence to this day. But as I always say with these biopics I don't look to movies for history lessons but rather to be entertained. On that front this is very successful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released Feb 12 1936 it was The Prisoner of Shark Island where audiences became aware of the screen presence of 30 year old John Carradine here making his debut for director John Ford who cast him in ten more features over the next 28 years most memorably in The Grapes of Wrath like this film scripted by Nunnally Johnson. Starring as Dr. Samuel A. Mudd is Warner Baxter a huge star in early talkies sadly forgotten today but here perfectly cast in the role for which he may be best remembered wearing his own beard and enduring many hardships that help endear him to the audience. Yes it plays loose with the actual facts but most biopics of that era did the same particularly 1939's Jesse James again scripted by Johnson and featuring Carradine as Bob Ford. In the kind of 'weeping heroine' role she'd hoped to abandon by leaving Universal where she missed out on The Invisible Ray replaced by Frances Drake the lovely Gloria Stuart winds up being cast in the same type of part required only to 'cry harder' at the director's request at least in her opening scenes the sexy actress gets to let her hair down quite fetching. With a fine cast including Francis McDonald as John Wilkes Booth Paul Fix Ernest Whitman Arthur Byron The Mummy O. P. Heggie Bride of Frankenstein Harry Carey and the ubiquitous Francis Ford it's still the newcomer John Carradine effortlessly stealing the show. At first Sergeant Rankin seems calm and rational then meets Mudd for the first time transforming into a snarling wolf never letting up on the new prisoner repeatedly taunting him by calling him 'Judas.' John Ford captures the Satanic glint in Carradine's eye the leering sneer on his face yet doesn't allow the character to descend into clichd madness a constant threat to Mudd's attempts at liberty. And in the final scene Rankin is once more calm and rational a real human being again quite an achievement for any actor. More than anything it's the relish with which Carradine performs that made him stand out carving a lengthy and distinguished career out of playing mostly villains despite the fact that in the final analysis Sergeant Rankin was no evil bad guy only fanatical.".

He makes a surprise announcement when he asks the band to play Dixie something that was meant to be a conciliatory gesture. Lincoln's murder by John Wilkes Booth at the Ford theater brings Dr. Samuel A.

The doctor and his wife are dumbfounded when the companion of Booth gives him a fifty dollar bill for a two dollars job. They are quite taken aback but it is too late to return the money since the men had gone away. The boot that was ripped from Booth surfaces during an investigation being conducted that follows the trail followed Wilkes took to escape the police.Because of the circumstantial evidence Dr. Mudd is taken prisoner. The trial that ensues condemns the doctor to life in prison something the real conspirators did not get. His sentence is to be served in the prison at Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas off the Florida coast. The jailed Dr. Mudd finds an avowed enemy in the cruel Sgt.

He treated the material with reverence as he focuses his attention on a man that for all accounts had nothing to do with the assassination of a US president.Warner Baxter playing Dr. Mudd brought a raw intensity to the way his character needed to show. Mr. Baxter had a great role in the falsely accused doctor as he showed in the film.

	schema:headline " Not perfect but many things to admire in this John Ford film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Prisoner of Shark Island tells the story of Dr. Samuel Mudd the man who set John Wilkes Booth's broken leg following his assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. The screenplay as is to be expected from 1930's Hollywood Hollywood period I should say is not wholly factual about Mudd's story. Also unfortunately it is quite racist also to be expected from 1930's Hollywood. Still the film features some strong performances and frequently very fine direction by the great John Ford. Warner Baxter plays Mudd and this is probably the finest performance he ever gave. His wife is played by Gloria Old Rose Stuart and his daughter by a Shirley Temple lookalike named Joyce Kay who doesn't age or grow one day in the whole length of the story. Ford found room for his favorites Harry Carey Sr. and John Carradine in the portion of the film showing Mudd's imprisonment at Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas near Key West Florida. Carradine is especially memorable as a sadistic sergeant who makes the prisoner's life miserable as is O.P. Heggie as the prison doctor. The prison is a fantastic set and cinematographer Bert Glennon does some very memorable expressionistic work shooting it. Especially exciting is a tense attempted escape sequence. I also found fascinating the arrest and trial scenes of Mudd and the coconspirators of Booth. The scenes of them shackled and hooded while being railroaded to justice by a panicked military are still shocking. All in all this is one of Ford's best efforts from the 30's and it certainly made me want to know more about this interesting episode in history.".

Warner Baxter is excellent as Dr. Samuel Mudd the doctor who set John Wilkes Booth's leg after he broke it jumping from the balcony in which he shot Abraham Lincoln. Like most Hollywood films it completely ignores history. It's not generally believed that Mudd was a conspirator against Lincoln but the truth was a lot murkier than this film presents. The beginning of the film is pretty good with the assassination and Mudd's arrest and trial. Strangely enough I thought it got much less interesting when it moved to the titular island Dry Tortuga in the Florida Keys. I don't exactly know why but I lost interest during the latter half of the movie despite the wonderful presence of John Carradine at his hammiest. Love that guy. The bugeyed Negro characters are pretty annoying in this one although I thought the character of Buck a former slave of Mudd's who aids him in prison was one of the more positive characters of that type I've seen. Not that the depiction isn't fairly racist but at least he's kind of a hero.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movie audiences who think of director Ford as mostly a western filmmaker may enjoy checking out this solid midcareer film set in the postCivil War era. Based on fact but fact that is hotly disputed by two camps it depicts the tribulations of Dr. Samuel Mudd a country doctor who one night according to this film set the broken leg of a stranger and was later sentenced to prison for it. The stranger turned out to be none other than John Wilkes Booth fresh from assassinating President Abraham Lincoln. Baxter plays the doctor who finds himself caught up in a maelstrom of outrage and can't get a fair trial. He is sent to Dry Tortugas a sweltering severelyrun island prison which is surrounded by a sharkfilled moat. A former slave of his Whitman attempts to aid him in escape but it's hardly an easy accomplishment. Meanwhile Baxter's devoted wife Stuart examines every possible avenue of retrieving her husband and seeing him pardoned or at least retried. Baxter suffers mightily especially from Carradine a zealously antagonistic prison sergeant until he has a chance to redeem himself during a horrific Yellow Fever epidemic. Baxter an actor few people would be able to note as a Best Actor Oscar winner for In Old Arizona does a commendable job and a reasonably understated one considering the period. He has to carry much of the film on his shoulders and is solid throughout. Stuart hasn't got a great deal to do but she is strong as well and is benefited by several affectionate closeups. She claims to have been given virtually no direction by Ford but comes across professionally and emotionally appropriate nonetheless. Her Confederate father is played by Gillingwater in an interesting but entirely over the top performance. Gillingwater's reaction to the presence of Union soldiers in his home is preposterously handled. Rounding out the family in a detail that has no relation to the reality of the Mudd's family tree is perky and adorable little daughter Kay whose career strangely didn't go anywhere much after this. Carradine is memorably menacing and already possesses his distinctive growl of a voice at the time of filming. Fix who went on to a memorable career as a character actor appears as an accomplice to Wilkes Booth adequately played by McDonald. Though the story of Dr. Mudd as presented here and in some memorable television productions is a stirring and dramatic one there are large factions of people who believe that he was not quite the innocent lamb he is made out to be in this film. Reportedly he at least met with Wilkes Booth possibly even plotted a kidnap attempt and may have been part of the plan all along as he despised Lincoln. However as Baxter even points out in this movie a broken leg couldn't have been a planned part of any scheme! The film is best enjoyed as fiction in the same vein as The Count of Monte Cristo or even the more recent An Innocent Man rather than a piece of history. With some nice performances several striking visuals and a ripsnorting storm sequence it's easy to watch and enjoy.".

Raw sometimes painful to watch but appropriateAt no point does Ford show his hand the way he does in Fort Apache or The Searchers and so we are left wondering how much is depiction and how much is a statement of Ford's own racial attitudes. This is one of the things that makes the film such a complex textRecent period films which show blacks coming and going wherever and whenever they please display the most pernicious Political correctness. They dispense with a whole uncomfortable element of the society of the time which is being represented an element which a conservative like Ford has no problem looking squarely in the face.Expressionismmuch talk about the influence of Murnau and SunriseBut expressionism is not merely a series of positions and a stylish use of fog and shadow.Expressionism  especially German Expressionism of the period of Caligari and Nosferatu is connected to externalization of psychological states shock horror...Murnau found a deep lyricism and romanticism in his development of the expressionist vocabulary. What Ford took from this was ultimately external. The purification of his style leads him to reduce such elements to the point where in The Searchers they are not consistent parts of the mise en scene but rather colors used for underscoring heightening the deceptively natural look of the film.In Prisoner of Shark Island we are still in a Murnauish looking world. But Ford's approach to character is radically different from that which is found in Murnau. The discipline found in obeying some idea of a higher authority is always behind the action of Ford heroes. The Hippocratic Oath functions here much as the Navy or Cavalry will function in mature  period Ford. There is ambiguity in Ford characters and their will is tested. But ultimately they always choose the path that has been assigned to them. The expressionistic antihero racked by doubts and pulled ever which way by his appetites and his desires is unknown to Ford. The shadowy foggy world of German Expressionism is ultimately not appropriate to Ford's stoicism.Part of this look is Ford and part of it is a midThirties style. Even Fritz Lang's films lost a lot of their expressionist look as '30's moved to '40's moved to '50'sAs Eyman says on the commentary track this is not A John Ford Film CarradineThe only performance in this film that could come right out of Nosferatu  but equally right out of a late19th century potboiler  is that of John Carradine as the sadistic jailer. A deliriously stylized performance and one which influences our sense of the tone of the film. He sides with the artificial element of the mise  en  scene calling the ultimate agenda of the film into questionVictor Hugo hlas So said Andre Gide when asked who was the greatest French poet...It's somewhat the same feeling I have when I think of my pantheon of American filmmakers.There's a whole series of filmmakers whose aesthetic and sensibility is so much closer to mine Fuller Welles Ray and such migrs as Sirk Ulmer Lang...But the fascination with Ford has much to do with his stature. His signature is writ so large and he's able to include so many of our contradictions. Now well maybe not more than ever but at least as much as ever we need Ford. Within the mainstream of American thinking there is very very little countercultural about Ford he provides a clearheaded critique and a vision full of ambiguity. This becomes obvious only in a few films They Were Expendable Fort Apache The Searchers The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence.But I propose that The Prisoner of Shark Island is a worthy and important addition to this list.And as I said before this is not an Auteurist MasterpieceAt this point Auteurism is a fact of life. It shouldn't be necessary I hope it isn't to argue that a director has a signature. Of course what makes this difficult in terms of the establishment of hierarchy is the fact that film is such a deeply collaborative art. That the director's vision is the key and ultimate vision of a film seems debatable on a casebycase basis.".

His role as a medical doctor is certainly important but the reality is that the other two surviving defendants who had been sent to Ft.

The portrayal of blacks in this film is nothing less than disgusting  way beyond GWTW and into Birth of a Nation territory. Mudd remains a fascinating figure and watch this film  but don't be fooled into thinking it is at all historical.

	schema:reviewBody "Falsely imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND tries to maintain his dignity under vile circumstances.This is director John Ford's exciting and passionate tale of reallife Dr. Samuel Mudd who having set John Wilkes Booth's broken leg after Lincoln's assassination was swept up in the hysteria following the President's death. Convicted of conspiracy Dr. Mudd was sentenced to incarceration at Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas south of Florida a hellish mosquitoinfested prison where savage brutality was commonplace and escape attempts futile.In one of his best roles Warner Baxter gives a searing portrait as Dr. Mudd. While some of the plot situations are purely fanciful Baxter never lets the viewer forget that this is the story of a real man unfolding before us. Whether vociferously proclaiming his innocence vainly struggling to escape his hideous confinement or valiantly attempting to fight back an onslaught of yellow fever Baxter is never anything less than completely compelling.Equally fascinating is John Carradine as the sadistic prison sergeant who torments Mudd with his gimlet eye and sadistic grin Carradine sets the seal on the sinister persona he'd project for the rest of his career. The beloved silent Western cowboy star Harry Carey plays the warden of Fort Jefferson with realism  good grace. Gloria Stuart as Mudd's valiant wife and Claude Gillingwater as his fierce old fatherinlaw give firm support. Vivid character portrayals are given by O. P. Heggie as the prison's doomed doctor Francis McDonald as Booth and Paul Fix as his accomplice David Herold. A cast standout is Ernest Whitman as Buck Mudd's faithful field hand who attempts to rescue him.Movie mavens should recognize Jan Duggan  Dick Elliott as the performers on stage at Ford's Theatre and Our Gang's Matthew Stymie' Beard as the lad come to fetch the Doctor to a birthing  all uncredited.Director Ford's love of American history is plainly manifest in this frequently factual film. His reconstructions of the death of Lincoln movingly played by Frank McGlynn Sr. and the execution of the conspirators all have the look of antique illustrations. The entire film has excellent production values with the Fort Jefferson sets being particularly well conceived.The film depicts three of Booth's conspirators being executed for the murder. Actually four individuals were hung on 7 July 1865 Lewis Powell he stabbed  wounded an invalided Secretary of State Seward George A. Atzerodt he was assigned to murder Vice President Johnson David E. Herold who had accompanied Booth on his flight from Washington and Mrs. Mary Surratt she owned the boarding house where Booth met with his gang and may have been completely innocent. Two other men along with Dr. Mudd were given life sentences. The stagehand who held Booth's horse at the back of the theatre was given eight years.And what of the other three people in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre that fateful night? Already emotionally fragile Mrs. Mary Lincoln would eventually go mad and have to be placed in an asylum by her son. The Lincolns' guests were Miss Clara Harris and her fianc Major Henry R. Rathbone. They would marry but Henry would also go insane and murder Clara in a fit of rage.Dr. Mudd's health was permanently affected by his time at Fort Jefferson and although released he would die in 1883 the year of his 50th birthday.".

The entire film has excellent production values with the Fort Jefferson sets being particularly well conceived.The film depicts three of Booth's conspirators being executed for the murder. Actually four individuals were hung on 7 July 1865 Lewis Powell he stabbed  wounded an invalided Secretary of State Seward George A. Atzerodt he was assigned to murder Vice President Johnson David E. Herold who had accompanied Booth on his flight from Washington and Mrs. Mary Surratt she owned the boarding house where Booth met with his gang and may have been completely innocent. Two other men along with Dr. Mudd were given life sentences. The stagehand who held Booth's horse at the back of the theatre was given eight years.And what of the other three people in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre that fateful night? Already emotionally fragile Mrs. Mary Lincoln would eventually go mad and have to be placed in an asylum by her son. The Lincolns' guests were Miss Clara Harris and her fianc Major Henry R. Rathbone. They would marry but Henry would also go insane and murder Clara in a fit of rage.Dr. Mudd's health was permanently affected by his time at Fort Jefferson and although released he would die in 1883 the year of his 50th birthday.";

Selznick as producer and John Cromwell as director. And a superlative cast of popular stalwarts mostly from Hollywood's British colony.  Ronald Colman is his usual smooth and accomplished self in a dual role King Rupert of some fictitious country and lookalike Englishman Rudolph Rassendyll very distant cousins.  The scenes in which he faces himself onscreen  called trick photography' then  are  remarkable for the period.  Lovely Madeleine Carroll plays a princess betrothed to the king. Her equal in elegance and beauty wasn't seen on the screen again until Audrey Hepburn and Julie Andrews.  Many critics have praised Douglas Fairbanks jr as a likeable rogue.  He's very good in an easy role.  My applause goes to the two stars.  The film is a glamorous combination of romance spectacle and adventure.  Don't even dream of realism there was too much realism in ordinary life during most of the Thirties.  This is a grand escape to a time and place that never were.  If I had to pick a favorite scene in the film it would be the famous entrance of Colman and Carroll into the coronation ball.  The shot opens on the couple walking fast arm in arm directly toward us.  The camera pulls back and back and BACK until the grand staircase of the palace and the entire ballroom filled with people are revealed.  Visually and technically this single fluid shot is a stunning achievement.  It shows us the creative work that could be done at the time by hugely talented artists long before the advent of zoom lenses and computer graphics.  Elegance and class are not hallmarks of most current movies.  The Prisoner of Zenda' 1937 is a stylish and very satisfying example  a symbol perhaps  of what escapist entertainment can be.  And of what it could and should be now and then even today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ronald Colman shines in the dual role of the dissipated Crown Prince Rudolph and the simple Englishman Rudolph Rassendyl. The crown prince's predilection for the bottle recalls Colman's earlier portrayal of the dark side of Sydney Carton from A Tale of Two Cities. In contrast Rassendyll's reluctant gallantry and abiding integrity and honor epitomize the qualities for which matine idol Colman had become known during his famous film career. His scenes with the incandescent Madeleine Carroll are especially felicitous both visually and aurally. The poignant penultimate scene of the film left this reviewer with a wistful sense of regret that The Prisoner of Zenda was to be their only cinematic collaboration.Raymond Massey was never better as the ambitious Duke Michael. The expressionistic qualities of his facial contortions make his lines almost superfluous. The rakish Count Rupert played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. represents the archetypal rogue. His perennial smile abiding charm and sardonic wit make him a curious composite of Don Juan and Mephistopheles. Like Massey I have never seen the underrated son of the silent screen's most dashing hero in better form.The film's remaining actors acquit themselves more than adequately. Mary Astor is the lovely Antoinette Duke Michael's devoted yet unfairly neglected paramour. Her consistently dark raiment and shadowy movements are perhaps reflective of her lover's illegitimate origins while at the same time belying her kind heart. Visually this is contrasted with the always radiant Princess Flavia.The two royal bodyguards Colonel Zapt and Captain von Tarlenheim are a case study to my mind as to why films like The Prisoner of Zenda are consistently superior to today's mediocre fare. Although relatively lesser roles they are capable of and on more than one occasion do dominate a given scene moreover in their own way they are as fully developed as any of the principals. The abiding sense of honor and loyalty expressed by C. Aubrey Smith's Colonel Zapt is so profoundly felt and reflective of a longvanished ethos that one laughs to think of any contemporary actor making such utterances. The paradox would be striking!As for Zapt's protg Captain von Tarlenheim given the camera's fondness for the handsome young star it will come as no surprise to learn that this role was reputedly David Niven's first acting breakthrough. His gift for dry English understatement is the occasion for one especially humorous scenestealing moment that I will generously leave to the curious viewer to enjoy for himself. With such an outstanding marquee cast that lives up to its advanced billing and then some it is not difficult to understand why this film was such a rousing success when it premiered in 1937 so successful in fact that it was copied verbatim by MGM 15 years later after it purchased the rights from Selznick. With no slight intended to Stewart Granger et al. you cannot improve on perfection.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sir Anthony Hope Hawkins was a successful London barrister who got his measure of permanent fame as the author of several novels. Some were quite popular in their day like The Dolly Dialogues and The Man In The Car which bases it's central figure on Cecil Rhodes. But it is his two Ruritanian Romances The Prisoner Of Zenda and Rupert Of Hentzau that are the main novels he is recalled for especially The Prisoner Of Zenda. Set in a middle European kingdom it was for it's day in the last decades of the 19th Century an updating of the swashbuckling novels of Alexandre Dumas. Dumas had some stories set in modern Europe The Count Of Monte Cristo is set in the period of 1815  1830 and was written in 1844  1845 but most were in earlier periods such as the 16th 17th and 18th Centuries. Hope Hawkins who wrote under the name Anthony Hope figured that there was sufficient intrigue and deviltry in modern Europe to transplant the plot style to the 1870s  1890s.And there was considerable intrigue especially in Eastern Europe. In the 1880s Prince Alexander of Battenberg seemed set to become first Prince or King of Bulgaria. He had won admiration in Europe for his stunning victories over the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia in a war of 1885 the war that was the background to Shaw's ARMS AND THE MAN and was poised to get his crown when the Russian Empire balked. They thought Alexander was too proGerman and too close due to family relationships to Great Britain. So Alexander was toppled and forced to leave Bulgaria under very humiliating circumstances. Eventually Prince Ferdinand of SaxeCoburg got the Bulgarian throne.The Prisoner Of Zenda is not based on the story of Alexander of Battenberg but it shows the type of conspiracy atmosphere that pervaded the area. Basically the plot is an old one of substitutions concerning political figures. Dumas had used one in The Vicomte De Bragalone a huge multivolume novel that included The Man In The Iron Mask. One of the theories about the Iron Mask the one that Dumas usedwas that it was the twin brother of King Louis XIV. In that novel D'Artagnan has to thwart a plot to replace the Sun King with his brother  a plot that almost succeeds. Hope changed this slightly. Here the King is threatened by his ambitious halfbrother and the King's distant twin cousin replaces him to save the throne.The 1937 film version of the novel is usually considered the best of several including the 1951 version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr and a comic version with Peter Sellers and Lionel Jeffries in 1978. David Selznick was the producer this being part of his series of moviesbasedonfamousnovels that included A Tale Of Two Cities also with Colman David Copperfield with W.C.Fields and finally Gone With The Wind. His casting was top notch with Colman supported by Madeleine Carroll Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Raymond Massey Mary Astor C. Aubrey Smith and David Niven. It is an exciting and well made film and definitely worth watching.Selznick hoped to do the sequel Rupert Of Hentzau but that book is a comparative downer. Several of the main characters from the first novel are killed and one of them shows a less likable side to his personality than in the first story. He toyed with a total rewrite of the story to try to make Fairbanks a hero instead of a villain. The project never reached fruition. Probably just as well. It is rare for a successful film production to be replicated in a sequel.".

It is an exciting and well made film and definitely worth watching.Selznick hoped to do the sequel Rupert Of Hentzau but that book is a comparative downer. Several of the main characters from the first novel are killed and one of them shows a less likable side to his personality than in the first story. He toyed with a total rewrite of the story to try to make Fairbanks a hero instead of a villain. The project never reached fruition. Probably just as well. It is rare for a successful film production to be replicated in a sequel.";

	schema:headline " The best screen version of Anthony Hope's novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the at least eight film versions of Anthony Hope's famous novel this is the best. There is a fairly decent silent version starring Ramon Navarro and a flashier 1950's version with Stewart Granger but this one leads the pack as the most entertaining and the best directed. Dashing Douglas Fairbanks Jr. always in the shadow of his famous father gives the role of Rupert all he's got and that's a lot. He steals every scene he's in even from the likes of Ronald Coleman and Raymond Massey. He gives treachery and deceit not to mention opportunism new meanings in his double dealings. Few today have even heard of Junior though most movie buffs have heard of his father silent star Douglas Fairbanks and step mother for a time Mary Pickford. Senior divorced Junior's mother to marry Pickford. Junior gave other outstanding performances on the big screen especially in Gunga Din in 1939 opposite Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen. He went on to have a popular television show in the early days of that medium Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Presents. He gradually retired from films. Sadly when he passed away in the year 2000 very few knew who he was. Ronald Coleman gets to play two parts Maj. Rudolf Rassendyll and King Rudolf V two lookalike cousins from a family indiscretion several generations back. He does so admirably. Though Madeleine Carroll as Princess Flavia who loves one cousin but is tied to the other out of duty and patriotism is a hard act to follow as always Mary Astor gives her a good run for the money as Black Michael's Raymond Masseylady love. The two ladies counterbalance each other well as stand by your man women but for different reasons. The always underrated and underappreciated actor Raymond Massey makes the character of Michael come alive with jealousy and vainglory but with true love in his heart for his Antoinette. The grand old man of early cinema C. Aubrey Smith is around to make sure all is done correctly according to pomp and circumstance. David Niven in an early screen role gives his portrayal of Capt. Fritz Von Tarlenheim the easy touch almost tongue in cheek at times which lightens the heavy load for the viewers. He is a good counterbalance for the dour C. Aubrey Smith. Silent screen veteran actor Montagu Love is present to show them all how it's done. What a troupe of Thespians to savor!John Cromwell directs with flair and makes the film move at a fast pace especially near the end. The action sequence when the castle is stormed following the lowering of the draw bridge is intense. The rapier fight between Coleman and Fairbanks is still exciting to watch. The crisp black and white photography makes one forget that the film is not in color. For excitement adventure and romance by all means see the 1937 version of The Prisoner of Zenda.".

He's likable enough but from what I gather women used to swoon over him.  Is he really handsome?  If so the quality slips past my perceptive apparatus.  I do like his voice though so theatrically nasal and so hard to take seriously. Raymond Massey is Black Michael he of the monocle and the perpetual sneer. Mary Astor and Madeleine Carrol are decorative and provide the men with motives.  Outstanding though is Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Rupert of Hentzau.  It's often said that a movie is as good as its villain and that's as true here as in any other film.  He laughs he oozes charm he beats people over the head with iron pipes he stabs unarmed noblemen he seduces women he drugs kings seems to enjoy betrayal smokes too much lies as easily as the rest of us breathe and instead of fighting to the end like a man he jumps out a window and runs away or rather swims away.  He quotes poetry Oh woman in our hour of ease uncertain coy and hard to please.  When pain and anguish wring the brow a ministering angel thou. David Niven is a lighthearted friend of the hero.  C. Aubrey Smith is  well C. Aubrey Smith.Niven hadn't gotten very far in Hollywood until he landed this role which he was able to do only through the influence of Hollywood's British colony.  He began the shoot by playing the part in the breezy manner we now see on screen.  This displeased the director and the producer who wanted it dramatic but when they saw how it looked on film they were tickled pink. Both Niven and Fairbanks were to go on to meritorious service in World War II.The movie is so undemanding and so rewarding that it was remade several times twice as a spoof.  The 1950s version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr is about as good as this one only of course splashier.The climax involves a nicely done fight with sabres between Coleman and Fairbanks.  Coleman wasn't a physical actor and Fairbanks not a fencer so doubles are used extensively but without doing much damage.  And it's curious to note that this was released in the same year as The Adventures of Robin Hood and both films use some of the same conventions fighting with furniture trading wisecracks during the fight and the use of shadows swashbuckling away on the castle walls.  This despite the fact that different directors were in charge.  Hard to tell whether this is an instance of independent invention or some historical adhesion left over from one of Fairbanks' dad's early silents.And enjoyable tale not meant to be taken seriously.".

The plot is lead by Black Michael Raymond Massey who's facial features are suited for the part of a jealous villain. It is surprising however to see David Niven and Douglas Faitbanks Jr. on opposites sides but each performs superbly even if Douglas does play a heavy. The inner story is that of a King who is slated for removal by duping the populace that because the king has been killed Black Michael will assume the thrown in his absence.

	schema:headline " A true swashbuckling classic but do read the book!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1937 version of 'The Prisoner of Zenda' has been one of my favourite films for most of my life. The performances outshine those of the shotforshot 1952 colour remake while the Peter Sellers spoof deserves to be forgotten...The plot is taken from Anthony Hope's classic 1894 swashbuckling novel. Rudolf Rassendyll the younger son of a British Earl distantly related illegitimately to the ruling house of Ruritania is forced to impersonate the new King Rudolf whose double he is. There are complications conspiracies and some excellent swordplay. Rudolf has to rescue the abducted King but falls in love with the beautiful Princess to whom his lookalike is betrothed. The adventure is brought superbly to life by a terrific cast Ronald Colman as Rudolf Rassendyll and King Rudolf Madeleine Carroll as Princess Flavia Douglas Fairbanks jr. as Rupert von Hentzau Mary Astor as Antoinette de Mauban C. Aubrey Smith as Colonel Sapt and a very young David Niven as Fritz von Tarlenheim. Raymond Massey as Duke Michael is perhaps less happily cast see comments below but he does well in a role which is even in the novel too thinly written for his plotfunction.I love this film  it is one of the classics of its genre and I can only regret that the same team wasn't reunited to make the more tragic sequel 'Rupert of Hentzau'. The most obvious gaffe I've spotted is the list of stations painted on the door of the train. As Hopereaders know Ruritania is not in the Balkans but is a Germanspeaking state between Saxony and the presentday Czech Republic the nearest major raillink in the real world is Dresden therefore the Orient Express is not the best way to get there! Otherwise the environment of the book is effectively realised. Oddly the film sets the action in 1897 after the novel's publication 1894 whereas the sequel 'Rupert of Hentzau' implies that the events described are a few years in the past  probably c. 1876 for 'The Prisoner of Zenda'.However I just want to raise a few more points which I hope will encourage viewers to sample the book too. Enjoyable as the film is it is not a completely faithful adaptation in some places the film works as well as the novel but in others it loses depth. Both are worthwhile on their own terms. There are one or two spoilers in here.In the novel it is very clear that this is a story of young people and some of the casting in terms of age affects the dynamics of the relationships. While it doesn't matter too drastically that the 2 Rudolfs are here 40something not the 2930 of the book the script has altered the relationship between King Rudolf and his halfbrother Michael. In the film Michael is older but it is implied illegitimate. In the novel he is younger probably mid20s and legitimate although by a morganatic marriage he is popular with the common people not much in evidence in the film and the sequel confirms one's suspicions that he could not have been any worse a King than Rudolf. Perhaps the story needs a somewhat more ironic and cynical touch then rather than endorsing Sapt's agenda without question?What's more in the book Antoinette is implied to be one of the 'poules de luxe' or 'grandes horizontales' typical of the era and is a number of years Michael's senior which makes her efforts to hang on to him rather more urgent and desperate. Mary Astor is ideal in the role but she needed a younger partner had Douglas Fairbanks jr. an actor of far greater range than is sometimes credited been cast as the intense politically frustrated Michael the relationship would have struck the right note. But then one would have needed to cast someone like Errol Flynn as Rupert and fun though he is in swashbucklers I'm not sure that would have worked.Douglas Fairbanks jr. is a superb Rupert and in many ways steals the show from Colman's gentlemanly Rassendyll and drunken playboy King Rudolf. He has style swagger and sex appeal. What he is weaker on is the character's streak of sheer viciousness. When Rassendyll observes that he's a badtempered fellow underneath the charm we never quite believe it of this Rupert. He's more of a dashing rogue than the novel's polished but outandout treacherous juvenile thug the film's Rupert is a cad but he doesn't attempt rape. The film makes the big swordfight a duel between Rupert and Rudolf Rassendyll rather than between Rupert and Michael  which is understandable in boxoffice terms but sadly means we lose another terrifically dramatic scene Antoinette in her bloodstained nightdress going after Rupert with a pistol.In conclusion this is one of the alltime great adventure films. Never miss an opportunity to see it but don't forget to read the books too! They are now available online.".

The film starts as more of a drama film and makes a transition to action film near the end. It also features nice sets in the old Hollywood style and an appropriate score.The film's cast delivers great performances. Ronald Colman is charming as Major Rudolf Rassendyll. Madeleine Carroll plays Princess Flavia who is slated to marry the king. Colman and Carroll have chemistry together and nicely develop a relationship. C. Aubrey Smith is wellcast to play the part of Colonel Zapt the king's loyal helper and David Niven has a small role also on the king's support staff. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. creates a memorable villain as the brazen and obnoxious but somewhat clever Rupert of Hentzau. Raymond Massey is decent as the other main villain Michael but not on par with Fairbanks.The start of the movie develops the film's premise and then the characters. The film mostly has an interesting story and clever dialoguebut it does have some slower spots in the middle. However the film makes a transition to an actionoriented approach near the end. This was appropriate and in particular there was one duel with some amusing banter that was a highlight of the action. The film culminates in a satisfactory conclusion and is overall worth seeing for its premise characters dialogue and action toward the end.".

Well the pacing is brisk the story engaging acting superb and the supporting cast is dynamitehow can you fail when you are supported by the likes of the David Niven Dougals Fairbanks Jr. and C. Aubrey Smith?! PLUS Rayond Massey is great as the menacing villain leaderpart Jonathan Brewster from Arsenic and Old Lace and part Snidley Whiplash from Bullwinkle. Plus Madeleine Carroll is so beautiful and captivating I could see how Coleman would have a terrible time letting go of her! The story starts in a small mythical kingdom. It seems on the eve of his coronation the kingtobe is drugged by the evil villain. It just so happens that the good guys have stumbled on an exact double of the indisposed king and they ask this very surprised chap to sit in for the king. He reluctantly agrees but it is for a lot more than he expects after the kingtobe is kidnapped and he must remain king for the foreseeable future! This is rousing adventure in the grandest tradition! If you love films such as Captain Blood and the Adventures of Robinhood you will be in for a real treat if you watch this film.NOTE The entire movie was refilmed nearly scene for scene in the 1950s with Stewart Granger in the lead. It too is an excellent film but offers nothing significantly better than the original. My advice is to try the original firstas overall it's a little bit better. ALSO Peter Sellars did an unbelievably terrible version of this film in 1979. Avoid it unless you are into masochism.NEWER NOTE I reviewed this wonderful movie a couple years back and tonight I was surprised to see Ronald Coleman is a very very very similar film called THE MASQUERADER 1933 in which he once again plays two roles of people who are supposed to be identical but not twins. Considering that this is a bit of a silly clich and that he did THE MASQUERADER several years earlier this makes THE PRISONER OF ZENDA a bit less original than I'd earlier thought so I am now scoring the movie with a 9 instead of a 10. It's still a lovely filmjust not quite so original.".

	schema:reviewBody "In reply to someone who questioned whether or not Ronald Colman was as handsome as people say I add a resounding YES! He has real Hollywood Golden Age glamour. I don't have a lot to add to what other fans of Prisoner of Zenda have said but it is a classic romantic swashbuckler. It is far superior to the remake with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. I love seeing Ronald Colman shake hands with Ronald Colman. I also love the scene when Colman enters the cathedral for his coronation  he is every inch a king and no one would guess he is an imposter  however you sense that he is walking into a place he has never been before. Now that is subtle acting. If you haven't seen it you are in for a real treat. The men led by Colman are all magnificent.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only ingredient missing in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA '37 is Technicolor but it's masterfully photographed by James Wong Howe in glorious BW and the cast is exceptionally fine.The story is the familiar one about a man forced to masquerade as a King of a fictional country Ruritania while all sorts of intrigue and cunning schemes are going on at the palace. RONALD COLMAN has the central role and MADELEINE CARROLL is the gorgeous aristocratic Princess Flavia that he falls in love with.Produced in lavish style by David O. Selznick with stirring music by Alfred Newman and directed by John Cromwell it's the sort of escapist entertainment audiences needed thenand now.DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR. plays the wicked Rupert of Hentzau with devilish charm the man who is in on an audacious plan to hold the real King Rupert hostage for ransom and RAYMOND MASSEY does his usual villainous turn as Michael the prisoner of Zenda's brother the man who wants the throne for himself. In a small role as Massey's wife MARY ASTOR makes almost no impression at all.On the debit side there's a strictly 1930's storybook flavor to the way the story is told particularly the love scenes between Colman and Carroll. Their histrionics get a little too overheated during that final scene during which her nobility in willing to forget a moment of madness seems more like a story contrivance. True love never does run smooth not here and not in Shakespeare.The duel between Colman and Fairbanks is well staged and makes an exciting finale for a slowpaced tale that becomes a bit too talky at times. Still despite obvious drawbacks it's an entertaining story told with a dashing amount of romance and intrigue. Madeleine Carroll was never more beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not quite the absolute marvel that most critics really enthuse over but pretty exciting stuff nonetheless what with Colman shaking hands with himself and Fairbanks Jr as the definitively cavalier villain. Colman is much more animated and interestingly personable than usual whilst Carroll plays to the hilt. Smith and Niven alas are stuck with tediously explanatory roles though both do their best. Astor's part is small. But Raymond Massey plays the sneering blackuniformed villain with such striking precision we can only regret that he is removed from the action too soon.However when all's said and done it's Fairbanks's film. He plays with such dash and panache one can't help but admire so charming a heavy.Technically the film proves also a second wonder though the special effects vary from magically fascinating to pretty obvious. The sets however are never anything short of sweepingly magnificent. Cromwell has directed with style and finesse. His setpieces such as the coronation and the ball with its great introductory tracking shot are so richly dazzling that director Richard Thorpe had no hesitation imitating Cromwell's setups for his 1952 remake. As Brenda Davies comments our only regret is that Selznick saw fit to have a couple of scenes redone by other directors. Cukor's renunciation scene marks an abrupt change of tone but Van Dyke's sword fight with its obvious camera undercranking is equally graceless and out of place.Wong Howe's masterly camerawork and skilfully atmospheric lighting is somewhat undermined in present DVD prints by processing in blackandwhite. Some sequences of the original were released in sepia. For some odd reason in 1985 TV copies these scenes were printed green. Alas they are now all blackandwhite. Another problem is that when the movie was originally aired on 1960s TV  miracle of miracles!  the framing story had been restored. The sparkling 16mm prints had obviously been struck from an original negative. The 1985 prints on the other hand were duped on to color stock from an old projection print. Alas no framing story. It is still missing.".

And there's another guy in there Douglas Fairbanks Jr. who's got his own agenda working while aligned with Massey. The women aren't out of the picture either. Colman the king is set to marry his cousin Madeleine Carroll who's in line for the succession herself. If he can elbow Colman out of the way Massey would like her for himself. That does not sit well with Mary Astor the woman who is crushing out big time on him.The king's two trusted aides C.

At the hunting lodge of the king the king gets slipped a present from one Michael Finn and he's out of it on the day of the coronation.With Massey ready to declare martial law and assume the crown himself Smith and Niven count it as divine providence that the other Colman is there. He takes the king's place and gets crowned the ruler of Zenda. But Massey and Fairbanks aren't through by any means.I counted nine different versions of this novel for the screen including three silent films and one animated version. Still this one sets the standard. Everyone is so well suited for their parts.It certainly is one of Ronald Colman's most beloved characterizations both of them. He essays both the character of the weak king who summons up enough grit to take on the job and the carefree English traveler that maybe providence did put in the right spot.The Prisoner of Zenda marked the return of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. to the American screen and as he relates it in his memoirs he wasn't flooded with good offers. He was reluctant to take on the part of Rupert of Hentzau as he had not taken swashbuckling roles deliberately so as not to be compared to his father.But Fairbanks did ask dad and his father said that his role is the best one in the story that he wished he was young enough to do it himself and that he should run not walk to accept the part. Fairbanks did and he got rave reviews as the charming but deadly Rupert. The Prisoner of Zenda's release was timely indeed with memories of the abdication of Edward VIII who would not step up to the plate and do his duty by his country. C. Aubrey Smith's admonitions about doing one's duty to Colman the king were exactly what Stanley Baldwin and others were trying to beat into Mr. Windsor's head.Though a good version of this was done in the Fifties by Stewart Granger and James Mason this one is still by far the best.".

The story is pretty confusing with some bad editing and a lack of explanation in some key scenes like where do those explosions on the city street come from?

Yes the movie is a bit slower than others of the genre but since it takes time for its characters for example the puppet maker it has more qualities than the average low budget western. Nothing extraordinary but I was satisfied.".

Incidentally this seems to have been considerably trimmed for American export  given that the runningtime is a mere 79 minutes what remains is a thinlyplotted affair which virtually resolves itself into one long chase! Incidentally the R2 C'Est La Vie DVD sports German credit titles and even the first spoken bits of dialogue is in that language! Sartana springs a trio of nogood brothers from jail intending to cut in on a fortune in gold that awaits them however the latter soon doublecross him and he's stranded on foot and without provisions in Death Valley hence the title  they also get even with their former associates including puppetmaker Luciano Pigozzi for letting them take the rap. Eventually of course Sartana catches up with the gang  taking some timeout to romance a gal who aided in his convalescencebut she too turns out to be harboring ideas above her station! At the finale the 'outlaw' is revealed to be a courier for the American cavalry entrusted with a crucial message  and his reward for the accomplishment of said mission is that he gets to keep the brothers' gold for himself! For the record the song playing over the opening credits King For A Day is quite decent and is even warbled for no good reason by a blonde barroom chanteuse at one point in the film.".

This Sabata movie gets the usual Western issues  such as greedy antiheroes violent facing off  quick zooms  exaggerated baddies and musical score with Ennio Morricone influence  among them . The dark  elegant hero named Lee Calloway or Sartana William Berger helps three imprisoned brothers Wayde Preston  Aldo Berti  Giordana break out from prison under the condition that they give him fifty percent of the stolen gold they have hidden in the desert. The film deals with a cache of gold that have hidden turning into several hands . As freelance gunman named Sartana is doublecrossed and appears to chase the nasty thieves  and settles disputes by shooting . Bemusing Spaghetti Western with Sartana as a tough and stranger protagonist  he's an efficient gunslinger acting as judge  jury  and executioner . At the beginning Sartana arrives in a small town where occurs a shootout when a bounty hunter attempts to kill him and he is subsequently betrayed by powerful Norton Franco Ressel . Later on  Sartana is taken prisoner by the bandit brothers and suffering hitting  knocks  punches and tortures . It follows the seemingly endless adventures of Sartana in search of a cache of stolen gold . At the end takes place the inevitable confrontation  a spectacular showdown in which Sartana contends against all . This acceptable Western contains an interesting but twisted plot  violence  double crosses  shoot'em up and results to be quite entertaining  though drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some violence  crossfire or stunts every few minutes . SARTANA is a fundamental archetype in SpaghettiPaella genre as well as James Bond in spygenre  here William BergerSartana stars an entertaining SW with lots of action  gunplay and fun . As always  the mythic personage appears elegant and dressed in black and with a killer look . Sartana is the standard by which every spaghetti antihero is measured along with Lee Van Cleef's Sabata and Franco Nero's Django . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist William Berger against the heartless enemies formed by a trio of brothers led by Wayde Preston . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as well as a lot of twists and turns  as the film approaches its climax  as in the final and the unusual conclusion . Austrian William Berger in this Sartana Western  is fine  as he ravages the screen  hit and run and kills . Fairhaired Austrian leading man Berger appeared in many Spaghetti westerns between 1966 and 1987 such as La Grande Notte di Ringo They Call Him Cemetery  Fast hand  Noose for Django Jaider's Gang  among others . He also played several Western as a secondary actor as he had got fame and fortune with his unforgettable costarring in Sabata as the banjo man  Face to face Keoma  California and Tex. He had a reputation for being a rebel and a vociferous antiestablishment figure . Berger's career was also at times interrupted by drug abuse . There appears usual actors from Spaghetti Western such as Franco Ressell as Norton  Federico Boido or Rick Boyd  Franco De Rosa and special mention to Luciano Pigozzi or Alan Collins nicknamed the Italian Peter Lorre as a doll maker  furthermore two beauties as Jolanda Modio as Juanita and Pamela Tudor as Esther . Atmospheric Eastmancolor cinematography by Sandro Mancori in Technicolor  Techniscope  though being necessary a good remastering and filmed in Elios studios  as usual . Enjoyable musical score by Augusto Martelli  including catching songs performed by Betsy Bell who plays a Saloon Singer . This Italian production is an exciting Sartana movie starred by William Berger  it is plenty of action  shootouts  doublecrosses  twists and loads of violence and blood . Sartana himself is like a crossover between Clint Eastwood's The Man with no Name and Django a blackclad amoral antihero  adding the special characteristics from James Bond  his quirky gadgets and elegance . Sartana character is in equal parts mysterious  cool and deadly  he is not out there to chase the bandits like a simple bounty hunter  he is just out for money and blood . His quirky gadgets often bring to mind the other similar character  Sabata played by Lee Van Cleef and Yul Brynner . The first Sartana was Gunfighters Die Harder or If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death a trendsetting film by Gianfranco Parolini with Gianni Garco  Klaus Kinski and Fernando Sancho . The best Sartana are directed by Giuliano Carmineo  alias Anthony Ascott he realized various with George Hilton who replaces to Garco . Hilton played more natural and roguish than Garco who was cold and peculiar . The later Sartana movies directed by Anthony Ascott became increasingly cartoonish and humorous . It was followed by director Alfonso Balcazar with Sartana non Perdona or Sonora with George Martin  Jack Elam and Gilbert Roland . Miles Deem directed two Sartanas deemed lousy and cheesy . Furthermore  a string of sequels and ripoffs with other Zseries directors. Sartana in the valley of death perhaps is not a Spaghetti masterpiece but a watchable and sometimes unusual movie nonetheless .".

The version of Ballad of Death Valley that Echo Bridge Home Entertainment has released on their Spaghetti Western DVD go by its Teutonic title Der Gefrchtete.

Clocking in at a meager 80 minutes this Italian produced horse opera doesn't malinger. During his twenty plus year career Vengeance Is My Forgiveness director Roberto Mauri helmed 26 films and ten of them were western. Mind you Mauri was never as good as any of the three Sergios. Nevertheless Mauri makes this western enjoyable and I think Sartana in the Valley of Death may qualify as his best film. It is definitely better than An Animal Called Man. As Spaghetti westerns go this one boasts two American actors in the leads William Berger and Wayde Preston of the Warner Brothers television series Colt .45. An outlaw with a price on his head breaks the three Craig brothers out of jail so they can recover the loot from their last robbery. Our hero apparent has ten thousand dollars on his head. This dusty European oater contains more than an adequate number of gunfights. If you're a fan of the genre you must add Sartana and the Valley of Death to your watchlist. Berger lacks charisma but writer  director Roberto Mauri has done a competent job orchestrating the events. Peterson makes an excellent villain and his unfortunate death is something that you don't often see. It reminded me of the Kirk Douglas western with Henry Fonda entitled There Was A Crooked Man.

	schema:reviewBody "This Spaghetti Western could had been good but it was such a disappointment. First off this movie is hard to find due to it being produce with different titles. It lead to much confused of what the film is called. It is often mistaken for other movies. One such title for this film is 'Ballad of Death Valley which happens to also be the title to an earlier film. Now retitled as 'A Pistol for Ringo' 1965. This movie has nothing to do with A Pistol for Ringo's film. So if you're thinking this is a remake or the original of that movie you just waste your money. The second one is more complex as this film goes by Sartana in Death Valley Sartana in the Valley of the Eagles or Sartana in the Valley of the Vultures. While the man in the film dress up like Sartana it's not Sartana at all. Sartana was a semi famous Spaghetti Western character that was introduced in 1968's If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death. Sartana was often played by Gianni Garko in most of the sequels to these films but not here as William Berger supposedly plays Sartana despite the fact in the film his character is name Lee Callaway. Lee Callaway doesn't have the Sartana like charm. There is no smoke bombs no derringer with double chambers and not even a robot name Alfie. Surprising it doesn't have the same high death count as the other Sartana films as well. There is only a few similar to the other films like how Lee Callaway is trying to get money. Lee Galloway is an infamous outlaw who is hired to break the three Douglas brothers out of jail and look for their stolen treasure of gold. After the Douglas Craigs in some versions brothers double cross him in the Valley of Death Galloway must learn how to survive the harsh environment and seek revenge on the gang. While the film looks like he would have an awesome showdown against the brothers in the end. Sadly it was disappointing. I blame it on the scorpion on the wires. Watch it to get what I meant with that. I just couldn't root for Galloway anyways. He's a criminal just like the brothers. Austrian William Berger is not that good to look at plus he looks like the villain. He did help the brothers gun down the doll maker in the beginning of the film that got me anger and done a lot of vile things. The best part is the Valley of the Death walking scenes with the Douglas gang mocking Lee for not having a horse. It add suspense that was needed for the film. The film was shot somewhere in Italy. To make the vast desert landscape the script calls for the crew simply made a sandpit as Spain would be too expensive to shoot in. I find the sandpits interesting since you can measure a film's budget by sand. I think they did what they can but it doesn't look like a desert. The exteriors had repeated shots of people riding across green and moist hills covered in grass. The story is pretty confusing at times due to bad editing and lack of explanation in some key scenes like where did those explosions come from? Even the odd twist and turns are pretty out there. The movie is in widescreen format with English audio but the dubbing is really bad as some German is add in on accident in the beginning. The dialogue is pretty awful as some of what they say doesn't make any sense. For 79 minutes it's a short film but with a slow pace. In some version of this film it's approximately 15 minutes cut off. I don't think the 15 minutes lost even added anything. The whole scene missing in that version is the movie's beginning which is pretty pointless. It's just supposing showcasing of the hero's unhuman shooting abilities. It really boring and not that much action in it. The action we get wasn't that good anyways. The music sounds like an odd folk rock song 'King for a Day' sung by Augusto Martelli. It is pretty catchy but forgettable. I did like the girl that sang at the saloon scene. She was very beautiful. I also did Pamela Tudor as Esther. She was one hot woman in her time. Her scenes was just there for sex appeal as it was bit cheesy. Overall In my opinion I don't think this is a Sartana movie the producers most likely use that name on the title just to capitalize on that character's fame so more people can go see it thinking it's a Sartana's movie when it's not. It's so misleading. Who knows? I might be wrong. The character Sartana does have a certain affinity like the Man with No Name hero of Sergio Leone character as in the fact that he might give or sell false information about himself. In many cases the Sartana in these movies bore little resemblance to Garko's interpretations in the original film cycle. It's clear to see that in this Roberto Mauri's low budget film as it doesn't have the action nor charm of that character.".

It lead to much confused of what the film is called. It is often mistaken for other movies. One such title for this film is 'Ballad of Death Valley which happens to also be the title to an earlier film. Now retitled as 'A Pistol for Ringo' 1965. This movie has nothing to do with A Pistol for Ringo's film. So if you're thinking this is a remake or the original of that movie you just waste your money.

In fact it's a slightly flawed but enjoyable western with a simple easy to follow story which i wont repeat here but it holds your interest where some westerns can veer toward the confused Return of Sabata for instance.The late great William Berger is given a leading role for a change and apart from his terrible dubbing is very good. More of an anti hero than a good guy. Definitely not Sartana in fact he isn't called by this name at any point in the whole film as far as I could tell. Similar black wardrobe but otherwise a different man. Decent gunplay the agile Berger leaping about blasting away at his adversaries as he usually does. Still don't know why half the street at beginning explodes when he shoots the ground though maybe some of the plot ended up on the cutting room floor that explains this because the editing is very jumpy. Perhaps he has exploding bullets or hid some dynamite there earlier! Daft! I nearly spilt my beer when it happened. However the version i saw was apparently missing about 15 minutes so that definitely would explain the choppy editing.Good fun though and the action sequences are reasonably well spread though the film so it does not ever get boring. There isn't anything fancy or original just the usual gun fights punch ups and explosions but done well enough.Unfortunately the theme song is really dreadful thankfully its only really sung over the opening credits and after that just a short burst later on by a saloon singer. The incidental music is better though fairly nondescript. Does the job.The other actors are adequate familiar face Franco Ressel is there as a villain but doesn't last long. No really terrible performances though the dubbing is particularly poor.It seems to be a very low budget picture so as as other people have commented the 'Valley of Death' in the title is a bit unimpressive. Bit too much foliage for death valley it looks more of an abandoned building site than a desert but they did the best they could i suppose. Most of the action takes place in greener pastures.As for the climax to the film it is good and satisfying end to a very enjoyable spaghetti western experience. If you prepare yourself for something more modest and lower budget you will not be disappointed.Not bad at all!".

This song reminded me of a untalented Italian Elvis impersonator singing.The main annoying problem I had with the film one was everyone kept calling Berger's character Galloway and on the wanted poster it shows Calloway. All in all for a low budget SW it was a nice flick about Calloway who is a gun for hire that wants 50 of the loot the Craig brothers stole and hide in order for him to break them out of jail.

Further the character Kong is absolutely unnecessary in the plot. Pataratida Pacharawirapong is a very beautiful young woman and good actress. Siwat Chotchaicharin is not so convincing his performance is weak but he shows a good chemistry with Pataratida. Meesak Nakarat is perfect in the role of the scum Angel. I liked this creepy movie and in my opinion the IMDb Rating of 4.6 is a little underrated. My vote is six.Title Brazil Atormentados Tormented".

From the cinematography I found myself also wishing to revisit Southeast Asia and check it out more thoroughly.

Many Western directors make the mistake or maybe it's deliberate of romanticising the Orient with people walking the streets in ethnic costumes and wild animals ok .. maybe domesticated ones roaming the streets.The main story itself is straightforward but well told and the premise is interesting to say the least.

	schema:headline " Ghost of Mae Nak Proves a Horror Film Doesn't Necessarily Need to Terrify it's Audience in order to be Entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghost of Mae Nak is not the traditional horror film viewers of the genre may be accustomed to. Although the movie makers obviously attempt to frighten the audience the film is based on Thai folklore and in this sense works more as a story that could be told to children around a camp fire than a grisly tale destined to provoke fear. For those after a film that provides an endless amount of terror you may want to look elsewhere. If you are interested in a movie where the horror elements take a backseat while the story consistently remains in the foreground then this particular feature might be for you.Unlike other films in the horror genre where the audience is treated only to small glimpses of the apparition for the majority of the feature until the final quarter in this particular film viewers are immediately greeted by Mae Nak in the first few minutes. The image of a woman with jet black eyes and a gaping mouth is not something we haven't seen before and the inclusion of a hole in the center of her forehead does little to heighten the level of terror.On many an occasion moments meant to scare the audience are not only predictable but more than half the time the movie falls into the trap of enveloping many of its scenes under the shroud of darkness and rather than reeling backwards in terror we are leaning forwards squinting at the screen.

	onyx:emotionText "Ghost of Mae Nak is not the traditional horror film viewers of the genre may be accustomed to. Although the movie makers obviously attempt to frighten the audience the film is based on Thai folklore and in this sense works more as a story that could be told to children around a camp fire than a grisly tale destined to provoke fear. For those after a film that provides an endless amount of terror you may want to look elsewhere. If you are interested in a movie where the horror elements take a backseat while the story consistently remains in the foreground then this particular feature might be for you.Unlike other films in the horror genre where the audience is treated only to small glimpses of the apparition for the majority of the feature until the final quarter in this particular film viewers are immediately greeted by Mae Nak in the first few minutes. The image of a woman with jet black eyes and a gaping mouth is not something we haven't seen before and the inclusion of a hole in the center of her forehead does little to heighten the level of terror.On many an occasion moments meant to scare the audience are not only predictable but more than half the time the movie falls into the trap of enveloping many of its scenes under the shroud of darkness and rather than reeling backwards in terror we are leaning forwards squinting at the screen. Due to the level of darkness a vast number of shadows are present and it seems that an opportunity to use these to advantageously increase the level of horror was unfortunately overlooked.Again in contrast with horror movies that frequently use stereotypical genre tropes Ghost of Mae Nak becomes heavily reliant on music to the point that sometimes it seemed the score reserved for moments of horror was being played unnecessarily to provoke a response.

Good then Ghost of Mae Nak is one you should add to your to see list.It's a nice little ghost story from Thailand about a recently married young couple that's haunted by the ghost of a woman that died 100 years ago. After the husband is left in a coma that inexplicably won't end the wife must investigate the origin of the supernatural presence in order to help him. There's a welltold backstory that explains why this particular couple earns the supernatural attention so there thankfully aren't a lot of dangling storylines.Ghost of Mae Nak includes a lot of Final Destinationtype deaths that are pretty entertaining. I was actually surprised by how elaborate some of them were. There's a fair amount of jump scares and startling things in mirrors too but Ghost of Mae Nak is more creepy than frightening. Still I was very pleased with how good this movie turned out to be and I definitely recommend it. IF like I mentioned at the beginning of the review you're not burned out on Asian horror after it's ubiquity in the west postThe Ring.The main actress Pataratida Pacharawirapong is incredibly pretty too if that kind of thing interests you.".

From the looks of all things alphabetical can a home grown Vietnamese ghost story be too far behind.Now I am not that big fan of ghost stories and the Japanese take on the subject has done very little to impress me. There are only so many faulty florescent lights and violin screams that one man can take. So it surprised me that Mae Nak is as entertaining film in its own right. For one thing this is more a romance than a ghost story.The story revolves around two very likable kids named Nak and Mak who are getting married and settling down when one of them the guy is haunted by a ghostly vision see above. They have true love and the ghost is jealous or vengeful or in pain or something. So they have to help her spirit to rest because SPOILER ALERT they bought the house she used to live in and pledged their love on her unmarked grave and received part of her skull as a wedding gift. No I'm not making this up The nonghost scenes however with the couple buying a house and dealing with various relatives and cultural demands are delightful and fresh to these western eyes. And the two leads are both attractive and pleasant and give of the aura of being real people with real lives. They both have actual jobs and go to punk rock bars with friends. The movies other asset is the Final Destination style death scenes the ghost uses to exact revenge or protect the couple or whatnot. The special effects are excellent and the camera isn't to shy about the gore.The film clearly has a healthy budget and talent behind the camera. On the negative side the movie plot is right out of a Scooby Doo episode and the film is about as scary as one. Lack of fright aside for a J horror style ghost story this is a pretty good film.".

These dreams cause him to wake up in a state of panic. So he tells his fianc Nak Pataratida Pacharawirapong about it and she does her best to reassure him that everything will be fine after their wedding in another week. Unfortunately the dreams intensify immediately after they get married and buy a home. Yet although the apparition is indeed frightening it also takes a deadly vengeance on those who attempt to wrong either Mak or Nak. Such is the wraith's violent nature. But one day when Mak is involved in an accident which causes him to go into a coma things begin to take a terrible turn for the worse. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this is not the original story of the ghost known as Mae Nak played in this particular film by Porntip Papanai but rather a continuation of the legend transplanted into a modern urban location. The acting was decent and the special effects were adequate enough as well. Likewise having two attractive actresses like Karnchanit Summakul as Noi along with the aforementioned Pataratida Pacharawirapong certainly didn't hurt matters either. Additionally I liked the location of the film Bangkok and I thought the CD cover was quite artistic as well. However having said all of that I must confess that there weren't very many scenes out of the ordinary which would have made this movie really stand out. In short it was an interesting movie but nothing really special and I have rated it accordingly. Average.".

One of the elements that's really impressive here is the fact that the haunting scenes are top notch delivering a lot of nice scenes. The opening dream opens the film strong with the initial appearance of the ghost delivers a solid shock with it's banging noises and really offbeat jump as well as a couple of other brief ghostly visions from outofnowhere especially work. The appearance in the house during the walkthrough is pretty nice with the unearthly noises that only he can hear the gag with the mirror and the second dreamsequence complete with the disappearance and a brilliant gag to wrap it in make this one a real highlight. The standout sequence where the ghost attacks thieves inside a small van is an absolutely classic using darkness mixed with the brilliant gag of flashing light intermittently to see coupled with the comeuppance of the gang at the end which makes this so fun. The film's other supernatural action is also really enjoyable including the two main hospital scenes. The first sequence with the levitating body in front of the priest while the others disturb the burial site is one of the better scenes in the film as the surgeon's test where the ghost physically prevents others from interacting with the body is a great visual and comes off rather well. The actionpacked finale where the race to get the ghost action resolved meshes well with the exorcism performed elsewhere and a fun twist capped onto the end of it all makes for a rather enjoyable and exciting conclusion. Along with the fact that the ghost is actually really creepy with its faded eyes blackedout mouth and teeth and an eerie dark spot on its head and the great kills in here these film's good points here are more than enough to hold up over the couple flaws to this one. One of the biggest is that this one really has a convoluted backstory that is so hard to understand there are repeated attempts to explain it and none of them do much good. One of the biggest obstacles in that regard is that the characters in the flashback have the same names as the current protagonists even though there's no possession going on along with the fact that it seems to wipe out the meaning of events after they happened and offer up a second slightly different explanation for it all just makes it all the more confusing and incredibly hard to understand. There's also the flaw in here where the film's languid pacing produces a long opening at the begging as it does take a while to get going with its good scenes while there's also the rather overlong and unneeded flashback scene which just drags the film out a little longer than what it should be.

Nothing ever happens in this movie except for some Final Destination inspired deaths. Characters appear and then disappear without ever knowing what happened to them or why they were in the movie at all in an effort to increase the body count. It's nothing you've never seen before but this takes the cake for bad execution of an average story.The only thing that might incite some interest might be the good insight into the traditions and legends of Thai culture. The movie sure takes its time to illustrate some rituals and ceremonies but by then you'll surely be too bored to even care. It baffles me that people have found this movie to be more than average.

	schema:reviewBody "The synopsis and the DVD cover to this movie does have a certain appeal and it does give you some sense of hope and expectation to the movie. However don't get your hopes up too high.For a horror movie then Ghost of Mae Nak is fairly slow and anything but scary bordering on being overly predictable at times. Plus there are random scenes where the ghost is shown and then they just cut to some other scene leaving you clueless as to what happened after the ghost appeared and also raises a big question mark as to why people wouldn't be scared out of their pants after having seen a ghost that up close and personal.The story told in Ghost of Mae Nak is about an ancient tale of love between Mae Nak and Mak. And oddly enough it today's time there is a young couple in love with similar names Nak and Mak. It is said that the ghost of Mae Nak will come between anyone who would stand between her and her true love.I will say that the storyline itself is adequate although there are no scares at any times throughout the movie. Plus it also becomes rather predictable at times. The movie was suffering from an overhanging sense that no one was really scared given their predicament and situation which made the movie have an approach which just lead to you not really buying that much into it.As for the special effects well they were there and they were adequate. Not top of the line Hollywood blockbuster effects but effective enough and doing what they are supposed to do.There was a single turn of events that I hadn't seen coming. Without saying what it was it is towards the end of the movie at the temple scene. It was actually a nice touch but it didn't manage to pull up the overall enjoyment of the movie as a whole.The idea with the bone amulet was a nice touch to the movie though I will say that much.For a Thai ghost and horror movie then Ghost of Mae Nak is a fairly standard movie that offers nothing new to the genre nor does it hold any scares or overly spooky moments. If you enjoy Thai and Asian horror and ghost movies then there are far better movies available.".

It has got everything you can have in a movie humor horror thrillromance action music etc. The songs are REALLY good in this movie. I would definitely recommend buying the soundtrack of Chandramukhi. There's even one song in Telugu. Overall I liked this movie a lot. Of course it had Rajnikanth in it which brought quite a lot more appeal to it. There are good fight scenes with attempts of the Matrix effect which is pretty cool. In the Telugu dub of this movie one of the songs is sung by Carnatic Diva Nityasree Mahadevan. What more could one ask for? It is a great movie and I think everyone should see it. It might be a bit scary for young children but it should be suitable for older ones. Conclusively Chandramukhi is a great watch and with stars like Rajnikanth and Jyothika it is a big success!!".

While Shobana acted so well naturally in her role as Nagavalli i'm not sure why P. Vasu director of Chandramuki had to beam light on Jyotika's eyes to make the audience aware that she was acting as Chandramukhi. Vadivelu's comedy in the Tamil movie is not too entertaining. i don't say innocent's comedy is very hilarious either but then there aren't so many sexual innuendos in the comedy in the Malayalam movie. in summary a movie worth watching once. but please take the time to see the Malayalam movie too with subtitles if you don't understand Malayalam.".

It is a ghost movie about an ancestral castle which has the ghost of a dancer who was sodomized and killed by the king who lived there.

	schema:headline " One of the best Rajni movies ever. May contain Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "When Rajni began work on Chandramukhi quite a few people wondered how it would fare after the debacle of Baba. But the Superstar has silenced his critics and he has silenced them in style. A younger look and feel toned down histrionics and a great screen presence have all contributed to the success of his role in this movie. Though the movie lacks his usual style and punch lines the man still has the charisma and charm to lure audiences to the theaters. Having watched the movie a number of times in a variety of theaters let me assure you that the response he gets for his entry cannot be matched by any other actor. Whether he is fighting bad guys shaking a leg to Vidyasagar's amazing tunes helping out various members in the house or confronting the ghost Rajni evokes screams and cheers other actors can only dream of. Jyotika as Ganga and Chandramukhi has done a fabulous job and given one of her best performances. Prabhu has nothing much to do and carries on whatever little he's got to with flair. Vadivelu and Rajni have excelled in comedy though I can't call it very refined. Nayantra essays her role well. Nasser Vijayakumar Vinaya Prasad Sheila and the rest of the cast just fits in to the story. Special mention is required for Avinash. His portrayal of a god man is realistic and his entry is very good. Overall Chandramukhi is a great movie which signals the return of an even greater man.".

The plot keeps the viewers guessing as to whatwho is the cause behind all these mysteries. SuperStar Rajini as Saravanan and a Ramachandra Swami use their own ways to help the family resolve the mysteries of Chandramukhi. The cast comprises of Prabhu sivaji film productions Jyothika Naser VijayaKumar Vadivelu and newcomer Nayanthara?!. P.Vasu has failed to use any of the cast effectively  but has focused on keeping usual Rajini gimmicks to a minimum. Rajinijyothika's performances can pull this movie to a success. Given Manichitarathalz the Malayalam version featuring Mohan Lal was a mega hit the director P.Vasu could have done better. Vidyasagar's music was a pleasant surprise. At least 4 out of the 6 songs are pleasing to the ears with the climax song Raa Raa scored beautifully in Ragaa sudhadhanyasi with Telugu lyrics being the best. Rajini's reduced gimmicks and demeanor seem to give his fans the impression he is turning a corner in his long movie career. Almost forgot to mention the entry scene where Rajini makes his fans scream with his stunt sequence  one of the better entries from the master lately. Rajini has 2 stunt scenes in the movie to please the younger audience. If the movie needs a PG13 rating its because of the vulgar comedy track and Jyothika's facial expressions!".

The comment i saw hasn't done any justice to the movie or the cast.I think Jyothia was suitable for this role. Especially the costumes were adorable. Regarding Ranjinikanth's makeup...please he is old that is the best he can do...but still i think overall he scores credit for that.I can assure that this movie is far better than the Malayam version of the same. Overall this movie is sheer fun and a great family entertainment. But i really don't see any significant role for Nayanthara. They could have gone for a better looking heroine for sure. But i really enjoyed this movie.".

I don't mean to be rude or anything but this movie stinks.I went to the theater to watch this movie being an Rajini fan and all but got extremely disappointed.Its such a thirdgrade picture!!!C'mon prabhu's acting was like his afraid to steal the limelight of Rajini or something the Hindustani dude which kept appearing during the first half till the end was absolutely unnecessary.What?? The director thought it's some kinda clever plot so that the audience will be thrown off track on solving the suspect??? Puhlease!!!Rajini's acting was extremely bad was the hell did he act?? Other than speak some pshcological gibberish in the end of the movie.Just a note  Rajini should stop acting after baba cause it will only degrade his reputation he achieved his peak with padaiappa arunachalum muthu badshah..etc..Its so weird his acting like a young hero with nayantara.C'mon she looks like his great granddaughter!!!!!!Whole cast was terrible joythika acting was only passable!! C'mon vikram acted in 'Anniyan' a Billion times her character in three different personalities and did it billion times better!!The song was bad with superstar embarrassing himself with dancing.Its so embarrassing to me being a hard rajini fan and all!!!Have you'll noticed Rajini's lips during the movie?? It's so burnt!!!And it the beginning of the movie when rajini did his fight which was way over with the supernatural stuff for a man of that age who was trying very hard to just keep his wig on!!!I mean its understandable that supernatural elements in a Tamil movies fight scenes is a must cause it caters even to the lower working class and autorishaw fellows in India which makes up the majority of audience in Tamil film.Now!! Now!! no need to get angry or anything just stating the facts only!!!So like i was telling the beginning of the movie during the fight scene which was totally defies newton's law of gravity I was hoping it was some kinda of dream scene were Rajini will wake up and see it was only a dream cause all the kamal fans and other neutral audience were shouting remarks like Thats Ridiculous Give a a Break!!..etc.. and being a rajini fan that was some difficult remarks to digest so I prayed and hoped that the scene will change and show that it was only a dream scene or something to save Rajini's dignity or mannum but it didn't and I was crushed! Cauz if it was any other actor I would have given some iron hard criticism.But for the sake of rajini I kept my mouth shut and try my level best to convince my oneself which was calling it ridiculous deep down.Frankly the movie sucks so bad it it pathetic.The only reason it ran in the cinemas was because Rajini was acting and the punchline sakakalalalka which was the only highlight cause there was nothing else in the move to talk about!!!! I only respect the notion of the film that it was to Honor Sivaji's career life as an actor.But on the other hand it was a disgrace to Sivaji.Because like I said earlier it Sucks!!!!Dissapoited Rajini fan.

Rajini does not convince a wee bit as a doctor even worse a psychyartist. Nothing much appreciable about this movie except a reasonably decent performance by Jothika. The movie is quite boring if not for the last 2025 minutes which do create a little bit of interest to the viewers this movie would have surely become one more huge failure like Baba. I don't mean to say that the climax is great but for people watching this movie frustrated from the dragging boring experience it comes as some relief. Thats all. Stunts are funny and under par so is the comedy. One particular scene made me lol in a serious scene Prabhu is going to drink poisoned coffee Rajini desperate to stop that comes flying in the air to stop Prabhu sipping coffee from the cup C'mon this is not a stunt sequence even in a stunt sequence this type of a thing is not suitable but all movies have these flying tricks to satisfy the masses understandable But this is a serious scene this type of gimmick is totally uncalled for. This type of small things spoil the movie even more. Tamil film producers should stop making these types of movies riding on mass popularity of an actor and start giving some good stuff for the upcoming generations. What they are doing is not fair to the movie loving public. Too much hype for this sorry episode. In short tooooo much ado about nothing. Rgds. Sorry if it hurts Rajini fans but just wrote what I frankly felt about this movie.".

The movie ends when our Superstar sends back the soul of chandramukhi to peace and ties a knot with nayan Tara.If u expect some punch dialogs cigarettes invincible rajinikanth cruel villain...... then this is not a movie for u.Rajini has replaced his BH cigarettes with Boomer bubblegum and punch dialogs with dialogs referring himself to god His name itself is Saravanan. Vadivelu makes us laugh asusual. I still wonder how they made huge prabhu hide behind all the other characters has no big screen appearance. Poor nayan Tara dances very well as v can see her only in songs. Finally Jyothika as over acted asusual.Rajini's introduction starts with an Chinkick to a gunda with camera freezing and rotating around rajini with his leg still in the air Matrix shot. Rajini fans starts shouting there and there only. Rajini has taken lot of risks like hiflying kicks ofcourse with the aid of the rope and walking against huge air blower Wig designer gets a good applause as it is not flyingoff.Each n Every rajini movie has a punch line or style which he uses thru out the movie. In this it is 'lakalakalakalaka.....' V r getting smiles instead of the things v use to get.Gone r the times when v searched for any characters in the screen other than rajini instead endup searching for rajini in the movie.I can recommend u to watch the movie if u1. want to see a younger and smart looking rajini compared to Baba 2. want to analyze what r who made rajini to change from his mass style movies. 3. want to see Jyothika without makeup U can see this in the climax".

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched this movie several times and reflected on the negative criticisms of others on this message board. And while I agree that some of the performances were flawed and that an evening spent watching it can hardly be called entertainment still in terms of its writer's objectives which are summed up in Rolf's concluding VO which I quote below in my opinion Affliction it is a superb accomplishment.I write thusly because I as a child  as I must suppose the writer was also  was beaten often and most violently by a totally outofcontrol father who himself was the product of his father's violence. Which is not to say that I did not afford ample provocations for sound thrashings or possibly a more effective form of chastisement for as the proverbial fool I indeed kept returning to my follies still there are limits.

And while I agree that some of the performances were flawed and that an evening spent watching it can hardly be called entertainment still in terms of its writer's objectives which are summed up in Rolf's concluding VO which I quote below in my opinion Affliction it is a superb accomplishment.I write thusly because I as a child  as I must suppose the writer was also  was beaten often and most violently by a totally outofcontrol father who himself was the product of his father's violence. Which is not to say that I did not afford ample provocations for sound thrashings or possibly a more effective form of chastisement for as the proverbial fool I indeed kept returning to my follies still there are limits.

Its characters are fleshed out human beings capable of good and evil and in the grips of intense suffering not the formulaic cardboard creations which populate so many recent Hollywood productions. The movie's atmosphere and mood are thick and the bleakness of the New Hampshire winter comes alongside its beauty and majesty. Paul Schrader achieves here what has eluded the Coen brothers in Fargo. The photography of Paul Sarossy is of a rare beauty and his compositions are breathtaking. Think of the scene of the two brothers in the barn lit by light sneaking in through the slits in the wood exterior the beauty of the snow covered New Hampshire chalets the camera receding from the barn fire until we get to watch it through a slightly offcenter picturewindow from the main house and finally think of the snow in its serenity its menace its domination. The two stories are so naturally intertwined that one can spend most of the time convinced one is watching a thriller until in the end this thriller dissolves into the main story which explores the violent undercurrents of human love and bonding. This whole is as thick and rich as cream.I am in awe of Nick Nolte's spectacular performance. It is honest complex and totally convincing. Nolte is ably supported by James Coburn and others. This is moviemaking at its best.".

Recently with movies like American Beauty and The Story of Us Hollywood has portrayed American households as candidates to be on the next TV tabloid talk show. Paul Schrader's dramatic portrayal of a troubled family in Affliction is as intense as any suspense thriller released within the past few years. The thoughtprovoking power of his script based on the novel by Russell Banks and the methods he uses to execute the vivid interpretative character study creates more than just a sense of emotion and empathy but places the audience in the character's shoes allowing us to explore a tense atmosphere on our own.The movie looks into the life of a struggling person named Wade Whitehouse played with extreme intensity by the descriptive Nick Nolte. He is the lowly sheriff of a small backwoods in New Hampshire. Nothing much happens in Lawford however thus Wade is usually restricted to plowing the snowy streets and serving as the local school's crossing guard. His exwife Lillian Mary Beth Hurt has most custody of their daughter Jill Brigid Tierney and neither relative enjoys his company. Wade's alcoholic father Glen James Coburn in an Oscar worthy performance who abused him and his brother Rolfe Willem Dafoe as children continues to abuse him emotionlly.The subtle town of Lawford is turned upsidedown when a rich businessman is mysteriously killed while hunting with Wade's friend Jack Hewitt Jim True. Finally given something to investigate Wade takes his job seriously even when complications arise when his mother dies his brother comes home from Boston and his waitress girlfriend Sissy Spacek meets Wade's parents and realizes what she gotten herself into.As Wade's life starts to completely unravel the filmmakers neglect to leave out any details from flashback of his fathers abuse to an uncompromising toothache Wade is developed vividly and clearly. The movie is best when allowing Nick Nolte and James Coburn to come to terms with each other's hatred for each other. The performances are what make this movie much more distinct than similar but lesser films like The Other Sister and The Story of Us and even better acted than the masterpiece Award winner American Beauty.Instead of milking the dysfunctional family material to the maximum the film also has tender dialogue and heartfelt scenes that exhibit a loving relationship between Wade and his girlfriend. These scenes make even more tragic the production's unsettling conclusion and increase the overall dramatic impact which is tremendous. By the end of Affliction like in The Ice Storm we feel for the main character's losses. Although this film is more conclusive it is also unmerciful we receive no happy ending no satisfying motifs this movie takes itself seriously and has no pity regrets or agreements. For Wade Whitehouse the climax of the movie represents death grief and sorrow. For us we can only stare at the screen and try to comprehend what we have experienced through his eyes.".

James Coburn is the dark angry patriarch of an abusive household whose abuse and anger are inherited by his sonNolte.  The story is told by the youngest brother played mainly in voiceover and a small cameo by Willem Dafoe and traces the events of a small town murder investigation that leads to the mental collapse of Nolte's cop character.  The film weaves us through a buffet of subplots and bit characters including a nice appearance by Sissy Spacek which is at times whishwashed.  However the tone and style of the film are quite fresh and unique.Penned and directed by Paul Schrader who will probably always be known for writing Taxi Driver the film is a stylish take of what is most likely a much better novel.  The tone is cold and dark and serves as the perfect backdrop for the anger and isolation of the two male characters. In my opinion the voiceover narration takes away from the feeling the picture leaves basically serving the purpose to tell us what to feel. The images and performances on the screen do a fine job in dong that on it's own without reenforcment.  On a whole the film is powerful and moving and is a great look into the heart and soul of lives that are truely tortured.  I would recommend this film if for no other reason than to see the brilliant performances of James Coburn Oscar winner and Nick Nolte Oscar nominee.".

	schema:headline " Affliction Clearly Schrader's Best Film To Date";
	schema:reviewBody "Roger Ebert described it well. The effects of abuse are similar to implanted medication. It continues to seethe inside the victim long after the original event or implantation. Nick Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse a shell of a man about to lose everything he has and knows including his sanity due just as much to his inability to learn to function as a person outside of the abusive environment he grew up in as his overbearing father's alcoholic stupors and redneck machismo. Nolte's mumbling has been criticized as indecipherable hogwash but it's consistent with a person who has lost direction confidence in himself and his reason for being long ago. James Coburn plays Glen Whitehouse Nolte's father winning the best supporting actor Oscar for his mindblowing portrayal of an abusive father who has simply played the same record over and over and over for many many years. Coburn's acting is a rare treat in that every action gesture nuance and word of dialog coming out of his mouth makes up a portrait of abuse hanging in an imaginary gallery of contempt. Ironically Wade and Glen share the name Whitehouse which of course symbolizes purity goodness and an idyllic existence all rolled into one but in reality is everything but that. Nolte's character is a small town sheriff with nothing much to do except plow snow and double as a school crossing guard until a hunting accident occurs and uncovers a possible financial conspiracy. Meanwhile Nolte must deal with fighting his exwife Mary Beth Hurt for custody of his daughter who has either been programmed by Hurt against Nolte or has other reasons for disliking him. Every aspect of and social interaction in Nolte's life reduces him to nothingness whether he tries to buy his daughter a hamburger plead with his exwife Hurt give a person a ticket for a moving violation interact with his best friend or his boss or has cross words with his father Coburn. There is not the slightest hint of success in Nolte's past present or future except for the possibility of his current relationship with his new waitress girlfriend played by Sissy Spacek. Watching Nolte's life unfold layer by layer it's no surprise to viewers when Spacek bails on Nolte as well. Director Paul Schrader wrote the script based on the novel by Russell Banks and as in every good Schrader film the acting and the dialog are outstanding. There is never a false note or Hollywood moment. Willem Dafoe who previously starred in Schrader's earlier best effort Light Sleeper plays Nolte's younger brother Rolfe who distanced himself emotionally and physically from this quagmire of a family years ago. So much so that Dafoe's illadvised opinion regarding the hunting accident serves as the catalyst leading to a sequence of events culminating in Nolte's Pyrrhic victory at the end. It's clear Dafoe's character did not know just how deep or how long Nolte's abuse was festering inside when Dafoe says at least I was never afflicted by that man's Coburn violence. Nolte's character replies with that's what you think with a laugh and a tone of voice that makes it clear Wade Whitehouse has never been so sure of anything else ever before.Schrader sets the film in New Hampshire although it was filmed in Quebec during a snowy winter and features several shots of bleak landscapes and dimly lit night scenes the perfect complements to a script depicting one man's small world of despair and desolation closing in and trapping him like an unexpected winter storm. The script's dialog is balanced with fantastic scenes during which the characters reveal much by doing only a little at times. The flashback scenes showing Coburn interacting with his sons are like home movies in the Bizarro world Nolte recalling a family life and memories not worth the effort but always there nevertheless. Sissy Spacek as Nolte's waitress girlfriend has a scene at Coburn's house with Nolte present and she rolls up and tightens her hands in her face realizing immediately what Nolte took a lifetime to do if even then. Nolte's toothache throughout the film and how he ultimately chooses to deal with it serves as a metaphor for Schrader's exposure of Nolte's festering rage and his inability to appropriately express anger. He turns to violence just as his father Coburn did to assert himself combat his feelings of inadequacy and to solve his problems. Abuse and violence begets abuse and violence. The film does not necessarily lead to any great redemption resolution or revelation. Instead it builds quietly and slowly telling a story that many viewers are probably familiar with themselves whether they share the similarity of alcoholic loved ones a lack of success in their work or personal lives or just shattered lives. It tells a story of how a man regresses from using his wits to his primitive instincts in order to survive emotionally. It's an interpersonal tragedy and viewers with unflinching sunny dispositions may not identify with it at all. Viewers have complained about the film being too depressing pointless and a waste of their time so liking the film a lot may be a matter of taste and tolerance or it may just be that some viewers are unable to accept films without a happy or satisfying ending before the fadeout. 12 of 4 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a perfect example of how the sins of the father are not only visited upon the son but are perpetuated by him and serve to visit and affect others as well.  There is one story line here  Wade Whitehouse town police constable of Lawford New Hampshire was raised by an abusive alcoholic grouch of a father.  He has remained in the town while his siblings have fled.  His terrible relationship with his father has infiltrated every relationship that he's had and acts as the lens through which he sees and judges the world.  Because of this his relationships with different people are all ambivalent  He either respects them and turns to them as a pupil would his master or he hates them and violently lashes out at them because they have disappointed him in upholding his preconceived 'high assessments' of them.  Wade is very unstable in that he seems to have a drinking problem an inability to manage his anger and as a result but also as a constant circuitous reason a very low moral view of himself. In this elliptical plot an important crystallizing event is the hunting accident that results in the death of a rich Bostonian with suspected links to organized crime named Evan Twombley whose son in lawMel Gordonis in business with Wade's boss Gordon LaRiviere whom Wade both admires and despises.  The New Hampshire State Police seem to think this is an open and shut case of accidental death  Twombley goes hunting with Wade's young friend Jack winds up shooting himself and that's that.  However to Wade this is not the end of the story.  Wade's low assessment of himself his having to deal with his father more closely after his mother's recent death his financial destitution and reliance upon Gordon LaRiviere as well as his failing attempt to have a close relationship with his estranged daughter Jill and exwife Lillian causes him in a desperate act of self assertion of his 'authority' to insist that Twombley was in fact murdered and that all characters that surround himhis boss Gordon Jack and Melare involved in a sinister plot to not only get away with murder but to deceive him and make him look foolish.  As Wade's fantasy elaborately blooms into a wonderfully baroque and intricate starcaise to psychosis his relationships with the people of Lawford and particularly with his close friends and family rapidly begin to deteriorate.  Watching this occur is like witnessing an avalanche and exemplifies Kierkegaard's assertion that one does not hit rock bottom in despair but instead can always sink lower perhaps infinitely.  Needless to say the film does not end on a happy note yet I would commend this film to anyone because the plot is intense the cinematography is excellent and Schrader's directing is magnificent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Affliction doesn't have an immediate plot.  It's mostly a delve into a man's Nick Nolte psyche a divorced alcoholic man who was abused as a child by his drunken father James Coburn.  He tries to cope he tries to make something of himself by attempting to solve a hunting accident which he thinks is really a murder.  He claims that after this everyone will remember him as a hero.Luckily the audience isn't made to believe Nolte's cause to us he looks just as mad as he does to the characters around them.  This is well done because it could've been presented as some big twist at the end.Anyway the mystery element to the film isn't that important.  It's mostly about how hard  and almost impossible  it is to prevent an emotionally abused man to make the same mistakes his father made.  This idea is presented well but by the end it just feels so thick and depressing that it's hard to take anything from the film because you don't want to remember it.Actingwise the movie is quite good.  Nolte delivers what I think is his best performance here with a quiet desperation wonderfully put out by his eyes voice face and so on.  James Coburn does his usual well but I have to question just why he won an Oscar for this.  Don't get me wrong he was a terrific actor and his performance in this is great but he's not in many scenes and the scenes he is in are mostly just a variation of the same thing Coburn drunkenly and violently mumbles at his sons and eventually starts to yell and thrash.  This is all well and good but his scenes never go beyond that except for maybe at the end when he spews his own sort of twisted philosophy to Nolte.Other great performances come from Sissy Spacek as Nolte's increasingly uneasy girlfriend. Also Willem Dafoe as Nolte's brother who is so concerned with being quiet and not problematic that he cant prevent the buildup of violence and abuse in his family.  I'd say that this performance is more Oscar worthy than Coburn's.This is a good movie with a great message but it doesn't put enough on the table 710.".

Come on a combination of Russell Banks and Paul Shrader the author who explores a school bus accident and the writerdirector from Taxi Driver or The Comfort of Strangers. Did you really expect a happy ending? The film is a dark side vision of Richard Russo's Nobody's Fool which Paul Newman and Robert Benton turned into a tale of redemption on screen in that same part of the world. No redemption here. As Wade's brother's final voiceover lets you know that Wade is still out there reliving his father's life you are relieved to be permitted to leave this claustrophobic world.Painful scene after painful scene are piled on each other none more so than the painful rejection of Wade by his little girl. Children go through periods where their parents are embarrassments to them but in this case it is more of a fear than a shame of Wade that makes her want to be in her mother's arms.This is a great film of uncompromising realism. It is a modern Jude The Obscure but at least you were allowed to see Jude when he had hope and some happiness and at the end he simply wore himself out. At the end of Affliction all that you know is that Wade is out there in the world his angers banked.The film works because of Nolte's performance. Coburn has an easier job but he carries it off. The subplots mean little but show us WadeNolte in a field of action and demonstrate that it is not only his personal life that is a mess.Odd that Banks' The Sweet Hereafter locale was moved from upstate New York to British Columbia and this film of bare rock flinty New Hampshire was made in Canada also.".

	schema:reviewBody "Affliction based on the disturbing novel by Russell Banks is a monumental little film. It's one of those independents that got overlooked by the public but not by the critics and certainly not by fans of the incomparable Nick Nolte. I won't give a lot of details or a plot summary since it's been done several times already.Affliction is the story of how alcoholism is a disease some family members catch but all are affected by negatively in some way. James Coburn family patriarch has the disease. Nick Nolte eldest son catches it. And both Willem Dafoe youngest son and Mary Beth Hurt wife are affected by it. The wife is beaten into submission years before while the youngest son in scared to death of his father and as he says in the film I was a careful child and I became a careful adult explaining how one episode caused him to be very careful around his father and thus it is now his role in life.But for this film we are focusing on Nolte and Coburn who are so intense in this movie it is beyond belief that there was not a twofer Oscar win for their performances. This is a fatherson screen story for the ages worthy of a Greek tragedy. And as we join them at their current ages and the current stage of the battle they are a frightening dynamic to watch.See the story in the Trivia section of the preparation conversation between the director Paul Schrader and Coburn. It is a true shame that we were not given the opportunity to see Coburn truly act more often. I always liked Coburn since he seemed likable but his career was a string of mainstream mediocrity in which he was punching a clock. This role shows us the depth of this man's talent that sadly Hollywood and he wasted with choices more like the embarrassing Snow Dogs than true acting vehicles such as this.For Nolte it was yet again another shaft by the Academy. People seem to be happy to equate Nolte's talent with the infamous mug shot that is so happily reprinted from a substancerelated arrest. Why I do not know. I cannot think of another actor that I would lay down my money to see and know that am guaranteed my money's worth from his efforts at least. As someone mentioned in the comments Tom Hanks who also lost out on an Oscar in the same category losing to the lead role from the most insulting and disrespectful film made in many years Life is Beautiful would never have considered taking Nolte's role. Never. He is not going to take a role which contrasts with his good guy image and so we are treated to an endless stream of average nice guy wins roles from him while Nolte who takes more chances than any other actor in Hollywood is continually ignored. This part is as skillfully crafted as his role in Mother Night. You can see more of his talent in Nightwatch and more recently in Off The Black another small film he makes a big impact in. All ignored by the Academy.Nolte's skill makes his paranoid reactions to situations believable where other actors would make it comical or simply awkward. His anger and angst as well as his broken personality bursts out of the screen. Throughout this film his character PLEADS for help in every way he can without sacrificing that tough leathery exterior that real men are supposed to have in this country at least of that generation that last generation it was expected of and that his father holds up as the highest achievement any man can attain. But he is a broken man broken deep inside where it is nearly impossible to repair and must start with a soul being opened up completely like a gutted helpless fish which is not something men growing up in a situation like this can ever do during or after though honestly there is never an after ... it is always during ... and it is for the rest of your life. Nolte makes it all so real and genuine many comments on this board say he must not be acting and must really be like this. I don't know Mr. Nolte personally and I am certain others saying this do not. It's just one more way of snubbing his immense and honest talent in favor of what the news media and the hammerheads on the internet would rather have you believe is the Nolte that matters that is that infamous mug shot.And what different thing does Nolte bring to every role? What makes the actor so unique? One thing I always notice is the walk the gate of each character. In Affliction it is a rhythmic selfassured stride as he is protecting what little of his insides there is left to try to save. But as the anger and the madness take him the stride is hard punching and offcenter.In Off The Black his stride is also offcenter physically with his right foot pointing out and his left foot pointing in as he angles through his uncertain life uncertain of himself and his place in the world.I'm running out of room as I always do but Sissy Spacek and Willem Dafoe make big things of their smaller parts and flesh out the fun house mirrorfeeling of the central figure's life that keeps us all offbalance to the sudden and brutal end.Schrader directs this group to a perfect film in my opinion. It builds to a deafening disturbing crescendo in steady welltimed measures. He was also overlooked for the Oscar for what is his best film since American Gigolo.See this film. It cuts to the bone and then scrapes across the bone in a long slow draw.".

It cuts to the bone and then scrapes across the bone in a long slow draw.";

I kept thinking These poor actors are trying their best but I just don't see why the characters are saying that.  But I soon discovered that I would never understand why any of the characters do anything in Affliction.  Why is Margie so smitten with a loser like Wade?  Why are Jill's parents so dang old when Wade mentions he got married when he was just a kid?  Why does Rolfe suggest a conspiracy theory regarding the shooting accident and then later describe the plot as existing only in his brother's imagination as if he had nothing to do with it?  Why do the flashbacks suggest bad camcorder more than forty year old memory?  And is it just me or does Wade's boss have a weird accent?  In this film Schrader has created a mess of underdeveloped plot lines which he can only salvage by tacking on a voiceover at the end to finish up the story and try in vain to explain to us why we should care.  The alcoholic father is a onedimensional monster despite Coburn's noble attempts I found myself praying that someone would kill him early into the movie and the protagonist is so multidimensional that he is impossible to grasp.  Mostly I just didn't care what happened to any of these people.  After shelling out nine bucks at the box office I couldn't bear to leave but I'll confess I did whip out a magazine and try to read but it was just too dark a good description of the film overall.  The last time I was so bored by so much gratuitous familial dysfunction was when I saw The Sweet Hereafter also based on a Russell Banks novel.  I think Mr. Banks and Mr. Schrader each need to cough up 4.50 and maybe I'll forgive the waste of my time.PS Yes Nolte gave a great performance but alas there is no Oscar for Best Actor in a Bad Bad Movie.".

There's a toothache a murder a divorce....and why do I care? This movie struggles trying to decide what to be. Is it a murder mystery? A drama? Or just a pointless waste of time? Mostly the latter. The ending made absolutely no sense at all and was completely unfulfilling to the script and the audience. The expected gradual buildup one anticipated was completely absent...there is no descent into madness or anything like that. It is more like 2 hours of nothing horribly drawn out followed by about 5 minutes of a series of events that should have been the climax mostly reduced to flashback and 3rd party offscreen narration! And bad narration I might add  Willem Dafoe might be a great actor but he should never be allowed to readnarrate a film again. He sounds like he's reading out of a book. I understand the deeper intent but the execution was pathetic. I would not curse sitting through this entire film again on anyone. There are much better movies out there to deal with substance abuse and violence...this is not one of them. Mostly it's just a bunch of exposition and wasted time.

	schema:headline " A good character study on inner afflictions";
	schema:reviewBody "Affliction. Defined as a state of pain distress and misery. One word and yet it means a lot. It also makes a catchy movie title enough for me to check it out. The film focuses on two different unrelated stories about murder conspiracy and family abuse seen through the eyes of a small town cop named Wade Whitehorse Nick Nolte. While the film favors more of the later story than the former it makes a mildly interesting character study of the movie's protagonist Wade. He is a very imperfect being. He drinks he smokes he is estranged from his exwife and distant daughter all the while plagued by harsh memories of his alcoholic father James Coburn. As the stories progress they converge and overwhelm Wade as he desperately fights against both and makes some decisions that could harm his life as well as his loving girlfriend Sissy Spacek. In the end it comes down to whether his past afflictions from his dad will turn him into a wicked individual. The apple does not fall far from the tree they say.No doubt director and writer Paul Schrader is heavily inspired by old film noir. The movie itself feels like such a genrea character trapped within himself and from the world unable to escape aided with a melancholy score and obtuse camera angles that make the world seem like an inescapable void. The story itself is good noir but it unfortunately drags. Some scenes go on longer than necessary and when things turn even more interesting the movie abruptly ends. However it makes up for with a great cast particularly with Dafoe as the younger brother and James Coburn as the father. Coburn won an academy award for his performance and it is not surprising. It is a very good role. He has a very strong dominating presence on screen that dwarfs Nolte as it would with a cantankerous father with his sensitive son. Nolte is decent his Neanderthal movements gruff grumblings and occasional tirades work well for him in this movie. Though I do think his Oscar nomination was a bit of an overkill. At times it seemed that he was just being himself whereas Coburn immersed himself with his character. Dafoe on the other hand is very subtle and does a fine job.Affliction overall is a good movie. Don't expect yourself to feel good after watching it. It may hit home for people who have grown up in an abusive home.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having written the screenplays for Taxi Driver 1976 and Raging Bull 1980 director Paul Schrader is on familiar territory with this blistering adaptation of Russell Banks' cult novel Affliction 1997. Here Nick Nolte plays a local lawman and jobbing handyman Wade Whitehouse a man whose entire life seems to be crumbling all around him. His marriage has ended his daughter hates him the town considers him a joke and added to that he spends the entire film suffering from a severe case of toothache. Like many of Schrader's iconic antiheroes Wade is a man trying desperately to do the best he possibly can but is unable to shake free from the grip of his abusive hard drinking father Glenn an almost personification of benign evil here swaggering around in front of his children and casually beating his wife with a gleeful abandon. However as the film progresses Wade himself slips further into darker territories revealing himself to be closer to his father than he initially expected as the film draws to an exasperating close.Much like his scripts for Taxi Driver and Raging Bull as well as his best film as director with the haunting and surreal Mishima A Life in Four Chapters 1986 we know that the film is going to reach an eventual violent and downbeat final as Wade continues to try and find his own kind of redemption amidst a series of unfortunate events. However the film is so much more than just a meditation on male aggression but a microcosm of everything from failure and defeat as well as issues such as domestic violence and the impact that it has on the children of these families with both of the central characters here affected by their father who casts a terrifying shadow over both their lives and the film.If there is a fault with the picture however then it's the ending. Right up until then we're drawn into these character's lives through the great all round performances from Nolte Coburn Spacek Dafoe et al and from the lowkey direction of Schrader. But the final act seams so rushed that I really needed to take a second to think about how it affected the film as a whole. A minor criticism admittedly especially given that the rest of the film is definitely worth experiencing.".

We also see his sadistic side as in the bombing of the forensic scientist's car and crucifixion of one of his gang members his lack of consideration and compassion for the 100 workers laid off at a storeroom he has robbed his cold bargaining with the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang members.The supporting cast also put in fine performances too.Jon Voight not only masters the rural Irish brogue of the Garda police inspector bedevilled by Cahill but also the attitudes. It is a tough but ultimately sympathetic performance of a cop dragged unwillingly into the gutter.Maria Doyle Kennedy and Angeline Ball give charming performances as the sisters who were also the women in Cahill's rather unorthodox life with Ciaran Fitzgerald also making a sympathetic son.Adrian Dunbar Sean McGinley and Eanna MacLiam all put in spirited performances as members of Cahill's gang. McGinley in particular creates another memorably seedy performance as Gary. Special mention should also go to Pat Laffan as a brutish Garda sergeant.With it's cracking script Richie Buckley's musical score and the black and white camerawork 'The General' is easily up there with the best of modern movies made in Ireland certainly up there with Neil Jordan's 'The Butcher Boy' and Alan Parker's 'The Commitments'.It is a must see  a film which demands cult status.".

Sheer quality craftsmanship and excellent storytelling.There's a very rich quality to this film. What we see on screen merely scrapes the surface of a full history that is eluded to but not entirely exposed explicitly which is what I think works best to keep interests up. Just brilliant film work in every regard makes this story come to life. Crime ethics political standpoints and complex relationships.Martin Cahill the film's central character is the antihero thief something of a modern day Robin Hood but much more visceral. I understand that John Boorman was allegedly one of Cahill's breakin victims. From what we see in the film he remains constant to his own beliefs and principles even if that means breaking the law at every turn. His schemes and plots to outwit the cops are so simple and effective you can't help but like him. He's very clever despite a lack of education and he doesn't shift to the world around him as much as it shifts for him. His biggest weakness appears to be cream filled pastries. Even if he's been beaten he won't allow his adversaries the pleasure of seeing him suffer in any way.I don't know how faithful the film is to the truth history or the spirit of Cahill's actions. But one thing I do know is that the superb craftsmanship of this film should propel it on to everyone's must see list but that's not too likely to be. At least for North American audiences this film has many things going against it. It's in black and white. The Irish accents are thick and difficult to understand at times. It doesn't seem to have the sort of advertising campaign that it deserves. And worst of all it appears to have unanimous critical acclaim. Often great films aren't hits they don't strike a chord with the masses but in my book that's fine. You can only tell the quality of a great film in comparison to one that's inferior. Personal taste aside this film is simply done extremely well.".

	schema:reviewBody "In terms of acting direction and entertainment value the general certainly delivers.    Its is well paced humorous and the performances of all the main actors in particular Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight are excellent. I'm not sure why the film is shot in black and white I don't think this adds particularly to the film.My one reservation about the film is the portrayal of the main character Martin Cahill whom I think is overly glamorised.   I remember before Cahills death his exploits as I saw them in the newspapers and television and from the many stories which circulated around Dublin at that time of his criminal activity. This was no latter day Robin Hood.   He was an unusually successful thief no doubt but with none of the charitable spirit.   He was also extremely cruel at one time breaking into the home of a social welfare officer and torturing him for hours simply because he had refused Cahill welfare payments.I would recommend people to see this film but at all times remember that the man it portrays was no one to be admired but an example of the most vile thugs that Ireland has had the shame to produce in recent years. But then they say The devil has the best tales.".

The scenes are well thought out and the acting solid.  While this movie never hit the critical radar in America it was praised both in Britain and at Cannes.

	schema:reviewBody "Like with any movie genre there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies. If you asked me to name a good gangster movie I'd have dozens to choose from. If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you the last time. That film is The General unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. This is a very dry very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story it's more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.Like Goodfellas 1990 and American Gangster 2007two superior mob moviesThe General is based on real people and true events. The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill Brendan Gleeson who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult. Meanwhile the police led by an inspector named Kenny Jon Voight try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill him.Perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous Goodfellas 1990 and the first two Godfather films I was expecting too much from The General. But that may be going too easy on it. This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its fartoostretched running time of screaming bad scenes. Let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented. For some reason director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in blackandwhite while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a fullfledged color film. Now I have nothing against bw pictures not even ones made in modernday times. Schindler's List 1993 was more than ninety percent filmed in blackandwhite and it's a masterpiece. The General made just five years after Schindler's List is not. The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very videogamelike quality that I found simply annoying. The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist's documentarylike style like Schindler's List did but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time too much like a classicstyle motion picture. Performances in the film range from passable to poor. Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. The sound design is also very primitive probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crimenoir appeal but that also fails because again it's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.But the worst thing that occurs is that there's not onenot onecharacter in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for. In fact for every moment of every scene the only thought going through my head was okayso what? Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and timeconsuming here. I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull. Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did. If a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films we feel nothing. No remorse no relief no surprise nothing. We just say so what? And that's all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy very poorlymade crime film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Cahill is an Irish thief but is generally a well mannered man with a good sense of humour.  His actions draw the attention of the police although he always manages to stay one step ahead of them.  However his life is one of crime and violence and a major art robbery brings him to be the focus of a police investigation and brings the IRA demanding a cut.  When a deal is made with the UVF Cahill's position becomes increasingly untenable.Films about the troubles or around the troubles in Northern Ireland usually tend to put me off because they often wear their colours very large on their sleeves and seem more interesting in scoring political points than telling a good story.  However this happily manages to avoid that and tells a Robin Hood style tale that is fairly well told.Cahill is a little romanticised in that he has a great sense of humour and is very likeable but the film doesn't hold back from showing the violence of the life with Cahill having to do nasty stuff as well.  For me it worked so well because of the gentle comedy that ran through the story but it still held plenty of drama and the characters especially Cahill held my attention easily.Gleeson gives a great performance.  He has got Cahill's little habits down really well  the covering of the face at every opportunity etc.  Dunbar is good as are most of the support cast.  Voight is an interesting bit of casting that is only used occasionally.  However it is really Gleeson's show and his good humour carries the film easily.Overall this film is very entertaining with a dark edge to it.  The story is very enjoyable itself but with the dark humour provided by Gleeson it is even better.".

One of those lives that no fiction would have touched because it goes so much against the grain. One of those gangsters that took on the police head on and seemed to mix cruel intentions including attempted murder with black comedy.Cahill wasn't really a successful criminal because his game ended up lost. How I won't say but there is only two options. Think about it. His only success was keeping the inevitable at bay for as long as he did. This film is about the how and why.The two posters boys are John Voight Inspector Ned Kenny and Brendan Gleeson as Cahill himself. Voight brings a bit of Hollywood to the piece but looks out of place  his accent is not at all bad though.This film has a lot of natural humour because Cahill seemed to enjoy a joke. Taunting an enemy is actually not that clever a ploy when the enemy is the state and he learns this the hard way. Despite what Cahill believed you can't be both an outlaw and a family man. Professionals talks about living in boxes and this what Cahill attempted. Family man one minute  cold blooded torturer the next.What I liked best was the onlookers and the family. Cahill is a criminal who doesn't pretend anything else. However he has weak jellyfish people around him  people that take his favours and therefore his blood money. There is not a Robin Hood story  his actions put good people out of work.This is a focus on one man and the script isn't clever enough to weave any dimension in to the minor characters. They are people that seem to spend their life nodding and agreeing  they are weak in the face of someone with a brain and ideas. This is the kind of stuff that the British industry can do. It is small  it is even in black and white  and it achieves what it sets out to do. It carries you through to the end and lingers in the memory but it makes only limited appeal to a world audience who are not intune with Irish politics. Any other country would have fought dirty tricks with dirty tricks  that is why Cahill never went to the British mainland to steal.".

Im sorry but Hollyfield is definitely not Hollywood!  I think that might explain some of the 'boring' commentary in previous reviews.  As for my own views i think it is an excellent movie which is interesting witty and depressing.  What makes it so is a central character who can be so creative and innovative with a pronounced intelligence and set of values BUT who wastes these assets through devoting his life to crime self indulgence and power.  The character of Martin Cahill is not portrayed accurately in the film as he is seen as a likeable rogue whereas the real General was a brutal horrific thug who despite all the interesting facets to his personality was ultimately beyond redemption. So that is my chief gripe with the film but it does not deter from a fantastic movie which is extremely enjoyable about the life of Dublin's most enigmatic crimelord.  For a more accurate portrayal of the actions of The General i would suggest reading the book by Paul Williams on the man himself.

It appears that in Boorman's mind at least Martin Cahill's less savoury tendencies can be forgiven because he stood up to the IRA and you can only wonder how anybody can arrive at such a simplistic notion.Cahill is portrayed as a modernday Robin Hood but he's a Robin Hood who steals gold from the rich and gives nappies to the poor.

He lives in a nice house and has a loving wife and sisterinlaw and he's really just like you and me.

While rarely holding down a starring role Dunbar never fails to give a convincing performance and he makes the most of a role here that is given scant attention in Boorman's quest to sanctify the memory of Cahill.Enjoy the film  you'll find it difficult not to  but as you chuckle at Cahill's exploits some of which are highly unlikely just remember he's no different in character from the scum who steal your cars and stab your sons.".

And I'm glad i did because this is one of the best movies i have seen in quite some time. Shot entirely in black and white and told through a flashback we are shown Cahill as both the clever criminal gang head and as the father brother and husband of his family. The dialogue is intelligent fast paced and ripe with wit and banter between the characters but one must keep attentive because you may miss a lot due to the Irish accents. pay particular attention to Cahill and police when they awake him in his tent in the beginning. I think this is a must see for any taste".

And I'm glad i did because this is one of the best movies i have seen in quite some time. Shot entirely in black and white and told through a flashback we are shown Cahill as both the clever criminal gang head and as the father brother and husband of his family. The dialogue is intelligent fast paced and ripe with wit and banter between the characters but one must keep attentive because you may miss a lot due to the Irish accents. pay particular attention to Cahill and police when they awake him in his tent in the beginning. I think this is a must see for any taste";

The pool table scene gives us an insight as to why Martin is not your normal crimelord.  I would rate this up with The Long Good Friday as far as films across the pond go.  The black and white scope images are stark.  Voight is restrained from his normal ham ways in his role as the cop after Cahill.  A good overlooked film of 98.".

	schema:reviewBody "The General Died at Dawn the title itself is enough of a giveaway as to what happens. But the circumstances leading up to the death of Chinese Warlord Akim Tamiroff is quite a tale.The setting for this film is Kuomintang China where the government of Chiang KaiShek doesn't have its writ run very far. Most of China in the Twenties is controlled by various provincial warlords. In fact a case could be made that the Chinese Communists under Mao Tsetung was viewed as just another warlord. But that's a whole different story.American adventurer Gary Cooper has a money belt with a whole lot of cash in it entrusted to him by the opposition faction to Akim Tamiroff. He's supposed to make contact with William Frawley in Shanghai who when he's not drinking the hotel bar dry runs guns. But Madeleine Carroll and her father Porter Hall who are working for Tamiroff help Tamiroff part Cooper from his money. In the case of Coop he's real guilty of thinking with his gonads. Then Porter Hall steals the money for himself and the film gets real interesting.There's one big flaw in the film occurring when Madeleine Carroll who starts falling for Cooper refers to him as the O'Hara Boy. O'Hara is Cooper's character name. Coop was 35 when this film was made and referring to him as 'boy' was ludicrous. But then again a man of 35 should have been on better guard. Film might have worked better if someone younger like Robert Taylor or Tyrone Power played the part of O'Hara. Or Clifford Odets's script should have given Carroll a more elaborate ruse to play on Cooper.Two major oriental roles were given to occidental players. Casting like Akim Tamiroff as the warlord Yang and Dudley Digges as Mr. Wu who employs Cooper would never happen today. But both do well and come to think of it Tamiroff does have an oriental strain in his ancestry.One bit of casting really hits home. By all accounts William Frawley was hardly the lovable tightwad Fred Mertz in real life. He was a misanthropic alcoholic in the tradition of W.C.Fields and a mean drunk when he was loaded which was often back then. His role as Brighton the misanthropic mean and thoroughly racist gunrunner was way closer to the real Bill Frawley. Gary Cooper in The General Died at Dawn was playing a role that Humphrey Bogart would probably have done in the forties. It was always joked that Cooper's dialog consisted of 'yup' and 'nope.' But the way he gets himself Carroll and Digges out of a real predicament in the end called for quite a gift of gab.".

Rather than the charm and humor of Borzage and Lubitsch's film Lewis Milestone's movie concentrated on the straight and honest decent American that Coop played in westerns and adventure films. Here he is on a mission to buy weapons for the peasantry fighting one of the warlords who overran China between 1911 and 1931 when Japanese aggression became a centralizing force in uniting Chinese except for Kuomintang v. Communists for awhile longer. The General here is Wang Akim Tamiroff at his most subtly threatening. He is aware that there is a scheme to arm his enemies and he is making all efforts to scotch it by kidnapping the gun dealer William Frawley  as said elsewhere on this thread in a performance that unfortunately mirrors his frequently mean drunk self and finding the man who is trying to buy the weapons. Cooper shows early his boy scout honor by illustrating to Russell Hicks a glib cynical traveler what Wang's rule means to the peasants. He asks for a match and Hicks says he hasn't any. Cooper knocks him down and calmly asks for the match again. A furious Hicks repeats he said he has no matches. Cooper says he understands that but what he just did to Hicks about matches is exactly what Wang does to the peasants for food possessions whatever he wants and he treats them far worse than just knocking them down if they refuse him.Madeleine Carroll is the antiheroine the daughter of Porter Hall a year away from killing Cooper as Jack McCall in THE PLAINSMAN. As sneaky as ever he encourages her to help preoccupy Cooper while Hall gets the money from him. Cooper does realize slightly late what's going on and he does confront Carroll who is not happy at her actions. Eventually there is a confrontation with Hall as well  which ends badly.Hall is not the worst figure in the film. Besides Tamiroff and Frawley there is also J.M.Kerrigan as Leach an apt name who is a blackmailing scoundrel only out for his own benefit. Like the other villains in the film he does a first rate job. So does Dudley Digges as Mr. Wu the restaurant owner who is also the contact man for Cooper when he is supposed to get Frawley's weapons. Notice his comment about the pleasure of a particular Chinese dish. Also notice briefly the appearance of John O'Hara the novelist as a reporter early in the film. He is closer to Samara than to Gibbsville in this movie.The film's threads all come together in a mass confrontation on Wang's junk. The conclusion is one that only makes sense if you realize what an egomaniac Tamiroff's character really is.I like this adventure film which is a worthy continuation of the story of China's fragmentation in those years to Von Sternberg's SHANGHAI EXPRESS. Definitely a film to watch and enjoy.".

The script which some reviewers found too wordy or too preachy I found very engaging. The pacing was excellent.Some reviewers have taken offense at the two main Chinese characters being played by occidentals who spoke pigeon English. Well that's how films were made back then. Sure it seems unfair to modern viewers. It was unfair. Is that reason to trash the whole film? The Asian actors who had speaking roles came across as intelligent and well spoken.If you're in the mood for some dark exotic espionage I definitely recommend this.".

	schema:headline " Cinematography Madeleine Carroll Stunning In Lewis Milestone Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Lewis Milestone is surely one of the most underappreciated directors from Hollywood's Golden Era. He may be the best example to illustrate how cinematographers and film editors have less to do with how good a movie looks than the director himself. Lewis Milestone's pictures exhibit the same fluid sensuous exhilarating black and white cinematography and silky smooth scene changes no matter who his camera man and editor were. The fluid movement of his camera was his trade mark and an innovative style much copied especially in the 'forties. He is in fact credited with the invention of the camera dolly while filming the early talkie classic All Quiet On The Western Front 1930.In The General Died At Dawn the gorgeous cinematography finds a worthy subject of concentration in the breathtaking beauty of leading lady Madeleine Carroll who plays a tormented femme fatale manipulated into wicked and even murderous moneymaking schemes by her terminally ill and morally challenged father Porter Hall. When she has to lure idealistic soldier of fortune Gary Cooper into the clutches of cruel tyrannical Chinese warlord Akim Tamiroff she quite naturally falls in love with him  Cooper not Tamiroff of course! Miss Carol has never looked lovelier than in this picture. As she reached thirty years of age a dawning maturity was adding character to her beauty and endowing her gorgeous face with an aching sensuality. Okay trying to describe what makes a beautiful woman that way is like trying to describe what makes Oreo cookies taste so good. Believe me Madeleine had it! Not to mention she was a terrific actress!When Gary Cooper is on screen he doesn't have to worry about anyone stealing attention even a beaut like Madeline Carroll. Tamiroff who earned an Accademy Award nomination for his role is bizarrely riveting as he was in nearly every movie appearance. Good support is also provided by Hall in one of his best performances Dudley Digges and William Frawley. Frawley is rather irritating as in all his roles but it was intended here.The plot is confusing at times and doesn't always make complete sense but it wasn't so difficult to keep up with as others have carried on. Compared to say The Big Sleep 1946 it was as easy to follow as The Three Little Pigs. Whatever the story Milestone knew how to reel it out in a way that would keep your peepers glued to the screen. This style of suspenseful storytelling immersed in eyegrabbing cinematography would be honed to a fine edge in the next decade with his masterpieces Edge Of Darkness 1943 see my review and The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers 1946. In fact this 1936 movie's flowing camera work oblique angles frequent night scenes and dark brutal story seem to be pointing the way to the stylish noir thrillers of the next decade.The General Died At Dawn has everything you could ask from a movie  top stars exciting action gorgeous cinematography. Topnotch Old Hollywood entertainment from the smoothest of the smooth Lewis Milestone!".

However he is betrayed by Judy Perrie Madeleine Carroll and her father Peter Perrie Porter Hall and is captured by Yang on a train. He hands over the money and is taken hostage but escapes and determines to get the money back.......This film is pretty confusing and you have to pay attention to keep up. It still loses you in parts though especially at the beginning. The cast are nothing special and fall in between the extremes of Akim Tamiroff who is excellent as the warlord and William Frawley who is dreadful in every scene that he appears in. Frawley also has an awful raspythroat voice which really invades your brain. He manages to produce a very offensive performance and it doesn't help the film at all.The story confuses at the beginning then levels out into semitedium with unbelievability factor 10. The way in which Cooper breezes through the film with his cocky manner is pure phoniness he would have been killed at his first meeting with Yang. The plot is also somewhat cheapened by the way that General Yang meets his death. Frawley's involvement in the final denouement is an outrageous con to those who are looking forward to a good climax.The film is done in such a way as to preach to the viewer and this stand of taking the moral high ground insults the audience...........Shut up Cooper!!.....

	schema:headline " Aside from two really dumb characters and some inconsistencies a pretty good film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper plays Mr. O'Haraa mercenary with a heart of gold. It seems that he's carrying money to help fund a revolt against a Chinese warlord General Yang Akim Tamirof. However due to the work of an indifferently written woman Madeleine Carrol O'Hara is captured by Yang and the revolution is doomed to fail. It's up to O'Hara to somehow escape find the money and then pay the arms merchant William Frawley so the revolution can commence.In general bad pun I know the film is pretty good. However Ms. Carroll's character simply made no sense. While she constantly professed that she was a good person at every turn she behaved otherwisemaking her confusing and quite stupid. How she could supposedly care for O'Hara AND betray him to be killed makes no sense at all nor do any of her actions. She is THE big problem with the filmotherwise it's mostly very good. Another problem though much smaller is that Dudley Diggs is perhaps the worst cast Chinese character in history. Despite decent makeup his very very strong English accent made him laughableas much as Katharine Hepburn playing a Chinese lady in Dragon Seed! As for Cooper he was coolplaying his heroic macho role extremely well. While it was rare to see a heroic man slap a woman here it was quite fitting and he carried it off well in macho heroic fashion he slugged a lot of folks in the movie! Because of this his professing his love for Carroll at the end really made no sense. And And although Akim Tamirof wasn't the least bit Chinese his General Yang was also quite goodand menacing. In fact all the production aside from Carroll and Diggs was pretty good and I can see why the film was a success. Of particular note was the very good fake Chinese makeup. Although lots of Anglos had these roles at least they LOOKED pretty Asianunlike many other films of the period such as the Charlie Chan pictures. Reasonably well made and interesting though far from Cooper's best from this era.By the way from what I have read about William Frawley in real life he pretty much played himself in the movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gary Cooper plays Mr. O'Haraa mercenary with a heart of gold. It seems that he's carrying money to help fund a revolt against a Chinese warlord General Yang Akim Tamirof. However due to the work of an indifferently written woman Madeleine Carrol O'Hara is captured by Yang and the revolution is doomed to fail. It's up to O'Hara to somehow escape find the money and then pay the arms merchant William Frawley so the revolution can commence.In general bad pun I know the film is pretty good. However Ms. Carroll's character simply made no sense. While she constantly professed that she was a good person at every turn she behaved otherwisemaking her confusing and quite stupid. How she could supposedly care for O'Hara AND betray him to be killed makes no sense at all nor do any of her actions. She is THE big problem with the filmotherwise it's mostly very good. Another problem though much smaller is that Dudley Diggs is perhaps the worst cast Chinese character in history. Despite decent makeup his very very strong English accent made him laughableas much as Katharine Hepburn playing a Chinese lady in Dragon Seed! As for Cooper he was coolplaying his heroic macho role extremely well. While it was rare to see a heroic man slap a woman here it was quite fitting and he carried it off well in macho heroic fashion he slugged a lot of folks in the movie! Because of this his professing his love for Carroll at the end really made no sense. And And although Akim Tamirof wasn't the least bit Chinese his General Yang was also quite goodand menacing. In fact all the production aside from Carroll and Diggs was pretty good and I can see why the film was a success. Of particular note was the very good fake Chinese makeup. Although lots of Anglos had these roles at least they LOOKED pretty Asianunlike many other films of the period such as the Charlie Chan pictures.

He and his twelve aides hope one day to rule the twelve provinces and subjugate China's millions. O'Hara an American soldier of fortune sides with the suppressed peasants accepting the job of carrying a large sum of money to Shanghai to buy guns for their defense.

However the story is not just an excuse for dazzling setpieces. It provides wonderful opportunities for the players to shine in wellhoned highly memorable roles. When you think of the dozens of great performances delivered over the years by Akim Tamiroff for instance it would normally be a daunting task to select a single portrait that transcends many magnificent others. But fortunately the actor lent his talents to the title role of this movie  which makes selecting the ultimate frontrunner easy!The same observation could be applied with equal veracity to other players such as Porter Hall William Frawley and J.

As for Cooper and Carroll they make the perfect screen couple!Realized on a noexpensespared budget with stunningly imaginative sets engrossing atmospheric photography bizarrely offbeat editing and a weirdly appealing music score The General Died at Dawn provides thrillingly exotic entertainment in its every powerfully composed frame its every brilliant stratagem of camera movement its every breathtakingly novel cut juxtaposition and dissolve.Formerly available on an excellent Universal DVD.".

He is a trained professional whose cheating methods is to mark high value cards...Barney knows how to get the job done and understands when things are getting a little too tough... But as an upandcoming poker player facing a longtime master of the game his cunning is tested through bluff and double bluff... Not only is there a huge fortune at stake but also his status of being the luckiest gambler of them all...Susannah York seems to have quite a flush of youthful beauty as the spirited blonde in pursue of a handsome young player chasing his win on the Baccarat table...The film is not a complete bore but you won't think too much about it once it's over...";

Feldman was asked why his 1967 film of 'Casino Royale' deviated so wildly from the source material he replied that the Eon movies had already swiped most of it. He could have said instead that Jack Smight's 'Kaleidoscope' released the year before was an even more blatant steal of Fleming's first book. Warren Beatty plays 'Barney Lincoln' an American playboy who devises the perfect 'get rich quick' plan. Breaking into the Kaleidoscope playing card factory in Geneva he carefully marks the printing plates. The doctored cards head for Europe's top casinos. With the beautiful 'Angel McGinnis'  Susannah York  in tow Lincoln breaks the banks and soon amasses a considerable fortune.But his unlawful activities bring him to the attention of New Scotland Yard. 'Inspector Manny McGinnis'  Angel's father  wants him to bankrupt the sinister head of a narcotics ring called 'Harry Dominion'  Eric Porter . The means? A game of poker. Facing a lengthy jail sentence Barney reluctantly agrees.Robert and Jane HowardCarrington's script is a more faithful version of Fleming's book than either the 1967 allstar spoof or Martin Campbell's 2006 retread. Porter gleefully hams it up as 'Dominion' a villain straight out of Bond particularly as he has a Napoleonic complex. There's a tense scene as he teases his men with the revelation that there is a traitor in their midst. Taking one of them  George Murcell  to a cellar he retreats as the unfortunate man is incinerated with a flamethrower.Beatty has never been one of my favourite actors  and no I'm not just jealous of his legendary sexual conquests  but the role of 'Barney' at least allows him to be funny and charming in a Cary Grant sort of way. As sexy boutique owner 'Angel' Susannah York makes the most of a stock 'love interest' character. For me the real star is Clive Revill as the steam engineloving police officer McGinnis. an 'Avengers' style eccentric to be sure. Murray Melvin  from 'A Taste Of Honey'  is also good as sharp shooting 'Aimes'. The fine supporting cast includes the late George Sewell Yootha Joyce Peter Blythe and John Junkin. Jane 'BlowUp' Birkin puts in a 'blink and you'll miss it' appearance.'Kaleidoscope' is one of those Americanfunded  Winkast Productions also made Alistair Maclean adaptations such as 'When Eight Bells Toll'  pictures which exploited the Swinging London phenomenon of the time. Maurice Binder's title sequence offers a picture postcard view of the capital seen through the aforementioned novelty toy. Fortunately arch scenes like the one in which Barney romances Angel in a field at night while she is perched on a cow are few and far between. Stanley Myers' chirpy music keeps the proceedings nicely afloat with a sitar accompanying psychedelic scene breaks of the sort later parodied by the awful 'Austin Powers' films. Jack Smight later made the cult film of Ray Bradbury's 'The Illustrated Man'.Unlike 'Casino Royale' there's no big torture scene here although Barney gets his legs hit at one stage with  ironically  a poker. Though not a spy film 'Kaleidoscope' owes enough to the Bond series to make it required viewing for fans.".

Of course what really gives the move genuine flavor is Eric Portman's performance. But it's sad to report that Miss York is not up to her usual high standard Perhaps the blame resides with director Jack Smight whose overfondness for closeups is not always flattering. I can just see Smight arguing with the photographer Chris Challis right now Who cares if it's not flattering! It will look good on TV  and that's all that counts!

When the film begins you see that Barney Lincoln Warren Beatty is an international playboy who loves to gamble...and win. However you soon see how he's so goodas he breaks into the company Mission Impossible style that manufactures cards for the casinos. Why? So he can mark the plates and thus be able to read all the cards. Along the way he gets hooked up with a screwy girl Angel Susannah York. This is problematic as she then tells her father all about Barney and his incredible card playing...and he works for Scotland Yard. The film however doesn't go where you think as Daddy is not interested in arresting Barney but forcing him to do a job for him. What's the job and how will it all work out....well see the film.Watching Beatty breaking in and then playing a highstakes game of poker was very enjoyable. His romance with York however never seemed very convincing nor romantic. I think if they'd have improved this angle they would have made the film more engaging and more of a mustsee affair.It's hard to imagine no one spotting the marks on the cards especially because these are multimillion dollar casinos. This just didn't make much sense.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chuck Norris has gotten a bit of a bad rap over the years but watching some of his earlier films it's hard to understand why. No he's not the best actor of all time but his fighting skills are pretty impressive. This movie gives him a lot of room to do what he does best and it's great fun to watch him take out bad guy after bad guy with his amazing kung fu kicks. There are also good performances by Mako and Christopher Lee both of whom make any movie worth watching and the director has some cool camera shots throughout.That said I have to admit it has plenty of unintentionally hilarious parts and I'm not just talking about the cheesy 80's soundtrack and polyester suits. For one thing it seems like something is a little wrong with ol' Chuck. He does some genuinely odd things throughout the movie that make you wonder if he's OK in the head. The most shocking example is when a guy asks him Kane do you know what is permeating this room? and he sniffs the guy's face rubs his cheek and says Is it your cologne? Then there's the scene where he knocks a man out then places a pillow behind his head and pats his hair. He also spends a lot of time talking to his dog Mort... and not just in a friendly way but in a maybehe'shearingthedogtalkingback sort of way.The character of the Professor is funny too funnyodd not funnyhaha. The scene where he gets hit by a car and responds by beating the car up is not easy to forget.These things are a bit unsettling but where the film really loses it is at the end when everything goes unexpectedly and completely bonkers. I am referring to the surreal scene where dozens of businessmen who all look like Ron Burgundy have a fullscale war with the police. It's like watching Die Hard with the terrorists being played by the entire cast of Dallas. Cheesiness aside however this is an enjoyable actionpacked film that any fan of Norris is sure to love. 710 stars.".

Mako is probably the only person to have appeared in a movie or TV show with Bruce Lee Chuck Norris Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung.

	schema:headline " SmoothFacedNorris' Best!";
	schema:reviewBody "In my review of Forced Vengeance I mentioned that there are three looks to Chuck Norris smoothfaced moustache and bearded. I'd call Forced Vengeance MoustacheNorris' best The Hitman BeardedNorris' best The Delta Force Norris' best in general and An Eye For An Eye SmoothFacedNorris' Best. Despite being a sold action movie that is very fun and thrilling the acting is bad and story is unoriginal. Chuck Norris plays a cop who witnesses his partner being murdered after being set up quits the force and seek vengeance. There's really nothing more to it than that. And as I mentioned earlier the acting is bad for the most part. Chuck Norris is simply a bad actor. I've seen better acting by firsttime high schoolers in a drama class. He has gotten better over the years rising from terrible to just okay. I laughed at Norris during a few parts. Nobody else is necessarily bad but everybody really is cheesy. Every martialarts film is cheesyascanbe! Christopher Lee is the only real actor in this that can be taken seriously. But due to an allaround corny movie it affects him. A movie with good acting was not what they were trying to get at. This is a straightup action movie that stirsup smart thrills and excellent action. This features some of Norris' best physical fight scenes and gun fights. Easily top 5 for Norris in terms of action and suspense. The buildup of mayhem and destruction that comes is exciting. Even though its cheesy its the good kind the overthetop cartoony cheese. There can't be a strong sense of danger and not be thrilling. Actually it can be dull but this isn't a bad movie. The action is fabulous and danger is lots of fun. Props to Christopher Lee too.".

	onyx:emotionText "In my review of Forced Vengeance I mentioned that there are three looks to Chuck Norris smoothfaced moustache and bearded. I'd call Forced Vengeance MoustacheNorris' best The Hitman BeardedNorris' best The Delta Force Norris' best in general and An Eye For An Eye SmoothFacedNorris' Best. Despite being a sold action movie that is very fun and thrilling the acting is bad and story is unoriginal. Chuck Norris plays a cop who witnesses his partner being murdered after being set up quits the force and seek vengeance. There's really nothing more to it than that. And as I mentioned earlier the acting is bad for the most part. Chuck Norris is simply a bad actor. I've seen better acting by firsttime high schoolers in a drama class. He has gotten better over the years rising from terrible to just okay. I laughed at Norris during a few parts. Nobody else is necessarily bad but everybody really is cheesy. Every martialarts film is cheesyascanbe! Christopher Lee is the only real actor in this that can be taken seriously. But due to an allaround corny movie it affects him. A movie with good acting was not what they were trying to get at. This is a straightup action movie that stirsup smart thrills and excellent action. This features some of Norris' best physical fight scenes and gun fights. Easily top 5 for Norris in terms of action and suspense. The buildup of mayhem and destruction that comes is exciting. Even though its cheesy its the good kind the overthetop cartoony cheese. There can't be a strong sense of danger and not be thrilling. Actually it can be dull but this isn't a bad movie. The action is fabulous and danger is lots of fun. Props to Christopher Lee too.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Chuck Norris doesn't need a weapon... he is a weapon!' Oh yeah. Don't you know it! This is what I like to see. Where can you get a Norris film which has him in a red sports car flaunting a blinding fashion sense glowing golden hair a sensitive pet dog called Mort Mako as his comical martial arts mentor an unstoppable henchman Richard Roundtree Christopher Lee haunting flashbacks plenty of fodder for some asswhooping and of course that fuzzy mo. Hey wait on. What there's no mo on show?! I don't know but I guess I have to deal with it. Even though it has dynamism of its own. More so than the man! Anyhow all of this can be found in director Steve Carver's An Eye For An Eye who was also responsible for the highly amusing and surprisingly stylish Norris' outing Lone Wolf McQuade 1983.Carver knows his stuff by keeping it at a cracking pace competent flair and plastering it with brilliantly stylised and choreographed action setpieces. Some lively suspense and jolting thrills are randomly worked in along the way. The premise is routine and the twists foreseeable. Vengeance vengeance. I think Norris has got vengeance on mind and flashy slow motion is the weapon of choice. Of course nothing is going to get in his way. This makes it quite exciting overthetop and at times comical. Yes there's some intentional humour too even in the wonky script. The San Francisco backdrop is wellused from the gritty to the attractive as its spaciously photographed and William Goldstien's moodily appealing score is pitchperfect. The wooden plank that's Norris does what's needed of him and strangely holds your attention in an adequate turn. A tiptop supporting cast give it a little more credit. Mako brings a wilful personality that suitably feeds off Norris. Richard Roundtree's cynical frownbeating Capt. Stevens and Christopher Lee's smooth presence features largely as Morgan Canfield. Rosalind Chao Maggie Cooper and Matt Clarke are solid too. In a role that's hard to forget is Professor Toru Tanaka as the formidable stoneengraved opponent that Norris must encounter. A swiftly executed and undoubtedly engaging actioner.".

However it's an enjoyably funky little martial arts action item that does the trick quite nicely getting immediately down to buttkicking business right from the stirring start and never letting up to the thrilling end. A cleanshaven babyfaced Chuck Norris stars as rugged San Francisco cop Sean Kane who after losing his partner in an ambush a brief appearance by Terry Kiser of Weekend at Bernie's fame quits the police force and decides to go after the nocount drugdealing evildoers responsible on his own using his chopsocky prowess to clean their clocks like nobody's business. So far so formulaic and predictable. Fortunately director Steve Big Bad Mama Carver maintains a snappy pace and a gritty atmosphere which keeps the pretty flimsy story on track throughout. The action is both plentiful and exciting with especially cool use of strenuous slow motion and a substantial body count racked up by our man Chuck. Moreover a bangup supporting cast helps a lot the late great Mako as a fellow martial artist who's constantly criticizing Norris' sloppy form Mako makes for a really funny comic relief character Richard Shaft Roundtree as Norris' huffy disapproving superior Rosalind Chao as a gutsy lady TV reporter the always terrific Christopher Lee as the suavely slimy main villain Matt Clark as a weaselly cop on the take and the enormous Professor Toru Tanaka as a hulking ferocious flunky for the bad guys the scene where Tanaka beats up a Volkswagon is an absolute riot!. Sure this film will never be hailed as some kind of great overlooked classic but it's nonetheless loads of solid silly straightdowntheline early 80's action fun and that's good enough for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now this film really takes me back to my youth where you were a member of a video shop... or fifteen I counted the cards I used to have... and you would troll around them all to find a movie worth watching  at least it kept us fit.This is pretty much your basic '80's action flick. Where the good guy is out for revenge for the death of a lover a family member friend or in this case a partner on the force. The plot like this one would usually revolve around drugs trafficking. Throw in a love interest and loads of exciting fights and you have the perfect mix. This was the start of the Leave your brain at the door movies. To be fair it's nice to let enjoyment and excitement take you out of your daily routine. I know I need it at the moment.So in this story you have Kane Norris and his partner Dave Kiser heading to an undercover meet. However it's a trap and Dave is killed in quite a nasty way. From here on in Kane is out to solve the murder and get revenge for his dead partner. This leads him and Dave's girlfriend reporter Linda Chao into a world of drug trafficking...So what makes this a film worth watching?Well there is Chuck Norris who to be honest isn't too bad in this film. He was just coming into being an actor in his own right at this time. These types of characters like the films were tenapenny and you were lucky if they made it to twodimensional let alone three. I have to believe that it's the likes of Christopher Lee Canfield Richard Roundtree Captain Stevens Matt Clark McCoy and even Mako Chan that elevated his acting up a notch or two for this movie. The rest of the cast are solid actors and carry the film and the muchused scenario easily.Next there's the direction. Steve Carver does a really good job with the camera work. There are some really wellframed sections. I loved the part where Kane goes to visit his sensei and master Chan. He parks his beautiful red Mustang and gets out. This is all superbly framed in a long shot by an ornamental oriental fence. Even on the drive up to his masters home he is followed by a helicopter. This is filmed smoothly you have a side portrait of Norris driving and outside the passenger window you see the copter flying at his side. There's also a nice sequence where Kane runs from his house down his pier to his private jetty opens his speedboats enclosure jumps in and speeds away. There is a lot in this film that Carver should be proud about. Even the slow motion sections of the fight scene's work. When a lot of martial arts opted to speed up the action slowing it down works really well  especially when you have a master of the arts like Norris.Carver also sets a nice rollercoaster pace for the movie. He knows when to slow down to drive the plot and quicken it up to boost excitement and tension. A Lot of filmmakers could take a few notes from this film.The only thing in the film that irked me was the love interest Maggie Cooper. This was mainly for Sullivan's wooden performance. In some scenes she appears so laid back that she may have been sampling the product the bad guys were moving.If you like your martial arts flicks and are not too worried about plot then I would recommend this one to you. It may not be intellectually brilliant but it is kick ass entertaining.".

Teaming up with his gruff and witty mentor James Chan Mako Sean sets about determining the identity of some dope smugglers.As far as vengeance for killing my loved ones cinema goes An Eye for an Eye is agreeable entertainment. An engaging Chuck delivers one of his better performances and his supporting cast is pretty damn eclectic. His adversary is a smooth and dapper Sir Christopher Lee as news station owner Morgan Canfield. Lee is cool but is kind of wasted in this part. Richard Shaft Roundtree is Chucks' boss one of those standard issue superior officers who's weary of his employees' methods. The gorgeous and sexy Rosalind Chao is effective as the partners' grieving girlfriend Maggie Cooper is likewise pleasing to watch as Chucks' love interest. A fine assortment of first rate character actors also helps matters the briefly seen Kiser of Weekend at Bernie's fame Stuart Pankin as effeminate pimp Nicky LaBelle Matt Clark as one of Chucks' colleagues and Mel Novak as the weaselly Montoya. The massive screen villain Professor Toru Tanaka makes quite the impression as a heavy  named The Professor  who in one uproarious scene expresses his displeasure by beating up a Volkswagen. J.E. Freeman Robert Behling and Nancy Fish have bits. But the show is completely stolen by the hilarious Mako who endlessly criticizes Chucks' technique and reels off one liners. I tried to question him...he preferred to expire.In the first of his two movies with Chuck director Steve Carver delivers the expected action with skill and keeps the story moving forward at a good pace. Chuck kicks ass in high style and has a nice showdown with the Professor complete with silly sound effects. There's some fine location work in San Francisco and a solid music score by composer William Goldstein.An Eye for an Eye isn't one of Chucks' best but it does just fine for a nights' viewing. The sense of humour does help quite a bit.Seven out of 10.".

The story itself is pretty much your standard revenge tale but where the film really succeeds is with its nonstop action and a pretty stellar cast. The film certainly has some flaws here and there but if you're a fan of 80's action movies then it's a must see for its entertainment value.As I said the best thing going for the picture was the very good cast. You've got Norris playing the type of role that suits him well. He's certainly believable in the role of a cop and his martial arts skills add most of the fun. You've got Mako in a supporting part and he adds some nice comic touch. Richard Roundtree was a bad muthafucer long before Samuel L. Jackson and he's fun here. Then you've got Christopher Lee is a somewhat thankless role but he's still fun to watch. Matt Clark and Rosalind Chao are good in their small roles as well. Then there's Professor Toru Tanaka who plays one of the bad guys and nearly steals the show every time he's on screen.The San Francisco location certainly help the film and we're also given a nice score as well as some good cinematography. Of course people are coming to a film liek this for the action and there's plenty of that. Countless shoot outs and various other forms of violence certainly make the film quite memorable.

	schema:headline " Star vehicle for Norris offers raw entertainment throughout";
	schema:reviewBody "A light entertaining martial arts thriller from Chuck Norris personally this is a favourite of mine. There's a flow of almost constant action things never become too bogged down in talk while the plot is still interesting enough and contains enough twists to be watchable. Plus the action in this film is hugely enjoyable and the best I've seen from Norris. And what a cast to die for! Norris himself is his usual self wooden but athletic. The villain here is played by Christopher Lee doing his usual charming polite routine while secretly fronting a major drugs ring. Lee seems somewhat out of place in this movie and it's odd to watch him get to grips with Norris in the modern setting but his appearance is a blessing for a horror fan like me.Richard Roundtree plays his typical persona  gruff but goodnatured  as Norris' superior who frequently gets thwarted by the big man. Mako that dependable supporting actor is a wise old martial arts expert who gets all of the best lines in his clichd but fun role. Also popping up are Terry Kiser only briefly though and Professor Toru Tanaka who has great fun as a clubfooted villain who finally goes oneonone with Norris in a battle to the death. Matt Clark a familiar character actor from 1970s television bags the supporting role with most character depth.What I like most about this movie is the action though as it's fast and overthetop all the way. Here Norris is at home breaking arms and necks in the manner of Steven Seagal and there are there expertlyorchestrated fights firstly at Mako's home secondly on a cargo ship and the finale at Lee's mountaintop house. Watching Norris battle and chop a dozen villains at each location is a lot of fun and the high death toll makes this great viewing for action fans. Although not the most original or inspired of action movies AN EYE FOR AN EYE is certainly one of the most enjoyable in terms of raw entertainment.".

	onyx:emotionText "A light entertaining martial arts thriller from Chuck Norris personally this is a favourite of mine. There's a flow of almost constant action things never become too bogged down in talk while the plot is still interesting enough and contains enough twists to be watchable. Plus the action in this film is hugely enjoyable and the best I've seen from Norris. And what a cast to die for! Norris himself is his usual self wooden but athletic. The villain here is played by Christopher Lee doing his usual charming polite routine while secretly fronting a major drugs ring. Lee seems somewhat out of place in this movie and it's odd to watch him get to grips with Norris in the modern setting but his appearance is a blessing for a horror fan like me.Richard Roundtree plays his typical persona  gruff but goodnatured  as Norris' superior who frequently gets thwarted by the big man. Mako that dependable supporting actor is a wise old martial arts expert who gets all of the best lines in his clichd but fun role. Also popping up are Terry Kiser only briefly though and Professor Toru Tanaka who has great fun as a clubfooted villain who finally goes oneonone with Norris in a battle to the death.

The plot too is pretty routine the star along with his cop partner gets ambushed due to a snitch within the Police force during a raid on some drug dealers  with the latter losing his life in gruesome fashion. Receiving no support from his superior Richard Roundtree he gives up his gun and badge  but needless to say continues the investigation on his own. This becomes even more personal when his partner's Asian TV reporter wife engaged in her own expose' of drug trafficking first contacts Norris that she may have acquired a lead on the villains and then winds up dead herself before she can divulge the information to the hero. Soon however he acquires a couple of associates the dead woman's father Mako himself a martial arts expert and who often comments wryly on Norris' own skills and her coworker who just happens to live in the same building and who eventually goes to live with our protagonist and his dog after her own place is ransacked at one point even comforting a perspiring Norris in the wake of a nightmare.Lee plays the TV station head but his mere casting gives away his identity as the head of the smugglers while Matt Clark is the crooked cop who gets to die violently for his double face.

It's often difficult to understand why anybody does anything in AEfaE. An informant lures two detectives into a dark alley that seems like an obvious trap. A young woman flees from nasty assassins but stops at her apartment to pack a few things because they'll never think of looking for her there. A crime lord hires several dozen guards armed with Uzi submachine guns to guard his citadel but ships the largest shipment of heroin ever in a truck with no guards or armed escort. One character tells another that they had been a good team but they hadn't actually done much of anything together. A character criticizes Kane's martial arts form but some sort of demonstration or visual would have been much more effective. The MacGuffin is discovered through a deus ex machina plot device involving a garment that really had no reason to be where it had been. The Odd Joblooking henchman has a foot deformity of some sort and wears an elevated orthopedic shoe but it doesn't play in the plot. It may slow him a bit which lessens the drama but it's never exploited as a weakness when Kane fights him. Heroin is smuggled in a manner that would seem clever for small quantities but doesn't make much sense if they're making the largest shipment in history  but it provides an excuse for visuals. Much of the movie seems contrived and episodic. The gunfights don't seem at all realistic. Henchmen shoot up glassware for no particular reason but empty submachine gun clips into a culdesac without even scratching the hero's car. Everybody seems to shoot blindly. Norris does some impressive kicks but the fight scenes aren't staged very imaginatively. They have continuity that is missing from the percussively edited scenes in films like the Bourne series but they seem on the level television programs. The reversal in his confrontation against Tanaka's villain doesn't seem realistic. The filmmakers tried to create a psychological dimension in which Kane is tormented by dreams and memories but it isn't effective. AEfaE suffices as mindless entertainment but feels like a television show with a couple of bare breasts while IJatRotLA still feels like a cinematic experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "A sweeping claim? Perhaps. But despite the presence in Hollywood over sixty subsequent years of Ford Wyler Kubrick Coppola Scorsese et al The Hunchback of Notre Dame remains as fresh as emotionally resonant and yes as powerfully artistic as the day it was made. What constitutes 'art' is of course a personal matter just as the Breughellike compositions of Hunchback might be as mystifying to someone whose favourite film is A Clockwork Orange Lichtenstein?. But what makes Hunchback so satisfying as art is precisely that its makers didn't set out with art in mind. Dieterle and his cocreators embarked on the project with the aim of telling a great yarn making it look authentic and above all ENTERTAINING the audience. It is to this end that the Grand Guignol excesses of the novel were trimmed or altered and the Hollywood bittersweet ending imposed. Audiences filed out with their Kleenex in hand having witnessed a threering circus of a movie then went home to read the warsoaked newspapers.  Virtually every frame of this movie could be taken in isolation made into a poster and hung on a wall. Examples include Gringoire cradling the dying Clopin as a rivulet of lead trickles past in the background the voyeuristic eye of Quasimodo peering through fence palings at the dancing Esmeralda  I could go on and on. And pervading it all is the magnificent score of Alfred Newman surely his finest ever.  Rather than sing its obvious praises the film can simply speak for itself. As narrative as character as cinema craft it is totally successful throughout. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favourite film of all time bar none. Ten out of ten".

Audiences filed out with their Kleenex in hand having witnessed a threering circus of a movie then went home to read the warsoaked newspapers.  Virtually every frame of this movie could be taken in isolation made into a poster and hung on a wall. Examples include Gringoire cradling the dying Clopin as a rivulet of lead trickles past in the background the voyeuristic eye of Quasimodo peering through fence palings at the dancing Esmeralda  I could go on and on. And pervading it all is the magnificent score of Alfred Newman surely his finest ever.  Rather than sing its obvious praises the film can simply speak for itself. As narrative as character as cinema craft it is totally successful throughout. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favourite film of all time bar none. Ten out of ten";

	schema:headline " Notre Dame's Celebrated Bell Ringer";
	schema:reviewBody "Though the French have done many versions of Victor Hugo's celebrated classic this version starring Charles Laughton has certainly stood the test of time and is the best known and loved in the English speaking world.Lon Chaney Sr. did an acclaimed silent version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Laughton was following a great tradition. And he did it in the manner of Chaney almost without dialog. Not that Hugo wrote too much dialog for Quasimodo in his story but except for his time with Esmerelda in the tower after he rescues her Laughton is almost speechless in the film. Of course his character in addition to being deformed is also deaf from the ringing of those cathedral bells.Quasimodo born deformed as he was was left as an orphan on the steps of the Notre Dame cathedral in medieval Paris. Raised in the sheltered atmosphere of the church he derives some joy in his duties as the bell ringer in the tower. His mentor is the brother of the archbishop played by Cedric Hardwicke and the archbishop is Walter Hampden. Quasimodo's life is useful but without love. But Laughton is crushing out on Esmerelda the gypsy girl played by Maureen O'Hara in her American screen debut. Problem is that Hardwicke is also getting hot and bothered by her.Hardwicke's role is the second best acted in the film next to Laughton's. He's a man with shall we say some issues. He's purportedly committed to the church and it's celibacy requirements. But Dr. Freud wasn't around back in the day of Louis XI to tell us about sex drives. Hardwicke's desires mean only one thing Esmerelda has to have bewitched him. When he kills Alan Marshal who is also interested in Maureen and looks like he's about to round third so to speak the blame goes on Maureen.What I like about the story is how the lives of two very ordinary people Quasimodo and Esmerelda become the focal point for a whole lot of religious and political issues of the day. The church the peasants the just developing middle class and the nobility all have an agenda as far as the Esmerelda murder case is going. The only agenda poor Quasimodo has is he's in love with her.Maureen O'Hara who was a discovery of Charles Laughton back in the United Kingdom was pushed by Laughton for the role of Esmerelda and traveled with him to America to play the part. She was grateful to him ever afterwards for any career she had and can't praise him enough for getting RKO to sign her.Harry Davenport probably plays the most benign Louis XI ever put on film. It sure is a far cry from Basil Rathbone in If I Were King or Robert Morley in Quentin Durward. He plays him like the kindly grandfather he usually plays on screen.Thomas Mitchell as Clopin the king of beggars and Edmond O'Brien as Gringoire the poet are two other significant roles. O'Brien gets his first substantial role on screen in The Hunchback of Notre Dame and this was a banner year for Thomas Mitchell. In 1939 he was also in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Gone With the Wind and Stagecoach for which he won Best Supporting Actor. He could have though for any one of these films.When all is said and done though the film belongs to Charles Laughton who was the screen's best portrayer of tortured humanity. Even beneath all of Bud Westmore's grotesque makeup we can feel his anguish. He's not a stupid man Quasimodo he knows how repulsive he is to most of the human race. He's childlike though something like Peter Sellers in Being There another character raised in a secluded atmosphere.To see Charles Laughton at the top of his game in my humble opinion one has to see The Hunchback of Notre Dame.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was my favorite movie as a kid from the first time I saw it on TV in the third grade. The look and the atmosphere of it have lodged ineradicably in a corner of my mind ever since and the rescue of Esmeralda from the gibbet was and probably still is my favorite scene in a Hollywood movie. I never got to see the movie theatrically until a few years ago when Disney hosted a showing as an excuse to preview clips of its animated version which is based on this movie more than on the novel. The movie probably played as strongly then as it had fifty years earlier and I have no doubt it will play the same in another fifty years. Seeing it with an audience made me realize for the first time that it is Sir Cedric Hardwicke's movie rather than Laughton's. He dominates the story and commands the screen whenever he appears. Since the Hays Office prohibited showing a lubricious priest the writers did something clever they changed the character into Javert from Hugo's Les Miserables here promoted to chief prosecutor and a hypocritically highminded celibate as Esmeralda puts it he seems like a priest without being one. Hardwicke's performance is superbly subtle and his character must be one of the most intimately despicable movie villains of all time. Laughton is terrific. too his cadences on lines like She gave me a drink of water are classic. When Mandy Patinkin played the part he himself admitted that he was simply replaying Laughton's score and hoping he'd be able to hit all the notes. As for Maureen O'Hara if I came across a gypsy dancer like her I'd be moved to swing into the square and rescue her myself. And how can anyone not like Thomas Mitchell's beggar king? The only substantial fault in the playing I think is Harry Davenport's characterization of Louis XI which is funny but more broadly written and played than what surrounds it. Strangely although this is more a horror film than the other versions of the novel and contains many frightening scenes I never thought of it as belonging to that genre and I still don't. It's much more than that. I knew someone who called it Hollywood's finest hour he can't have been far wrong.".

Take my word for this I know from painful experience  sighCharles Laughton is exceptional and Maureen O'Hara would make any man swoon and is perfect for the part of Esmerelda.  The support includes the usual suspectsThomas Mitchell Harry Davenport and many other familiar character actors.  Strike up the band and start the parade.  Thunderous applause. Most highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Laughton's boisterous portrayal of Quasimodo and Maureen O'Hara's charm as Esmerelda are two of the things that make this version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame a fine production that still works very well. Most of the versions of the story have been at least watchable because the Victor Hugo novel provides so much good material to work with much of it wellsuited for cinema. This adaptation though is one of the best at making good use of what it offers.It's interesting to compare this picture with the 1923 Lon Chaney version  not for the sake of ranking them since both are fully worthy of attention in their own right but because they offer somewhat different strengths and because they emphasize somewhat different aspects of the story.Chaney and Laughton are both quite effective as Quasimodo each giving an interpretation of the character that corresponds to the actor's skills. Laughton brings out Quasimodo's feelings and perspective quite well. In this version for example the flogging scene is longer and more detailed and it is one of Laughton's most effective scenes. Chaney is particularly good at reacting to the other characters and their actions. Both give the character a distinctive and memorable look.O'Hara is also one of this adaptation's strengths. Patsy Ruth Miller was good in the Chaney version but O'Hara has the advantage of spoken dialogue and she makes the character of Esmerelda her own.While the Chaney version especially emphasized the atmosphere this one has quite a bit of action. The tumultuous climactic sequences are done quite well and they leave a vivid impression. Overall this is a very satisfying adaptation of the fine classic novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "The general public responds to the grotesque with a curious mixture of shock fascination and repulsion. In the 15th century where society was too ignorant to understand the consequences of deformity men like Quasimodo were shunned from the community and considered evil influences  as we approach modern times it seems that people have changed little as depicted in David Lynch's heartbreaking 'The Elephant Man 1980.' Despite the proud if misguided belief that humans judge each other based on their intelligence and personality our basic primal instinct often proves dominant. Just as many recoil in horror at the misshapen features of the unfortunate Quasimodo an entire audience is left entranced by the beautiful dancing body of Esmeralda Maureen O'Hara momentarily forgetting that she is of the reviled gypsy faith. Victor Hugo's 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame has long been a popular source for cinematic adaptations and William Dieterle's 1939 version is often considered one of the best featuring an incredibly heartfelt performance from Charles Laughton as the titular hunchback of Notre Dame cathedral.When he initially published his novel Hugo titled the story NotreDame de Paris. He was subsequently dissatisfied with the English translation of the title since it implied that the Quasimodo was the story's main character when in fact he had originally intended it to be a celebration of the cathedral itself an attempt to preserve the famed monument. This objective is certainly an admirable one but as far as Dieterle's film is concerned it results in a somewhat uneven narrative. Gringoire Edmond O'Brien and Esmerelda certainly serve the story adequately enough but our thoughts and sympathies are forever with the tragic Quasimodo and any scene that doesn't feature him seems insignificant  perhaps further proof of our natural fascination towards the grotesque. Also playing major roles in the story are Frollo Sir Cedric Hardwicke Quasimodo's sinister mentor who falls in love and is tormented by rejection and King Louis XI Harry Davenport the openminded but rather naive French royal a far cry from what history tells us of the real Louis XI.Though screenwriters Sonya Levien and Bruno Frank fashioned Victor Hugo's conclusion into what has been called a happy ending it nonetheless remains the most heartbreakingly tragic finale I've seen in a long while. Esmerelda may have been saved from hanging but the true hero of the story is neglected and abandoned in the highest reaches of the cathedral. His final sentiment expressing the desire to be made of stone is delivered with incredible poignancy by Laughton and speaks of a lifetime of unimaginable isolation and desolation. This final line stresses the terrible irony of Quasimodo's predicament as a stone chimera however gruesome his artistry would be celebrated by thousands of admirers as he briefly experienced early in the film when a frenetic crowd informally crowned him king. However more importantly being made of stone would simply bring an end to his unspeakable pain to the incessant aching of a heart that desires a woman he could never and will never have for himself.".

	schema:headline " The Best Version as far as film goes";
	schema:reviewBody "1939 was a banner year for the movies  possibly the best year. With titles like STAGECOACH GONE WITH THE WIND MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON THE WIZARD OF OZ and GOODBYE MR. CHIPS it was the best year for the old sound film system of the big studios. Among the great films was this one  the second of two classic versions of the Victor Hugo novel the 1923 silent version with Lon Chaney being the first. Let us acknowledge that this version is the most fun and the one people turn to. It is reminiscent of the best known and liked version of LES MISERABLES also a novel by Hugo made by Paramount in 1935 and starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton. That Laughton should appear in both shows his remarkable versatility as Hollywood's greatest character actor of his period. Inspector Javert is as unsympathetic a figure as Quasimodo is a sympathetic one. It is true that the makeup on the unfortunate hunchback makes him initially a figure to pity but his heroism rises in the movie as it does in the novel so that the reader never deserts him. The reader never feels that way about Inspector Javert.This and JAMAICA INN were both made in 1939 and both paired Laughton and Maureen O'Hara. Here O'Hara's Esmaralda is both lovely and powerless a gypsy hated for her background in superstitious and medieval France. Yet she is lusted after by so many. Forgetting the hunchback there are Phoebus Gringoire and not least Claude Frollo. Alan Marshall plays Captain Phoebus as the strawman hero he is  he is strong and manly on the surface but he is easily dismissed particularly by the conniving villain. Edmond O'Brien is partly a comic figure  Hugo's way of poking fun at himself perhaps as he was a poet like Gringoire. But I doubt if Hugo ever yelled in disappointment for failing to be crowned King of the Fools for a festival. Then there is Cedric Hardwicke's Frollo. Leslie Halliwell in HALLIWELL'S HUNDRED reviews the film and says it is Hardwicke's best performance. Perhaps I'd opt for his father in the 1949 THE WINSLOW BOY first. He is a Machiavellian before the Italian political philosopher came upon the scene busy pulling invisible wires from the church to control the country the church and the monarchy. But he is unaware of his Achilles' heel. A member of a celibate profession he finds himself falling for a woman  and one from a despised and suspect group. Fighting his inclinations but at the same time giving into them he is the motivator of all the evil in the plot  not only against Esmeralda but Quasimodo and the citizens of Paris. His fate is as unlamented by the viewers as that of Javert was in LES MISERABLES.Harry Davenport and Walter Hampden play King Louis XI of France and the archbishop of Paris Frollo's brother. It was an early film role for the elderly Hampden and he gives a good account for himself but there really enough for himself until the conclusion when coming to his senses he berates his brother had Frollo not met his fate he would have lost his power. Davenport is interesting. Usually playing kindly lovable grandpas MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS is a fine example he does not leave that image here. But as has been mentioned in another review of this film Louis XI was an excellent King of France  clever and careful. But he was the Spider King. Basil Rathbone's performance in IF I WERE KING two years earlier was closer to the mark. To be a Spider King one has to be devilishly ruthless trapping enemies in webs. Davenport's kindly old codger King is not that way at all. I would also add that the performance of Thomas Mitchell as the King of Paris' beggars is equally good  a wise opportunist who is unable to achieve what he wishes the looting of the rich by his mob signaled by their assault on the cathedral.By now one can see that I like this film  it is a rousing entertainment and emotionally quite fulfilling. But was it the novel? I will leave that for another review.".

He also uses a stirring Hallelujah chorus by uncredited Austrian Jewish migr Ernst Toch in Hollywood to escape the Nazis for the memorable scene where Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda reprised at the film's closing sequence as the camera pulls back from Notre Dame.It's a great pity that a better restoration cannot be achieved for this beautiful film than is currently available on DVD.

This movie is a great example of expressionist art as the director uses the sets and cinematography to create a mood of suspense that permeates throughout the entire movie. Many of the scenes are spectacular and have become iconic. This movie is definitely a classic.There's a saying They don't make 'em like that anymore. This saying is especially true for the 1939 classic The Hunchback of Notre Dame. What makes this movie so great is 1. the story 2. the screenplay and 3. the acting. Surprising is Edmund O'Brien's excellent portrayal of the people's poet Gringoire. But of course the star of the movie is Charles Laughton whose portrayal of the poor and hapless Quasimodo who is hopelessly in love with the beautiful Esmeralda transforms this movie from an interesting period piece into a really powerful story. For this movie is truly dramatic  in its portrayal of the power of the Church in medieval society its portrayal of the people themselves who are angry restless and desperate and its portrayal of an unfortunate man Quasimodo an outcast who transcends his place in society to defend the woman he loves without conditions and protect the Church and in the process becomes a hero. By the way Maureen O'Hara's portrayal of the gypsy girl Esmeralda is so strong and evocative that one cannot help but empathize with the character who is the very personification of victimization. If you want to watch a classic movie then this is the right movie for you.".

However it is Gringoire Edmond O'Brien a poet and playwright who leads the group of admirers which includes Father Frollo to see which one will end up possessing the girl in a time when superstition possessed most of Europe.

But I must say that this version surpasses that one and it's mainly due to Charles Laughton. He makes this deformed bellringer of Notre Dame cathedral even with his marred looks and superstrength at once a sympathetic figure who we root for. Besides Laughton there is Sir Cedric Hardwicke who plays Archdeacon Claude Frollo of Notre Dame the man who has been Quasimodo's caretaker since the Hunchback's youth. But now Frollo is a slimy character who falls in love with Maureen O'Hara's gypsy girl Esmerelda and is not above committing murder to get to her. O'Hara is very young and beautiful and causes almost every man who sees her to fall in love with her. This includes an almost unrecognizable Edmund O'Brien as a young performer for the poor of Paris. And of course the Hunchback falls for her but knows he can never have her. But he is not bitter about it like others and risks his life for Esmerelda. The movie taken on its own is fine entertainment. But Laughton lifts it above standard fare and makes it a classic. I've seen lots of Laughton films but this is currently my favorite of his. Highly recommended.".

Along with impressive sets moody black and white photography and a powerful Alfred Newman score this film remains a formidable artistic achievement.Despite Laughton's makeup delivering plenty of shock value his character retains sympathy. The audience is denied the comfort of seeing Quasimodo as a creature that could not exist in real life. He is neither a supernatural being nor a creation of a mad scientist. Laughton's Quasimodo is an afflicted but real human being  a kindred spirit of the truelife Elephant Man. Laughton is barely recognisable  those who know his work may recognise him by the mole on his left cheek. Irish actress Maureen O'Hara in her Hollywood debut plays the other key figure in the story Esmeralda. She fairly glows in this film and has an effect on men not unlike the effect Cameron Diaz's character has on them in Something About Mary. Males of all ages hunchbacked or otherwise are attracted to her. Many scenes stay in the memory. When Quasimodo is caught watching Esmeralda dancing during the Festival of Fools his head is pushed through a hole on a stage to be evaluated by the crowd. Although great advances have been made in makeup and special effects since 1939 the first sight of Laughton's Quasimodo still has the power to shock. In the film's most disturbing sequence Quasimodo is whipped for attempting to abduct Esmeralda on the orders of his guardian. After his tunic is ripped away to expose his hump he receives 50 lashes in a scene that is still brutal despite 70 intervening years of cinematic excess. The brutality is only relieved when Esmeralda steps forward to give him water. When Quasimodo attempts to hide his ugliness from Esmeralda in the bell tower of Notre Dame it illustrates Laughton's ability to project a character through pounds of makeup. He also projected onto his character the way he felt about his own lack of physical attractiveness.Laughton searched within painful life experiences to inform his roles. He didn't have to look far for pain in this demanding film. Apparently the hours spent applying his makeup put a strain on Laughton's relationship with his makeup artists and at some point they humiliated Laughton by pinning him down and squirting soda water in his face. Laughton drew on such experiences to help him plumb the depths of Quasimodo's despair. In my opinion through Laughton's inspired performance and superb production values the 1939 film eclipses all the other versions. Despite many remakes this remains the definitive film version.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a theory I've invented called Humphrey Bogartitis. Humphrey Bogartitis dictates that whatever performance you first watch of an actor will mark how you see him or her forever after. Humphrey Bogart famous for his gangster and detective films played the nice guy in The African Queen. Since The African Queen was the first Humphrey Bogart movie I ever saw I always think of him as being nice and sweet. The first Charles Laughton movie I ever saw was The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Even though Charles famously played such villains as Captain Bligh Inspector Javert Captain Kidd and King Henry VIII I always think of him as Quasimodo. To me Charles Laughton is pitiful and lovable and I always want to reach into the screen and envelop him in a big hug.Disney patterned their drawing of Quasimodo after Charles Laughton and when you watch this 1939 versionthere have been quite a few remakesyou can see the numerous similarities between it and the cartoon. Cedric Hardwicke plays the cruel cold Judge Frollo and a seventeenyearold Maureen O'Hara plays the wild but loving Esmerelda. Charles Laughton discovered Maureen and helped her get the part adding an extra sweetness to their scenes together. Just as in the cartoon there's a Clopin played by Thomas Mitchell and a Phoebus played by Alan Marshal. The order of scenes is nearly identical but there's an added sadness the cartoon understandably chose to cut Quasimodo is deaf.If you watch five minutes of Charles Laughton's performance without bursting into tears you've misplaced your heart. It's one of those performances like Robert De Niro in Awakenings Sean Penn in I Am Sam and Shirley Booth in Come Back Little Sheba that reduces you to a puddle within minutes. In itself The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a heartwrenching story but Charles's incredible performance makes it one of the great classics of the silver screen and certainly the most famous film adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel. As you might expect since the Academy snubs better performances than it awards Charles Laughton wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance. You may have already seen the famous Sanctuary! scene and while I'm sure that scene brought tears to your eyes I highly recommend you watch the full movie to make good use of that box of Kleenex going to waste on your coffee table.".

The film is entertaining and has elements of romance and humor. It also many beautiful shots such as those at the 'festival of fools' and those highlighting an impressive studio version of Notre Dame and its gargoyles. Laughton is brilliant as Quasimodo and the rest of the cast is strong as well including Maureen O'Hara as Esmerelda the gypsy woman who will end up having four men fall for her. I have to say though Harry Davenport is not regal enough in his role as King Louis XI.

It seems to me that in this 2nd version Albers is better cast though I never saw the 1930 version. Albers easily dominates the film and plays his part with a lot of joy and irony. The makers gave him the chance to render a song from his standard repertoire in at the same time the best scene in the film during the underworld part Albers sings Beim ersten Mal da tut's noch Weh the song he sang for the first time in Helmut Kutner's Grosse Freiheit Nr 7 of 1943. This is also the last film in which Hans Albers had a really good part. After this film came the only passable Der Mann im Strom q.v. and two others with Albers I would not care to mention. Though the film can be considered a Hans Albers vehicle in retrospect York surely did not aim for it. His aim was to make a psychological thriller. As such it is good entertainment but the psychological element the women killer who loves his mother too much is on the simple side to say the least and is also taken to seriously that is a bit more tongueincheek would have helped to make it acceptable. There are some big problems with the continuity of the script at at least two occasions the action jumps without any logic. Watch how the film jumps from the bar to the arrest of Albers someone forgot to bridge the two scenes.".

It's an observance of Japanese culture and how they don't really like giant monsters anymore...but in this world the giant monsters still exist. And Daisuke is unappreciated as such. Very cool film but I didn't find it quite as uproariously hilarious as it's portrayed. That's what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't what I got. Not that that was a bad thing! I just didn't get what I was expecting at all.All in all a good film.

As a documentary the film succeeds admirably.

However the film's special effects are cheesy but actually add to the representation of a man stuck firmly in a meager existence. Daisato's life is entirely devoid of any social support network. He visits a grandfather but this man is suffering from dementia in a nursing home and is in worse shape than our hero. Daisato is allowed visitation with his wife and daughter twice a year and his 'friendships' are paid geisha girls with whom he drinks heavily.

Tommy Cooper had it Billy Connelly has it sometimes  the ability to make you laugh the moment they appear on stage. I've followed Matsumoto and Downtown since 1989 when I first encountered them on the sketch comedy show Yume de Aetara. A lot of his experimental comedy on the small screen since then has been outrageous cerebral andor scatological. It is almost always riotous and for that reason I was expecting more of the same here. Part of Matsumoto's genius is in how he reigns in his basic instincts creating a tension for domestic audiences while also fashioning a clever narrative with universal appeal. That tension makes for a glorious release when classic Matsumoto moments do appear such as standing in front of giant purple underpants or the edit to his pixelated daughter in a bunny hat declaiming her indifference to her father in contrast to the sentimental speech on her he has just given.Many Japanese geinojin seem fettered by the jimusho system that controls their creative output and you feel sympathy for the truly talented ones who seem capable of so much more than the usual primetime foolishness Takuya Kimura take note. I always had a sneaking suspicion Downtown's Hamadasan could rise to a serious dramatic role if given the chance so it is a pleasant surprise to be blindsided by Matsumoto here. Understated even moving in places with a wonderfully comic climactic scene where the 'traditional' Matsumoto surfaces Big Man Japan is a refreshing addition to Matsumoto's array of comic talent. Small mention to Ua as the mercenary manager a coldblooded portrayal. Was Matsumoto having a sly dig at his Jimusho's creative accounting? Matsumoto bites the hand that feeds here but then feeds them in turn with the grosses this film has earned. The man is practically reinventing the term irony in art and in his life. Genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cinema in the East differs from cinema in the West. But was there ever a better film to illustrate this than Dainipponjin? Since last year big monster have returned to the big screen. The USA gave us Cloverfield Japan is giving us Dainipponjin. Both movies share some superficial similarities but at the same time they couldn't be any more different.It must be said that the Kaiju big monster genre in Japan never really lost its popularity. Gamera Gojira and Ultraman are still hot in the land of the rising sun. But even in Japan they felt the need to inject the genre with some fresh juice. Cloverfield did it by adding a serious touch to the formula Matsumoto decided there were more innovative ways.Similar to Cloverfield Dainipponjin starts of slow hiding it's true face behind a facade of boredom. The first 20 or so minutes are dedicated to a bored boring middleaged washedout Japanese guy that is followed by a television crew for a documentary. Apparently he's somewhat of a star but it's never revealed why he's be anything special. Until he runs off to a power plant turns into a big huge cgi guy and walks off to battle monsters. Uhuh.Our hero is actually a monster fighter product of a proud family of monster fighters that lost their fame after several generations. Times are different and people don't really look up to monster fighters anymore. Still from time to time he jumps into his purple nickers gets electrocuted through his nipples and becomes this colossal guy fighting of a series of wackedout monsters to get the viewer rates going.The change of tone between the moc doc scenes and the actual fights is enormous. The documentary is as boring as can be but the deadpan humor remains at all times even when long overdue which makes the film weirder and weirder as it continues. When we finally see his cute little 8year old daughter with a distorted voice and a mosaic in front of her face the film had completely won me over.The fight sequences are incredibly silly but amazingly funny. The monsters are simply hilarious and weird and even though the tone changes the same amount of seriousness is still present during the action scenes. It's just plain weird to see a big guy arguing with a farting squidflower monster because he's apparently blocking the traffic.Visually the film does what it needs to do. The documentary scenes are simple a bit boring but effective. The fight sequences are technically sub par but apply all means necessary to create monsters that are as freaky as they are funny. Every monster is memorable and while the technical side of things might not be perfect it gives the film a distinct look that will defend it from bad aging and will keep the scenes attractive in years to come. Not only that the visual style is just freakin' hilarious too.The film finally flips in the last fifteen minutes. And while those scenes are still pretty damn funny I think I would've preferred it if it had kept its deadpan humor going until the end. Still this film is filled to the brim with memorable scenes. It's been a long time since I've been this amused with a comedy. Some knowledge of the Kaiju genre is certainly a plus as there are several spoofs you will miss otherwise but even without it you can grasp most of the humor at hand.As a little bonus it's extra fun to read or watch reactions of people who didn't quite grasp the humor in this film. The humor throughout the film requires a certain state of mind which makes it all the better. A must see this one if only to marvel at the insane creations and the wacky surreal scenes that come from a silly subject turned serious. 4.55.0".

	schema:reviewBody "Hitoshi Matsumoto's wonderfully deadpan Big Man Japan DaiNihonjin is a brilliantly hilarious send up of Japan's giant monster movies of yesteryear. A postmodernist at heart Matsumoto flips the genre conventions grounding the beautifully weird world of Big Man Japan in reality through a dry mocumentary style that mixes interviews archival footage and computer animated fight scenes with a razor's wit.Masaru Daisato is the latest in a long legacy of men who grow to mammoth proportions when juiced with electricity. Masaru spends most of his time as a normalsized human being surviving on a meager government stipend in a grimy suburb of Tokyo. But when strange monsters attack and believe me they are strange Masaru is hooked up to a power plant and juiced with enough electricity to grow into a purple underweared giant.Not that any of this endears Masaru to the citizens of Japan. The road to the power plant is plastered with signs critical of Masaru's actions and abilities. His house is covered in threatening graffiti and vandalized on a daily basis. Masaru is an outsider in a country of insiders a colorful anachronism in increasingly bland times.Perspective is a central theme in Big Man Japan's giant monster weirdness. Does having the ability to turn into a giant and save the country from destructive buildingstomping monsters make you a hero or a freak? It all depends on who you ask.There's no doubt that Masaru is a loser. When not attacking giant monsters with a large pipe Masaru sits in his graffiticovered home eating dehydrated seaweed It only grows big when you need it. while neighbors throw bricks through his windows. Masaru's wife and daughter have left him photos are all that remains of his profession's illustrious past and his show routinely earns less ratings than the weather report. No one ever said it was easy being big.And perhaps this is the biggest joke in Matsumoto's wonderfully awkward film. Godzilla eventually became a friend of the children saving Japan from countless invading monsters but he was always a foreigner. Godzilla called Monster Island home not the gray slums of Tokyo. Ultraman was from outer space not Osaka. This is an important difference. Forced to live among the very people he fights to protect Masaru became the biggest oddity in a hegemonic society based on Confucian values.The world of Big Man Japan is one of dashed hopes and squandered potential a world where Masaru's senile grandfather made so by repeated exposure to high levels of electricity zaps himself giant and wanders through the city. And the monsters as outrageously weird as they may be never actually seem threatening in any way.Instead the creatures with their combovers phallic eyes and sexual perversions seem as oblivious as children that their actions do any harm. Masaru dispatches the beasts by clubbing them once in the head not through a long drawn out fight and their souls ascend to heaven in a campy 8bit video game fashion.And by the end when Matsumoto drops the mocumentary cameras and the computer animation for a ridiculous symbolismheavy homage to cheesy rubber suits and miniature sets fare like Ultraman it hardly makes sense but is hilarious nonetheless. I would've preferred Big Man Japan didn't end with an allegory about JapanChina relations and the reliance on the American military for protection filtered through campy 1970s kaiju sensibilities but what the hell it was one crazy ride.Taken from httpwww.midnighttrash.net?p677 MidnightTrash.net Your guide to everything under the radar.".

	schema:reviewBody "Big Man Japan is one of the weirder films I've seen from Japan and anyone who's passingly familiar with Japanese cinema knows what a statement that is. Starring written by directed by and produced by one man comedy auteur Hitoshi Matusmoto Big Man Japan tells the tale of Masaru Daisato also known as Big Man Japan the giant 30 foot tall super hero that defends Japan from invading monsters in a similar vein to Ultraman and other Kaiju films.The twist being that everything in Masaru's life including his monster fighting absolutely sucks and the people of Japan hate him and think he's terrible at his job.That's a brilliant high concept but it's not really the film that Big Man Japan gives us and partly that's why the film is so odd. It's not the subject matter although stuff like a giant starfishvagina monster that stinks is pretty oddball but rather the tone. Big Man Japan is deadpan to the point that it seems sometimes to be actively taunting the audience with how unfunny it's being. Long sequences of the film are taken up with Masaru eating at a noodle place driving his scooter talking about how he likes umbrellas and doing other mundane tasks all filmed in a documentary style with minimal camera movement and subtle acting. It's actively boring at times but it seems to be intentional because the central gag is presenting the absurd and surreal monster battles in as deadpan and ordinary a way as the mundane aspects of Masaru's life. The long boring segments means the eventual pay off of a giant pair of purple pants seems all the funnier. Not that the documentary segments are without humour particularly the scene with Masaru's daughter in her bunny hat and pixelated face but it's a subtler humour than the giant electric nipples or enormous cat eared baby spouting poetry. Tolerance for this level of deadpan is likely to be low though so it's certainly not a film with wide appeal.People have moaned about the special effects for this feature but frankly on the budget this film had and especially considering they're using motion capture technology I think they look great and even add to the humour since again they mix the oddball and the deadpan. Being able to see the actor's facial expressions is much more important than a good looking suit or smooth CGI when you're doing this kind of subtle comedy.One final note the last ten minutes of this film are absolutely hysterical. Having built up the threat of this unknown red monster with Masaru running away from it and finally having to face it again at the end we're all primed for a typical redemption story where Masaru overcomes his own incompetence and beats the big bad. I won't spoil the ending but suffice it to say the film undercuts this expected trope in the most ludicrous and hilarious manner possible. Much as individual scenes have a slow tedious excruciating agonisingly long build up to a gag so the film as a whole is 90 minutes of deadpan and 10 minutes of utter unrestrained insanity that had me laughing like a loon.For more film reviews check out www.wordpress.mummy.com or find out more about at httpabout.meAdamHalls".

	schema:reviewBody "Strangely paced unflinchingly crazy and browfurrowingly confusing this is a tough movie to get a handle on. It's pseudodocumentary in the same style as Christopher Guest but with a less obvious comedic timing more humble unassuming characters and a hefty injection of pure unabashed Japanese absurdity. The camera's focal point is Masaru a soft spoken middleaged loser with a goingnowhere life and zero self confidence who nonchalantly moonlights as the fifteenstory tall nearly naked hero Big Japanese Man. Despite saving the city from a series of rampaging monsters public interest in his work is waning and he's beginning to find it difficult to make ends meet. Excruciatingly slow at points it has a few interesting things to say about the longevity of the superheroic profession and the notoriously fickle nature of public favor but much of that is lost beneath the burden of such a painfully dull lead character. Its dry bizarre sense of humor hits the mark more often than not and the CGI fight scenes make for quite the spectacle but this really didn't need to be half as long as it is. Fans of the eccentricities of Japanese culture will have a ball with it although they'll have to wade through some arid terrain to get to the good stuff. I'm still trying to figure out what exactly happened in the last scene.".

I went into seeing this film without any expectations it was the last of the films I saw at the Helsinki International Film Festival 2007 but I came out feeling giddy and joyous like a surprised and baffled child who just heard a really funny and raunchy joke for the very first time. There is considerable novelty in this film ranging from its pseudodocumentary I guess they call it mockumentary style of narrative with its lowkey humour to its overthetop Godzillastyle action sequences with CGIanimated pseudosuperheros and monsters  all of which contributes to this film being beyond bizarre.Without a semblance of character development or plot suspense Dai Nipponjin which translates The Big Japanese meanders from one event to another tracing the goingson of an unwitting superhero who has inherited from his parents and grandparents the unrewarding role as a saviour of Japan and Tokyo from various roaming baddies rendered in blocky but pretty CGI. From fighting an elastic rubberman to interfering in the strange mating rituals of two massive weirdos the life of Dai Nipponjin is portrayed ironically and postmodernly as that of a realityTV star or a minor celebrity. This is to me the strength of the film Although ostensible harmless monster entertainment the film contains some amount of social criticism masquerading as dry humour. From Japanese selfidentity to its precarious relationships with the U.S. and earlier Germany one of the baddies looks unmistakably like Hitler the film often derails into a strange commentary on modern Japan. Dai Nipponjin as the Big Japanese stands for nationalism TVentertainment and commodity culture all rolled into one package.From an entertainment standpoint the film is a mixed bag. It seems likely that only the Japanese will be able to fully appreciate all the jokes and alluded contexts in the film. Most Westerns will be left baffled gasping for air  I know this from first hand experience! It is also slowpaced at times and needlessly lax in its transitions from scene to scene. But after a slow start the movie gains momentum and the last 20 minutes or so of the movie are pure comedy gold  IF you can handle its offensive and very Japanese humour. Really I have not laughed so hard in the cinema for at least a year! Silly crazy and outrageous  I loved it! Now if ALL of the film had been as tight as the last third or so I would easily have given the film an 8 or even a 9 but there was some boring and unnecessary stuff in there to lower the overall score.Funny offensive surprisingly witty and biting at parts this film is not for everybody and certainly not a masterpiece. But what lifts it above such onejoke wonders as the overrated Calamari Wrestler is its selfconscious irony and unique approach to its subject matter. If only it weren't so slowpaced and uneven. So definitely worth seeing  although if you are allergic to crazy Japanese culture this film will make you foam from the mouth... Good fun for all the rest of us!".

Though I know they are all big now there's some problem working together. But it's my dream that Matsumoto working with Mr. Itao full time making a picture together. It should be a great surreal comedy flick.Actually Itao appearing few minutes as smelly monster in this film. I always laugh my head off seeing that but it's not enough cos considering their talent they can do more than that.Maybe Matsumoto's weak point is working with strangers and that huge budget. Probably big budget gave him big pressure mentally and couldn't concentrate. his talent will definitely explode when solving those problems. Working with his close friends making it with low budget.

An eccentric man aged about 40 lives alone in a decrepit house in Tokyo. He periodically transforms into a giant about 30m tall and defends Japan by battling similarly sized monsters that turn up and destroy buildings. The giant and the monsters are computergenerated.After about an hour and a half the film stops and a notice is displayed on the screen with a yellow warning triangle. The message says something like Koko kara wa jissha de goran kudasai which means From this point on is liveaction. Then some American giants appear. They are humans dressed in costumes in contrast to the computergenerated monsters before this point. And they have some trivial conversation with the Japanese giant. And then the film ends.It seems that many people's reaction to this last part of the film is I didn't understand it or It was strange. Perhaps I'm rash but I have more of the courage of my convictions I think this part of the film was meaningless totally uninteresting totally unenjoyable and totally unfunny. The only reason I didn't walk out was that I thought there might be another good bit before the end. But there wasn't. It just ended. If you go to watch this film I recommend you go home when the notice with the yellow warning triangle appears. You will save yourself from being bored for fifteen minutes. There are three scenes where the world outside Japan intrudes. All three have a distastefully xenophobic tone. In the first the main character just speaks ill of America for no reason. In the second a Chinese woman tries to speak Japanese but can't pronounce it properly and this is supposed to be funny. In the third the American giants turn up. One of them repeatedly says Zehi Please and we are supposed to find this funny because that is the only Japanese he knows. Western audiences might think that they are missing something or that you need to know more about Japanese culture to fully understand this film. But I don't think there's anything to it. This film is just weak. Hitoshi Matsumoto writer director and star of this film is one of the countless legions of TV personalities who are extremely well known to most Japanese people. People say he is more talented than most. But this is not saying much. In his favour he has a likable screen persona and fairly good comic acting ability. The scenes where he is a normal human being are reasonably funny. I think if Matsumoto put his mind to making a pure comedy film set in the real world and steered clear of feebleminded antiAmerican sentiments he could make an entertaining film. The title is translated The Great Japanese. But it is not meant to mean that the Japanese people as a whole are great. It is just meant to mean The Great Japanese Person. I suppose there are many other interpretations that could be put on it because Dainipponjin is a madeup word.".

	schema:headline " Inspired sublime parody";
	schema:reviewBody "The concept is genius the film takes the form of a mockumentary about a Japanese superhero Big Man Japan Hitoshi Matsumoto an ordinary man who can transform via a massive electrical shock into a hundredfoot tall warrior. Apparently this trait is hereditary his father and grandfather could also do this in fact his grandfather was a popular hero shown briefly in doctored WWII clips milling with the troops and Big Man wonders in the film if the trait has been passed down to his daughter. But the tone of the documentary is what really makes the film it's exceptionally dry and somewhat dull like following an average man of little financial means would be. Big Man leads a wholly uninteresting life until called upon to defend Japan from a marauding giant monster then he rushes to the nearest electrical station to do his thing and fight whatever freakish thing is attacking usually the other monsters are grotesque and stupid more comic than scary. It's a spoof of the giant monster genre in Japan but it's also a very clever social satire as well because most people hate Big Man they graffiti the walls outside his house and leave angry messages on placards on the road to the electrical station once or twice sitting around his house just talking for the documentary windows behind Big Man break as people throw bricks through them. The humor is exceptionally clever  and aside from the scenes with the monsters battling very lowkey. Big Man's wife  no longer living with him  is somewhat ashamed of him and insists that their daughter's face be pixelated on film. His manager is obviously conning him and most people treat him with mild disdain. It's an interesting switch from the heroworship we often see in superhero movies and it's both more realistic and sublimely comic at the same time. The movie maintains its subtle and gently mocking tone right up until the end when the final scenes turn to outright parody and we're not entirely sure what happened did he die? Is this heaven? it's more quizzical than disappointing and it's hardly enough of a departure to spoil what is otherwise an inspired parody probably the best fake documentary since Spinal Tap and I would argue a better one. This film might not be for everyone  it can move slowly and it is very Japanese  but it is so astonishingly clever and funny that I was deeply impressed. The film is absurd in all the right ways and is far far better than any of the 'straight' superhero movies you'll see any time soon.".

	onyx:emotionText "The concept is genius the film takes the form of a mockumentary about a Japanese superhero Big Man Japan Hitoshi Matsumoto an ordinary man who can transform via a massive electrical shock into a hundredfoot tall warrior. Apparently this trait is hereditary his father and grandfather could also do this in fact his grandfather was a popular hero shown briefly in doctored WWII clips milling with the troops and Big Man wonders in the film if the trait has been passed down to his daughter. But the tone of the documentary is what really makes the film it's exceptionally dry and somewhat dull like following an average man of little financial means would be. Big Man leads a wholly uninteresting life until called upon to defend Japan from a marauding giant monster then he rushes to the nearest electrical station to do his thing and fight whatever freakish thing is attacking usually the other monsters are grotesque and stupid more comic than scary. It's a spoof of the giant monster genre in Japan but it's also a very clever social satire as well because most people hate Big Man they graffiti the walls outside his house and leave angry messages on placards on the road to the electrical station once or twice sitting around his house just talking for the documentary windows behind Big Man break as people throw bricks through them. The humor is exceptionally clever  and aside from the scenes with the monsters battling very lowkey.

He lives in a house alone feeding stray cats eating his favorite food super noodles having bricks thrown through his windows and waiting for his cell phone to ring. For the first 10 to 15 minutes this will be about all we see as he interviewed casually the first question is what he thinks of the weather and he responds by saying how much he likes his umbrella. He carries it with him all the time because it is very compact and only get's big when it needs to and then it's very useful. Eventually he get's a call and then it's off to a local power plant plastered in angry graffiti about littering destruction of public property and misusing energy. The small thin man then is taken where cameras can't follow and then there's a power surge.Next thing you know the man is now a 50 foot tall CGI generated giant fighting the first in a series of bizarre looking monsters whose soul interest is to destroy buildings. They do battle in what is less Godzilla freeforall as the worlds worst dog catcher. In these giant sequences the film becomes what looks like a TV show instead of a documentary. Sato our hero is the last of Japan's BigMen seemingly normal humans breed to do battle with the giant monsters that appear in Japan periodically by transforming into giants themselves after high voltage electro shock to the nipples. Sato's father destroyed himself trying to become bigger than the rest so his grandfather stepped in raising the boy and acting as the family's champion a second time exposing himself to so much charge it rendered him senile. Sato is in the process of divorce considered an embarrassment and nuisance by the people who causes more damage than good. He has an agent who sells advertising space on his chest and back and his exploits are only aired on television past 2 am.Like so many Christopher Guest characters he is socially awkward and woefully pathetic. What gives Big Man Japan some added steam is the grotesque comical images of the large juxtaposed to the emotionally small and stifled real life. The same way Kafka's metamorphosis makes Gregor Sama's inner life manifest turning him into a insect a pest in the lives of others so does Sato's Big Man and the monsters he faces serve as distortions of himself. Monsters like the Strangling Beastwho only wants to throw castles and buildings around to lay his eggs mark his turf or otherwise inseminate the ruins to the Leaping Monsterwho has the intellect of an 8 year old and only wants to jump around no matter what it breaks to the stink monster who appears for a public sexual encounter and is unaware that it stinks of 10000 pounds of feces to the Cyclops creature whose eye is attached to a long tendril which descends from it's groin to the Child Monster who is weak and sickly and only trying to get home appear as psychosexual demons taunting him with their distinctly human faces.This is the story of a thin man quiet somber man who becomes his country's biggest spectacle wrestling all manner of horrors in only his underwear. Films like Jean Claude Van Damage They Call Me Bruce and ZebraMananother Japanese film about a faded superhero in the modern world and to a lesser extent The Watchmen deal with fallen heroes myths descended into the grim and grit of modern life and humor and Big Man Japan follows suit but manages to balance it's selfdeprecating realism with the wide eyed absurdity that made such heroes so interesting in the first place.It's largely a parody of Ultraman a Japanese superhero franchise later imitated in North America by the Power Rangers in 90's and also there's some gentle fun poked at the loss of traditional culture the sacred growth ceremony once attended by geisha's and crowds is now performed like an old habit by Sato and a priest in a storage room the non conflict oriented postwar JapaneseSato tries to talk to the stink monster into just leaving the town instead of fighting it and the flip side of such passive aggression the obsession with violence best illustrated in the final scene's surreal dues ex machina which make the superhero team up look like a gang of bullies degrading and humiliating their chosen bad guy target.In some patches it does become more dead than just dead pan and the jokes fall flat but the more quiet moments make the clever ones all the brighter. The third film from the Six Shooter series which gave us Let The Right One In and TimeCrimes has mostly succeeded here with their third genre fusion of superhero mockumentary comedy. DaiNipponjin is an entertaining and grandiose weird tale and modern fable about being emotionally stunted by family country duty and cowardice. The bigger they are the harder they fall.".

Selmer a small town in southwest Tennessee served as the authentic background for the biopic of the heroic southern Sheriff. Joe Don Baker did an admirable job with the role and the hugely violent film was a surprise hit. Former Sheriff Pusser himself was set to potray himself in the sequel but he died in a car crash as he as returning from his contract signing in California. The sequel was filmed using Swedish actor Bo Swensen and a Final Chapter triquel told of Pussers' demise. While the Walking Tall franchise will never be on any list of Classic Film the original is a great slice of Americana Circa '70s. It made Bakers' career and perhaps kicked the 'southsploutation' genre of that decade into gear.";

	schema:reviewBody "Joe Don Baker gives his best performance in this film as legendary Tennessee lawman Buford Pusser. This film is defintely biased in its portrayal of Pusser as an almost perfect good guy. I have read a couple books about Pusser's life and I think he was a good man who really wanted to bring justice to his county and to help his fellow man. The most tragic part of this film is the scene that depicts the brutal murder of Pusser's wife Pauline and his near murder Pusser had his jaw almost blown off and the people who did it were never caught. When was the last time you cheered at a movie? was the tagline for Walking Tall. It was a sleeper hit that spawned two sequels and a shortlived tv series. I only wish that Joe Don Baker had played Pusser in the other two films he does a wonderful job playing a simple man in a complicated world who wants only what is just and right. I remember the scene where a corrupt judge tells Pusser that he doesn't know anything about the law. Pusser merely tells him I know the difference between a poor honest judge and a rich dishonest one. Pusser was supposed to play himself in the second Walking Tall film but was tragically killed in a car accident. What I didn't like about the third Walking Tall was they tried to make it out like he was murdered like the mob cut his brake lines. They didn't come out and say it but they strongly hinted at it. According to all accounts Pusser's death was due to speeding and it was just a tragic accident and there was no conspiracy involved at all. Tragic but not mysterious. Elizabeth Hartman does a fine job in this film as Pusser's loving wife Pauline. She was a fine actress who had an amazing debut in the classic film A Patch Of Blue. Unfortunately she was also very troubled by mental illness and killed herself in 1987. It always makes me sad when I see her in this film and remember her tragic end.".

In order to get good sound on dialog the mike is hung very close to the subject. It is almost always captured on film but in the area which is not meant to be seen by an audience as the square film frame is supposed to be matted at top and bottom by the projectionist when shown in a theater or by the technician when transferring film to video.In the case of Walking Tall whoever supervised the transfer to video did so open matte meaning they transfered the ENTIRE film frame without proper matting hence the visible boom. This was not carelessness on the part of the filmmakers but on the part of whoever put it out on video. You'd see microphone booms in Star Wars if it were transfered to video this way.When I saw Walking Tall in the theater it did not have visible booms. Blame the video release not the filmmakers.".

Pusser led a colourful life from being a wrestler Buford the bull or Buford the wild bull. to a stint in the marines in which he was given a medical discharge for asthma. Buford came home to Adamsville Tenn. As a young man he visited a crooked casino across the state line and caught them cheating and stealing his money. They beat him and carved him up and left him for dead. Buford lost a friend in that attack and he returned to the casino and took his money back by force. He was arrested and during his trial he stood up for himself and was acquitted. Buford ran for the job as Adamsville's police chief and started a war to clean up the state line . Buford's term as police chief expired after four terms and he ran for the more powerful position of county sheriff. he made powerful enemies and was shot and knifed countless times and left for dead but he came back stronger then ever.until Aug 12th 1964. Buford Pusser was responding to a call out on new hope road. His wife PAuline terrified for her husband went along. The day was beautiful and no sign of trouble until the cars came and ambushed Buford Pusser and his wife. Pauline Pusser died and Buford was severely wounded. His jaw almost shot off. Buford was in the hospital for almost a year recovering. But when he did he continued his relentless war. In 1967 Mort Briskin caught a news story on Pusser and was captivated and believed this would make a great movie. He contacted Buford and he agreed to make the movie as a consultant. Buford Pusser himself would say WAlking Tall was 50 percent true 50 percent Hollywood. And you can see what's true and what isn't. But they got the important details right. And they got the legend right. When Walking Tall became an incredible hit Buford Pusser received death threats. He was worried he would die before they finished telling his story. He screen tested for the next chapter simply called Buford and got the job to play himself but died before it was made. But Joe Don Baker does a great job here as Buford and keeps his memory alive. The film isn't perfect it's not a documentary of a incredible man. But it's a fitting cornerstone into the legend that has become Buford Pusser. I've seen this film hundreds of times and each time it's affected me deeply. Not bad for a film made in 1973.".

Judging from hisher use of overlydescriptive adjectives I'd say heshe was looking down their nose even before they entered the theatre.It coincided with the beginning of a sordid bottom period in the social and intellectual history of the United States from which the nation has yet to recover.   Whoa!  Where'd that come from !?  For starters that wasn't the beginning of any bottom period for this country.  I'm not even sure what context heshe is referring to.  If it's violence in society then you need to roll the clock back 10 20 or more years to find the bottom.  Sounds like someone lived in a glass house during the McCarthyera JFK's assassination Vietnam MLK's assassination  and that's just going back 1020 years!  Dip back further into the early part of the century when the country was involved in labor fights of which I highly recommend watching Matewan One a movie about unionizing coal miners of West Virginia back in the 20's or 30's.Sorry to digress.  Here's my take on Walking TallI watched this the other night and was glued to it!  Not for the display of violence but for the fact that this movie is now nearly 30 years old and it's like a time capsule of sorts.  Yes it was a story based on violence but the real story is how morally bankrupt one town had become while still functioning as a little town somewhere in America.  Joe Don Baker played an excellent role in being a notsonice guy bent on cleaning up the scum of his childhood town.  He had been away too long and when he returned it was too much for him to handle.  I took to watching this movie lightly.  A lot of viewers commented on the social aspects of this but I tookin all of the surrounding things like the props and scenery.  For instance look how huge those Dodge sedans were! Boats with wheels!  The bad hair bad clothes especially one scene where his wife is wearing this blouse that has about 4 different contrasting patterns on it.  Truly Seventies Americana.As mentioned in another post the boom operator must have been someone's kid helping out on the set as the mic is shown in many of the scenes.  Being an independent company they must have said the heck with it in the editing room.  Not enough money for a reshoot.I take this movie with a grain of salt.  I was entertained by the time period of it and the acting. This movie belongs in the yettobe implemented IMDB genre category of The Seventies.  Hint hint IMDB.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember seeing this film when it first hit the theatres in 1973...had some hype in the local newspapers and TV ads and was ballyhooed a lot like The Exorcist the same year. This film does not disappoint. If you like underdog films and the bad guys getting their a's kicked you will love this movie. Joe Don Baker a bit actor at the time puts in slam dunk performance as the tough tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser who is a southern dirty harry type cop. Some fans might remember Baker as one of the prisoners in Paul Newman's Cool Hand Luke. Story centers around Pusser returning home after a long sabbatical as a pro wrestler to find corruption running amok. After getting sliced and diced at a corrupt card table in the local septic tank bar and left for dead on the side of the road Pusser gets angry enough to make a run for sheriff....after winning the surprise election Pusser has to recruit some honest deputies  a rather hard task in that small corrupt town  and proceeds to try and weed out the gangsters and prostitutes running amok in the town. After running the corrupt judge into the basement of the local court house Pusser has to stop the moonshining operation run by the mob also. Along the way he literally castrates a corrupt deputy who is a mob informer. His preferred weapon is not a pistol but a big round wooden stick if you will he uses to bang up and batter down all criminals with. Gets to be sort of fun waiting for the next scumbag Pusser will pound down with that big wooden stick......scene of Pusser and his wife getting ambushed by the mob is very graphic and humbling...several people getting very teary eyed in the theatre the first time I saw this film. Scenes of Pusser and his children walking in funeral procession for his wife get to your emotions in a warm and tender way. Plenty of action and the bad guys get mowed down in the end by Pusser. Almost like a carbon copy of the original Dirty Harry film the same year with Clint Eastwood mowing down the criminals. Poor cinematography and film editing the only downer for this film. Why does the viewer have to see part of a microphone hanging down from a bedroom?? Don't bother with the sequels without Baker as sheriff Pusser. Bo Svenson poor substitute after you have seen Baker as Pusser. Great overall action film  can be quite graphic. Not for young kids to see.".

This 1973 movie is based on actual events in the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser of McNairy County Tennessee during the 1960's. Though the screenplay takes some liberties with Pusser's story it is an exciting account of one man taking on organized crime and corruption .The story begins with Buford and his family moving back to his home town in McNairy County. Shortly after arriving Buford realizes that his home town has changed. Gambling prostitution and bootlegging have taken over. Buford exposes the gambling operation to be corrupt and is brutally beaten and left for dead. He recovers and seeks vengeance using a big piece of lumber. He is arrested for his troubles. Buford is cleared of the charges and is soon elected Sheriff. He promises to rid the county of crime and corruption. The rest of the movie shows how difficult it was for Buford to follow through with his promise.Buford Pusser is played by Joe Don Baker who gives the performance of his career. Baker's Pusser faces the tragic events of the movie with a sense of sad but heroic nobility. The audience is able to feel what Pusser must have felt when these events actually happened through Baker's brave performance.The story is ultimately a tragic tale of one man who walked tall and stood up against the forces of corruption. It is the rare action movie that makes you cheer and cry at the same time. This is essential viewing for anyone who loves true heroes.".

True of course but too extreme. Things never happen that way. It takes time a lot of time to move public opinion particularly in a small town. It takes time and finesse to trick and trap mafia criminals. It takes time and patience to trick and trip a judge who has so much power in his hands. But in 1973 it was a sign on the road away from the good old silent majority. The very first step on a very long way that is just coming ripe right now maybe and the silent majority might finally get some voice and shout Yes We can to their desire for the change they need. Will that be a landslide or a tottering stumble? The film seems to believe that such radical change is possible once the fruit is ripe. Yet it does not show the ripening of the fruit just the plucking.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

It takes time and finesse to trick and trap mafia criminals. It takes time and patience to trick and trip a judge who has so much power in his hands. But in 1973 it was a sign on the road away from the good old silent majority. The very first step on a very long way that is just coming ripe right now maybe and the silent majority might finally get some voice and shout Yes We can to their desire for the change they need. Will that be a landslide or a tottering stumble? The film seems to believe that such radical change is possible once the fruit is ripe. Yet it does not show the ripening of the fruit just the plucking.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines";

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately the IMDb allows only comments up to 1000 words and I was so much taken in by WALKING TALL that my comment got longer so please go to my entry in the message board if you want to read the whole review!  ...  I love movies with balls and brains and this is one of 'em!  OK I know this movies has its small shortcomings because it does not belong to the category of overfinanced Hollywoodjunk which is a moviecategory established by the film industry ! in the later 80ies and beginning 90ties consisting of movies costing anywhere from 50 to 200 million bucks and which look like most designerstuff well crafted but hollow but to the category of a small independently financed Bpicture. Don't get me wrong this ain't a movie financed on a shoestringbudget this is just one of those movies where the producers did not have million's to burn. It's very decently made and 95 perfect just here or there you think well they could have tried one more take or something similar. But anyway are you going to the cinema to see a technically perfect movie and receive joy from seeing designertailored actionscenes or do you go to the movies or buy a DVD to enjoy yourself with a movie full of balls and brain? If you belong to the 1st category I suggest you save the time reading this and forget about watching this flick. But if you belong to the later category then this is something for you you gonna enjoy this rollercoasterflick! Especially if  as is the case with me  70ies Bflicks are your cup of tea. They certainly are mine! I won't dwell here on the storyline of WALKING TALL you can find details elsewhere here it's probably enough to point out that the title is the program and that our hero's tagline is walk softly and carry a big stick or  as the old Latins said  suaviter in modo fortiter in re. Yeah that's what he does and he uses that big stick to clean house very properly. I do not know which part of the story is actually fact based on incidents in the life of Buford Pusser and which parts are fiction that could be a lot since the disclaimer reads that this picture is based on incidents suggested by the life of BP which sounds like something but in fact can mean nearly everything or nothing at all but IF just 50 of the storyline happened in some way or another this guy must have had enormous luck and 7 lives. Already the incidents when somebody tries to kill him amount to at least 5! The movie is quite brutal at least for a flick made in the middle of the 70ies. Quite a lot of dead and quite a high number of severely beatenup bodies but there ain't that much of it onscreen. Just the first beating of our hero is really tense and was probably only outdone by Mel Gibson's Christ a couple decades later. Of course it looks a bit unrealistic to see Joe Don Baker in a Tshirt so soaked with blood because anyone loosing that much of it would certainly be dead but then again Phil Karlson had a point to make and wanted to make sure we'd get it our hero had been severely wounded by the villains of the town and now he had a task to handle do what a man has to do simply WALK TALL! This movie is pure 70ies magnetism a wonderful ride into rural Americana with so many classic partly stereotypes wonderful original characters hardly any cardboard ones and actors indeed looking like someone you could meet at any corner of such a town. This is what lifts such classic productions over the Hollywoodproduct we get today we do see real people doing things that could at least be possible while when we watch Die Hard IV everybody should know that 90 of the actionscenes there could simply never happen because they are against the laws of physics. Here you got a lot of beatups carchases shootouts more beatings cars driving in houses all things that normally don't happen if the police does its job but things that COULD happen that are physically possible. And they are staged with zest and verve by a veteran director in the twilight of his career who took this job at the age of 66 and wanted to give it a last which then was his penultimate try. And he does deliver ALL the goods pulls all triggers. He certainly knew this could very well be his last effort so why not give the best. With 4 decades !! of moviemaking experience Phil Karlson who also directed THE SILENCERS and THE WRECKING CREWentries in the lovely Matt Helmseries and quite a couple very good noir's and western certainly knew how to build up a good storyline and how to stage it as well as possible with whatever budget he had available. ...ATTENTION !

	schema:headline " Ironic Thought Provoker.";
	schema:reviewBody "Joe Don Baker is Buford Pusser an ex Marine who returns to find his small peaceful Tennessee town corrupted by an immoral cabal marketing illegal stuff like gambling white lightning and trailer hos. He is elected sheriff and cleans it all up.Baker is mulling over the decision to run for County Sheriff. It's a dangerous job in this milieu. He's already seen a friend killed and has himself been horribly tortured. His wife Elizabeth Hartmann objects. Is your pride worth the lives of your wife and children? she asks. Both Baker's character and the viewer take the sentence to be rhetorical. It's not.But it's the sort of challenge that every wife lays down before her man when he's about to commit himself to some heroic deed. How many times has John Wayne's cinema wives clashed with him and his career as a sheriff or a Marine because they want him safe at home not out risking his life wondering if he'll come home in a body bag? Phil Karlson the director has made a couple of powerful movies but I'm not sure that he understood the import of Hartmann's question. It may have been that he realized it but it may also have been an accident the kind of phrase that slips easily by someone's critical apparatus. That's what I meant when I called the movie ironic.There's another scene that demonstrates the same irony. Baker has just been ambushed his wife murdered and half his jaw shot away. His face is encased in plaster up to his eyes. He's weak and can barely move. And we see the crowd of friends in the corridor gawk and make a path when Baker's young son solemnly enters the room carrying the little rifle that Baker gave him for Christmas. The kid is going to kill anyone who tries to hurt his Dad. Do the film makers know what they're saying? Anyone expected a Steven Segal wisecracker or anything resembling the loutish remake with Dwayne The Rock Johnson will be disappointed. This movie is ambiguous in too many respects. It's not a simple revenge movie like The Punisher although there is an abundance of violence and blood. After that first mauling and the subsequent humiliations Baker is rabid with revenge. His face turns into a horrifying Gargoyle mask as he tortures the spies and law breakers.I would guess  judging from some recent polls and comments from our own politicians  that about one out of four Americans will see this as the simple triumph of good over evil. The distribution will be skewed in the direction of boys in their early teens. It won't occur to them  though the notion is brought up once or twice by character is the movie  that Baker is a flawed person that his pride verges on arrogance and his anger on enjoyment. He brags about his scars.It's hard to argue with such a black and white view of the sheriff. He only drinks an occasional beer to be friendly doesn't smoke doesn't cuss doesn't approve of seethrough blouses doesn't hold with loose women even if they love him he's all tenderness with his wife and children and doesn't gamble. Has there ever been such purity  outside of the Bible and Arthurian legends? Baker is surprisingly good in the role of the reallife Buford Pusser. You can tell the story is based on actual facts and personalities because where else would you find people with names like Lutie McVey or Ferrin Meaks? As for Buford Pusser that name would be the first to go. As the heroic central figure he'd have to have a name like Matt Steel or Bull Durham.But the acting and the location photography are fine across the board. Nobody is a dud. Baker himself always sound like he's reciting lines in an acting class doing his level best but it's okay in this kind of role. After a while you get used to it and come to believe that this is how he sound off screen. He had a similar role except as a murderer in Charlie Varick where he was easily the most complex character. Probably the best performer in this film is Rosemary Murphy as the villainous Callie Hacker head of the Whore Division. She doesn't get a chance to exercise her chops here but catch her in Night Moves if you can.It doesn't really matter how you take the movie. You can either accept it as a shallow revenge story full of blood and sentiment or as the rather deeper and murkier thing I suspect it is. It will still be gripping and emotionally moving. The climax has the lawenforcer breaking the law in search of insurance that the law will prevail. Dirty Harry with a motive. Ironic.".

Definitely worth a viewing. As one reviewer said it may be a good one to watch when you've given up on finding any body left 'walking tall' around you. I saw the remake with 'the rock' before this version. Not even close. The rock's version is your typical Hollywood action flick. This one felt pretty real for '73 and it does get your blood boiling. Granted some scenes seem pretty far fetched but the key focus on corruption is there throughout. Maybe we need someone to make an up to date film featuring behind the scenes at Enron.".

Anywaythere are some spoilers ahead.Anyone who wants to know more about Buford Pusser read on.Late in 1973Buford Pusser said in an interview in NEWSWEEK magazineThat the film was about 80 percent accurate. He served three two year terms as sheriff from 1964 to 1970.In another interview he saidThat his only criticism of Walking Tall was that it wasn't violent enough. The film mentions in the opening and closing credits that this was a fictionalized account of certain events in the life of Buford Pusser.In the book Reeling by Pauline Kaelwho was the film reviewer for THE NEW YORKER magazine for around 25 years that I know ofit included a review of Walking Tallalong with reviews of many other films from that time.Ms.Kael had published several books of her movie reviews.She was considered by many to be one of the foremost film critics.She retired in 1991.She passed away in late 2001 from complications from Parkinson's disease. In Ms.Kael's review of Walking Tall she shed some light on the facts.For instance Pusser was never in the Marines.The crooked Sheriff Thurmanplayed by the late Gene Evanswhom Pusser said toThurman!I'voe known you since I was a kid.I always thought you walked tall.Butit looks like you done learned how to crawl!was killed in car accidentbut not by trying to run Pusser overas it was depicted in the movie.Alsohis fatherplayed by the late Noah BeeryJr.was a former sheriff of the county.Alsohe had many deputies but never a black deputyin the movie well played by the actor Felton Perry.Mr.Perry was also very good in Magnum Force that same yearwhere he played the partner of Inspector Harry CallahanClint Eastwood.Remember this was the segregated South of the 1960's.The filmmakers understandably wanted to appeal to the black audience.Alsohe didn't have a young son.His wife had a son by a previous marriage but he was a few years older than the young boy portrayed here.AndKael mentions in her review that he wasn't reelected sheriff.It seems he developed a reputation of being a big bully when it came to arresting suspects.He was accused of excessive use of force.The candidate who won the election for sheriffin his platform asked the votersWho would you rather have arrest your son? Evidently the voters didn't want him arresting their sons any longer.I found Reeling to be a good book.Although I didn't agree with some of her reviews.I think the book is out of print now.Some footnotesMort Briskinthe producer and writer of the filmdecided to do it after seeing a 10 minute interview with Sheriff Pusser with Roger Mudd on the CBS television network in 1969.Red Westwho was one of Elvis Presley's bodyguardshad a small role in the film as a sheriff from Alabama.West was one the bodyguards Mr.Presley fired for being a bit too rough on certain fans.There were fears of lawsuits for assault.Alsoit is known the Mr.Presley sent an anonymous donation to Sheriff Pusser when his home was badly damaged by certain criminal elements to help with the rebuilding.They both lived in the same neck of the woods.Mr.Presley was a very nice guy.Actress Elizabeth Hartmanwho played Pusser's wifethis was her last film role.Ms.Hartman died in 1987 from a suicide.She suffered from manicdepression or bipolar disorder.Andthe actress Brenda Benetwho played the kindly prostitute who helped the sheriff out by being an informerdied in the early '80's from a suicide.She had been recently divorced from the actor Bill Bixby and she had been very despondent over the death of her young son after a long illness.How sad.I saw Buford Pusser in a television interview in 1974 talking about going to Hollywood for a screen test for Part 2 Walking Tall.Buthe never got the chance because of his death later that year when someone or some peoplepresumably the criminal elementplanted a bomb in his Corvette.He was killed driving home late one night.His demolished car was found on the side of some lonesome road.May he rest in peace.".

	schema:headline " Cars and bars like in Coen brother's movies";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very carefully crafted highly stylized movie by legendary director Phil Karlson. The story about law and order is of the Western type and reportedly based on the life and times of a real Tennessee sheriff.  The plot is somewhat coarse and certainly not very close to real facts but the director and the actors deal well with it and turned out a powerful movie that has qualities of a fairy tale for adults makes a twisted statement and never bores. It lingers on in my memory.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADSome scenes reminded me strongly of the two road movies made by the Coen brothers Blood Simple and Fargo. The brothers really must have liked Walking Tall! Like in their movies roadside entertainment places and the road itself signify moral depravity and danger. There are hauntingly beautiful night shots of the badly wounded sheriff lying in the gutter trying to catch the attention of passing cars and someone surprisingly shooting out of a stopped car very much like in Fargo. Even the cheesy bar equipment of Blood Simple and Fargo seems to have been borrowed from this film.I guess Karlson was a movie man of the old school. He amply uses signs and symbols. They seem to underline the political views of the moviemakers. For example the sheriff is constantly carrying a big stick as his trademark Teddy Roosevelt is appropriately quoted. There is a curious scene in the county judge's private bathroom in the courthouse several toilet bowls arranged in conference room fashion without partitions and additional living room furniture. The sheriff intrudes to make his determination clear to the judge who is deeply shocked by this invasion of his privacy and subdued thereafter. At the end the lower part of the sheriffs head is cast in plaster. He is only eyes and ears. There is no more need for talking. The eerie appearance seems to complement the face masks in Karlson's Kansas City Confidential There the gangsters carry masks that cover the top half of their faces. It is equally intimidating. Karlson knew exactly how to stir up emotions. The scene of the assassination in which the sheriffs wife dies is arranged and carefully balanced like a painting. The following funeral procession has a humble dignity that is moving and fits the situation perfectly. The bonfire in front of the badmen's bar after having been looted by an anonymous mob with police and sheriff quietly looking on gives a last and lasting impression of the ambivalence of the sheriff's understanding of law and order.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walking Tall is certainly one of the most ass kicking movies ever made. It's a fictionalization of the true story of Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser played here with conviction and intensity by Joe Don Baker. Buford has retired from life as a wrestler hoping to settle down to a quiet life in his hometown but he finds out that everything has gotten crooked with local bigwigs running the show. Soon enraged at a system that does little to nothing to help the common man he wages a personal war on corruption using any method necessary. The movie does its job as far as manipulating its audience. It doesn't take long for viewers to get their blood lust up and loudly cheer on our swaggering hero as he gives the assorted sleazy cretins their just desserts. And it doesn't hold back in the violence department either even if the blood is typically bright red movie blood that looks more like paint than anything there's a lot of it that flows before the movie is over. And we can also definitely take interest in a story of a regular Joe who fumes at the injustices of the world and refuses to live in a place where the big shots can have their way at any time. When Pusser puts a pompous ineffective judge Douglas Fowley in his place or humiliates a rat by having them crawl on all fours it's not hard to pump one's fist in the air and yell YEAH! All of the bad people are one dimensional sleazy selfish jerks even though they may disagree with one another on methods used they all look out for number one and enjoy their hold on the community. Provided one can take the brutality and doesn't mind having their buttons pushed so obviously Walking Tall is gripping. A superb cast really helps in the selling of the material with Elizabeth Hartman as the troubled but loyal wife Gene Evans as the ineffectual sheriff Bruce Glover and Felton Perry as deputies reallife siblings Leif Garrett and Dawn Lyn as the Pusser children Noah Beery Jr. and Lurene Tuttle as Buford's folks Rosemary Murphy as trouble making Callie Hacker and assorted other character players such as Arch Johnson Don Keefer Sam Laws Kenneth Tobey Pepper Martin Red West Logan Ramsey Richard X. Slattery Sidney Clute and John Myhers. Now granted all of what happens is plenty predictable but it's hard to deny how this could become a crowd pleasing entertainment on a nonthink level. And Buford's story didn't end here with two sequels a TV movie a short lived series and a loose remake  subsequent sequels to follow just going to show how enduring the concept of a strong principled man fighting for what's right can be. Seven out of 10.".

In fact vigilantism spelled big boxoffice at the time with the likes of DIRTY HARRY 1971 STRAW DOGS 1971 DEATH WISH 1974 etc. A decent cast of Hollywood veterans has been rounded up in support of the star these include Noah Beery Jr. as the heros father Gene Evans as a crooked sheriff and Kenneth Tobey as another socalled pillar of the community  read redneck  involved in the myriad illicit activities.By the way the version I watched via the Rhino DVD was openmatte as opposed to the more professionallooking Widescreen original  in fact in a number of shots the boommike is plainly visible above the actors heads!".

Buford Pusser was the technical consultant and the huge Joe Don Baker played realistically his character. I have a picture with both of them and Joe Don Baker doesn't seem to be so huge compared to the mountain Buford Pusser.

Someone will kill a friend or family member of Pusser and Pusser will kill one or two of the bad guys at a time. It's a shame Joe Don couldn't be in the sequels remake or TV show. I've heard pretty bad things about all of those so I think I'll stay away from them. The ending is somewhat anticlimactic but somehow effective.

I'm not taking anything from Bo Svenson but to me he just didn't look the part. If they were not going to use JDB in all of them then they should have gotten BS to play the lead in the first. I felt that for the time line the movie albeit low budgeted was pretty decent. I am from the south and my father was in law enforcement for 30 years and I can relate to the stories of running shine and the like. There are so many clips that were shown that I on a personal level could relate to. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole trilogy and yes I did shed a few tears when Pauline died and a whole lot when Buford died. I give the whole thing a thumbsup and hope that one day there can be a true remake of the whole trilogy with a wonderful supporting cast that can be in all three movies!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those why don't they make 'em like that any more movies. If it starred say Jimmie Stewart and Jean Arthur everyone would look upon it fondly as a treasured masterpiece. But no it's the oftenabrasive Eddie Murphy and the frequently hardtotake Jeff Goldblum. If you can handle the casting though this is a marvelous movie transcending its formula to deliver moments of hilarity as well as a thoughtful message.Jeff Goldblum is to me impeccably cast as an ambitious but unsuccessful salesman. The explanation later in the movie of how he traveled with his father on sales trips sets the character up beautifully. We come to understand that his lack of success really stems from a lack of commitment to the noholdsbarred ethos of the salesman. And of course that's a good thing.Murphy plays G who may or may not be divine but certainly is otherworldly. He's the opposite of Goldblum's character totally centered with no attachment to anything least of all the crass commercialism of the shopping network where Goldblum works. Naturally he disrupts Goldblum's life but the kicker comes when Goldblum desperately puts G on the air and finds that sincerity sells better than salesmanship.A number of reviewers have complained that there's not enough of Murphy. Maybe so if you're expecting a fullon Eddie Murphy vehicle. But Holy Man is more than just an Eddie Murphy movie and G the sort of showcase role that no actor could resist. It really lets Murphy shine displaying more subtlety than usual... yet spinning nicely off his usual sarcastic persona.The plot to be sure is formulaic. You can see the twists coming a mile away. So what? This type of cinema is as ritualistic as Greek tragedy or Kabuki theater. The point isn't in where it's going but in how it gets there. And get there it does making its little Zen point about materialism versus spirituality in a unique and compelling way.And at times a hilariously funny way. The 'magic trick' G performs with a Rolex watch is sidesplitting. But it's easily topped by the gutwrenchingly funny antics of G as he roams from one set to another in the TV studio. What he does to Morgan Fairchild is one of the great moments of sadistic slapstick. I admire her for appearing in this unflattering scene she must have an amazing sense of humor.I'll admit that the two stars will limit this film's appeal. But even if you're not a fan of Murphy or Goldblum it's worth taking a chance. Personally I tend to find Goldblum overpowering I was definitely rooting for the Tyranosaurus to catch up with his asinine chaotician in Jurassic Park 1 and 2. But in some roles he just works and this is one of them. Another is Beyond Suspicion a.k.a. Auggie Rose.This is not only a good movie it's one that I actually pull down off the shelf and watch far more frequently than many of the betterknown 'classics.' I've seen it at least four times and intend to see it many more.".

If it starred say Jimmie Stewart and Jean Arthur everyone would look upon it fondly as a treasured masterpiece. But no it's the oftenabrasive Eddie Murphy and the frequently hardtotake Jeff Goldblum. If you can handle the casting though this is a marvelous movie transcending its formula to deliver moments of hilarity as well as a thoughtful message.Jeff Goldblum is to me impeccably cast as an ambitious but unsuccessful salesman. The explanation later in the movie of how he traveled with his father on sales trips sets the character up beautifully. We come to understand that his lack of success really stems from a lack of commitment to the noholdsbarred ethos of the salesman. And of course that's a good thing.Murphy plays G who may or may not be divine but certainly is otherworldly. He's the opposite of Goldblum's character totally centered with no attachment to anything least of all the crass commercialism of the shopping network where Goldblum works. Naturally he disrupts Goldblum's life but the kicker comes when Goldblum desperately puts G on the air and finds that sincerity sells better than salesmanship.A number of reviewers have complained that there's not enough of Murphy. Maybe so if you're expecting a fullon Eddie Murphy vehicle. But Holy Man is more than just an Eddie Murphy movie and G the sort of showcase role that no actor could resist. It really lets Murphy shine displaying more subtlety than usual... yet spinning nicely off his usual sarcastic persona.The plot to be sure is formulaic. You can see the twists coming a mile away. So what? This type of cinema is as ritualistic as Greek tragedy or Kabuki theater. The point isn't in where it's going but in how it gets there. And get there it does making its little Zen point about materialism versus spirituality in a unique and compelling way.And at times a hilariously funny way. The 'magic trick' G performs with a Rolex watch is sidesplitting. But it's easily topped by the gutwrenchingly funny antics of G as he roams from one set to another in the TV studio. What he does to Morgan Fairchild is one of the great moments of sadistic slapstick. I admire her for appearing in this unflattering scene she must have an amazing sense of humor.I'll admit that the two stars will limit this film's appeal. But even if you're not a fan of Murphy or Goldblum it's worth taking a chance. Personally I tend to find Goldblum overpowering I was definitely rooting for the Tyranosaurus to catch up with his asinine chaotician in Jurassic Park 1 and 2. But in some roles he just works and this is one of them. Another is Beyond Suspicion a.k.a. Auggie Rose.This is not only a good movie it's one that I actually pull down off the shelf and watch far more frequently than many of the betterknown 'classics.' I've seen it at least four times and intend to see it many more.";

Perhaps this may be because I personally identified with the message but still the nonmaterialistic message definitely strikes home with comedy sprinkled in. If a light hearted comedy is what you are looking for then this is probably not the best movie to watch simply because the movie isn't that funny.

As the viewer of the movie we are positioned to like her. This I totally agree with because I think everyone should be like Kate  she has lovely qualities. When she stands up for her rights as a human and says I'm not going to sell my soul I really like that. That's how everybody should think. Why should individuals give in to money and business and simultaneously sell their soul their integrity their self as a whole? Well they should not. But it happens so it's ultimately up to the individual to make their own choices right or wrong. Kate is empathetic towards G and she feels that G should not be made to do the shows purely to save someone else's ass. She also feels that the business is just using him as a way for their success to be fruitful again. Although G doesn't mind doing the shows because he says he wants to do them for Ricky. So Kate walks away from the whole business and I think it's great that she does this cos she shows us what it's like to have integrity. But this movie teaches one that when you're in trouble and you pray for help God is always there to help you  G is in trouble at work so he prays sincerely and G turns up! There are other beautiful messages too. You can work them out. In the end Ricky listens to Kate's benevolent example and lets G go. Kate falls in love with Ricky once again and here we have a wonderful happy ending. I just love movies with happy endings. I recommend this movie to anyone that believes in integrity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the last two posters described very well two facets of this beautiful gem. It's sad this movie got such bad reviews as I think it was misrepresented in the press since Eddie was in it.I'm very selective of the movies I watch...I'm one of the international cinema crowd also so I tend toward deeper more intense movies. This is a movie I've watched countless times and I've never tired of it...and I've always cried at the end. This is one of the few movies that to this day still causes me to cry at the selfsacrifice and parting of the friends.This is probably because for me I see another facet of it as a modern parable...very subtle but powerful and poignant. This is not a movie about comedy and funny situations with a guru...in my opinion that is simply the stage being set and the backdrop raised for a parable about the value of true friendship and relationships...when we move beyond simply 'using' each other in the normal progression of our daily lives into the realm of true friends. The two highpoints are 1. Ricky Jeff finding the better part of himself that he never knew he had and was against much of who he thought he should be to tell G to go to leave the show. The virtue of selfsacrifice for the betterment of a friend. The buildup timing music and dialog were welledited and synchronized for a very poignant moment.2. And this happens again in a wonderful way...another poignant moment as Ricky G and Kate meet once more on the highway to say goodbye to each other...for the last time. It's bittersweet but incredibly moving and once again Ricky gets a glimpse of the much better part of himself that he didn't know he had and that has the potential to emerge. It's very beautiful and touching. And we sense that they are all on a better road for the journey for the experience.What touches me most deeply is the strong sense of true friends made how they touch and effect our lives and then move apart. We'll probably never see each other again but we will never forget each other and what we did for each other to make our lives a little brighter and better. I've had several true friends like that and that chord strikes beautifully here.I strongly recommend this film. It is a great parable of the coming of true friendship.".

	schema:headline " Eddie man what were you thinking???";
	schema:reviewBody "Well first of all this movie was billed as Eddie Murphey movie but it's not.  Holy Man actually stars Jeff Goldblum with Murphy in a supporting role. So don't go in thinking it's an Eddie Murphy comedy because it's not for two reasons. It's not an Eddie Murphy film and it's not all that funny. Goldblum stars as Ricky Hayman a producer at the Good Buy Shopping Network. Ratings are down and the boss tells him to either pick them up or he's out. So Ricky gets teamed with Kate Newell Kelly Preston and together they're going to try and boost the ratings. Out of nowhere comes their savior G Eddie Murphy. He's this gurulooking figure in flowing robes who seems to have this connection with people. So Ricky gets G to go on the Shopping Network ratings soar but as always there's a problem. G is on a spiritual journey. The only reason he's on the Shopping Network is because doctors told him he needed to stay out of the sun for a while. But the ratings are so good Ricky lies to G to get him to stay even when G is better. Moral dilemma time. And I think you can guess how it resolves itself. So let's get to the movie. First like I said this isn't an Eddie Murphy comedy. It's a movie about Jeff Goldblum trying to come to grips with his spiritual side with the help of G. Ricky has money problems women problems job problems all sorts of problems that he can't fix because he isn't centered enough. G comes along to help him find himself. From reading those last couple of sentences do you think it sounds like a comedy? The only thing remotely funny about the movie were the mockinfomercials they had. Ones for laundry balls or cooking while driving or the chainsaw. Those sendups of home shopping were well done and funny but the rest of the movie wasn't. It tried to be at times but the movie got bogged down in it's quest to try and incorporate a love story and a spiritual story. I'm not against spiritual stories well maybe or love stories for that matter but don't package them in a movie and call it a comedy because it doesn't work.  Besides most spiritual' movies belong in the FANTASY genre. I just read that the director and producer initially approached Murphy to play Ricky instead of G but Eddie wanted to play G. I think the movie had the potential to be better if he had played Ricky because it would have allowed them to use Eddie's comedic talents a little better. Goldblum has always been a little stiff to me and sadly he falls into that category that many actors and actresses fall into he will always be remembered for one roll and that roll happens to be Ian Malcom from Jurassic Park and not the kind of guy you would think could hold a comedy together. So overall I wouldn't bother seeing Holy Man. It's a movie that tries to make you laugh but eventually leaves you unfulfilled.".

Eddie Murphy is usually quite comical. I wish I could give you a film in comparison to thiswait what  about My Giant. Billy Crystals comic touch was wasted as Murphy's was the movie started out as a slightly entertaining comedy then turned into a melodrama that is emotionally touching but is absent of all laughs. That is a perfect example.This movie has some funny moments which all happen at the movie's opening in which a struggling home shopping agent meets a new partner that just so happens to be female an instantly obvious setup for a romantic subplot. So when they are forced to travel across town together in a car that pops a tire they meet a seemingly mental man who sniffs the grass and waves to every car that passes.Who he is we never find out and at this point in the movie the last laugh is long gone. All we know is that this is a friendly guy friendly enough to hypnotize a man so that he fever loses his fear of flying and even uses his miracles to help the agent played by Goldblum. The way he helps isn't really funny but entertaining. I won't recite anymore for the plot to you mostly because it all goes downhill from here but I don't want to spoil anything either.Now I want to say up front that I am recommending Holy Man if 1 You liked My Giant 2 aren't expecting more than approximately  2 minutes of laughs in 114 minutes. This is not a comedy it is a touching and emotional drama. On that note it works well. Judging the film on that concept I would give this movie three stars.For a comedy well here I go The Eddie Murphy character was easily the poorest written character of the year. Nothing about is explained. Yes I know he is supposed to be a mystery to the audience but I am talking about his entire existence. The filmmakers clearly depended no used Murphy as a crutch to hold back their bad ideas. As a comic production this movie absolutely stinks! I would give the comedy part two stars as you can see I decided to split the difference between the two ratingsI felt the actors did what they could to try and save the film but couldn't succeed. Jeff Goldblum is well written and performed but his character never meets its maximum potential until the finale. Kelly Preston from Nothing To Lose was the best thing in the film and defiantly was the most developed. She succeeds in making her character fun and intriguing. And unlike the others we relate to her.In Holy Man there is something to be made from the clever ideas and few funny moments from itanother movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A mysterious saintly man named G Eddie Murphy befriends the director of a failing shopping network Jeff Goldblum  his colleague Kelly Preston in Miami. He becomes a curious sensation on the network.Holy Man 1998 combines elements of Michael 1996 and City of Angels 1998 to forge its own hybrid and is the obvious precursor to Bruce Almighty 2003. It failed at the box office mainly because people thought it was going to be a typical Eddie Murphy vehicle but it's not. Sure there's some comedy but it's decidedly lowkey with maybe 23 laughoutloud parts. It's more of an amusing drama crossed with spiritual docudrama and the unique tone turned people off.While it's the least of those three other films it possesses its own appeal once you catch a grip. The movie seems overlong though and needed tightened up with a rewrite. Still it has its points of interest. Murphy for instance is thoroughly convincing in the title role and his character is certainly intriguing I think it's obvious who he really is not to mention the flick conveys several valuable insights.The film runs 1 hour 54 minutes and was shot in Miami Florida.GRADE CB".

	schema:reviewBody "What do you get when you combine the writer of Dead Poet's Society Tom Schulman with the director of Mr. Holland's Opus Stephen Herek? Before you answer the question I should tell you that Schulman also wrote Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Herek's directing credits include The Mighty Ducks and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. What we get in the film Holy Man is much closer to being Ricky and G's mediocre adventure than anybody's opus.Ricky Hayman Jeff Goldblum is the producer for a home shopping network. Kate Newell Kelly Preston is a marketing consultant brought in to help fix the flat sales that are plaguing the network. As they are getting to know each other they almost literally run into a holy man named G Eddie Murphy. When G stumbles into the middle of a live sales pitch for laundry detergent he criticizes the materialism of contemporary society and almost ruins the show. When the producer and the consultant discover that sales actually went up with this infusion of new age spirituality a star is born.The real problem with the story is confusion over the central character and confusion over the plot. The advertising and title of the film would suggest that Eddie Murphy is the star since G is the main character. Murphy's role is really a supporting role and the central plot ends up being the ethical transformation of the amoral producer Ricky Hayman. It's actually not a bad story and the film is engaging at points but by choosing to focus attention on the wrong story line the film ends up being little more than an adequate clich.If the story had focused more on the commodification of religion or for that matter the religification of commodities this could have been an interesting story. Any extraterrestrial visiting this planet and observing our behaviors would have to conclude that shopping is a religious ritual the NY stock exchange our main temple and Christmas the holiday when we worship through consumption and excess. The film teases in this direction but this part of the story remains an underdeveloped subplot. This could have been an interesting story. Unfortunately when all is said and done what we are left with is another formula film filled with merely adequate performances and trite clichs.".

All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that I didn't really like it very much.  I blacked the rest out and for good reason.A poor film on par with the greats like Gymkata and The Pumaman No Holds Barred is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling. Well maybe the stakes aren't all that high...and quite frankly I feel dirty just calling these people professionals at anything.  And really except for the first scene there's no wrestling to speak of.  So I guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beatingthecoutofpeople. Sounds good right?Hulk Hogan plays Rip the champion of the WWF Never let it be said that Hulk Hogan was typecast this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents.  Essentially he's playing himself but with a wardrobe that's more black and blue than the Hulkster's red and yellow.  He also has this hand gesture he does.  It's kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts except you stick your thumb in the air and you curl your index finger in.  My friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an R. Try and see for yourself.  If that looks like an R well then Mars needs women.  But anyway.Kurt Fuller with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz plays a TV exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting Rip who's evidentally bigger than Elvis on his network.  He won't have any of it And exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera and so the movie follows Fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at Rip. He does so when he creates his brilliantly titled Battle of the Tough Guys.  Marketing genius this guy.From the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fight scenes All played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious to the overacting to the far too frequent shots of Hulk in nothing but undies this movie has everything you'd ever want in a dumb movie.  It's frivolous not too taxing on the mind violent and includes the phrase What's that smell? DOOKIE! Dookie?A classic for all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler A real acting stretch... named Rip who is forced to defend his honor his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network Because wrestling sells! however when Rip declines the network gets a circuit fighting championship called and i'm totally serious Battle of the tough guys who's champion Zeus Played by Tiny Lister Jr maybe the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital. No Holds Barred is pretty much what I expected from Vince McMahon production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre Hogan it is basically lots of unintentional humor tons of awkward sequences a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words it's not unlike wrestling itself so I give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they're getting. The movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this. I myself found this to be ultimately hilarious. They're are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself. Such as the way Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limo how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way Hogan recites from his cuecard. I.EI'm not going to be around when this check clears! No Holds Barred is a lot of fun true though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. Fans of camp should really enjoy this clever clinker.  out of 4Fair".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't why the critics gave No Holds Barred such a hard time. I think this movie is a hit! Hulk Hogan is a great wrestler and his acting skills are very natural. Too much type cast was the cause of the bad reviews. Everyone in the sports world deserve a chance of doing something different. I don't typecast anyone who was in a nonacting job. Playing Rip Hogan does all his regular wrestling moves as usual his art of sensitivity is always put into place I like that. I liked the part where he ripped through the limo top and the driver used the bathroom in the limo while Rip crushes the bad guys daintily. Joan SeveranceSee No Evil Hear No Evil plays Rips lover who really knows how to flaunt it. I didn't like the part where she was sexually assaulted and Rip got him good.

	onyx:emotionText "I don't why the critics gave No Holds Barred such a hard time. I think this movie is a hit! Hulk Hogan is a great wrestler and his acting skills are very natural. Too much type cast was the cause of the bad reviews. Everyone in the sports world deserve a chance of doing something different. I don't typecast anyone who was in a nonacting job. Playing Rip Hogan does all his regular wrestling moves as usual his art of sensitivity is always put into place I like that. I liked the part where he ripped through the limo top and the driver used the bathroom in the limo while Rip crushes the bad guys daintily. Joan SeveranceSee No Evil Hear No Evil plays Rips lover who really knows how to flaunt it. I didn't like the part where she was sexually assaulted and Rip got him good.

This was made back in the days when Vince McMahon and pretty much everybody else in wrestling tried their best to keep the secret from being revealed. That secret being of course that pro wrestling is staged and choreographed. So you had movies like this and a few others from the time that treated it as though it was real. The plot to this is pretty stupid. Hulk Hogan plays a version of himself named Rip who is the WWF Champion. Kurt Fuller runs a TV network that loses to wrestling in the ratings due to Rip's popularity. So Fuller tries to come up with his own pro wrestling alternative called Battle of the Tough Guys. Seriously. Through a series of ridiculous events that involve a lot of big men grunting and fakehitting each other Fuller discovers his own champion Zeus a hybrid of Mr. T and Frankenstein's monster. Zeus is played by Tommy Tiny Lister who went on to a long career in everything from Alist theatrical releases to garbage that shows on the SyFy channel at 2am. The rest of the movie is a long wait until the inevitable showdown between Rip and Zeus.Hogan and Lister are both so awful you can't help but enjoy them. They snarl and growl and carry on like animals marking their territory every time they're face to face. The real star of the movie though is Kurt Fuller with one of the most overthetop performances you'll ever see. He's got more ham in him than Porky Pig. Objectively it's a terriblymade movie. Its only redeeming quality is that it has some merit as an unintentional comedy. For current fans of professional wrestling it will all seem pretty dull. The wrestling matches mostly consist of guys clubbing each other with their forearms and posing a lot. For people who grew up with the Hulkster and the old school WWF like me there's a lot of nostalgic appeal here. Fans of so bad they're good movies may also find something to like about this turkey. Many memorably bad scenes and corny lines. One of my favorites is when Hulk starts throwing food at two thugs trying to rob the diner he's eating at while the Hank Williams Jr. song All My Rowdy Friends plays in the background. Movie gold.".

	schema:headline " What's that smell? It's No Holds Barred stinking! It's still entertaining somewhat.";
	schema:reviewBody "No Holds Barred was just one of those movies that's 'so bad it's good'. Directed by Thomas J. Wright and produce by the World Wrestling Federation now WWE. The movie was trying to capitalize on Hulk Hogan's popularity in wrestling. The movie is also trying to boost the wrestler's acting career years after his last appearance on the big screen in 1982's Rocky III. Since Hulk Hogan's acting chops are not the best the movie has Hulk Hogan stars as Rip Thomas a very popular prowrestler. Basically Hogan is playing himself in this film. The only different is that he has a younger brother Randy Mark Pellegrino in this. The two brothers are very close and Randy's presence in the audience motivates him enough to win his matches. When Rip turns down money to join the rival network the network chairman Brell Kurt Fuller wants revenge. He decide to look for somebody to challenge Rip to a match that he can promote. He finds Zeus Tiny Lister Jr. an excon. After using Zeus to beat up Randy. Rip promises his brother that he'll defeat Zeus and win the match for him. The movie has some really unrealistic action scenes. The prowrestling matches are not really wrestling based matches but more like real street brawls. The movie even add oddly a robbery subplot that has little to do with the main plot just to make Hulk Hogan look good. Honestly are we supposed to take Rip seriously when he's throwing pies at the bad guys!? This movie has gone out of its way to make the antagonists as despicable as humanly possible with them beating women up and treating children like crap. Tiny Lister Jr. in my opinion doesn't look menacing. The goofy unibrow the side 'z' haircut add to the blind eye and that voice makes him look retarded and hammy. Honestly he look more menacing as Deebo in 1995's Friday. He can barely do action scenes in the film. Another thing honestly why would a billionaire chairman risk going to jail by hosting and promoting illegal 'battle of the toughmen' fighting? Brell is such a onedimension bad guy that is willing to send a gang of thugs and rapist to make Rip's life a living hell just because Rip didn't sign with him! It doesn't make any sense in a reality sense! Why risk getting catch for 'attempt murder' on something so dumb? I guess it makes sense in a prowrestling sense. Kurt Fuller is so over the top. It's get worst when the screenwriters give him annoying lines that always have the word 'Jockass' in it. He says it throughout the film. While the character of Brell is made up. His character does borderline have similarities to the real life rival of WWF at the time Media Mongol Ted Turner. Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting Network purchased WWF's rival promotion World Championship Wrestling in Nov. 1988 and try to promote it as a 'real man' wrestling. Often showing over the top violence similar to what Brell was showing in his programming. WCW was mostly less kid friendly than Hulkamania WWF. I have to give Hulk Hogan some credit in this movie. While his acting isn't the best. His snarling and grunting are cartoonish but he try really hard to make emotional in some scenes. He indeed cry when Randy got hurt. He also made the funnier scenes really hilarious with his delivery. I can't help laughing my head off at the whole 'dookie' scene. I had a few chuckles during the whole one room hotel scene with Samantha Moore Joan Severance. Joan Severance was really hot but her character was a bit too bitchy for me. The movie does go a bit dark at times. I find it odd for the film to go from rape attempt to comically bike chase in less than a minute. The movie goes all 1980's montage in the middle with Zeus engages in a brutal training routine for the match while Rip is more focused on Randy's rehabilitation. The ending is just odd. I have never watch a wrestling match that lavish before. Unless it's 2008's the Wrestler at the Oscars. The movie did OK at the box office but WWF felt that they can make more money. So in 1989 No Holds Barred The MatchThe Movie was shown on payperview. The program consisted of the film in its entirety followed by a match prerecorded at a Wrestling Challenge taping. It is currently not yet available on the WWE Network. To promote the PPV Tiny Lister came to WWE as the Zeus character to challenge Hogan to a series of matches. 1989 SummerSlam and 1989's Survivor Series The HoganBeefcake vs. SavageZeus tag team rivalry resumed after the Survivor Series was the leadup to No Holds Barred The MovieThe Match.. Rumors had it that if No Holds Barred had been a success the main event for 1990's WrestleMania VI would have been Hulk Hogan vs. Zeus. Thank God the PPV wasn't a huge hit and Zeus was sent packing from prowrestling. Instead Vince McMahon went with the idea of having Hogan Vs the Ultimate Warrior and the rest was wrestling history. Hulk's movie career didn't quite take off as hoped as a result of No Holds Barred and years later he indeed sign up for Ted Turner's WCW. The movie was then put VCR tapes sold and then shelf. It wasn't until 2012 when the movie finally saw a DVD release. The 2012 DVD is crappy. It has no special features. Get the 2014's BluRay for that. For wrestling fans look for cameos of Howard Finkel Stan Hansen Gene Okerlund and Jesse The Body' Ventura in the film. Also look for Games of Thrones's Peter Dinklage's first onscreen role. Overall It's a lot of fun watching it but I can't say this is a great movie.".

It doesn't make any sense in a reality sense! Why risk getting catch for 'attempt murder' on something so dumb? I guess it makes sense in a prowrestling sense. Kurt Fuller is so over the top. It's get worst when the screenwriters give him annoying lines that always have the word 'Jockass' in it. He says it throughout the film. While the character of Brell is made up. His character does borderline have similarities to the real life rival of WWF at the time Media Mongol Ted Turner. Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting Network purchased WWF's rival promotion World Championship Wrestling in Nov. 1988 and try to promote it as a 'real man' wrestling. Often showing over the top violence similar to what Brell was showing in his programming. WCW was mostly less kid friendly than Hulkamania WWF. I have to give Hulk Hogan some credit in this movie. While his acting isn't the best. His snarling and grunting are cartoonish but he try really hard to make emotional in some scenes. He indeed cry when Randy got hurt. He also made the funnier scenes really hilarious with his delivery. I can't help laughing my head off at the whole 'dookie' scene. I had a few chuckles during the whole one room hotel scene with Samantha Moore Joan Severance. Joan Severance was really hot but her character was a bit too bitchy for me. The movie does go a bit dark at times. I find it odd for the film to go from rape attempt to comically bike chase in less than a minute. The movie goes all 1980's montage in the middle with Zeus engages in a brutal training routine for the match while Rip is more focused on Randy's rehabilitation. The ending is just odd. I have never watch a wrestling match that lavish before. Unless it's 2008's the Wrestler at the Oscars. The movie did OK at the box office but WWF felt that they can make more money. So in 1989 No Holds Barred The MatchThe Movie was shown on payperview. The program consisted of the film in its entirety followed by a match prerecorded at a Wrestling Challenge taping. It is currently not yet available on the WWE Network. To promote the PPV Tiny Lister came to WWE as the Zeus character to challenge Hogan to a series of matches. 1989 SummerSlam and 1989's Survivor Series The HoganBeefcake vs. SavageZeus tag team rivalry resumed after the Survivor Series was the leadup to No Holds Barred The MovieThe Match.. Rumors had it that if No Holds Barred had been a success the main event for 1990's WrestleMania VI would have been Hulk Hogan vs. Zeus. Thank God the PPV wasn't a huge hit and Zeus was sent packing from prowrestling. Instead Vince McMahon went with the idea of having Hogan Vs the Ultimate Warrior and the rest was wrestling history. Hulk's movie career didn't quite take off as hoped as a result of No Holds Barred and years later he indeed sign up for Ted Turner's WCW. The movie was then put VCR tapes sold and then shelf. It wasn't until 2012 when the movie finally saw a DVD release. The 2012 DVD is crappy. It has no special features. Get the 2014's BluRay for that. For wrestling fans look for cameos of Howard Finkel Stan Hansen Gene Okerlund and Jesse The Body' Ventura in the film. Also look for Games of Thrones's Peter Dinklage's first onscreen role. Overall It's a lot of fun watching it but I can't say this is a great movie.";

He tries his best to ruin this movie as he tries to ruin every other movie I have ever seen him in. That man simply cannot act! It makes you wonder why he's in so many movies. Does anybody know?Based on the other reviews I almost didn't watch this but once again it shows that what's comedy for someone is not necessarily comedy for everyone.I enjoyed it a lot this late evening and will probably watch it again and give it a solid 8.Possibly because I was positively surprised after reading the other reviews...".

The movie was well paced and reasonably suspenseful as such a movie that tries to follow in the footsteps of movies like 48 hours should be.There's one thing I dislike about this movie however and that's Dom DeLouise. He tries his best to ruin this movie as he tries to ruin every other movie I have ever seen him in. That man simply cannot act! It makes you wonder why he's in so many movies. Does anybody know?Based on the other reviews I almost didn't watch this but once again it shows that what's comedy for someone is not necessarily comedy for everyone.I enjoyed it a lot this late evening and will probably watch it again and give it a solid 8.Possibly because I was positively surprised after reading the other reviews...";

The wit is very clever my favourite being the license for sex and some of the slapstick is quite amusing. The plot is not deep but the movie is what I call a fun movie.The movie stars Gene Hackman who plays far better bad guys that good guys though in this movie he was good. Then there is Dan Ackroyd who simply steals the show with his antics. Ackroyd is a very good actor as he can take on different roles. Early in his career he seemed to play simply comic roles such as the Blues Brothers but recently he has taken a little more serious approach to his roles such as the assassin in Grosse Point Blanc. Loose Cannons has him playing a cop with multiple personalities and some of them such as the Road Runner are a hoot.As for attitudes I guess it deals mainly with tolerance for those who are mentally disabled. Ackroyd's character is disabled due to a painful experience in the past and Hackman puts in effort to actually help Ackroyd return to his job and overcome his experience. It played a little part of the film but not much. Moreso it was an actioncomedy flick.The one thing that concerned me was that the title had little to do with the movie. A loose cannon is somebody who does not take part in the team somebody who is not under control and goes about doing their own thing. Obviously it comes from the times of wooden sailing ships in that if a cannon was not secure it could roll all over the ship and possibly cause quite a lot of damage. These guys did not seem to be loose cannons rather they were involved in a case and were doing what they could to solve it. There was no big police cover up and their superiors were not ordering them to desist from the case. Other than that which is minor but I tend to drag up minor things it was a good movie.".

Otherwise it is hard to see Hackman or Aykroyd accepting on the basic premise of making cheap laughs out of a psychiatric illness  bearing in mind this was long before the days of Me Myself and Irene. The darker elements of the plot certainly call for a much more serious approach which could have worked with a better actor. In reality it's hard to chuckle as Aykroyd goons about as Butch Cassidy various Star Trek characters and Road Runner to name but a few.These personalities manifest under severe duress and such a plot device would be more believable if the character was a civilian caught up in the cops  robbers chase. Instead  incredibly  not only is Aykroyd a cop he was never cut out for the rigors of police work and was given the job as a favor from his uncle a senior police detective. Really which career cops do that kind of thing? Worse still Aykroyd is brought out of convalescence by the same uncle who is apparently so desperate to crack a case that he will endanger the welfare of a family member with a very serious psychiatric illness and risk the loss of his job for gross misconduct. Suspending disbelief even in the name of broad comedy can only go so far.The movie sets the tone right at the beginning with a crass scene that introduces Hackman as a detective on a disturbanceofthepeace call to an apartment building. Why a couple of detectives are sent out on a routine call is never adequately explained. Aykroyd's gooning is often plainly embarrassing  leaping around in the street during a car chase doing a flying monkeyWicked Witch skit from The Wizard of Oz comes painfully to mind. The bad guys might as well be made from cardboard which would explain how such ruthless villains can just stand there holding their guns as AykroydasRoadRunner steamrolls over them. Beepbeep! It's all extremely lowgrade stuff and deserves to be avoided even by fans of the main actors especially as Hackman is only here to make up the numbers. There is an attempt at empathy for Aykroyd's character with some serious talk about his condition but Aykroyd simply isn't a giftedenough actor to pull this off. Dom DeLuise is along for the ride and he does what little is asked of him. In fact his character is very easy for the audience to identify with as he rolls his eyes and groans at Aykroyd's antics throughout the movie.".

There's really not an original moment here unless you could what the murders are happening for. Get ready for this. The cops are trying to track down a porno movie with Hitler.

Yes it's fairly a mindless action just to entertain but the try of making a comedy a very lousy one then agglutinating it to the main movie to sell it as an action comedy was so failed and deformed huge part of the whole thing. The script treats the matter of Aykroyd's disease in strangely contradicting way. Sometimes it's a sad illness where verses by Dylan Thomas are said and sometimes it's a cheap tool to make Aykroyd imitate Road Runner ! Well apparently that was tensely made. Not only this the fromhaterstofriends line between the 2 leads is lost after their first conversation in Hackman's car. They seemed later accepting each other fine thus so long for a running ironies or dramatic changes. The dialog is deeply uninspired. Noting is comic or even right about it. Look at scene like the one in which Hackman talks to his colleague  the black policewoman or the one where he meets Ronny Cox for the first time or when he talks about the order in the universe through his car's ignition they're bland scenes with no funny thing to come up with or important info to inform. The comic situations are none. The multiple personality disorder leads to some poor sketches and terrible impersonations. OH MY GOD Aykroyd did his Razzie worthy performance there the Road Runner in specific was his and this movie's worst bottom for sure ! Some moments are just weird. For instance Hackman's first scene it never tells us how come that 2 detectives are sent out on a disturbanceofthepeace call to an apartment ? For another  we know that Hackman's flat is burned just like that! We weren't allowed to see that at the least. OK. They're not weird they're dumb !Aykroyd was loud and very silly Where was Jim Carry or  as one of the IMDb reviewers asked smartly  Robin Williams?. Hackman was fooling around for making a comedy with the wrong material? for getting a job? I don't know. It's official that the 1980s was his lowest decade. Moreover both of Hackman and Aykroyd had no chemistry with each other and looked chubby. There is no rest since this script doesn't have anything to present on the level of characters further than its 2 leads ! So what could be positive here? It's easy  seeing the 60 year old Hackman playing a play on Martin Riggs of Lethal Weapon movies as a crazy super cop. Although this movie wasn't a bright point in his career but he was a bright point in this movie. I loved seeing him in action and in that red sweater. Aside from that positive things happen accidentally and rapidly  The moment when Hackman had to play Captain Kirk to solve a crisis. The trick which the leads used to bluff the bad guys in the train station. The design of Dom DeLuise's cane as a secret bottle of wine. 2 lines between the nurse and Hackman near the end I'd rather set my head on fire and have it put out with a sledgehammer  I'd like to see that actually!. And thank god that the action was vivid it is what makes this movie watchable or in fact bearable !Director Bob Clark is always related to the Razzie awards Turkey of the year movie more than once with Rhinestone 1984 Turk 182! 1985 Baby Geniuses 1999 and Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2 2004. Some may say he isn't a bad director. Though he undoubtedly has a bad scripts fetish and it shows. That  with the best techniques  still makes a bad director ! Loose Cannons is made by loose cannons who lost a good chance to make a talented action comedy. They're so dry people who made so dry movie. Now to a big annoying problem this movie causes which is its last lines. The 2 cops are hired by the Mossad and they'll have a training in Sinai desert. For your information Sinai is an Egyptian land not Israeli. Israel did invade it in 1967 and occupy it for 6 years however Egypt went to war to free its stolen land in 1973 and succeeded by battles of war and  later  peace in regaining it completely in 1982. So when this 1990 movie says something like that then whether their makers are ignorant or braggart !".

The plot is ridiculous. The pacing is poor. The acting isn't even slightly impressive. The characters are clichs and stereotypes. The humor is all crude innuendos and people swearing. How is that funny? Oh and of course there's Aykroyd's characters multiple personality disorder. Ah yes. Lets laugh at a terrible mental disorder. And what's with how serious the film tries to be at times? It might have been slightly entertaining if it didn't take itself so seriously. All in all just a terrible failure on every conceivable level. I recommend this only to hardcore fans of Hackman and Aykroyd. Everyone else should do themselves a huge favor and skip this. There are plenty of other films with the two actors and most of them are far better. 110".

	schema:headline " Ageless Hollywood Epic Adventure.";
	schema:reviewBody "Arguably the finest romantic epic adventure of the Golden Age of motion pictures Fox's CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE 1947 has amazingly not dated one iota since its inception. The movie is a joy to behold! With rich vibrant 3 strip Technicolor Samuel Shellabarger's classic novel about the young Spanish nobleman who joins Cortez' Conquistadores in the New World to escape the inquisition comes mightily to the screen. This was a 1947 blockbuster with outstanding production values. Tyrone Power is terrific in it and Caesar Romero gives a striking performance as the all conquering Cortez. Solidly directed by the always reliable Henry King it was gleamingly photographed by Charles Clark and Arthur E. Arling and was splendidly written for the screen by Lamar Trotti. The only crib I have with the movie is its 140 minute running time. Despite the film dealing only with a little over half of Shellabarger's book it is still a tad long for a movie. With about 20 minutes shorn from its length it would have made for a tighter more cohesive viewing experience. Nevertheless it is still a memorable and spectacular piece of filmed entertainment.The picture cost almost 5 million dollars to produce. A gigantic sum in 1947 and the cost is evident throughout. Extensive location filming was done in Mexico where the real events depicted took place. And almost unbelievably coincidental is that while filming in Uruapan an active volcano was erupting and was utilised in the background for the closing scenes. This so accurately substituted for another active volcano that was erupting during Cortez' actual invasion all those centuries ago.Complimenting the colourful production throughout is Alfred Newman's blistering Oscar nominated score. Beside his Academy Award winning music four years earlier for The Song Of Bernadette CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE is his finest achievement and contains his celebrated and spine tingling Conquest March surely cinema's greatest march theme! Also from the score is the sumptuous music for Catana the peasant girl The lovely Jean Peters making her debut and the equally gorgeous theme for the lady Luisa Barbara Lawrence. Although Newman's Song Of Bernadette is quiet brilliant it was really one dimensional in structure being unable to untangle itself from its overt piousness. CASTILE on the other hand is totally different. Edward B. Powell Newman's trusted orchestrator for many years said in a 1975 interview it was a film that allowed Alfred full range as a composer. It had everything love death pomp action scenery and The Church. The grandeur of the whole thing inspired the use of the complete orchestral palette in the grand manner.Alfred Newman's inspired score is just one of the many stunning elements that makes CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE an unforgettable movie. It is a radiant example of Hollywood's golden past that had exceptional writing performances Cinematography and music. Since it was made over sixty years ago it has been enjoyed by past generations and without doubt it will be enjoyed by many generations to come. A Fox winner!".

Piramids were built volcanoes were erupting for real and ancient ship replicas were destroyed at sea. One of the main surprises was seeing that the beautiful Jean Peters could act. This actress without much dramatic training did an excellent job in her movie debut. She practically steals the picture from Tyrone Power  Impossible? She does and he's very good in this one. See her last scene while waiting to move deeper into Mexico with Cortez it's a treasure. I became a fan after seeing Miss Peters in the pirate flick Anne of the Indies she plays 'the pirate' and have seen most of her movies since. It's a shame Fox didn't use her talents in better fares such as Susan Hayward's I Want to Live but then Howard Hughes came into the picture while she was doing Castille and I imagine his obsession over her beauty ruined a promising career. This film is partly based on true events and has an excellent cast a fantastic screenplay and a musical score by Arthur Newman that rivals any other composed for anepic flick then and even now. It's on DVD now. Get it before they become extinct. It's worth seeing. Beautiful vistas a handsome Ty Power and a gorgeous Jean Peters.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is my understanding that this Hollywood adaptation of Samuel Shellabarger's book enraged the author so much that he put some kind of legal injunction against the Hollywood producers that prevented them from making the video and other profits for 50 years!  The reason The film stops halfway through the novel!  I love historical fiction and Shellabarger along with Raphael Sabatini The Sea Hawk Captain Blood are my favorite authors of historical adventures. In spite of Shellabarger's attitude to Hollywood I was delighted to see this film.  I only wish they could have made the whole book come to life because the action and plot are much more intense in the second half of the book  especially when Cortez has returned to lay siege to the Aztec city. Shellabarger reads very much like Bernal Diaz a common soldier under Cortez who wrote a history of the Conquest of Mexico.  Diaz's and Shellabarger's description of the fighting on the Aztec aqueducts is the most intense and desperate battle literature I have ever read!  I think this film should be remade as soon as possible and give the viewing audience the whole story.  Of course there will never be another Tyrone Power Jean Peters or Cesar Romero but do it anyway  and use Alfred Newman's original music score adopted by the USC Trojans as their own Conquest march and let Newman's son and nephew add the remainder of the score!  With today's hightech special effects this story would surpass Gladiator in splendor spectacle and action if Shellabarger was followed religiously and completely.  Shellabarger deserves the same fidelity that J.R.R. Tolkein has received from the New Zealand producers of Lord of the Rings.In spite of its shortcomings to the author I have loved this film for half a century!  It is my favorite classic film.  I fell in love with Jean Peters as Catana when I was only six years old in 1950 which is when I first saw the film. The Catana Love Theme has played in my head from time to time ever since! Now I have it on video thank God.  My every guest gets offered a viewing of it as well as a listen to its soundtrack by Newman.What more can I say?  The film like the book struck a chord in me that refuses to stop playing.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a shame that 20th Century Fox has yet to have released DVD editions of many of the films of the studio's biggest star Tyrone Power. Almost impossibly handsome enormously popular and with excellent acting credentials Power nearly singlehandedly kept the studio solvent in the traumatic transition years following WWII with costume epics like Captain from Castile showcasing his strengths.Castile echoes Power's earlier films The Mark of Zorro and Son of Fury as again he plays a gallant standing against an arrogant aristocratic class but this time he runs afoul of the Inquisition and must flee Spain to reestablish his wealth and reputation accompanied by loyal friend Lee J. Cobb and a servant girl who secretly adores him Jean Peters in one of her best performances. Recruited into the service of the charismatic Hernando Cortez Cesar Romero who nearly steals the film it's off to Aztlan Mexico today with a small army to face the overwhelming but naive Aztec civilization.While the film frequently drifts into melodrama shooting on location in Mexico with the permission and support of the Mexican government in glorious Technicolor gives even the most mundane moments a sense of spectacle and the cast is in top form. Worth singling out is a terrific supporting performance by Thomas Gomez as a soldierpriest who dispenses common sense as well as religion and helps Power realize that the woman he truly loves is not on a balcony in Spain but beside him as they march towards their destiny.Two aspects of the film deserve special recognition Alfred Newman's score featuring the vaulting 'Conquest' march is one of the finest of his long career and is even more popular today than when the film was released and Arthur E. Arling and Charles G. Clarke's cinematography is truly magnificent particularly in the breathtaking finale as Cortez' forces proudly march across a broad plain with active volcanoes in the background. Never has going 'on location' been more justified as the image is unforgettable! If any 'Powers that Be' are reading this review PLEASE offer this film on DVD soon! And while you're at it consider Power's other great films of the 40s and 50s he deserves to be 'rediscovered' by audiences today...".

Recruited into the service of the charismatic Hernando Cortez Cesar Romero who nearly steals the film it's off to Aztlan Mexico today with a small army to face the overwhelming but naive Aztec civilization.While the film frequently drifts into melodrama shooting on location in Mexico with the permission and support of the Mexican government in glorious Technicolor gives even the most mundane moments a sense of spectacle and the cast is in top form. Worth singling out is a terrific supporting performance by Thomas Gomez as a soldierpriest who dispenses common sense as well as religion and helps Power realize that the woman he truly loves is not on a balcony in Spain but beside him as they march towards their destiny.Two aspects of the film deserve special recognition Alfred Newman's score featuring the vaulting 'Conquest' march is one of the finest of his long career and is even more popular today than when the film was released and Arthur E. Arling and Charles G. Clarke's cinematography is truly magnificent particularly in the breathtaking finale as Cortez' forces proudly march across a broad plain with active volcanoes in the background. Never has going 'on location' been more justified as the image is unforgettable! If any 'Powers that Be' are reading this review PLEASE offer this film on DVD soon! And while you're at it consider Power's other great films of the 40s and 50s he deserves to be 'rediscovered' by audiences today...";

Head female duty falls to a vibrantly young Jean Peters in her film debut as Catana Perez pretty and beguiling her gorgeous green eyes shining bright in this Technicolor spectacle she is the perfect foil to Power's dash and swagger.Production costs are thought to have been over 4 million yet even though the film sadly lost money the money spent is still evident at every turn and it proved to be very popular with critics and film lovers alike. Director Henry King wonderfully utilises the panoramic vistas of the Mexican locale and the costumes come right out of the top draw but one of the most striking things in this magnificent production is the score from Alfred Newman. Stirring and emotionally hard it has to rank as one of the best scores to have ever been composed. I strongly recommend the isolated score option on the excellent Region 1 DVD. It's a far from perfect film for sure the no battle payoff at the finale is a great disappointment but the harking back to old historical days of yore can induce a tingle on the spine and in that respect the piece delivers handsomely. Just like its leading man ironically enough. 810".

It is just an excellent old school adventure film which deals with honor and loyalty which are pretty much lacking in today's films. It fired my young imagination and encouraged me to read the book by Samuel Shellabarger upon which it was based.It has a wonderful cast including Ty Power Jean Peters Lee J.

Alfred Newman's score is  good.Power was great as usual and Jean Peters turns in an excellent performance  this was her first film.Much of the film was shot in Mexico following the actual route that Cortez followed when he was conquering the Aztecs. Check out the live volcano in the background that was erupting while the film was shot. That ain't a painted background.I highly recommend this film especially if you haven't seen a Tyrone Power film because this is one of his best.".

	schema:headline " A bit solemn perhaps but with a great march. Just don't think about what happened to the Aztecs";
	schema:reviewBody "If Captain from Castile is remembered much today it probably is because of one of the most rousing marches a Hollywood composer ever wrote. The Conquest theme is heard only three times and the first two are brief but effective scene setters. We have to wait until the movie is almost over and Hernan Cortez is setting out on his march to the Aztec capital of Tenochititlan for the full treatment. The music by Alfred Newman embraces the moment with hundreds of soldiers the priests the natives the hangerson spreading out before us the horizon lightening and a single volcano smoking in the distance. The theme is inspiring martial emotional uplifting and memorable. It's enough to make most movie goers want to sign up and most historians queasy. In less than a generation a civilization of between 2 million and 6 million people was obliterated ground into quickly fading memories under the heels of soldiers landowners and priests with nearly all Aztec records burned nearly all Aztec structures torn down and nearly all natives allies and enemies of the Spanish alike turned into ignorant serfs under slave conditions that would make most American slave owners either blanche or be envious. But enough about reality a foolish expectation when Hollywood deals with history. Captain from Castile is a Tyrone Power swashbuckler made under the shrewd eye of Darryl F. Zanuck. Considering that the book by Samuel Shellabarger was a huge best seller well written and stuffed full of history the movie seems to me to be almost as dull at times as a Spanish onion especially during the first half hour. Here in Spain we learn about how noble is young Pedro de Varga Power how noble his father and mother are how noble the serving wench Catana Jean Peters is how noble Juan Garcia Lee J. Cobb is...and what a piece of self serving vomit is the local head of the Inquisition Diego de Silva John Sutton. Once we're in the prison with Pedro his family and Juan where de Silva has put them for heresy things pick up. After Pedro and Juan escape with Catana's help and when the three reach Cuba things pick up even more. And after an hour when we finally reach the coast of Mexico along with Cortez and his raggedy army of about 600 soldiers the movie actually starts. Pedro may be fleeing the Inquisition but now he has a chance to prove himself to help Cortez conquer an empire to realize his growing love for Catana even though he is of aristocratic birth and she is but a peasant and finally to ride along side Cortez for the fateful meeting with Moctezuma II. His friend Juan is with him. His new wife Catana carrying their baby son is in the crowd and he has his friend and confessor the wise and understanding Father Bartolomeo Thomas Gomez to nag about human rights. Pedro has survived false accusations sword thrusts and knife wounds. He has proved his worth to Cortez has foiled plots and finally has been promoted in Cortez' army to captain. The captain from Castile is on his way to being a contented conquerer of the Aztecs. Two firstrate performances are worth mentioning. One is by Lee J. Cobb. After seeing Cobb so powerful in movies like Thieves' Highway On the Waterfront and Twelve Angry Men it's a jolt to see him in this earlier costume caper. Still he manages to give a strong performance in spite of the tights he has to wear. The other outstanding performance is by Cesar Romero as Cortez. Romero roars through the movie with charisma high spirits and shrewdness. It's an expert job with no hamminess and is one of the few performances in the movie that has energy. We pay attention whenever Romero shows up. Captain from Castile is a great example of a big Hollywood spectacle from the Forties and I don't mean that as a criticism. On many levels it's fun to watch. At the same time it seems to me to be a film which is too solemn for its own good. For those who enjoy a good historical read Shellabarger's novel still has its merits. For an engrossing exciting and often gruesome picaresque novel about the Aztecs just before during and just after the Spanish conquest try Gary Jenning's Aztec.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great adventure concerning the Conquest of Mexico was written by Bernal Diaz De Castillo Shield bearer for the young Hernan Cortes who was 19 when he landed on its shores in 1519. Using his wits clever guile guts grit and deeply ingrained bravado plus some courageous and loyal officers in addition to five hundred men from the ships he later burned Cortes set out to meet befriend betray and then later destroy the mighty Montezuma Moctezuma and his empire by 1521. This movie is one of the best visual adaptation of said Conquest by the Spanish Conquistadores. Despite it's flaws and inaccuracies it is often used in many a school classroom. The conquest is put in the background with the surface story of a young aristocratic Castillian officer one Pedro De Vargas Tyrone Power who in trying to defend his family against the evils of the Inqusition endangers his ambitions with an attempt on the life of Diego De Silva John Sutton. Cesar Romero plays Hernando Cortez with a lively and jovial approach which is infectious to say the least. Lee J. Cobb Antonio Moreno Thomas Gomez Alan Mowbray are the supporting cast as is Jay Silverheels. From a stand point of the times the cast is good. However in hindsight they fall short of convincing a modern audience that any of them are Hispanic or of Spanish heritage. Yet with the generous beautiful scenic landscapes and ample scenery of the ocean ships and majestic scenes this is a wonderful attempt at capturing the era of the new world. It's tragic outcome is a couple years away but in the meantime enjoy the story as Hollywood presented it in 1947. ".

The conquest is put in the background with the surface story of a young aristocratic Castillian officer one Pedro De Vargas Tyrone Power who in trying to defend his family against the evils of the Inqusition endangers his ambitions with an attempt on the life of Diego De Silva John Sutton. Cesar Romero plays Hernando Cortez with a lively and jovial approach which is infectious to say the least. Lee J. Cobb Antonio Moreno Thomas Gomez Alan Mowbray are the supporting cast as is Jay Silverheels. From a stand point of the times the cast is good. However in hindsight they fall short of convincing a modern audience that any of them are Hispanic or of Spanish heritage. Yet with the generous beautiful scenic landscapes and ample scenery of the ocean ships and majestic scenes this is a wonderful attempt at capturing the era of the new world. It's tragic outcome is a couple years away but in the meantime enjoy the story as Hollywood presented it in 1947. ";

	schema:reviewBody "The most exciting part of Captain from Castile should have been the least exciting the beginning of the story that takes place in Spain when the De Vargas family is wronged at the hands of Diego De Silva John Sutton in the name of the Spanish Inquisition. Pedro De Vargas Tyrone Power seeking a runaway servant from the New World happens upon two of De Silva's men tormenting a tavern girl Catana Perez Jean Peters by sicking dogs on her to tear the laundry she is carrying to shreds. Pedro deals forcefully with the men who in turn run back to tell their master. To avenge this effrontery to his station in life De Silva who heads the Inquisition in the area declares the entire De Vargas family heretics having them arrested and thrown into jail to be dealt with accordingly. Pedro's twelveyear old sister is tortured to death by orders from De Silva. Pedro along with his mother and father are broken out of prison by an acquaintance Juan Garcia Lee J. Cobb. In the process Pedro has the opportunity to kill De Vargas to avenge his sister's death but only wounds him. Pedro's mother and father hide out in Italy but Garcia persuades Pedro and Catana who has aided in the escape to accompany him on an expedition headed by Hernando Cortez Cesar Romero to seek gold and adventure in the newly discovered West Indies. This part of the film is filled with action and suspense well edited directed with finesse by Henry King with breathtaking photography by Arthur E. Arling and Charles G. Clarke.After such a magnificent build up the rest of the movie should have been even more exciting but alas it is not. Too much time is spent on the romance between Pedro and Catana making this part of the film melodramatic soap opera with a few exceptions such as the theft of the gems and the confrontation between Pedro and his old nemesis De Silva who reappears on the scene as an emissary from the King of Spain seeking to introduce the Inquisition to the New World. And just when the main event is to occur the conquest of the mighty Aztec Empire by the handful of Conquistadors the show is over. What a disappointment!Though weak in its second half Captain of Castille is worthwhile for several reasons. One is the onlocation cinematography the introduction reads that when possible the story occurs in the exact places where Cortez and his army traveled. Second the acting is top notch with standout performances from Tyrone Power Jean Peters Cesar Romero and in particular by John Sutton who plays the nasty villain De Silva with lan. Jay Silverheels shows great potential in the small but significant role of Coatl before he became typecast as Tonto. Third the musical score by Alfred Newman which was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award adds much to the overall effect of the film especially the Conquest march. Finally the movie serves as a good introduction to the history of the period although the ill treatment of the Native Americans by the Conquistadores is basically ignored. Of significance is the emphasis on the class system that existed in Spain and was brought to Mexico by Cortez and his army along with the Catholic religion still powerful forces in Mexican culture today.".

The villain whom Power believes he has killed is played by John Sutton an instrument of the Inquisition who winds up in Mexico as well after killing Power's young sister. The entire cast is great  and the scenery! A live volcano no less! The music! Sensational. A firstclass production all the way.Power really didn't like doing these roles but the public demanded them of him and he is dashing heroic and romantic throughout. He had been a matine idol for 11 years but in this film he is showcased as if the audience is seeing him for the first time. Riding a horse being tough being romantic dancing  it's all him and he's marvelous.Romero makes a fantastic Cortez. It's really difficult to single anyone out because they're all so good. John Sutton was beyond evil.Jean Peters had an interesting career at Fox. Here she is quite young and effective. Even when she was moved into second rate films it seems as if she was always given the heavy acting role so it's obvious that her talent was recognized by the studio.I believe that during the period in which the film was made Power was involved with Lana Turner. Lucky woman even if she did lose him to Linda Christian later on.".

I was interested in noting Roy Roberts who later ended up in many t.v. sitcoms e.g. The Lucy Show.Fine locales including a real erupting volcano good acting lavish color photography...but all that doesn't equal a superior film. There are places in the film where the action is exciting but there are other long stretches where the film seems to sort of ramble along with no real goal...contributing to the overly long 2 hours and 21 minute length. And then suddenly the film ends...seemingly without building to any sort of climax. That's not to say this is an unwatchable film. It's reasonably entertaining.

The films follows well part of the book but it ends abruptly which is understandable considering its runtime of 140 minutes.Cortes's conquest of the Aztecs is very hard to accept by today's standards virtually all of Aztec culture was destroyed not counting the natives being killed by the thousands fighting canons with bows and arrows spears and stones. Nevertheless the hero Pedro De Vargas Tyrone Power is a loyal soldier of Cortes and his real enemy is the Inquisition the horror of which is well described by the film. For those like me who miss a disappearing genre the swashbuckler film in which Errol Flynn Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks were the great names this film is a pleasure to see from beginning to end. Jean Peters beautiful has her best role and the sensual dance number with her and Power is superb. Cesar Romero is great as Cortes in this mega budget film with great colors directed by the excellent Henry King.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a colorful pageant type film with some style and little substance. Not as classic in my opinion as the other Samuel Shellabarger book that was made into a Tyrone Power film Prince of Foxes. Both of these films were made by Henry King a director who I find to be generally watchable but not particularly compelling. Foxes was done in color and the locations are a bit more impressive in my opinion and perhaps just has a story and character that appeal to me more. In this film Power is playing a character with no real moral ambivalence not even moments where the audience might make the mistake of thinking that he does. So he's kind of a dull character but Power is a compelling enough actor to make it very watchable nonetheless.It's fun to see Cesar Romero as Cortez riding around on impressive horses with shining armor and making big speeches. It's very odd to see Lee J. Cobb in tights in his early scenes when he's befriending Power's character. But of course he's also such a good actor and knows how to use the screen so well that he's able to make a fairly standard character seem unpredictable. Jean Peters was solid in one of those roles where we're supposed to think that a really pretty girl is somehow practically unnoticed by most.I like the movie but I think that the script was probably dumbed down a bit compared to the book. You can't lose with Tyrone Power anchoring the entire film but you wish that they could have made a slightly better picture to match his talents coming right off his masterpiece in Nightmare Alley the same year.".

Prince of Foxes and The Black Rose come to mind.In Captain that conflict is downplayed in favor of 'Epic Scope' and Power's character actually seems to like and approve of Cortez as an admittedly greeddriven but basically decent goodguy whose heart is in the right place once you get past his greed genocidal tendencies and psychopathology.For most of the movie that actually works thanks to Romero's performance and the script's softsoaping of Cortez's negative personality traits. But those last five minutes ...How in God's name could you even try to elevate Spain's or Cortez's trampling of the New World as a positive expression of liberal or humanistic values? That's where the one star comes from the offensive and virtually obscene attempt to characterize someone like Cortez as a hero rather than the pathetic psychopath he and his fellows really were.Hollywood has always played fast and loose with factual history in favor of dramatic impact The King's Speech being the latest of brilliant examples but Captain from Castile's script is a script too far.".

A valid passport was needed by all in Imperial Prussia to apply for a job prove citizenship or even to travel. An old cobbler is denied a muchneeded passport due to the Prussian bureaucracy. He breaks into City Hall to steal one and is arrested. Finally he procures old military uniform of a captain and makes use of his previous military experience and the fact that nobody in that era would question the authority of any Prussian officer to commandeer a group of active duty military members he happens to meet and use them to take over city hall. In a series of humorous events he places the mayor and treasurer of the Berlin suburb of Koepenick under house arrest in his attempt to finally secure his desired passport. This event is still celebrated each year in a parade held in Berlin as the citizens of Berlin make fun of their welldocumented habit of yielding almost totally to the whims of the Prussian military throughout much of their history. The film's Berlin dialect can make it difficult for some viewers to understand the spoken dialog. This film has been remade several times including the most popular 1956 version starring Heinz Rhmann. Nothing beats this 1931 version at rendering a periodcorrect atmosphere that takes one back in time.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Captain of Kpenick' is a true story that could only have happened in Germany where the authority of a uniform was and still is? obeyed without question.In 1906 an obscure Tilsiter cobbler named Wilhelm Voigt 18491922 purchased the secondhand uniform of a Prussian infantry captain. Wearing this he travelled to the borough of Kpenick and ordered a troop of guardsmen to place themselves under his command. He then declared the town hall to be under military law ordering the arrest of the mayor and treasurer and confiscating all the funds in the exchequer. In this version it's 4000 deutschemarks a tidy sum. None of Voigt's orders were questioned and he got away with the dosh. When he was eventually caught the German people regarded Voigt's imposture as a jolly hoax that pricked the pomposity of petty bureaucrats. Although Voigt was clearly motivated by unlawful financial gain he emerged from the affair as a folk hero.This film is based on a stage adaptation of the original incident I can't vouch for its accuracy. Some of the incidents here seem a bit farfetched but I accept that the original incident happened similarly to what we see here although surely there weren't so many women involved. The movie is a comedy and succeeds on that level. I was especially impressed with the performance of Fritz Odemar as the apoplectic treasurer. Still in one sense this subject is no laughing matter. Let's recall what was the ultimate result of the Germans' penchant for mindless obedience to authority figures. This story was funny in 1931 but a few years later nobody in Germany would be laughing. More as an artefact of its time than for its merits as a comedy I'll rate this movie 7 out of 10.".

But this gem proved me wrong as I not only watched it but loved almost every second of it and Sinbad is always on the screen so surely it must be his doing!.The story is a common Hollywood theme a guy Sinbad passes himself off on a group or family as someone he's not in this case a childhood friend of a father Phil Hartman. A little variety exists in how to play this out but the same old stuff happens stranger teaches family a lesson and learns one himself along the way.What made this film great was the cast. Sinbad was surprisingly insightful and was able to make even average activities seem farfetched and outrageous. Phil Hartman had a relatively minor role and didn't really get to provide us with a full performance but his physical facial comedy of biting into a piece of turkey was extremely amusing facial comedy plays a large part in this film later coming back when a wine taster is testing a glass.Jeffrey Jones has too small a part this man is so underrated in Hollywood but does well with what he's been given. And most of all I think Kim Murphy's career should have ignited from this film but I guess producers didn't watch it. Murphy is obviously beautiful which seems to be enough to make it in Hollywood but more so she played her Gothic character perfectly. I was amused with her delivery of the lines concerning Edgar Allan Poe's last meal her Smiths tshirt perfect choice and the really wacky line about evil rats. The writers did their homework when writing in Murphy's character and she repaid them in spades. Can I use the word spades when talking about a Sinbad movie? The soundtrack was amusing. Best feature the fact that some scenes were so obviously McDonald's commercials with one really extended scene including a McDonald's theme song. Heck after that moment I would have cut off my own leg for a double quarter pounder with cheese.I love this movie and would not be against displaying it proudly on my movie shelf for all my relatives friends and guests to see. I do not know why this film has gone underground and has been long forgotten my many people but it shouldn't have been. This is comedy gold people.".

The writers did their homework when writing in Murphy's character and she repaid them in spades. Can I use the word spades when talking about a Sinbad movie? The soundtrack was amusing. Best feature the fact that some scenes were so obviously McDonald's commercials with one really extended scene including a McDonald's theme song. Heck after that moment I would have cut off my own leg for a double quarter pounder with cheese.I love this movie and would not be against displaying it proudly on my movie shelf for all my relatives friends and guests to see. I do not know why this film has gone underground and has been long forgotten my many people but it shouldn't have been. This is comedy gold people.";

	schema:headline " Dumb comedy or one of the best films of the '90s?";
	schema:reviewBody "The comic genius and timing of stars Sinbad and Phil Hartman take what could have been a runofthemill dumb comedy film and turn it into a wonderfully likeable tourdeforce. The premise has been done time and time again it's basically a fish out of water story. Yes the gangsters are dumb almost to the point where they're annoying. Sure we see the message coming from a mile away.But there are a few things that separate this film from other comedies and elevate to the status of excellence. First of all it's hilarious. There are few jokes that don't work and they are immediately forgotten as this fastpaced romp wastes no time. The speedup of scenes and the quick editing several shots seem to last for no longer than a few seconds do get a slight bit irritating but it serves its purpose by catering to the fastpaced story and Sinbad's style of comedy. Take for instance the party scene in which Sinbad is explaining what the GFH on his suit jacket stands for. Slow down the scene and it loses the humor.Since the McDonald's issue has been cited again and again in reviews with varying degrees of criticism let me address it briefly. First of all there are a lot of people who love to eat McDonald's food. It's not healthy for you but you'd be lying if you say that it tastes awful. Now Sinbad's character is established as the lazy unhealthy alwayseating slacker from the very beginning as he comes home to his apartment and enjoys his McDonald's and 2 liter bottle of soda. The real Derek Bond is completely contrasted with the impostor Derek Bond's lifestyle. Hence the fish out of water comedy. Sinbad's character is put in a desperate situation where he assumes this other man's life and the man he is pretending to be is the complete opposite of him. He's got a successful career as a dentist and he maintains a strict diet of vegetables and muescli cereal. So when Sinbad's Kevin Franklin character in this awkward and unfamiliar situation of staying with a suburban family's house and pretending to be someone who everyone expects to be a healthconscious stuffy professional manages to escape for a moment and sees the familiar golden arches he's so happy that he feels like he's in a commercial. He knows McDonald's and in many places McDonald's seems to be an unchanging constant source of familiar greasy food. McDonald's works in the context of the film because it's a real fastfood place that we can relate to because we've all eaten there at one time or another. To me if there was some fictional place like Lou's Hamburgers it wouldn't work. The character design might come through but there could be no jingle resounding in our heads and it'd take you out of the reality of the story which I discuss in next paragraph. Yes McDonald's is a real fastfood joint and Kevin Franklin loves to eat there. Does that make Houseguest a McDonald's commercial? I don't think that it does I think it maintains an element of reality that we as viewers can relate to. Perhaps we needn't always be so cynical as some professional film critics are.Now I mention the 'reality' of Houseguest and you must think I'm absolutely crazy. Houseguest is an unrealistic film that requires you to throw logic out the door entirely if you wish to enjoy it right? Well not necessarily. I think looking back at this film eight years after it was made we can look at the family suburban life depicted and notice the realness of the characters. Phil Hartman's character Gary Young is a hardworking businessman at a law firm. He sucks up to his boss and the boss's wife and spends more time with his job than his family. Gary's wife tries to be there for her family but she's taken on a career with frozen yogurt stores and it's turning out to be far more timeconsuming than she imagined.Then there are the three children. The oldest girl is distancing herself from her family trying to find comfort in a Goth phase taking pleasure from sad poetry and a boyfriend who seems to think that he's a tough kid from the hood. The middle child is the only son Jason. He tries to win his father's approval by playing basketball and hoping to be good. The youngest daughter seems not to be getting any attention either. Her busy parents don't have time for her and she's been getting lessons from television programs instead.The dysfunctional middleclass family serves as a foil for Kevin Franklin pretending to be someone he is not who will ultimately find the desire to help these people who have unknowingly opened up their home to him a complete stranger. Kevin Franklin doesn't have a job a family or kids and yet it his interactions with the Young family that allow both them and he to better themselves.Now if you've seen the movie you're probably reading this and thinking This guy's nuts. He's completely overanalyzing some stupid comedy. Well perhaps I am. Houseguest is indeed a silly hectic fishoutofwater comedy somewhat formulaic but very much successful. However to dismiss the film as 'bad' or a 'stupid comedy' is a superficial assessment of a film that really has a lot going for it.Sure the film is glossy and not without faults but then so is life and the people that we interact with. Houseguest is a winning comedy and one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It presents laughs but also provides a realistic look at individual and family life in the '90s even if this comes out of an unrealistic setup of a man assuming another identity to avoid the mob.Muchmaligned and underappreciated Houseguest is a gem of a family comedy that I certainly hope you will give a chance. Or if you initially didn't like it some more thought on these matters and maybe a second chance.".

The dialogue sparkles the direction isn't just 2takesandgo the cinematography is whackily speeded up in some places and the editing is rapid fire. And unlike most family movies it lasts for 110 minutes. That's about half an hour longer than is usual. I know this hardly seems like a valid point but I reckon it proves the movie's got more content than fart jokes etc.My only gripe is the obvious McDonalds plugging about 40 minutes in. If you can just turn away for these 10 seconds then it's not so bad. It's a shame that it's there tho because it tarnishes the credibility of the movie.Sinbad is always good and the late great Phil Hartman can make any film watchable so they really add to this brilliantly entertaining comedy. Do yourself a favour and watch it. It's not just for kids. I watched my VHS a zillion times and I was so impatient for this DVD to be released.So it's barebones but who cares? I'm just glad to have it. The 1.781 anamorphic picture is super and the Dolby 2.0 surround track is decent enough. After all this is a dialogue driven comedy but some sound effects and music are presented pretty well. My subwoofer even go a big kick from a gunshot near the end.Pick this one up whenever you see it. No matter what age you are you and your kids will enjoy.".

An orphan Kevin once bragged to his grade school classmates that one day he would be very wealthy. Trouble is none of his getrichquick schemes have panned out and Kevin is in debt to the local mobsters. When they come to collect Keving speeds off to the airport to catch a flight. However with the mob on his heels Kevin overhears an even better opportunity for him to lay low for awhile at the airport terminal. It seems that Gary Phil Hartmanand his children are waiting for an old camp friend that Gary has not seen for 20 years. Kevin seizes the moment and declares himself to be Dr. Derek Bond a dentist to Gary and the kids. Gary is delighted to see him and takes him home. Once there in heavenly suburbia Kevin finds out he is supposed to make a speech at the local elementary school on career day. Okay. Kevin also learns he is reputed to be a strict vegetarian. Horrors. But as the family showers him with gifts and parties Kevin wonders as do we all how soon will they learn the truth about his identity? This is a great film very funny and very spiritlifting. Sinbad's Kevin is a such a lovable character despite his scheming that everyone is hoping for a happy ending. Hartman likewise is deadpan funny in his role as a much putupon lawyer with a family that looks perfect but which in reality has some problems to overcome. The setting is lovely the costumes are nice and the look of the film is quite wonderful too. Do you want to cheer up yourself and your family in a big fashion? This is the film for you as to watch it is to love it and laugh it up till the clouds overhead are long gone.".

But as the family showers him with gifts and parties Kevin wonders as do we all how soon will they learn the truth about his identity? This is a great film very funny and very spiritlifting. Sinbad's Kevin is a such a lovable character despite his scheming that everyone is hoping for a happy ending. Hartman likewise is deadpan funny in his role as a much putupon lawyer with a family that looks perfect but which in reality has some problems to overcome. The setting is lovely the costumes are nice and the look of the film is quite wonderful too. Do you want to cheer up yourself and your family in a big fashion? This is the film for you as to watch it is to love it and laugh it up till the clouds overhead are long gone.";

Phil Hartman could not have been better but that should not be surprising if you're one of the many out there that deems him a genius like myself. Sinbad did his part and contributed to many laughs. The story is what you'd expect with an underachiever from the hood hooking up with some white surburbians. Sinbad's job is to bring us into the lilly white community of Zwickley and deconstruct the Puritan values and customs that everyone has become accustomed to. Sinbad makes white people let loose by passing around a wine bottle and dance to Brick House. Sounds great doesn't it? But if you're looking for mind perplexing subject matter you're in the wrong place to begin with. Sit back laugh and enjoy a very underrated '90's comedy. One of the few leading role works by the late Phil Hartman.".

A particularly goofy scene is the whole washing balls sketch.So it's the sort of movie that you watch with best buds. Don't expect a religious experience just expect to laugh I'm sure that you will.

	schema:reviewBody "I was in college when this movie came out in 1995 and me and my friends all thought it was hilarious then. Now at age 40 I still find a lot of it still funny. Sinbad was very funny but from an older perspective he's sometimes a little too hyper excited. But that aspect is still minimal and it's mainly in the first parts of the movie before Sinbad teams up with Phil Hartman. We get a couple more of the comic book style gangsters that we've seen in so many other 90s movies I.e. Getting even with dad  Cop and a halfMan of the house. And the late Phil and his wife could be a little brighter for not being able to see Sinbad as an imposter. But I've always let that part slide cause the scenes with Sinbad Phil and his family were the best parts of the movie. I still find the part with Sinbad at the school assembly very funny. Same with Sinbad at the party at the house. And Sinbad's reaction to Phil calling every activity they do the thing. And I've always liked Sinbad and Phil's chemistry together here. Phil Hartman is one of a number of great comic actors from the 80s and 90s I really liked that are no longer with us such as Chris Farely River Phoenix and Corey Haim. Jeffery Jones definitely had had his day but in Houseguest his  Ferris Bueller funniness is long gone. But there's still some funny zanyness. I always shared Sinbad's fondness for McDonalds back then back in the days when McDonalds burgers still tasted good. That was before the quality of McDonalds Burger King and a number of other fast food places went downhill. I still laughed at this movie. Like I said a lot of the movie's still funny. It's on my long list of favorites from the 80s and 90s the age of my youth.".

His awardacceptance monologue near the beginning I find hilarious. I can picture a golden age icon like young Mickey Rooney or Jimmy Stewart doing the same scene with a zany innocence... but Sinbad is a comic for our times and because of the edginess of his character who was set up to look like a petty criminal that scene couldn't have been more funny. I also enjoy the toothremoval sequence. It's comedy worthy of Jerry Lewis or Lucille Ball and that the entire film is really a build up to that scene makes it forgivable.

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Franklin Sinbad is a big man with big dreams but try telling that to his car that backfires so often that he probably doesn't go through the drive thru at McDonald's his favorite place to eat. Growing up as an orphan money centric Kevin has tried to get it any way he can by selling baseball cards watching tapes on home based businesses and finally borrowing 5k from Happy the local loan shark. When it comes time to collect none of these business opportunities have paid off in the least so he has two options. The two mobsters kill him or he can have another day of life and an opportunity to pay 50k he naturally takes the latter and decides to skip town which is when he runs into Gary Young Phil Hartmann who is looking for his uptight conservative Derek Bond Ron Glass who's well known for his role in Barney Miller and he pretends to be the real Derek Bond with hilarious results especially when trying to remember the childhood he had with Gary at Camp Maple Ridge and the lyrics to Goodnight Irene First A presentation in which he BS's his way through with hilarity trying to figure out the details of Derek Bond before a garden party that he livens up after a mishap with an ice cream machine and a wine tasting that would otherwise be uptight and conservative. As he bumbles through the time at the Youngs he realizes that their family though a shining example of the nuclear family with a successful Mom owner of a yogurt franchise and Dad who works for a rival frozen desert company in town but the kids are not exactly the Leave It To Beaver kids.The oldest girl has a thing for dead guys and depressing poetry wearing black all the time and has a boyfriend named Steve but he prefers ST3 he is simply the son of a Congressman who thinks he's a white boy who grew up in the hood around black people those who have are often called white chocolate. The daughter is justtrying to find her voice as well but not in the best of ways Kevin teaches her to embrace life and living things and to not let a guy like ST3 take advantage of her and Kevin teaches ST3 a lesson Don't leave a chicken dinner for a chicken McNugget this other girl he was with at a shop Kevin went to by getting pretty creative. His Son Jason is obsessed with pleasing his dad who wants him to become an all star basketball player Kevin teaches him confidence by teaming up with him to be victorious over a bunch of teenagers who hog the basketball court and wins their clothes. The youngest girl is ignored so he basically watches cartoons with her throughout his time at the Young Family Gary the Father is pitted against his wife by being given a Beaver Meadows account that is going into a frozen yogurt business and he has a conflict of interest. When mentioning this to his boss Mr Pike Pike simply says that he knows that Gary is best for this eventually Kevin steps in saying that he needs to stand up to his boss and can it which he does Gary then resolves to work as in home counsel for his wife.As all this is going on the thugs are homing in on Kevin until their search leads them to the Young Residence with the real Derek Bond who then states that he is the real Derek Bond and that this man is an impostor. Then things make sense for Gary and the family after Kevin is taken away and the family then decides to go after him when the real Derek Bond berates Kevin as a two bit crook. Final chase happens between Kevin and the mobsters and they acquire a scratch off which can be worth a cool million they then part ways with Kevin and let him go.One year later Kevin is rich with that Porsche thanks to a Handbook for Houseguests he published. Now that the Youngs know who he is and that he was being himself they forge a continuing friendship with Kevin and his friend Larry and the movie closes with food themed Christmas Classics showcasing the voice talents of Phil Hartmann and Sinbad This movie is wonderful for both their comic stylings. Phil Hartmann is a great reactor and his delivery is amazing. The garden party scene really does fit in with his style as wellit's a good movie that really makes him shine while also making his co stars shine too. It's more of a farce comedy that I give 6 out of 10 stars a nice family comedy and all around fun. It has its shortcomings but I really don't see them when I look at its message I'd say it's more like a tale of friendship and it's power to change people for the better.And that is my review".

The two mobsters kill him or he can have another day of life and an opportunity to pay 50k he naturally takes the latter and decides to skip town which is when he runs into Gary Young Phil Hartmann who is looking for his uptight conservative Derek Bond Ron Glass who's well known for his role in Barney Miller and he pretends to be the real Derek Bond with hilarious results especially when trying to remember the childhood he had with Gary at Camp Maple Ridge and the lyrics to Goodnight Irene First A presentation in which he BS's his way through with hilarity trying to figure out the details of Derek Bond before a garden party that he livens up after a mishap with an ice cream machine and a wine tasting that would otherwise be uptight and conservative. As he bumbles through the time at the Youngs he realizes that their family though a shining example of the nuclear family with a successful Mom owner of a yogurt franchise and Dad who works for a rival frozen desert company in town but the kids are not exactly the Leave It To Beaver kids.The oldest girl has a thing for dead guys and depressing poetry wearing black all the time and has a boyfriend named Steve but he prefers ST3 he is simply the son of a Congressman who thinks he's a white boy who grew up in the hood around black people those who have are often called white chocolate. The daughter is justtrying to find her voice as well but not in the best of ways Kevin teaches her to embrace life and living things and to not let a guy like ST3 take advantage of her and Kevin teaches ST3 a lesson Don't leave a chicken dinner for a chicken McNugget this other girl he was with at a shop Kevin went to by getting pretty creative. His Son Jason is obsessed with pleasing his dad who wants him to become an all star basketball player Kevin teaches him confidence by teaming up with him to be victorious over a bunch of teenagers who hog the basketball court and wins their clothes. The youngest girl is ignored so he basically watches cartoons with her throughout his time at the Young Family Gary the Father is pitted against his wife by being given a Beaver Meadows account that is going into a frozen yogurt business and he has a conflict of interest. When mentioning this to his boss Mr Pike Pike simply says that he knows that Gary is best for this eventually Kevin steps in saying that he needs to stand up to his boss and can it which he does Gary then resolves to work as in home counsel for his wife.As all this is going on the thugs are homing in on Kevin until their search leads them to the Young Residence with the real Derek Bond who then states that he is the real Derek Bond and that this man is an impostor. Then things make sense for Gary and the family after Kevin is taken away and the family then decides to go after him when the real Derek Bond berates Kevin as a two bit crook. Final chase happens between Kevin and the mobsters and they acquire a scratch off which can be worth a cool million they then part ways with Kevin and let him go.One year later Kevin is rich with that Porsche thanks to a Handbook for Houseguests he published. Now that the Youngs know who he is and that he was being himself they forge a continuing friendship with Kevin and his friend Larry and the movie closes with food themed Christmas Classics showcasing the voice talents of Phil Hartmann and Sinbad This movie is wonderful for both their comic stylings. Phil Hartmann is a great reactor and his delivery is amazing. The garden party scene really does fit in with his style as wellit's a good movie that really makes him shine while also making his co stars shine too. It's more of a farce comedy that I give 6 out of 10 stars a nice family comedy and all around fun. It has its shortcomings but I really don't see them when I look at its message I'd say it's more like a tale of friendship and it's power to change people for the better.And that is my review";

The part when they leave the airport is hilarious and also when Sinbad tells Jason Caress the wheel like a woman. Don't hold it like a pervert! Then Jason says But I don't know how to caress a woman. LOL. That part was hilarious. From beginning to end this movie is definitely an alltime classic. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. Now a days it's overhyped garbage like The Da Vinci Code or these teen slasher psycho movies where everyone just runs around and screams. Another part I really liked was when Sinbad says to the wine critic Sounds like someone needs a woman. That part was hilarious too. Houseguest is a comedic gem that very few comedies can live up to. Definitely worth seeing for anyone who hasn't seen it yet and definitely worth buying to add to your collection!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I am quite a fan of Heinz Erhardt's physical presence and approach to comedy even if his characters are always pretty similar. But sadly he cannot lift a film that is mediocre in every regard to greatness either. This 90 minute movie from over 55 years ago fits that description. It's also blackandwhite which is not a given for 1959 anymore. Basically it is a mix of RomeoJuliet story while the families are neighbors who are just angry at the noise the other party makes. Or it's really just two family members who keep getting annoyed. Erhardt was almost 50 years when this was made. The actor who plays the Perlacher boy is still alive today and also still appears in movies such as the Ostwind sequel that hit theaters these days. I felt that in this movie I could see he enjoyed his role and was fun to watch so no surprise he did not choose an anonymous career path outside the film industry.The humor in this film is mostly based on Erhardt's chaotic character and all the trouble he gets himself in even has to go to jail near the end and his courtroom sequence is almost a standup comedy program especially with the audience's laughter. Other than that they make fun of some German proverbs Hund in der Pfanne and so on. Nothing truly great but watchable. The sister to Erhardt's character was possibly the highlight of this film. You could really feel how she was suffering because of her brother all the time and his escapades. She just wanted harmony but sadly her brother was as much of a 1950s drama queen as it gets. This basedonaplay movie is not the only film by director Hans Deppe with Heinz Erhardt. The two worked together on several occasions. The ending I have to say I wasn't too fond of when he all of a sudden makes up with his ohsohated neighbor and the two who hated each other with passion almost become friends all of a sudden. This was not realistic sadly and basically made everything before that worthless almost the whole arguing etc. At least i did like the final shot the crossword puzzle reference. But all in all i was hoping for more. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warner Bros. OBJECTIVE BURMA 1945 is one of the best war pictures made during the war about the war. Produced for the studio by Jerry Wald its fine screenplay by Ranald Mac Dougall and Lester Cole derived from an original story by Alvah Bessie. With crisp and sharp Monochrome cinematography by the great James Wong Howe it was masterfully directed by Raoul Walsh. It also boasted splendid looking Art direction by Ted Smith with the Burmese jungle mockups filmed at the Lucky Baldwin ranch near Pasadena in California not only looking convincingly authentic but with the added sounds of jungle wildlife making it quite daunting too.The story has Major Nelson Errol Flynn and his large contingent of American Paratroopers being dropped into the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines on a secret mission. They must locate and destroy a Japanese radar station. After a successful sneak attack on the station a good action sequence the men pull back to their designated pickup point and wait. Suddenly things go terribly wrong when Japanese ground troops discover where they are after tracking them. Nelson and his men have no alternative but to scurry into the thick jungle to escape and radio for a new pickup point. But the new rendezvous is 150 miles away. Losing half of the platoon on the journey  because of their forced march through rivers and dense jungle plus tangling with enemy troops  they finally make it to the pickup point and are rescued.Although there are the usual stock characterisations  which seems to be endemic in all war movies  performances are generally good. Flynn in particular is excellent! Eschewing his swashbuckling heroic image he turns in a splendid portrayal of a respected commanding officer who is professional and human. In one disturbing moment he expertly manages to bring a deeply effective sense of grief to the scene where he tearfully tries to comfort his dying friend and fellow officer William Prince. Flynn has rarely been better! OBJECTIVE BURMA was one of the actor's personal favorite pictures and considered it one of his few worthwhile efforts. Good too is Henry Hull as Williams the aging war correspondent who constantly trying to keep the bright side out finally succumbs to the pressure of the arduous trek and passes quietly away in his sleep Gee I'm awfully sorry Mr. Williams observes a compassionate James Brown. And watch out for Mark Stevens as the pilot of the B29 in one of his first film appearances under his real name of Stephen Richards.One of the outstanding aspects of the movie is the marvellous Acadamy Award nominated music by Franz Waxman. The score contains one of the finest march themes ever for a war picture which compliments the early preparation scenes to perfection in its jaunty engaging statement. Then for the Paratroopers jumping from the B29s high pitched strings descend with them as vibrato on the brass simulate the engine noise of the great Bombers. The score is one of the composer's most memorable works and high on the list of Waxman admirers.OBJECTIVE BURMA hasn't dated at all since it was made sixty five years ago. Unlike many movies of its kind and era it stands up very well today despite starting off on the wrong foot. It was banned in England in 1945 because it omitted to mention any British involvement in Burma. But in 1952 and with a new apologetic prologue it was given its long overdue release.Interestingly in 1951 the film's basic premise was reused in Warner's Gary Cooper western Distant Drums.".

A solidly entertaining film that follows the exploits of a small group of American paratroopers dropped behind Japanese lines to destroy an enemy radar installation it was quite gritty for a 1940's era war picture. Lacking the usual bravado of Flynn films it had the look of a documentary. That look was greatly enhanced by the fine black and white photography. While the film was shot in California as I recall it had a very authentic look and feel. Flynn was excellent in perhaps his best nonswashbuckler role.

Men shout and wave at a search plane two or three miles away three times. The men are the usual congeries of ethnicity  Gabby Gordon hollers Mazeltov at the departing Sweeney. Hold on a moment. I'll have to think that one over. I'll also have to figure out how Lt. Sidney Jacobs acquired a Catholic dog tag. Franz Waxman's music is just catchy enough without being in the least distinguished. The jungle looks like a dressedup Santa Anita with eucalyptus trees instead of ebony. The dialogue tends to run along lines like  Here we are in the muck and mire. Hi Muck! Hi Mire! Just at the end when the remaining handful of paratroopers are in despair the cavalry comes riding to the rescue.I guess that gets the timetrapped stuff out of the way. This is far from an insulting cartoon of a movie. At its best it captures the kind of utter physical exhaustion that Norman Mailer caught in his novel The Naked and the Dead. It's essentially a journey movie. Flynn who is not bad and his men are parachuted into Burma to destroy a radar station. Mission accomplished without casualties they find their pickup airfield swarming with enemy soldiers and must slog their way out through swamps and over mountains the trip punctuated by bloody encounters with the Japanese.Not that the battles are literally bloody. I don't think a drop of blood is spilled in the entire movie despite multiple opportunities. Saving Private Ryan is one way to tell a horrifying story  very explicitly  but the suggestion that is used in this film is equally effective as hard as that may be to believe. Maybe the most jarring and moving moment in the film is when Flynn's group finds their friends tortured and killed by the Japanese. Flynn's friend Jacobs is barely alive. We see only his legs as Flynn kneels over him and identifies himself. The viewer can only imagine what Jacob's face  and his eyes  must look like as he whispers Nelson? Is that you Nelson? Will you do me a favor Nelson? Kill me? The movie is a long one but it really needs to be long or we wouldn't so readily feel the agony and the desperation of these dying men. It's long enough for us to get to know the men as more than just anonymous soldiers too.And the dialogue has its redeeming moments. When the middleaged journalist is found dead near his foxhole a supporting player James Brown stands over the body and says sincerely but not overdramatically Gee I'm sorry Mister Williams. Awfully sorry. And when Flynn leads his pitiful group of survivors finally into the base his commanding officer shakes his hand gives him a light and tells him You don't know how important it was for you to take that radar station. Flynn says simply Here's what it cost and hands him a fistful of identity tags.It's an example not of art but of Hollywood craftsmanship. Engaging and nicely done.".

Unlike many of the war films of the same era this one is shot almost exclusively outdoors and a considerable effort was made to make the shoot look and sound like it was actually in a jungle. Considering the film's age the picture quality of the DVD is very good.

	schema:reviewBody "When I read histories of the Pacific War I frequently come across passages telling of a rage held by allied soldiers against the Japanese more intense than that held against the Germans though had they known at the time about Malmedy and the Holocaust it might have been a different story.  There is a scene in Objective Burma which conveys to me more effectively than any other film how that rage was born.This is a Warner Brothers A picture directed by the great Raoul Walsh and it shows.  The acting is superb and the locations are totally convincing.  The framework for these is a conventional story of an allied patrol's sabotage of an enemy radar station deep in the jungle and its harrowing trek back to safety.  What sets Operation Burma apart is its concentration on the humanity of the characters within an action film context without resort to melodrama.  It is a delicate balance that many films fail to maintain and it is perhaps why Errol Flynn is ideal as Captain Nelson leader of the patrol.  Flynn's screen image as a swashbuckler was always tempered by a disarming mildness which not only made the ladies swoon but enabled him convincingly to reveal the human frailty behind the bravura.  And nowhere else does he display this double facet to better effect than in Operation Burma.  It is said that the best commanders are those who only have to ask in order to be obeyed.  Flynn is this kind of commander.  Other fine players should not be neglected.  There is a standout performance by Henry Hull as an elderly journalist whose ambition to cover the war from the ground leads him to the realization that in war it isn't just combat that kills.  I also like Warner Anderson both grim and sympathetic as Flynn's commanding officer.  And the uncredited Erville Anderson's Vinegar Joe Stillwell is so convincing I fancied the general was playing himself!I like to have films representing each of a broad range of interests.  For Errol Flynn I have The Adventures of Robin Hood Operation Burma and That Forsyte Woman.  As well as any others these three films define Errol Flynn's career.  For World War II I have Operation Burma They Were Expendable and Saving Private Ryan.  As well as any others these three films define World War II.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Objective Burma as a Saturday afternoon movie probably on WGN TV in Chicago around 1963 at the tender age of 14. I was expecting the usual Errol Flynn fare which was fine by me but this blew my socks off! It rates right up there with Cagney's unbelievable turn in Yankee Doodle Dandy or Bogart's African Queen  If you never thought Flynn could act this flick will turn your head around.The usual TV Guide description goes something like  American paratroopers are dropped into Burma to destroy a radar station. Yes but that's only the first half hour! The real story begins when they find out they can't be picked up and are going to have to 'walk out' and it ain't no Robin Hood swash buckles his way through the castle sequence!The dialog music photography settings along with major and minor players all work exquisitely to deliver what I humbly consider to be the finest war movie ever made. The depth is incredible Raoul Walsh's touch is perfect Flynn soars beyond what anybody ever thought he could. My God there's even a scene where a tortured comrade begs to be put out of his misery and Flynn pulls it off. This ain't Santa Fe Trail Baby!Yes there is some dialog that today would not be politically correct but come on  We were at WAR and I'm sure the Japanese had some equally colorful words to describe us! Yes there is little mention of the British who were the major heroes of Burma  Well let them go ahead and make their own damn movie and shut the hell up about it! And sorry it's NOT 92 minutes long Walsh takes his time bringing the story along showing the deteriorating situation the heat the worry the exasperation  If you want MTV go somewhere else.So many scenes stand out. Jacobs death signaling to the supply plane with a mirror the rendezvous scene the night battle  Jeez they're all so damn good. But maybe the one that gets to me the most is in the heat of a skirmish when Flynn's men ask him where to go what to do  His face contorts into anguish and he gives the unheard of in Hollywood answer  But I won't spoil it for you go see it for yourself. I moved to LA in 1975 and about 20 years later I happened to be visiting the Los Angeles County Arboretum formerly Lucky Baldwin's Estate in Baldwin Park next to Santa Anita Race Track and got to talking with someone in the office about all the movies television shows and commercials shot there hundreds. I suggested that someone ought to do a book about it. The gal smiled reached into a cabinet and handed me a well worn out of print volume  You mean like this? I eyed the index eagerly and almost couldn't believe my eyes when I found Objective Burma there. Oh my God I'd been coming to the park for over 15 years and never realized that the main Victorian house popularized in the TV series Fantasy Island is the exact same building used in the 'native village scene' where the big fight takes place. Later I walked over to the building climbed onto the porch and chuckled to myself  This is where they set up the machine gun to cover their escape when the Japanese attacked. Over there is where they crossed the 'swamp' and here is where Jacobs died. I actually shivered with the realization that I was standing right on the very spot where a large portion of one of my all time favorite movies was filmed. If you happen to be a fan and are in LA it's only about 7 dollars to get in and be sure to bring some unsalted popcorn to feed the ducks Errol probably did".

It is a very underrated war movie that doesn't get the accolades that a Saving Private Ryan The Longest Day or even the Dirty Dozen. It was a made  up story about a small mission in the Pacific Theater of operation.It portrays the men's bravery sacrifice and and heroism quite well. The acting storyline and action make for a very well done and in some areas ahead of its time movie. I have never really been an Errol Flynn fan but this has to rank as one of his better and yet more subdued performances. Henry Hull also gets high marks for his portrayal as a newspaperman.

	schema:reviewBody "Objective Burma is a gritty WWII drama set in Burma and competently directed by Raoul Walsh. This film as far as I can tell has never gotten the praise it deserves among WWII movies. It contains one of Errol Flynn's best performances and correct me if I'm wrong is the only film of Flynn's in which there are no females.Captain Nelson Flynn heads a group of paratroopers assigned by company commander Colonel Carter Warner Anderson to parachute into the dense Burmese jungle and destroy a Japanese radar station. The idea is for them to go in like Flynn and then be picked up by plane the next day on an abandoned airstrip. Well since the film runs 142 minutes you know that's not going to happen.The 36 officers and men including Lt. Jacobs William Prince SSgt Treacy James Brown Cpl. Gabby Gordon George Tobias Nebraska Richard Erdman Hogan John Alvin Miggleori Anthony Carouso middle aged journalist Mark Williams Henry Hull and others attack the radar station and destroy it in a relatively easy operation where the entire Japanese detachment is wiped out and without casualties to Nelson and his men.As they are about to be picked up by a plane piloted by Lt. Barka Mark Stevens aka Stephen Richards the Japanese prevent the landing and Nelson and his group are then forced to walk out to their camp a distance of some 200 miles. Along the way the group has several encounters with the Japanese and some are killed. Col. Carter has planes out searching for the men but eventually calls off the search.Nelson continues to lead his men to the last rendezvous point given him before his radio was smashed but................................What makes this film so compelling is the inter play between the various characters and Nelson's efforts to keep them all focused on the task at hand while inwardly believing the situation to be hopeless. True the picture is somewhat a flag waver but it nonetheless conveys the horrors of war without the necessity of a love story or two inserted for Flynn. It's in my opinion the best acting job of his storied career.".

	schema:reviewBody "...probably one of the better ones about WWII made during WWII. In it a group of American paratroopers are dropped into the Burmese jungles to destroy a Japanese radar station. Things don't go as expected of course and instead of being picked up by an airplane after their mission is completed they are forced to trek through the jungles and battle the elements to make their escape.Director Raoul Walsh was in good form when he directed this overlong but effective film which adopts a semi documentary approach. James Wong Howe also scored well with his striking photography which really adds to the film's realistic credibility. Howe captures the scorching heat of the jungle in this production whose principle photography was largely done on Lucky Baldwin's Santa Anita ranch. There was also a fine musical score by Franz Waxman including a impressive military march theme.While the characters are the usual army stereotypes the restrained performances of the cast add to the film's sense of realism. This includes Errol Flynn who well portrays an ordinary guy who's in command. His commanding officer is not the belligerent macho type to be found in many military films but instead a humane officer who cares about his men who in turn respect him. Flynn regarded this film as one of the best of his career. Also look out for the terrific performances by several actors that later went on to well known TV roles such as George Tobias who played Mr.Kravitz on Bewitched and Hugh Beaumont who was The Beaver's dad.The film has one dated overthetop diatribe by Henry Hull as a newsman accompanying the soldiers in which he rants about the Japanese as stinking little savages who should be wiped off the face of the earth. Oh well I guess if I'm going to watch the films of 1945 then I should be prepared to deal with the values of 1945.At the same time however the film has some great dialogue. For example after a soldier named Hollis is found dead one of the paratroopers in retrieving the soldier's dog tag says So much for Mrs. Hollis's 9 months of pain and 20 years of hope. In speaking of the pain that a mother will feel when she receives the news about her son the film briefly touches upon a common humanity we all feel with the grief and tragedy of war.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Objective Burma!' is one of the great World War II movies made and released while the conflict was still going on. It is understandably less than politically correct when it comes to the Japanese but neither is it heavyhanded in its approach. It has an almost documentarytype feel to it much of the time showing a group of American soldiers going about a dangerous mission in the jungles of Burma and the film is both exciting and tedious showing the miserable conditions the average fighting man must have endured there and elsewhere. And it's not a flagwaver either. The men gripe about their food talk about women are sometimes brave and sometimes panicky. Watching it one is occasionally reminded of the Bataan death march and how the soldiers there sometimes felt deserted. There are no stirring speeches about the great cause they're fighting for though one can sense just below the surface a determined acceptance of it. The war is a business a dirty business to be concluded as quickly as possible and with as few casualties as possible. On a smaller scale so is this mission. Errol Flynn foregoes his usual flamboyant manner and offers a restrained performance as the captain in charge of the operation. He is likable yet tough and his men are very loyal to him. One gets the impression that while he gives the orders there's nothing he asks of them that he's not willing to do himself. Flynn will never be confused with say Laurence Olivier in terms of acting skills but he acquits himself well here in what may be his finest hour on screen. One scene in particular registers strongly the captain comes across a soldier who has been tortured to the brink of death by the Japanese. We never see the injured man only Flynn looking at him and talking to him. We are left to measure the severity of his suffering from Flynn's pained expression and he is most effective. The platoon's long trek through the steamy insectinfested jungle after missing their first scheduled pickup is shown to be arduous and brutal. The climax of 'Objective Burma!' takes place on a hill at night what's left of the American group try to hold out until they are rescued. The Japanese attack stealthily in the dark attempting to trick individual soldiers into speaking and giving away their positions. It is a brilliant scene as directed by Raoul Walsh no man completely certain if the form next to him is friend or foe. There is a memorable moment when one of the Japanese approaches a trench and whispers Where are you Joe? There is a struggle and silence finally broken by the American who killed him My name ain't Joe. 'Objective Burma!' ranks as a superior war film and is all the more remarkable considering when it was made.".

	schema:headline " Above average and overlong WWII movie about a platoon of valiant soldiers facing Japanese in Burma jungle";
	schema:reviewBody "Thrilling as well as exciting flick  it was partially inspired by Operation Loincloth a 1943 longrange operation in Burma by the British Chindits . However  members of Merrill's Marauders who were on location as technical advisers critiqued the fact that Nelson's men killed all the Japanese at the radar station so quickly with none wounded or escaped . In 1944 a platoon of special ops are tasked to parachute into the distant Burmese jungle and destroy a strategic Japanese radar station but getting out isn't as easy . Capt. Charlie Nelson Errol Flynn is assigned a risked mission  as he leads the group of paratroopers George Tobias  Anthony Carbone  James Brown  William Prince into Burma to blow up an important post in advance of the allied invasion. They're accompanied on the assignment by Mark William Henry Hull  an American reporter who is there to write about their feats . After destroying the remote post  then the command is forced to get away and continue their exploits . The band of American soldiers must face the treacherous jungle and hostile Japanese in order to reach safety and battle against risks .Zestful Warlike action film in which a platoon suffers several dangers to wipe out Japanese station . This exciting Warlike film packs thrills  noisy action  spectacular battles and lots of gutsy adventure . Epic  sprawling  almost primitive action  teaming across the screen . Impressive images when the platoon discovers a massacre and spectacular square off in a breathtaking climax . Interesting script by writer Lester Cole who cowrote the somewhat overly patriotic flagwaving script would be branded an UnAmerican Communist becoming one of the Hollywood Ten just a few years later . However producer Jerry Wald also admitted that much of the screenplay was based on Northwest passage a film about the adventures of a longrange ranger unit during the French  Indian War . Raoul Walsh demonstrates a special talent for making the densest action sequences seem uncomplicated and uncluttered and his characters  like the scenes distinguished  often have an unfettered  raw power . All the weapons uniforms and gear used in this movie are original and accurate  this was possible due to the fact that these were still in use to the US military when this film was made  WW2 movies made in recent times use reproduction weapons and gear . This one results to be a top excitement flick and reworked as Distant drums set in the Florida Everglades  being also filmed by Raoul Walsh . Most of the exteriors of Burma were shot at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. The film has an authentic feel to it thanks to the use of authentic military aircraft and materials . Also the film includes a large amount of authentic footage taken by U.S. Army Signal Corps cameramen in the China Burma India theater.The motion picture lavishly produced by Jack L Warner was compellingly directed by Raoul Walsh . From his starts in the silent cinema he achieved successful films until the 50s and forward  early 60s  when he was less dominant  but is still stayed lots of lusty adventure  stories of comradeship and friendship  and Raoul makes the most of plentiful action scenes . Walsh was an expert director of all kind genres but with penchant in Western as Colorado territory  They died with their boots on Along the great divide Saskatchewan King and four queens  The sheriff of fractured jaw A distant trumpet  Adventure as Thief of Bagdad Captain Horatio Hornblower World in his hands Blackbeard the pirate  Sea devils  Warlike as Objetive Burma  Northern pursuit Marines let's go  and Noir film as White heat High Sierra They drive by night The roaring twenties. Rating  Fairly straightforward movie and better than average . This interesting Wartime film makes it of the finest of Raoul Walsh genre entries .".

	schema:headline " Very good war flick that seems a bit overlong";
	schema:reviewBody "While the film did seem awfully long and this is a very rare thing for me to complain about this was an exceptionally wellmade war movie. Instead of the usual overly glorified war flick that makes war almost look fun or exciting this film is like a real ordeal for the soldiersand in a way for the audience as well. It was very very realistic though according to IMDb the Brits and Aussies were NOT pleased that it made it look the the Americans did all the work as they apparently were the ones who retook Burmaoops.This film was unusual for Errol Flynn because he was normally known much more for period adventure movies or romancenot contemporary war films. However despite his pretty boy image he did a wonderful job in this film as the leader of a parachute assault team caught behind enemy lines. In fact the film was just chock full of excellent character actors who did a great job. I also noticed that the usual Warner Brothers formula for these supporting actors was absent. Instead of the usual kooky or endearing supporting regulars like Frank McHugh or Allan Jenkins the cast is made up more of normal type guys. The only really familiar face among Flynn's troops was George Tobias though he acted more like a normal guy and not his usual persona. This really improved the film and made it seem like a slice of reality instead of a typical back lot production. In fact I don't know where they filmed the movie but it didn't look like the Warner lot with typical fake looking plantsthe palms undergrowth etc. made it look like a tropical jungle. The film was realistic in many other ways. The biggest way were the long dull stretches between action. It was realistic to include them though occasionally it made the film drag a bit.There were a few other poor aspects of the film though they were easily overshadowed by the good. Seeing Tobias yank a pin out of a grenade then throw it was just stupid and a great way to rip out your teeth. I am sure that every military person watching this cringed at this ridiculous scene though dentists might applaud the scene as it will help to create more business! Also occasionally the stock footage they used was of very poor quality so it didn't integrate very seamlessly due to its being grainy a common problem with WWII films. The worst of the spliced footage though was when a C47 transport plane became a C46 and then switched back again! While probably noticeable mostly to neurotic airplane lovers like myself this is just a stupid errorespecially since the planes really don't look all that similar.".

The military goal is quite simple just destroy a small radar installation in the middle of the Burmese jungle.

And while it has some issues more on those in a bit 'Objective Burma!' manages to tell an effective story while avoiding most of the pratfalls you often see in those other efforts.Plot in a nutshell American paratroopers undertake a secret mission behind enemy lines in Burma and while their objective is met with relative ease their escape from Burma is not.Errol Flynn is very good here and it was a welcome departure from his 'Robin Hood' and 'Captain Blood' roles. Although still playing the 'lead' his character Captain Nelson does not engage in the flagwaving bravado so typical of WWIIera films. Also noticeably  and thankfully  absent from this film is any kind of cheesy romantic angle like those found in They Were Expendable and Pride of the Marines among many others. This is a straightup menonamission tale which then morphs into a struggle for survival. In some ways this film reminded me of 1987's Predator with the Japanese enemy taking the place of the pursuing alien.On the negative side it's a bit too long at 140 minutes. Some of the elements feel repetitive  you are stuck in the jungle we get it. There is a bit of we are good Japanese are bad and subhuman thrown in so the film is not totally immune from that familiar wartime trope. And most notably the film focuses solely on American soldiers while in reality the Burma campaign was mostly a U.K.British Commonwealth operation with an assist from the U.S. Watching this you get the impression Burma was another U.S. affair like the Pacific islandhopping campaign and that's the reason Winston Churchill had it pulled from U.K. theaters after one week.710. Aboveaverage WWII flick but loses a few points for lengthrepetition and historical inaccuracy. Would I watch again YN? Yes.".

Anyway his lack of training as a soldier is evident by the end of the film.

He's not funny in a comedy character sense  none of that nonsense in this film  but in his nononsense views about things. It's a long film but it is enjoyable and we get a jungle setting complete with jungle sounds that may or may not be codes being passed on. We also get silences and tense scenes as well as being included in the preparations for the mission which I found interesting eg the parachute lineup with every man given his number and an explanation of how the jump is going to work. If your parachute doesn't open then you'll be the first on the ground Flynn tells the reporter. Ha ha.We get a tense finale as the Japanese encroach upon what is left of Flynn's unit.

The worst was Desperate Journey and one of the best is Objective Burma. It was even recognized by the Academy as such getting Oscar nominations for best original story film editing and best musical scoring.One category it should have gotten recognition is in the matter of sets. During wartime one could not travel to exotic locations to portray a jungle and a swamp. Warner Brothers did a remarkable job in recreating the Burmese jungle.Errol Flynn kept the bravura heroics which he was known for down to a minimum in this film. Here he is just a professional soldier charged with doing a job which is destroy a radio transmitting station deep in the Burmese jungle. Getting out is another problem as Flynn and his command can't meet their drop and have to march out. That original story was written by Alvah Bessie and the screenplay adapted from it was done by Lester Cole two of the Hollywood 10. No doubt the keepers of our patriotism at the House UnAmerican Activities Committee poured over the film and script looking for evidence of any suspicious Communist propaganda. I confess I found none.Henry Hull should also be singled out here as well. In many ways he's playing the character he created in Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat now transplanted to the ChinaBurmaIndia theater of World War II. Like in Lifeboat Hull is the epitome of the civilized man whose whole world is shaken when he confronts the brutality of war be it the evil of Nazi Walter Slezak in Lifeboat or the Japanese atrocities done to our troops in their areas of World War II.Maybe Warner Brothers should have splurged for some color although that was kept to a minimum during the war years to bring out the jungle backgrounds better. It worked well with later films like Never So Few and Merrill's Marauders that dealt with the same war theater.Objective Burma was also castigated in British circles because in point of fact the CBI theater was primarily a British show with Lord Louis Mountbatten as the theater commander and Field Marshal Sir William Slim as the ground commander in Burma. We were there but a distinct minority and strictly in support.Despite their objections from across the pond Objective Burma is one of the best World War II era films that still holds up well for today's audience.".

As a Filipino who lived in the Philippines for 16 years 6 of which was in the province and the rest in the States I really identify with the movie. It shows the beautiful scenery of the country and the rustic huts which are still being used to this day. It displays the villager life quite authentically as I recognized the national costume barong Tagalog and filipiniana a typical nipa hut the way people typically wash their clothes and the huts on stilts.Tyrone Powell stars as the dashing war hero who gets blown off his PT boat and leads his motley crew to Australia. In the process he gets caught up with the Filipino guerilla movement against the Japanese trying to duck the Japanese whenever the village is invaded. It is an interesting portrayal of trying to make do with Asian countryside resources to make a viable radio to contact general MacArthurs troops. He meets the heroine who later becomes widowed and the two fall in love in the midst of the war. The ragtag crew gets caught in a last stand at a sturdy church when General MacArthur arrives in the nick of time making for a feel good movie I found it exciting easy to get into and located in a typical local Filipino flavor even featuring the typical native dance tinikling. I loved this movie it will not disappoint. Maybe they could have portrayed the Japanese high rankers as a little bit more cruel the way my mom used to describe to me and they could have shown some Japanese as young kids who had no choice and were just homesick and were in a war they never wanted to be in. But other than that an excellent war movie. The difference between movies in the 1950's and 2000's clearly show in terms of excellent acting and inspiring cinematography.".

	schema:reviewBody "If anyone thinks they've seen this film before An American Guerrilla in the Philippines bears no small resemblance to the John Wayne film Back to Bataan. But what a difference in terms of production.Back to Bataan was done on the RKO backlot with their official jungle set used for films going back to King Kong and The Most Dangerous Game. An American Guerrilla in the Philippines was shot entirely on location in the Phillipines and the cinematography is beautiful.I'm not sure that Tyrone Power's military service brought him to the Philippines but he did serve in the Marines in the Pacific Theater in several campaigns against many islands. It certainly lent a lot of credibility to his performance.Unlike John Wayne who is ordered into the hills to begin organizing resistance Power is a navy ensign who's just trying to escape the Philippines after Bataan has fallen and to avoid the brutal Japanese prison camps. Along the way Power decides along with Tom Ewell and others in his motley group to join the resistance.And unlike John Wayne Power gets an opportunity for a little romance with a plantation widow Michelline Presle. Power does a good job here. The film is not a dark and moody Fritz Lang type product but Lang does all right with a project that he obviously took for a pay check.

	onyx:emotionText "If anyone thinks they've seen this film before An American Guerrilla in the Philippines bears no small resemblance to the John Wayne film Back to Bataan. But what a difference in terms of production.Back to Bataan was done on the RKO backlot with their official jungle set used for films going back to King Kong and The Most Dangerous Game. An American Guerrilla in the Philippines was shot entirely on location in the Phillipines and the cinematography is beautiful.I'm not sure that Tyrone Power's military service brought him to the Philippines but he did serve in the Marines in the Pacific Theater in several campaigns against many islands. It certainly lent a lot of credibility to his performance.Unlike John Wayne who is ordered into the hills to begin organizing resistance Power is a navy ensign who's just trying to escape the Philippines after Bataan has fallen and to avoid the brutal Japanese prison camps. Along the way Power decides along with Tom Ewell and others in his motley group to join the resistance.And unlike John Wayne Power gets an opportunity for a little romance with a plantation widow Michelline Presle. Power does a good job here. The film is not a dark and moody Fritz Lang type product but Lang does all right with a project that he obviously took for a pay check. I will say this though the ending is a bit too much to swallow as Douglas MacArthur does indeed return and in the nick of time as well.";

That's because it's an excellent movie in just about every way but the earlier John Wayne and Robert Taylor films about the Philippines during WWII were very outstanding films and tend to overshadow this Tyrone Power flick.While the plot is not identical to these other two films there are many similarities. All three document the heroic efforts of the Philippino partisans as well as that of Americans stuck in this land during the war. About the only noticeable difference was that the Power film was in color and I really think for this subject matter black and white actually worked betterlooking more like what you'd expect a WWII film to look like. Plus the other two films are just a little more exciting and involvingbut this isn't to say this Power film is badit just isn't quite as involving.Still among the many many WWII films this one is a bit better than average and well worth a peek. And yes I also noticed the line that said a Navy Ensign is equivalent to an Army Major! I'm surprised that Power with his WWII experience would have said such a stupid line. An ensign is most closely equivalent to an Army Lieutennanta much lower rank.".

There are obvious nonactors in small roles which is a little distracting but I suppose this was done for the sake of realism. Power is rugged and handsome as Parsons and Tom Ewell gives an excellent performance as a wisecracking soldier. Micheline Presle is the de rigeur love interest  it's Tyrone Power who's starring after all and their love scenes are great as are their scenes where she subtly fights her attraction to him. Of course I'd have caved right in.Power did not get to meet the real Chuck Parsons until a few months after filming when Parsons appeared unannounced in Power's dressing room when the actor was performing Mr. Roberts in London. One must assume Parsons was pleased to have been portrayed by a matine idol.Fritz Lang did a wonderful job of directing but of course this film is a far cry from Metropolis. It was a hard shoot for Power as his wife Linda Christian miscarried while visiting him on location. Despite other reviews on this page Amrican Guerrilla is very watchable.

The psychologist was watching a film with the one named Louie. Adlai Stevenson then Governor of Illinois appeared on the screen. That's me cried Louie I'm Adlai Stevenson. The psychologist replied I thought you were Jesus Christ. I am said Louie I'm Jesus Christ too  but I've got to make a living.Fritz Lang must have had some similar motive for making this rather routine war film. It has every clich in the book. The romance thrown into the middle of the muddle. The cavalry riding to the rescue at the last possible moment. The acting of the principals is at par but some of the bits are played by people who seem to have had no training in inducing a suspension of audience disbelief. The best scene in the film has Tom Ewell in an uncommonly dramatic part trying to hide from the Japanese under a rotting log. His bare feet are on an ant hill and soon his skin is crawling with stinging ants while he bites his tongue and prays.The best performance is given by the Japanese officer. He's great. Sinewy dapper ruthless ironic. Speaking to Michelline Presle who has been aiding the guerrillas  You rike Americans with WHITE FACES like boiled pork. Marvelous line. That bleached skin like blue eyes is an evolutionary anomaly confined to northwestern Europe. The guy is fascinating to watch physically in the way that Jack Palance is.Minor error. Ty Power and Tom Ewell are reporting on the position and movements of two Japanese destroyers actually they look like Gearyclass American ships. Power gives the info on the ships to Ewell next to him who relays it by phone to a radio operator who encodes and transmits it. But the operator isn't sending information on the location of the ships. He keeps sending the word news over and over interspersed with a couple of letter bs. It is not as I say a bad movie. It's just done rather by the numbers. A far better job dealing with our defeat in the Phillipines was done by John Ford in They Were Expendable. This film is worth watching as a description of the very real guerrilla movement that developed in the Islands after that initial defeat.".

What's more as more time went by the seemed to get further and further from the realities of the conflict.An American Guerrilla in the Philippines sees Tyrone Power swashbuckling idol of the prewar years as an officer battling Japs in the Philippine jungle. Power has matured as an actor since his pictures a decade earlier appearing tougher and less boyish although he has also become less interesting in the process. His performance is steady and natural but he is unable to make anything of what is admittedly a rather bland character on paper anyway. His buddy Tom Ewell is an unusual addition to the cast. He was in later years a very fine comedy actor but it's hard to tell if he's appearing here as comic relief or not. In some moments such as his burbling in the water trying to stay afloat seem as if he is trying to play them for laughs inappropriately if so and certainly not at all funny. The rest of the cast is simply plain bad or plain boring.Director Fritz Lang is normally someone who can give a nice baroque touch to even the most American of film formats while still remain true to genre and tone. He seems uncertain however quite what to do with this one. He gives many shots in the jungle an abstract feel with no familiar points of reference giving them a threateningly wild look. Often his camera takes a spectator's position peeping out through foliage. It's hard to tell what purpose this serves as it distances us from the events on screen. Incidentally Lang was a very good director of crowds and action as evidenced in his bigbudget silent pictures. There are some very powerful moments with characters moving straight towards us down the middle of the shot and memorably stylised movements. However for a director who is normally so good at imbuing his work with a dark and nightmarish feel An American Guerrilla in the Philippines has none of the bleak terror of say Operation Burma a picture which really worked because it made us the audience feel lost within the jungle ourselves.And ultimately An American Guerrilla in the Philippines is too light and too sparing on any true sense of tragedy. It's lack of a real feeling of danger gives it many dull stretches and its lack of realism does a disservice to those involved in the conflict. All of which is rather odd because the picture is also far from being a comedy. The only thing which saves it and makes it watchable is Fritz Lang's strong vibrant imagery such as dozens of hats waving in the air or a soldier's dying scream just inches from the lens. Having said that there are far better Fritz Lang pictures to see these brilliant touches in.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's because it simply isn't very good not painfully bad exactly just a meanderingly paced time filler is all. Adapted by Lamar Trotti from a novel by Ira Wolfert it stars Tyrone Power Tom Ewell and Micheline Presle. The plot focuses on Chuck Palmer Power  Jim Mitchell Ewell who are stranded in the Philippine Islands waiting for Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return. As the impending surrender to the Japanese is unappealing to the guys they attempt to escape the Islands. Only to be thwarted at every turn. So digging in they set about building a communications station to aid the guerrillas in the war effort. But the Japanese are closing in.First time viewers should not be fooled by some of the advertising catch phrases that proclaim this to be a rousing spectacle or a great Pacific adventure. It's a sedate character driven story that's more concerned with flag waving jingoism than any adherence to action entertainment. Which would be fine if Trotti's script wasn't so unimaginatively bland. It's nicely shot at the actual locations by Harry Jackson and Power is as ever watchable working from actual military experience helps of course. But with Ewell and Presle out of their depth the former out acted by ants in one of the film's rare suspenseful moments and the romantic subplot as tiresome as it pointless this only serves to be a huge disappointment as a picture and a blot on the directors CV. 410".

As the impending surrender to the Japanese is unappealing to the guys they attempt to escape the Islands. Only to be thwarted at every turn. So digging in they set about building a communications station to aid the guerrillas in the war effort. But the Japanese are closing in.First time viewers should not be fooled by some of the advertising catch phrases that proclaim this to be a rousing spectacle or a great Pacific adventure. It's a sedate character driven story that's more concerned with flag waving jingoism than any adherence to action entertainment. Which would be fine if Trotti's script wasn't so unimaginatively bland. It's nicely shot at the actual locations by Harry Jackson and Power is as ever watchable working from actual military experience helps of course. But with Ewell and Presle out of their depth the former out acted by ants in one of the film's rare suspenseful moments and the romantic subplot as tiresome as it pointless this only serves to be a huge disappointment as a picture and a blot on the directors CV. 410";

	schema:reviewBody "As an exmilitary person the discrepancy of rank in this movie is very glaring to me. Chuck Palmer is an Ensign the lowest navy officer rank but wears silver clusters the rank of a Lt. Commander. At one point he is talking to an army Major and mentions that although he is in the navy they are of the same rank the navy equivalent of an army major is a Lieutenant. It's an interesting movie to watch when you're up at 2 am and can't sleep. But overall I think this is a very sanitized version of the guerrilla fight in the Philippines during World War 2. If you've just tuned into the film at some parts you'd think you were watching a documentary. An interesting trivia note Jack Elam is the narrator in this film but he also has a cameo in which he plays a con artist who bilks the locals of money in order to buy guns and ammunition to fight the Japanese.".

The playing is little more than adequate but it's interesting to see Tom Ewell who is high up in the billing here in his second attempt at a Hollywood career the two Willie and Joe films plus Abbott and Costello Lost in Alaska followed after which he dropped out of sight again until his triumphant return a few years later in The Seven Year Itch. Actually Ewell is comparatively subdued as his part here calls for naturalistic comedy rather than exaggerated slapstick  the former certainly tones in better with the overall mood of the film.

I am glad that Lang has the Japanese soldiers speak Japanese instead of fractured English Hollywood's usual device in these circumstances. The film was an unusual assignment for writerproducer Lamar Trotti but he has brought off both the screenplay and its production with his usual capability.

With him are a few American Army soldiers who willingly accompany him on a small boat headed for Australia. Unfortunately they encounter a typhoon and become stranded once again on the Filipino island of Leyte. It's at this time that they are encouraged to make a daring trek to another island in the Philippines to make contact with an American unit conducting guerrilla activities against the Japanese forces which are increasing at an alarming rate. However rather than being given passage on a submarine back to Australia Ensign Palmer is given the dangerous mission of setting up radio stations at certain key points to keep General MacArthur informed of enemy movements. And this is something that he has to do even though he knows nothing about radio communications and has very few supplies with which to carry out his assignment. Along with that he also has to contend with superior Japanese forces all around him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that had this movie been filmed during World War II I might have cut it a little slack as these type of gradeB patriotic films were the product of the times. But because this was clearly not the case I feel compelled to be slightly more critical. As a result I have to say that this was a movie which was long on patriotism but sometimes a bit short on entertainment. There just wasn't much here to get excited about. Now don't get wrongit wasn't necessarily a bad movie at all. But if the viewer is expecting something other than a runofthemill war movie then they are likely to be somewhat disappointed. In any case I rate this movie as about averageand that's giving it the benefit of the doubt even then.".

Though not amongst the directors finest works it was certainly worth a watch with Tyrone Power leading a group of Navy enlisted men on a circuitous journey across the islands at first in the hopes of making their way to safe Australia but eventually settling for becoming part of an American guerrilla warfare effort. The film is notable for not presenting the Japanese in as brutal a light as was common at the time  though they certainly are the enemy in every way and the film definitely has a rahrah go America feeling to it at times particularly the ending. The use of color is outstanding as I've found it always to be with this director despite his favoring black and white and the performances are all quite solid. The problems lie mostly in the central third of the film as the guerrilla mission gets going there's a little too much repetition here and the romance between Power's ensign Palmer and Micheline Presle's Jeanne Martinez doesn't really seem necessary nor is it well thought out overall the film feels a little too long and verges on tedious. But the final shootout is pretty well done and I certainly wasn't bored even if this is a far from typical Lang effort that does not show him at his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mad Executioners actually has two seemingly unrelated plot lines. The first involves a powerful but secret society operating outside official channels that has set up its own court of sorts. They hold trials render verdicts and carry out sentencing. Their cases seem to focus on criminals who have slipped through the loopholes of the regular system. But even though these criminals are quite guilty Scotland Yard tends to frown on hanging people. The second plot line involves a serial killer who dumps headless corpses around London. A desperate detective decides to use his girlfriend as bait. But can he get to her before she becomes the next victim? Based on my limited experiences with these Germanmade thrillers I would say The Mad Executioners is about average. When the film focuses on the secret trials and hangings it's very good and quite interesting. The opening trial scene for example is very creepy with the unknown hooded judges and the foggy Thames hanging sight. But when the movie focuses on the serial killer it doesn't work. The secret lab for example seems silly when compared with the serious tone of the rest of the movie. Not that cutting off someone's head isn't serious but the serial killer's methods are overly elaborate. Until they converge in the end these two disparate plot lines feel as if they're from different movies.Another big plus for me is the soundtrack. The Mad Executioners has that jazzy smokey score that I've come to expect and enjoy in these krimis. The music sets just the right tone.While I've yet to find a German Edgar Wallace movie that knocks me off my feet I think I'll keep looking. So far I've found these movies enjoyable enough in their own unique way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Henker von London or The Mad Executioners is a west German movie from 1963 and as this one is already over 50 years old it is still a blackandwhite film. The director is Edwin Zbonek who is not too wellknown anymore today but some people may still have heard of Robert A. Stemmle who adapted the novel by Bryan Edgar Wallace. And the latter is the son of Edgar Wallace who followed in his father's footsteps and is responsible for this mix of crime drama and horror. The lead actor is Hansjrg Felmy and he is also still somewhat known today and movie buffs from Germany may be familiar with his name and also with Dieter Borsche and Werner Preiss. Sadly this decent cast did not result in a quality movie in my opinion. The premise isn't bad about a group of vigilantes who killed alleged criminals but the longer this 90minute film runs the more is loses focus I felt. At the end I did not really care for anybody anymore let alone the action and plot. This one does not stand out compared to other Wallace films and there are quite a few but then again i have never been a fan of these anyway. I f you like the Rialto films more than I do then maybe you will even like this one. I give it a thumbsdown though. Not recommended.".

I'm not sure how much of the story is there or how much has been changed but whats on the screen is a really diversion.

The solution is probably not something you're going to work out completely then again you really won't care since the film moves along at such a good clip it just carries you along.If there is any flaw in the film its that the two halves of the story never really seem to belong together. Its not giving anything away to say that the plot threads to cross but its a bit too neat and makes it feel almost contrived.Highly recommended for those dark and stormy nights or afternoons when you want to slip away into the foggy streets of London.".

Here was a villain able to charm coddle or kill his own brothers with equal skill. Rathbone makes him quite believable. Oddly while carrying Richard's humpback Rathbone ignores the King's withered left arm.Although this is not a horror film Boris Karloff's Mord the Executioner is a very horrific character. Bald headed  clubfooted he stalks about the Tower carrying out Richard's foul orders. Karloff makes an indelible mark in his very first scene inflicting more torments on the denizens of the torture chamber. With such a striking performance as well as his status as one of Universal's most celebrated actors it is strange that Karloff doesn't receive equal billing with Rathbone here.Vincent Price does very well in the role of the nervous jealous doomed Duke of Clarence holding up nicely to the overthetop performances of Rathbone  Karloff. It is fascinating to see this early teaming of the three frightmeisters the next time they would all appear in the same film would be in 1963's THE COMEDY OF TERRORS.Special mention should be made of Ian Hunter as Edward IV. While acquiescing to all of Rathbone's bloody schemes Hunter nonetheless injects an element of sardonic humor into the role making it very entertaining.Barbara O'Neil as stately Queen Elizabeth Nan Grey as spunky Lady Alice  Rose Hobart as lovely Anne Neville each do good work in roles which demand little from any of the actresses.The supporting cast is sprinkled with familiar faces  Leo G. Carroll Miles Mander Lionel Belmore Ernest Cossart  each excellent in small roles. Far down the cast list is Ralph Forbes as Henry Tudor. This splendid actor was on the very cusp of becoming a major star at the end of the silent era although gifted with a fine speaking voice he was never able to achieve his full potential in talking films.Movie mavens will recognize uncredited appearances by both Robert Greig as a friendly priest  Nigel de Brulier as the archbishop who marries little Edward V.Universal gives the film a fine gloss with good atmospherics. The exterior London scenes look impressive on the screen.The film presupposes a certain amount of intelligent knowledge to already be in the hands of the audience. Indeed a working acquaintance with the facts surrounding the Wars of the Roses  the English Line of Succession could only be of help to the viewer in unraveling the intricate plot.TOWER OF London should be enjoyed as entertainment not accepted as historical fact. Modern research is slowly overturning many of the old beliefs concerning Richard of Gloucester. As a result he is emerging as a far less bloody individual and one who may have been pilloried for centuries by an unfriendly press. Shakespeare it should be remembered was writing for the Tudors  who may have had their own dark ancestral deeds to hide. Indeed there is much creditable speculation that it was actually Henry Tudor who had the young Tower Princes murdered.".

	schema:headline " Nothing Like Olivier's film but a good workmanlike horror flick";
	schema:reviewBody "There are several reasons to recall Tower Of London. It gave Basil Rathbone one of his few chances to portray a character that could be compared to Lawrence Olivier's portrayal in another film of the same character. It had a performance by John Rodion Rathbone's illegitimate son who tried to follow his father's footsteps into movies but was ultimately unable to do so. It was one of the few films that Rathbone did with Boris Karloff others being Son Of Frankenstein and The Comedy Of Terrors. It was I believe the first film that Rathbone did with Vincent Price oddly enough some twenty three years later Price appeared as Richard III in a remake of this film. There is a story that Rathbone tells in his memoirs In And Out Of Character of a practical joke played by himself and Karloff on Price. Price here was playing false perjured Clarence that is George Duke of Clarence the middle brother between Edward IV and Richard III. The Duke of Clarence was in the Tower of London charged with treason when he died suddenly  reputedly he was purposely drowned in a butt of Malmesey Wine a barrel of wine. Clarence historically was a very untrustworthy figure who kept switching sides to better himself at everyone else's expense. In reality he was probably executed for treason. But rumor about the odd death in the barrel of wine spread and eventually his death was thought to be due to the evil plotting of his brother Richard. When the film was shot Rowland V. Lee the director decided that wine could not be used for the barrel's liquid  it would be wasted and was too expensive. He used Coca Cola which is dark looking like a dessert wine. Price had to be tipped upside down into the barrel full of this Coke and hold his breath for about a minute and then be pulled out. He was shot a few times to be sure they got the best take for the film. Then he was taken out of the barrel and was resting when Rathbone and Karloff came over  they gave Price a bottle of Coke to drink and relax with!The film has some novel touches in it none of which are remotely true. Miles Mander's King Henry VI is killed by order of Richard while he is praying. Henry VI did die violently in the Tower of London in 1471 shortly after the failure of the attempt by Warwick the Kingmaker to restore him and the Lancastrians to the throne at the battle of Tewksberry. More likely though he was dispatched by order of King Edward IV. There was no box of wax dolls that Richard kept to remove the dolls representing the rivals he had knocked off. Mord is apparently a figment of the movie writer's imagination  no British monarch ever boasted of using a hangman to climb the genealogical tree to become king. Finally I don't think that Richard's older brother Edward IV Ian Hunter was such a ninny as to wink at Richard's acts of villainy as matters to laugh about while such a character came closer and closer to threatening the succession of Edward's own sons.For all the errors it is stylistically a good film with Rathbone at his wormiest as the ultimate bad uncle and usurper. Karloff's Mord is one of the few villain's he played with absolutely no good points to his character.It's not Richard III wherein Olivier with Shakespeare looks at the soul of a demonic villain. But as a good programmer it was worth watching.About eleven days ago was August 22 2006 the anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth Field the battle where Richard and his cause fell in 1485 destroyed by Henry Tudor. As it does every year the Richard III Society put a notice in the death columns of the New York Times regarding the sad fate of the monarch and concerning loyalty Richard's death in battle is tied to the opportunistic switch in loyalties of the Earl of Stanley and his men in the battle. I still hope that one day some serious film director will try to produce a film version of Richard's career and story that shows that the evidence that he killed his nephews and most of those other victims is not proved and probably was not done by him.

	onyx:emotionText "There are several reasons to recall Tower Of London. It gave Basil Rathbone one of his few chances to portray a character that could be compared to Lawrence Olivier's portrayal in another film of the same character. It had a performance by John Rodion Rathbone's illegitimate son who tried to follow his father's footsteps into movies but was ultimately unable to do so. It was one of the few films that Rathbone did with Boris Karloff others being Son Of Frankenstein and The Comedy Of Terrors. It was I believe the first film that Rathbone did with Vincent Price oddly enough some twenty three years later Price appeared as Richard III in a remake of this film. There is a story that Rathbone tells in his memoirs In And Out Of Character of a practical joke played by himself and Karloff on Price. Price here was playing false perjured Clarence that is George Duke of Clarence the middle brother between Edward IV and Richard III. The Duke of Clarence was in the Tower of London charged with treason when he died suddenly  reputedly he was purposely drowned in a butt of Malmesey Wine a barrel of wine. Clarence historically was a very untrustworthy figure who kept switching sides to better himself at everyone else's expense. In reality he was probably executed for treason. But rumor about the odd death in the barrel of wine spread and eventually his death was thought to be due to the evil plotting of his brother Richard. When the film was shot Rowland V. Lee the director decided that wine could not be used for the barrel's liquid  it would be wasted and was too expensive. He used Coca Cola which is dark looking like a dessert wine. Price had to be tipped upside down into the barrel full of this Coke and hold his breath for about a minute and then be pulled out. He was shot a few times to be sure they got the best take for the film. Then he was taken out of the barrel and was resting when Rathbone and Karloff came over  they gave Price a bottle of Coke to drink and relax with!The film has some novel touches in it none of which are remotely true. Miles Mander's King Henry VI is killed by order of Richard while he is praying. Henry VI did die violently in the Tower of London in 1471 shortly after the failure of the attempt by Warwick the Kingmaker to restore him and the Lancastrians to the throne at the battle of Tewksberry. More likely though he was dispatched by order of King Edward IV. There was no box of wax dolls that Richard kept to remove the dolls representing the rivals he had knocked off. Mord is apparently a figment of the movie writer's imagination  no British monarch ever boasted of using a hangman to climb the genealogical tree to become king. Finally I don't think that Richard's older brother Edward IV Ian Hunter was such a ninny as to wink at Richard's acts of villainy as matters to laugh about while such a character came closer and closer to threatening the succession of Edward's own sons.For all the errors it is stylistically a good film with Rathbone at his wormiest as the ultimate bad uncle and usurper. Karloff's Mord is one of the few villain's he played with absolutely no good points to his character.It's not Richard III wherein Olivier with Shakespeare looks at the soul of a demonic villain. But as a good programmer it was worth watching.About eleven days ago was August 22 2006 the anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth Field the battle where Richard and his cause fell in 1485 destroyed by Henry Tudor. As it does every year the Richard III Society put a notice in the death columns of the New York Times regarding the sad fate of the monarch and concerning loyalty Richard's death in battle is tied to the opportunistic switch in loyalties of the Earl of Stanley and his men in the battle. I still hope that one day some serious film director will try to produce a film version of Richard's career and story that shows that the evidence that he killed his nephews and most of those other victims is not proved and probably was not done by him.

	schema:reviewBody "Not really a horror film but a uniquely sinister and highly compelling history lesson this late 1930's Universal production brings together a marvelous cast and tells a rather loose interpretation of William Shakespeare's famous play Richard III. It's once again Boris Karloff's charismatic face that parades the DVDcover but the true personification of greed and wickedness here comes from the fantastic Basil Rathbone who plays Richard the Duke of Gloucester and brother to Edward King of England. Richard already heavily influences all the king's decisions but he wants to reign by himself and thinks of fiendish plans to eliminate all those preceding him in line of the throne. He even owns a miniature theater where his progress to owning the royal crown is illustrated by dolls! Richard most loyal partner in crime is the barbaric and uncanny looking executioner Mord performed by Boris Karloff. And yet another icon of horror cinema can be found in the cast list moreover in the earliest phase of his rich career namely Vincent Price. He splendidly gives image to the Duke of Clarence and appears in the film's absolute best sequence where he and Richard hold an unfair drinking contest. The story is sometimes confusing and not entirely without flaws but the wholesome is very atmospheric and suspenseful. Near the beginning there's a morbid execution sequence and later in the film there are two spectacular and typically medieval battle scenes. The costumes and settings were convincing enough for me and every line that comes out of Rathbone's mouth is a fascinating experience. Roger Corman retold this story in 1962 again starring Vincent Price although that version put the emphasis more on explicit torture and supernatural elements. Very much recommended.".

The censors of the time forbade any explicit sex or violence and what you saw was always highly stylized.

So what have we here in this fine old film. The classic tale of Richard Crookback. We have the great Basil Rathbone as the Black Duke and Boris Karloff as his fictional sidekick Mord. Yes Karloff is nearly a stereotype for the evil henchmen who's willing to carry out the furious demands of his heartless master. But there's a young Vinnie Price as the Duke of Clarence awaiting a drowning in a vat of Mumsey wine. The action line of this classic story moves quickly the lines are spoken clearly and the the acting is superb. What else do you want from a 1939 horror drama?".

	schema:reviewBody "All in all this oddball 90minutes could be called a noir costume drama. The lighting is either dull gray shadowy bw or plain foggy all the way through. Of course this befits a very dour tale based it seems on some historical fact. As the scheming Richard of Gloucester the sharpfeatured Rathbone is perfect. And by golly nothing's going to stand in the way of his becoming a 15th century King of England even if he has to step on half his family to get there. Of course he's got reliable old clubfoot Mord Karloff to do the dirty work. And do it he does.It's impressive how well Rathbone transitions here from the unscrupulous plotter to his later intellectual gumshoe Sherlock Holmes. There's been no one quite so compelling before or since. Then too as Mord the great Karloff makes better use of his massive frame than usual. With his bald head though the skull cap seams sometimes show he's an incomparable presence. Still there's that fleeting moment where the murderous Mord contemplates the sleeping bodies of the two doomed princes and the cruelty of his work. It passes quickly but amounts to a telling touch. Then there's that memorable scene where the Duke of Clarence Price and Richard compete for most quaffed wine in royal history that is before Clarence gets to bathe in the vat permanently. Though I've never again heard of Malmsey kind of wine that scene's stayed with me for years.In my little book director Lee is underrated for his work here and in other costume epics he seems to have specialized in e.g. Captain Kidd 1945. Nonetheless the movie is flawed in certain respects as other reviewers point out. There's a heckuva lot of characters that come and go so you may need the proverbial scorecard. Plus the royalty gets their finery to wear but the barebones interiors look like the budget didn't cover set decoration. And I'm still wondering how combatants could tell friend from foe in those fog shrouded battle scenes that come across like cloudy nightmares.Anyhow I know nothing about the historical accuracy of what's on screen. Nonetheless the oddball results have stayed with me for near 6decades. Thanks Rathbone and Karloff and especially a longgone TV Late Show.".

	schema:reviewBody "Upon first viewing I didn't warm up to Tower of London much. The story of 15th century political intrigue wasn't exactly what I was looking for when popping in a quoteunquote Universal Horror movie. This is after all the same historical material that inspired Shakespeare's Richard III and modern soap opera The Tudors. Rewatching this movie tonight I discovered surprise surprise it is a horror movie at least parts of it anyway.Granted a large portion of the film revolves around royal politics. There's lots of talks of familial relations of marrying the right people of who's next in line to the throne. As generally accepted by fiction but not necessarily history Richard III murdered his way up the royal line all the way to the king's throne. In tradition with Shakespeare Basil Rathbone's portray of Richard includes a hunchback. After the exile of Henry Tudor and the death of his mingling brother Edward the film shows Richard's inclinations for murderous conspiracies kick in.And that's were the film's horror elements come from. The film invents the character of Mord a royal executioner with a clubfoot childhood friend of Richard played by Karloff. Mord is one of Karloff's most sadistically evil characters. Karloff's head is shaved and his all ready imposing frame is further padded out making him look especially intimidating. This is a man who gleefully grinds an axe before the gallows has no qualms about stabbing an old man while he prays. Interestingly enough Mord is also responsible for spreading rumors gossip that slowly erodes at the public's trust of Prince Edward V and his brother. Richard's manipulation of the boys takes up a large portion of the film's middle section. The moment Rathbone first considers murdering the children even causes Karloff's totally immoral character to pause for a second. The scene where the boy princes are killed has got to be one of the darkest moments in PostCode thirties cinema.This is largely an actor's film. Rathbone gives an interesting performance. Richard III is never more then a calculating villain. Even his generous public area or the scenes with the woman he plans on marrying are never more then mechanical moves towards power. It's still a very good performance strictly because Rathbone imbues every line and turn with a sinister attitude. Among the supporting cast is a very young Vincent Price as Duke George played here as a foppish alcoholic. The best scene in the movie is the drinkoff like a duel but with booze between Rathbone and Price. Another example of two great actors playing it over the top against one another. There's some dark comedy sprinkled throughout too most of it coming from Mord's causal brutality such as opening a iron maiden and letting a body fall out as calmly as you and I take the garbage out.The horror content peaks during the scene where a prisoner of the Tower is tortured for information. Whipping hot irons the rack all of it displayed in as much graphic detail as 1939 would allow. Which might be more then you'd think. Could the roots of postmillennial torture horror be in this little seen period drama? Probably not but it's fun to think so. The story climaxes with a huge battle scene which is fine but marks the end of the horror elements. Rathbone is given a surprisingly lackluster death scene but Karloff's dramatic dive off a cliff makes up for it. After 90 minutes of brutality and darkness the overly upbeating ending is a real tone breaker. Tower of London honestly isn't pure horror but every time I see the film I'm surprise at how closely it skirts up against the genre.".

	schema:headline " An entertaining somewhat lighter alternative to Shakespeare";
	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to many an assumption Tower of London is actually not a horror film despite the dark and miserable English castle setting the sight of Boris Karloff as clubfooted executioner Mord and the presence of Rowland V. Lee  a director perhaps best known for Son of Frankenstein also released in 1939  behind the camera. There's also the existence of Roger Corman's lowbudget effort of the same name which emphasised the horror and pushed genre legend Vincent Price who also appears here in a smaller role into the central role as the deformed scheming Richard III. In fact Lee's Tower of London is a historical drama borrowing much from Shakespeare's Richard III but somewhat confusingly leaving out much of the detail.Edward IV Ian Hunter sits comfortably on the throne of England after defeating King Henry VI Miles Mander and imprisoning him in the Tower of London. The feebleminded former king wears a paper crown and lives in the hope that his son will return from exile in France to reclaim his crown. Edward enjoys combat practice with his formidable and cunning brother Richard Duke of Gloucester Basil Rathbone while their soft drunken younger brother the Duke of Clarence Price watches on enviously. Richard is an incredibly capable leader of men but is way behind in the line of succession. He keeps a mini theatre hidden away where he plans to remove everybody in his way and despite the many rivals who could challenge him for the crown the hunchbacked prince will stop at nothing until he is seated on the throne.Although not a horror Tower of London certainly looks like one. The huge set created for the film became a staple of Universal and the dark chilling castle could be seen in many genre pieces produced by the studio in the following years. There's also a few brutal but bloodless murders almost always involving Karloff's Mord who is the closest thing the film has to a monster. Yet for the most part this is more akin to Shakespeare performed by a ridiculous wealth of acting talent. There are great turns by Hunter Mander Price in only his fourth role and Barbara O'Neil as Queen Elyzabeth but the film belongs to Rathbone and Karloff with the former even eclipsing Laurence Olivier's arguably hammy thesping in the 1955 film. Packing what is an incredibly complex tale into 90 minutes can confuse matters but this is an entertaining somewhat lighter alternative to Shakespeare's infinitely more grandiose work.".

Lee  a director perhaps best known for Son of Frankenstein also released in 1939  behind the camera. There's also the existence of Roger Corman's lowbudget effort of the same name which emphasised the horror and pushed genre legend Vincent Price who also appears here in a smaller role into the central role as the deformed scheming Richard III. In fact Lee's Tower of London is a historical drama borrowing much from Shakespeare's Richard III but somewhat confusingly leaving out much of the detail.Edward IV Ian Hunter sits comfortably on the throne of England after defeating King Henry VI Miles Mander and imprisoning him in the Tower of London. The feebleminded former king wears a paper crown and lives in the hope that his son will return from exile in France to reclaim his crown. Edward enjoys combat practice with his formidable and cunning brother Richard Duke of Gloucester Basil Rathbone while their soft drunken younger brother the Duke of Clarence Price watches on enviously. Richard is an incredibly capable leader of men but is way behind in the line of succession. He keeps a mini theatre hidden away where he plans to remove everybody in his way and despite the many rivals who could challenge him for the crown the hunchbacked prince will stop at nothing until he is seated on the throne.Although not a horror Tower of London certainly looks like one. The huge set created for the film became a staple of Universal and the dark chilling castle could be seen in many genre pieces produced by the studio in the following years. There's also a few brutal but bloodless murders almost always involving Karloff's Mord who is the closest thing the film has to a monster. Yet for the most part this is more akin to Shakespeare performed by a ridiculous wealth of acting talent. There are great turns by Hunter Mander Price in only his fourth role and Barbara O'Neil as Queen Elyzabeth but the film belongs to Rathbone and Karloff with the former even eclipsing Laurence Olivier's arguably hammy thesping in the 1955 film. Packing what is an incredibly complex tale into 90 minutes can confuse matters but this is an entertaining somewhat lighter alternative to Shakespeare's infinitely more grandiose work.";

	schema:reviewBody "This slowmoving piece benefits from a very effective performances by star Basil Rathbone as a corrupt duke whose ambitious nature leads him to gradually destroy all those who stand between him and the crown. Rathbone exudes cunning evil in this enduring film and his scheming and wicked ways are the chief reason to watch. Not many other actors could have done this better. Although Rathbone is best known for his role in over a dozen Sherlock Holmes films in the 1940s this remains one of his best performances ever.Some people have complained that this melodrama is too slow not in my opinion. I think a lot of people are simply disappointed that this isn't exactly a horror film after it was recently rereleased in misleading packaging. Sure it's not horror but there are plenty of frightening moments plus the usual torture beheadings sword fights you name it... and Boris Karloff stumps around in makeup which wouldn't look out of place in any spooker you care to mention. Karloff here adopts the role of a faithful manservant to Rathbone a bald executioner with a club foot who carries out his master's bidding unnervingly. Karloff isn't given much opportunity to act here apart from in a scene with a young child and mainly trades in on his terrible Frankenstein image. But then there's no harm in that.The time period of the film is very good as we gradually watch Rathbone rise through the various ranks in the royal court. Absolutely nobody stands in his way in the film until the final moments where a heroic opponent escapes and paves the way for a fullscale battle. The acting is uniformly good as is the score and it's nice to see a young Vincent Price in an amusing role as a drunkard who meets his end in a vat of red wine. Price sports a terrible British accent here and plays a very effeminate character but his portrayal of drunkenness is accurate and you can see the seeds which eventually led to him becoming a famed actor some two decades later in the likes of THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.As for the horror content there are a few choice moments in a torture chamber to delight the genre fan. Karloff is a master of pain casually tossing water over a floor for a prisoner to lick up and dropping a weight on a man's chest in passing. I was surprised how graphic some of these tortures were and one man has to survive whipping branding and even being stretched on the rack at the end of the film. Some battering! If you want to see a Shakespeare play given a topnotch treatment by some forgotten stars then TOWER OF London is the film for you.".

It's a loose retelling of the legend of Richard III with Rathbone in the title role and Rathbone might be delivering his finest performance. He totally gets the two faced nature of the character. You have to like something about Richard in some regard otherwise the story just stretches plausibility too much. Rathbone might actually have it harder in that this is not Shakespeare and there is no direct address to the audience. The film benefits as well from having Ian Hunter being a very strong Edward IV.

He plays Mord Richard's personal executioner who does the dirty deed of killing the princes in the tower. It's a role that could have stood to be expanded. Mord too is disfigured with a club foot and that seems to be why he idolizes Richard and is willing to murder all his enemies. I think it would have been interesting to see Karloff's character become disillusioned in his hero at some point. The most disappointing Karloff pictures are the ones where Karloff is there merely to look sinister and 'Tower of London' follows that formula unfortunately. That being said Mord has one outstanding moment. He doesn't receive much dialogue but there his introduction is brilliant. Your highness you're more than a duke more than a king. You're a god to me!It isn't really a horror picture but it's a pretty good historical epic and easily one of Universal's biggest films of the period. These sets were recycled in a lot of later films.

	schema:reviewBody "1939's Tower of London was a Universal 'A' budget picture director Rowland V. Lee's followup to Son of Frankenstein as conceived by his brother Robert N. Lee who also scripted Rowland's final feature in 1945 Captain Kidd. Together they chose a reallife horror story set in 14th century Britain the throne usurped by three brothers immortalized by Shakespeare's Richard III. Wearing the crown is King Edward IV Ian Hunter his closest adviser brother Richard Duke of Gloucester Basil Rathbone while half brother George Duke of Clarence Vincent Price is regarded as a self serving weakling. Few are aware of Richard's own aspirations toward the throne though Edward's wife Queen Elyzabeth Barbara O'Neil correctly suspects that Gloucester is not the loving uncle her sons believe him to be. Boris Karloff's Mord is the chief executioner ruling over the Tower of London where all of Richard's enemies eventually end up. The first victim opening the film is played by John Rodion Basil Rathbone's son from his first marriage whose only other credit was also with his father 1938's The Dawn Patrol. The wine jousting death of Clarence is memorable borrowed by Price himself in 1973's Theater of Blood but by far the most shocking are the cold blooded murders of Edward's two sons the boy King having taken his father's place upon the throne only for Richard to order their deaths in striking back at the defiant Queen Mother. Karloff preferred the term 'terror' over the word 'horror' in describing his films but surely would have had no problem describing this movie as a genuine 'horror film.' Basil Rathbone enjoys one of his greatest screen roles handsome and resplendent his humpback barely noticeable. Having debuted in Universal's 'Service De Luxe' Vincent Price in only his third feature would finish his brief sojourn at the studio following Green Hell The Invisible Man Returns and The House of the Seven Gables moving on to 20th CenturyFox for Hudson's Bay. Splendidly hamming it up in this first brush with the genre he became indelibly linked Price actually graduated to starring as Richard himself in Roger Corman's impoverished 1962 remake also titled Tower of London.

Even though the film is sometimes labeled a Horror film it isn't really. Personally I saw Roger Corman's 1962 remake in which Vincent Price plays the leading role several years before first watching this one. I'd probably say I still prefer Corman's version due to the creepy atmosphere the stronger focus on the 'Horror' elements and Richard's growing madness and mainly due to Vincent Price's indescribable onscreen persona. It cannot really be said which is the 'better' film however. Though telling the story of the same King the two versions do differ immensely in most aspects. They begin at a different stage in Richard's aspiration for power and while Richard is depicted as an absolute madman by Vincent Price in Corman's 1962 film the Richard played by Basil Rathbone in this film is merely a calculating unscrupulous and extremely coldblooded aspirator for kingship.Lee's The Tower of London begins within the reign of King Edward IV Ian Hunter the older brother of Richard Duke of Gloucester Basil Rathbone. The unscrupulous hunchbacked Richard longs to be King and is willing to commit any murderous deed necessary to achieve his goal. He is assisted in his plans by his most loyal servant the clubfooted executioner and torturer Mord Boris Karloff... Tower of London is definitely a dark gloomy film and furthermore very explicitly violent for its time. Unlike Roger Corman's 1962 version it is not a Horror film however but a Historical Drama. The great Basil Rathbone is ingeniously sinister in his role and Horrordeity Boris Karloff is incredible as the ghoulish executioner. Vincent Price's role of the Duke of Clarence is regrettably small but he is brilliant in it as always. A 28yearold Price who was not yet the Horroricon he would become gives a great foretaste of the brilliance to come. Most though not all of the supporting performances are good. The 'good guys' such as the hero played by John Sutton are not too memorable but at least in my humble opinion great villains are of far greater value for this kind of story anyway. Though it treats the eponymous King Tower of London is not based on Willaim Shakespeare's play Richard III. The film is greatly shot the choreography is very good and the historical settings are incredible. Overall Tower of London is an excellent film that shouldn't be missed by fans of classic cinema. Highly recommended!".

Nevertheless even with a bald axwielding Boris Karloff in tow this is a tedious affair and I suppose it always was even in the early 70s when I had seen and liked it in the wee hours on my local TV station's Late Night Movie.  It impressed me for some reason back then but I don't know why.  I still don't.  It's certainly a big letdown from Son of Frankenstein which the same director Rowland V.

Nevertheless even with a bald axwielding Boris Karloff in tow this is a tedious affair and I suppose it always was even in the early 70s when I had seen and liked it in the wee hours on my local TV station's Late Night Movie.  It impressed me for some reason back then but I don't know why.  I still don't.  It's certainly a big letdown from Son of Frankenstein which the same director Rowland V. Lee made earlier in the year for the same studio with the same two stars Rathbone and Karloff.";

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite Errol Flynn movie has always been The Sea Hawk. Flynn made this in 1940 at the height of his career. All it is missing is Flynn's usual screen partner in that period Olivia DeHavilland.Errol Flynn plays the fictional privateer Geoffrey Thorpe who with the well known real characters like Drake Frobisher and Hawkins raid the rich Spanish commerce from the New World which is what Europeans of the day were referring to the western hemisphere as. Queen Elizabeth of England gave all knowing wink to their activities and the realm took a cut of their loot.One day Flynn attacks the ship carrying the Spanish ambassador Claude Rains and his niece Brenda Marshall who's English on her mother's side. That's it for Flynn.But Queen Elizabeth has some traitors in her midst. The clever Lord Wolfingham played by Henry Daniell is in the Spanish pay. Daniell was one of the best screen villains ever. He was always a cold and calculating individual and had a voice with a built in sneer. He very cleverly deduces Flynn's future plans and lays a trap for him. See the film and find out but suffice it to say Daniell is no fool.Jack Warner saw that Flynn's films were always well scored musically. Flynn swashbuckled to some of the best film music ever composed. Here the composer is Erich Wolfgang Korngold in other films with Warner Brothers it's Max Steiner. Korngold's score isn't quite on par with the one he did for Robin Hood but it's one you will not forget.This was the last film Errol Flynn did with director Michael Curtiz. David Niven in his memoirs made of Curtiz a figure of some fun he was the guy with the fractured English who uttered the memorable phrase that became Niven's title for his memoirs 'bring on the empty horses.' Flynn in his memoirs hated him with a passion in that Curtiz put his players in some dangerous situations without regard for safety. After this he refused to work with him. But between them Curtiz and Flynn did some grand entertainment. Curtiz later won an Oscar for directing Casablanca.Flora Robson repeats her role as Queen Elizabeth she had previously portrayed Elizabeth in Fire Over England back in the old country. It's probably the part she's most identified with in her career.Brenda Marshall who is probably better known for being Mrs. William Holden pinch hits for Olivia DeHavilland. Olivia was trying to get some better acting roles that she knew she could do and not be a crinolined heroine all the time. Jack Warner refused to see her as anything else for a long time. Others in the cast who stand out are Alan Hale Una O'Connor Gilbert Roland and William Lundigan has a death scene that will haunt you for a long time.The Sea Hawk is also a film that made use of a film process known as sepia tone. It's probably the film best known for it. The whole sequence of when Flynn sails his ship the Albatross to Panama is photographed in sepia tone. It makes the film come out a kind of brackish yellow. Since Warner Brothers didn't want to spring for full technicolor this process is effective in demonstrating the jungle heat that Flynn and his men and the Spaniards for that matter operate under.It is also no accident that this film was made in 1940 showing brave England refusing to buckle under to a tyrant from the European continent. Phillip II of Spain played by Montagu Love controlled a whole lot of the world's real estate at that point in time and wanted more. The meaning for the audiences of 1940 could not have been more clear.The Sea Hawk is grand entertainment. In my humble opinion Errol Flynn's best film and one of the best of the swashbuckling genre.".

Olivia was trying to get some better acting roles that she knew she could do and not be a crinolined heroine all the time. Jack Warner refused to see her as anything else for a long time. Others in the cast who stand out are Alan Hale Una O'Connor Gilbert Roland and William Lundigan has a death scene that will haunt you for a long time.The Sea Hawk is also a film that made use of a film process known as sepia tone. It's probably the film best known for it. The whole sequence of when Flynn sails his ship the Albatross to Panama is photographed in sepia tone. It makes the film come out a kind of brackish yellow. Since Warner Brothers didn't want to spring for full technicolor this process is effective in demonstrating the jungle heat that Flynn and his men and the Spaniards for that matter operate under.It is also no accident that this film was made in 1940 showing brave England refusing to buckle under to a tyrant from the European continent. Phillip II of Spain played by Montagu Love controlled a whole lot of the world's real estate at that point in time and wanted more. The meaning for the audiences of 1940 could not have been more clear.The Sea Hawk is grand entertainment. In my humble opinion Errol Flynn's best film and one of the best of the swashbuckling genre.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely an Errol Flynn classic meaning one of his best films and the charismatic star of the mid'30s to mid'40s did a number of entertaining ones. He's best known  on screen that is  as a swordsman from his Captain Blood and Adventures of Robin Hood days but he also was terrific as boxer James J. Corbett in Gentlemen Jim and as western star Wade Hatton in Dodge City. He's great here as pirate Geoffrey Thorpe and what makes this pirate movie different is that half of the action scenes are on land not sea. They on are on island or back in the castle of Queen Elizabeth. Flynn captains The Albatross and is a privateering ship captain for her Majesty the queen in the 1500s. They are battling the Spanish in this story. The real bad guys are some of the turncoats in Elizabeth's court.The film is interesting even with its length of over two hours. It keeps a good balance of drama action romance and suspense never overdoing any of those.While it's hard to beat the entertainment duo of Director Michael Curtiz and actor Flynn Brenda Marshall as Doria Maria Thorpe's love interest doesn't quite cut it. Olivia de Havilland usually played his female interest and  although that doesn't require she play in every Flynn movie  they could have found someone more attractive and likable than Marshall who justifiably had a thin career. Her casting in here is a big mystery to me.Whatever Flora Robson was fun to watch as Queen Elizabeth. Claude Rains and Henry Daniell played their normal badguy roles well and Thorpe's crew led by Flynn's best friend Alan Hale are all entertaining guys.I enjoyed the sepiatone sequence when Flynn and the boys go for the gold on the Panama island. That was a nice little visual twist to this blackandwhite movie..Not to be left out is the sweeping score under the direction of Erich Wolfgang Korngold which is one of the more magnificent ones you'll hear in a classic film.".

Even though Captain Blood has a lot more range and features more plotdiversity The Sea Hawk definitely is more spectacular and the swordfight sequences are far more exciting. The cinematography on this action sequences has seemly improved in the period between the two films. Errol Flynn portrays Geoffrey Thorpe captain of the Albatross. He's a Sea Hawk and those privateers serve and protect the English Queen in their own particular way. The greedy King Phillip of Spain has set his mind to conquering Britain as well and to cover up his plans he politely sends an ambassador to meet the Queen. However Captain Thorpe and his crew boycott the Spanish and they righteously foresee a war between the two nations. Things are getting even more complicated when some prominent members of the British counsel turn out to be betrayers and  of course  Capt. Thorpe falls in love with the beautiful niece of the Spanish ambassador. Errol Flynn clearly developed more charisma over the years and he already looks a lot more believable in his role of privateer now. He's excellently supported by Alan Hale who plays his first crewmember Mr. Pitt. Flora Robson seems to make a career out of playing Queen Elizabeth's lookalike since it already is the third film in which she plays this role. The best actor in the cast even beating Errol Flynn obviously is Claude Rains with in his terrific role of the vicious Spanish ambassador. The Galleons both the Spanish as the British look great and some historical aspects like slavery and inquisition are greatly included. The Sea Hawk is excellent wellmade fun and a must for all the nostalgic movie lovers.".

The movie provides rousing action a good story and some memorable characters.Flynn's character is Geoffrey Thorpe who is a sea hawk a privateering ship captain in the late 1500's indulged by Queen Elizabeth Robson and allowed to raise havoc with Spanish shipping in a time when Spain's dominance was at its peak.  The story in The Sea Hawk like the action in The Adventures of Robin Hood is loosely based on historical circumstances although this time the tone is often more serious.  This film is in blackandwhite instead of Technicolor giving it a different feel. There is a very nice touch when the scenes in the New World are tinted in goldenbrown an effective way of emphasizing the different setting.  There are also extensive scenes of the suffering and humiliation experienced by the English galley slaves imprisoned by the Spanish fleet instead of the very brief scenes of Saxon suffering in Robin Hood.  But the main emphasis is still on the swashbuckling action that made Flynn so popular.There are shiptoship fights chases escapes and of course sword fights. Flynn's charisma and infectious good nature are usually enough to carry even farfetched action and here the story itself is more than good enough to be worthwhile in its own right.  The Sea Hawk is good classic entertainment.".

Not only has he got the right looks but he also was a very talented actor who unfortunately died far too early at the age of 50.I also love how the rest of the characters are portrayed such as Elizabeth I and the 'gentleman' villains. Also the love story is done good in a nondistractive way and Brenda Marshall really was one beautiful woman!Still its funny to see how much more polite the English are portrayed than the Spanish. Not only do they politely capture all the Spanish soldiers but they also find time to free all the galley slaves and take them ALL on their ship back to England. It really is funny to see how black and white the story is at times. But this is really my only small point of critic about this movie.A very entertaining adventurous swashbuckling movie with some wonderful music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.

I saw a VividColor MellerDrama with her and Arlene Dahl or was it Rhonda Fleming  Arlene Dahl...whatever...when they were both on screen I needed sunglasses. I'm off subject. A pretty good movies I gave it six maybe give it more as I view others.";

The Sea Hawk dramatises the need for the US to enter World War II with sixteenthcentury Spain standing in for Nazi Germany and analogies to wartime Europe every few minutes.At the beginning Flynn's privateers board and sink a Spanish ship freeing its galley slaves ie victims of Nazism. The Spanish heroine is horrified when she sets eyes on them for the first time and Flynn later tells her he realised when he saw her expression that she was not as cold as he thought ie decent people should sympathise with the conquered nations not act as if the suffering doesn't exist because they don't see it. There are forceful speeches by Flynn Queen Elizabeth and her ministers about England's policy toward Spain whose king we have heard saying that he wants to conquer the whole world to satisfy his own ambitions. The Queen says that King Philip may not be planning to attack England and she doesn't want to make him angry. Flynn says why would he be building up a navy if he didn't intend to use it. The Spanish ambassador rebukes Flynn for freeing the galley slaves who he says were properly tried and sentenced under Spanish law. Flynn replies that an Inquisition court and slavery are not what any Englishman would recognise as properhe seems to stop just short of saying cruel and unusual punishment! The Queen is warned that England may find herself all alone in a world of enemies. The courtiers who oppose antagonising Spain are shown as doing so because they are profiteering traitors not because they have different ideas. So the Queen can be regarded as a standin not only for Churchill but for Roosevelt.When Flynn and his men are betrayed and then captured by the Spaniards and made into galley slaves they manage to slip their chains and then silently wait below decks for the Spanish to pass by one at a time and then pull each one down below and overpower himin other words they literally become underground fighters. The film ends with a fiery speech from Queen Liz who says who the hell is King Philip to tell us what to do and promises to turn all the trees in England into ships to fight those Spanish bastards with everyone cheering her on. For an utterly persuasive combination of argument and emotion this was a pitch for the US entering the war that should have won all the Warner Brothers honorary knighthoods.".

	schema:headline " To prepare for a war which none of us wants";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sea Hawk was the eleventh of twelve collaborations between actor Errol Flynn and director Michael Curtiz and one of the best. It's a return to the surefire swashbuckler format that had given them their biggest successes so far but it has a maturity and a darkness to it that was absent from their previous efforts.Comparing this to Flynn's previous seafaring adventure Captain Blood made in 1935 you can see how much cinema had changed in the intervening years. Despite the title the earlier film isn't really that bloodthirsty. Its depiction of slavery is fairly tame there aren't too many deaths and the tone remains optimistic throughout. The Sea Hawk on the other hand while still a rousing swashbuckler is shot through with despair. The galleyslave scenes come far closer to reality than Captain Blood's plantation. Darker still are the sepiatinted Panama scenes where some men are gunned down in cold blood only for others to die by inches under a glaring sun. Above all you really get the impression that this time the enemy is truly menacing and it will take the heroes more than a few cutting remarks and a few minutes of derringdo to get out alive. The approach of World War Two which broke out during production in particular seems to have cast a shadow over this picture.The Sea Hawk is not an outandout propaganda piece but demonstrates that fear of a sinister aggressive nation bent on world domination which had been subtly creeping into cinema during the late 1930s a good example is Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes. I don't know for certain but I get the feeling that Elizabeth's final speech at the end of the picture may have been added at the last minute when war began. However even without this rather obvious morale booster on the final reel the comparison between 16th century Spain and Hitler's Germany is fairly clear. Right from the opening scene the Spaniards are introduced as particularly sinister types the sinister touch by the way is something Curtiz was really good at there's a hint of it in nearly all his films. On top of that there's this dark feeling that here is a real enemy not some cartoon villain we can laugh away.Regardless of the context The Sea Hawk also stands out amongst Flynn's swashbucklers because of the strength of its elements. The score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is one of his best. The production design is particularly lavish and the hefty budget enabled Curtiz to get a really grand scale to the sea battles. The cast is fantastic too. Flynn was really maturing as an actor and he gives a kind of sober worldweariness to the character. Some of the era's best supporting players make appearances including Alan Hale Claude Rains and Una O'Connor. There's also a memorable turn by Victor Varconi  albeit just a couple of lines  as a sleazy Spanish general. There are a few wrong notes  for example Brenda Marshall's character is equally as annoying as the usual Oliva de Havilland heroine although she isn't as good an actor. Henry Daniel also isn't a match for Basil Rathbone.So a more mature Errol Flynn a darker edge to the adventure picture but also the end of an era. Flynn and Curtiz were soon to part ways and the adventure genre as a whole was beginning to wane in favour of the western and the noir thriller.".

The settings are too opulent the costumes too magnificent and the score is almost too rousing. This is particularly true when Flynn and his entire crew start singing backed up none too discreetly by the entire Warners chorus and orchestra. Who sings while climbing riggings anyway?The other shortfall is the absence of color. Warners was known for their costconsciousness but it is ironic to note that a bit of trimming in the costuming and settings department would have probably allowed them to use the tricolor process which was used to such spectacular effect in The Adventures of Robin Hood.That said the Sea Hawk possesses an embarrassment of riches. The semihistoric story line is strong as are the performances of a truly stellar cast. Flora Robson Claude Rains are tremendous and Henry Daniell darn near outsneers Basil Rathbone as the duplicitous villain. Brenda Marshall is no Olivia de Havilland but she doesn't have do be its nice to see Errol flirting with another comely wench.Errol himself is also a treat. This was 1940 before his rape trial and before he got tired of movie making. He is obviously engaged in the production and is at his most dashing self in pushing it along. Perrenial sidekick on and off screen Alan Hale is outstanding as well in his portrayal of...Well Alan Hale.Best of all is the score composed by gool old erich Wolfgang Korngold. It is no coincidence that his music is at the heart of Flynn's best movies. It matches the action scene for scene in a manner again reminiscent of Robin Hood.Although I cannot rank this as Flynn's best vehicle there is a solid minority of Flynnatics who do. A compelling argument can be made for it.".

Historically apparently it's not very accurate. Perhaps Flynn's best acting in the tale is when he is a prisoner  essentially a galley slave  aboard a Spanish ship...Flynn not in control.There are a number of fine character actors here including Flynn's frequent sidekick Alan Hale but from my perspective none of the roles stand out.Worth seeing once or maybe twice but this title won't sit along side other Flynn movies on my DVD shelf.".

It is a Warner brothers A effort a BW answer to Gone With the Wind. Warners was called the 'outlaw studio' because its tsars had a habit of making films about men who were either criminals or revolutionaries against a U.S.. the studio's bosses seemed to mistrust more than anyone else did. In this case the government they chose to study is Elizabeth I's Protestant England she herself considered an enemy of the mighty Catholic Empire of Spain under Philp II. To counter Spain's attempt to destroy England as she had overrun her ally The Low Countries Benelux England's Queen expanded the building of Henry VIII's fleet and bettered her father's design by refusing to waste money and men in wars and by making her navy's ships smaller and more swift than Spanish galleons. Hero of this film is rebellious but loyal Geoffrey Thorpe played adequately as a very young and promising fellow by Errol Flynn. He and others are disowned publicly but privately backed in their conducting of raids on Spanish shipping. In the film Geoffrey is returning from one such raid with a prize including a captured Spanish lady he is falling in love with to whom for love he has returned her jewels. Elizabeth I is furious at this but is softened and Thorpe goes off on his greatest adventure to the New World to go after the Spanish Empire's annual treasure fleet. Betrayed to the Spaniards and captured in Panama he and his men escape imprisonment in a slave galley make their way through swamps win a battle and return to England in time to expose traitors and save Elizabeth. His reward is the lady who has waited for him and the chance to serve England further. In the huge cast with Flynn are splendid Alan Hale the great Flora Robson reprising her Fire Over England role as Elizabeth Claude Rains Donald Crisp powerful Henry Daniell pretty but rather weak Brenda Marshall as the lady he loves Julien Mitchell Montagu Love Gilbert Roland William Lundigan Ian Keith Una O'Connor Jay Silverheels and Robert Warwick. This expensivelymounted production was written by Seton I Miller of the Mississippi Gambler and The Adventures of Robin Hood fame with Howard Koch. Director Michael Curtiz was in charge of this sumptuous offering the music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is justly famousthe credits for 'The Sae Hawk read like a who is who in Hollywood makeup was by Perc Westmore cinematography by Sol Polito art direction by Anton Grot and gowns by OrryKelly. Special effects were by Byron Haskin. Watch for the slave galley scene this is the scene adapted by William Wyler for Ben Hur's galley setups. This is a stirring and very entertaining film with everything from an amusing monkey to great acting to clever dialogue as Slizabeth inspires scolds but brilliantly misleads those who would thwart her courseto make England secure in her preImperial days from Spain's tyrannical ambitions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything is right in this film loosely based on the exploits of Sir Francis Drake and very little on the Rafael Sabatini novel. Errol Flynn Claude Rains Michael Curtiz Erich Wolfgang Korngold The WB Banner and piracy on the High Seas  What more could one ask for? Obviously the answer would be The Sea Hawk. The only shortcoming to my knowledge was no Olivia de Havilland who for some reason was overlooked by Jack L Warner when he made the film. Flynn is at his dashing best as the fictionalised Geoffery Thorpe matching wits with the likes of King Philip of Spain and his treacherous agents . He matches swordplay tongue in cheek and romance with ease making this his best ever. Claude Rains and Henry Daniel are unpleasantly debonair in their roles of Spanish spies. Brenda Marshall is adequate but just does not match up as one is always wishing Olivia alongside Errol as his lady love. Flora Robson recreates her role as Elizabeth I and adds a great aura of grace and majesty in her depiction. One cannot but help feeling that her rendition is of such conviction that it makes one believe that Elizabeth could not but have spoken and behaved the way in which she is played. Michael Cutriz once again scores with his excellent action sequences but overall it is Korngold who enthralls the viewer with his sweeping score which is unforgettable. One cannot but recollect the similarities of this film to Fire Over England but the Hollywoodization of medieval England is more pronounced here. Some unforgettable scenes The beginning of the film  the shadow of a dictator Philip of Spain covering the map of Europe wanting to covet England and her colonies bears a striking resemblance to Hitler and his dream all the more significant as the film was released in early 1940 when the Phoney war had just begun and Dunkirk was in the near distance. The swordplay between Flynn and the Spanish captain where he points out that the English are a practical people who do not sink with their ships  a veiled message to the Nazis that Britain would fight on even if all Europe was to fall? The speech by the Queen towards the end of the film where she warns her subjects of being prepared for the Armada that was poised to strike  Hitler's Luftwaffe and The Battle of Britain and a distant appeal to America to join the fight against Fascism. Last but not least the scene where the freed slaves of the Spanish Galley look wistfully at the distant Cliffs of Dover and ex slave Tuttle mouths just one word England which to me was the migr Curtiz announcing to all of downtrodden Europe that their safe haven in the wake of the impending onslaught was indeed Britain. One can go on and on about Sea Hawk but a review needs to be concise. The greatest of a swashbuckler that does not age a bit and can be viewed over and over again.".

Starring are Errol Flynn Brenda Marshall Claude Rains Flora Robson Donald Crisp Alan Hale and Henry Daniell. Music is scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Sol Polito is the cinematographer.It's the reign of Queen Elizabeth and Captain Geoffrey Thorpe preys on the galleons of Spain plundering for treasure and freeing the English enslaved as oarsmen. Back at court the Spanish Ambassador and an English traitor conspire against Thorpe and the British naval defence as King Philip II of Spain Montagu Love plots World domination.Swashbuckling ahoy in this quite rousing Michael CurtizErrol Flynn picture. No expense spared from Warner Brothers who stumped up 1.7 million to help make The Sea Hawk a wonderfully lavish production. The budget is evident in the marvellous sets and the impacting costumes spot on direction from Curtiz the cinematography from Sol Polito is luscious whilst Erich Wolfgang Korngold's score is suitably periodic with its swirling romanticism for the tender threads and rousing for the ship duelling bluster. But all this wouldn't be quite so great without a good cast to flesh out the dynamite story.Errol Flynn is perhaps at a career high as Thorpe? Swashing away with a trusty blade to do down the evil enemy who dare to hurt good old Blighty. Villain duties fall to Claude Rains as Don Jose Alvarez de Cordoba and Henry Daniell as Lord Wolfingham Rains is sadly underused but leaves his mark whilst Daniell is deliciously scheming and easily carries off the baddie honours. Excellent support comes from Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth Donald Crisp as Sir John Burleson Alan Hale as Carl Pitt Una O'Connor as Martha and Brenda Marshall does what is needed for the role of Donna Maria Alvarez de Cordoba. It would have been easy for The Sea Hawk to have turned out to be an over the top propaganda picture but it never feels like it to me full of wartime sensibilities for sure it also contains stirring speeches hello Adolf we are talking to you pirate singalongs and a derring do well heroic streak seaming throughout. Above all else tho it's the blood letting battles and having a hero to hang your hat on that crowns what has to be one of the best films of its type from the era. Hooray and a bottle of rum for all say I! 910".

His wooing of Brenda Marshall who makes a pretty if somewhat bland deHavilland stand in is sweet and somewhat insecure something different.To steal a movie from Flynn is not an easy thing but Flora Robson nearly does so with her marvelous portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I. She flirts fights and commands with great gusto. She's probably the best Queen Elizabeth I have seen even though she looked almost nothing like the genuine article. It just goes to show what a talented actress can do.As for the rest of the movie it was good but sometimes a bit hohum especially when compared to Robin Hood. I shan't give away the ending but I will just say that I was a wee bit disappointed.What I really can't understand is why they named this movie the Sea Hawk. It is supposedly based on the novel by Rafael Sabatini a very popular novelist at the time but absolutely nothing of the original plot is allowed to remain. The main characters have different names and backgrounds the time period shifted and so forth. I suppose with World War II raging Warner Bros. decided that a tale of a renegade Englishman turned muslim corsair would be too far removed so they cooked up a plot with Spain representing the Axis powers.All in all much more enjoyable if you have not read the book though it is quite good and definitely worth your while if you are an Errol Flynn fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "What style! What dash! They don't come much better than this. In fact they don't come at all anymore. It's a splendid genre picture from Warner Brothers when they were at the top of their game. No philosophy no pretense no artiness just love and adventure and action. Except come to think of it the whole thing is an allegory. Instead of England standing against the ambitions of Spain's King Philip it's really about Winston Churchill standing against the ambitions of Adolf Hitler. Not arty maybe but socially and politically responsible. That was always the chink in Warner Brothers' otherwise impeccably commercial armor.The film cries out for color and for Olivia DeHavilland. Brenda Marshall as Flynn's love interest is beautiful in her own way but a bit stiff compared to the intelligent but palpably sensitive DeHavilland. Flynn himself had matured as an actor in the five years since his major debut in Captain Blood. Peter Blood relied on his boyish enthusiasm and his dazzling everpresent grin. Geoffrey Thorpe is less one of the gang than a commander here though compassionate and accessible. He was a better fencer too. Henry Danielle as the heavy Lord Wolfingham comes across as a fop. His legs are skinny and his tonal contours those of a man not quite certain of his gender identity. He couldn't fence his way out of a paper bag so the climactic dual has lots of cutaway shots shadows on palace walls and obvious doubles. The acting honors really go to Claude Raines as the Spanish ambassador who manages to combine an obsequious manner that oozes insincerity with a genuine concern for his niece's Marshall's wellbeing. He's suave. He's debonair. He's dressed in black and wears ghoulish makeup. And Flora Robeson as Queen Elizabeth I not the first time must share in those honors. She informs the part of a dignified and dispassionate queen with a feminine quality that's almost seductive although as she says she'll settle for the scepter rather than for love.The film wouldn't be what it is without Eric Wolfgang Korngold's recklessly exuberant score full of trumpet fanfares bombast and soaring strings. He even manages to insert a notatallboring love ballad into the film that is simple surprising limpid and melodic. I think he later used it in a more formal composition. The score is sometimes criticized because after all men don't sing like an opera chorus  Strike for the shores of Dover and whatnot  when they're climbing the ratlines. But if you look closely you don't see any of the men singing on film. The chorus is built into the score. This along with Robin Hood is arguably Korngold's best score. Maybe even his best work even compared to his more ambitious classical pieces.Michael Curtiz directed as he had directed Flynn in several earlier movies. They weren't getting along too well. Curtiz was a demanding taskmaster and Flynn rarely took anything seriously enough to work hard at it. His career for him seemed to consist mainly of having fun. As part of a gag aimed at his buddy Allan Hale he once had the makeup department build a prosthetic penis for him that was so oversized that  well the gag had better not be described in a review subject to scrutiny by tots.Anyway enough. See the movie.".

At any rate he's terrific here perfect leading man material and his final storming of the castle is classic stuff. A lot of the other performances are kind of lackluster but I really loved Flora Robson's sly almost flirty portrayal of the queen. The film moves swiftly without any significant dead spots and my interest was held throughout. Curtiz had a real gift for framing always seeming to find a visually exciting composition. Also noteworthy is Korngold's stirring score and a coda which does the patriotic wartime call to action better than a lot of other films of its time. If there's a weakness it's the romance between Flynn and Brenda Marshall which feels rather perfunctory even though it's a significant plot element. Some people seem to have a problem with Marshall's performance but I think she simply wasn't given enough to do.".

Another shallow movie with no point. All it's going to do is ruin Tommy Lee Jones' reputation and put the University of Texas to shame. I was still curious to see it however and as it turns out this movie is excellent. It made me spin around over and over literally screaming at it's pure hilarity. With quips and punch lines by Cedric the Entertainer and Tommy Lee Jones this movie was very enjoyable. Surprisingly Tommy Lee keeps his same opinions they just find a level of understanding which is in my opinion what would happen in that kind of situation. I think this movie was made with an honest opinion in mind with the occasional eccentricities such as Cedric doing a row of back flips into a table at church. I loved this movie and I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good laugh. You'll be depriving yourself of a great time if you don't!".

While on the verge of capturing a potential lead his partner is shot and he loses his witness. Everything is up in the air and no one knows which way to go when luckily five cheerleaders witness the execution of the man Sharp was trying to capture who is named Morgan Ball Curtis Armstrong  Who would have thought he would still be making movies long after his most successful stint as Booger has long been dead. After the girls decide to do the right thing and tell the police they are held in protective custody until they can capture the criminal who would surely be looking for them. They decide that Sharp will look after them personally and live in the same house as long as needed. This is where the comedy really begins.The movie is meant to be a comedy and I think Tommy Lee Jones did an excellent job with it as well as Cedric The Entertainer. The movie opens like a typical action movie and then goes with the comedy all the way until the end when it reverts back to that one big action sequence to end it all.Jones and Cedric made the movie as good as it was. The cheerleaders were simply eye candy which is just fine by me. My favorite being Barb Kelli Garner. Jones comes off a little too old when he refuses to let the girls run around the house in the usual skimpy teen attire we all see nowadays but that is just to show his character. You still get to see plenty of the girls which is probably as much an attraction as Jones and Cedric.This movie is a little hard to review for some reason but like I said in the title if you liked the movie Miss Congeniality then you will most likely enjoy this one too. They are cut of the same cloth so to speak. If you did not like Miss Congeniality then you probably will not like this either. I guess that is the best way to put it.

	schema:reviewBody "There are movies that come out of nowhere completely enrapture us and have us singing their praises to anybody who will listen. Movies that will stand the test of time and be added to most DVD collections. Other movies Alone in the Dark appear in our theaters only briefly and much like Funyoninduced flatulence they stink up the joint and then disappear as quickly as they came. Then there are movies like Man of the House. They come they moderately entertain but they really don't add anything fresh or new to the industry. They simply manage to keep you smiling for an hour and a half before making their way to the WalMart bargain bin.The generically cheesy title Man of the House? Come on! should immediately warn you that we're not exactly diving into uncharted waters. No towing the line will be allowed here! But that's OK. Sure the movie is bythenumbers predictable silly and whatever other clichd buzz words you want to use for a movie that's not brimming with originality. It's a pretty simple mix really we've got Jones some hot cheerleaders to look at and a few laughs. Fortunately I like Jones and hot cheerleaders. And you know what? I laughed! I didn't have to see a doctor about my busted gut afterwards but I was entertained and sometimes that's enough to satisfy me on a Friday afternoon.This is a fun cutesy fluffy movie that bases most of its jokes on the contrast of Tommy Lee Jones' nononsense nonjoking persona with the bubbly personalities of five college cheerleaders who don't appreciate his rules. Of course this means they will do their best to rebel a bit. For example they continue to dress scantily despite Jones' insistence that they try to wear a few more articles of clothing. No problem. TLJ just purchases an extremely expensive air conditioner to force them to cover up. It may cost the Texas Rangers a few thousand dollars but it'll teach those girls a lesson in modesty! In a surprising twist that is bound to shake the very foundations of cinema as we know it the gals grow to like TLJ despite his leather tough exterior. They really want to help him discover his inner sensitivity because let's face it when you look like a piece of beef jerky you need all the help you can get. So when TLJ has a big date with one of the cheerleaders' professors Anne Archer they swoop in to trim his nose and ear hair give him a manicure and tidy him up. All the middleaged women who love Tommy Lee Jones and his Southern drawl go awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! And the scene where the cheerleaders help teach Jones how to skate is also sure to make those elderly female hearts flutter. I won't spoil it for you and tell you whether he falls or not. I'll give you the joy of finding out for yourself.Then of course there are the jokes that play to the stereotype of some cheerleaders not being too bright. When Jones announces that he's with the Texas Rangers one of the cheerleaders excitedly asks Do you know Derek Jeter? Some people will find moments like this to be stupid while others such as my mother and sister will think they're absolutely adorable.The best advice I can give you is to picture in your mind Tommy Lee Jones living with five cheerleaders. How funny is the image to you? Let that be your guide. If you don't like TLJ then there's not much here for you because he's responsible for keeping this from being a madeforTV movie that I probably wouldn't have had any interest in watching.THE GIST Man of the House isn't exactly a movie to get excited about but it provides enough laughs to keep its head above water. If you like Tommy Lee Jones or hot cheerleaders and you thought the trailer looked halfway decent then this is a serviceable matine or a future rental. Otherwise you probably won't find it worth your time.Rating 3 out of 5".

They really want to help him discover his inner sensitivity because let's face it when you look like a piece of beef jerky you need all the help you can get. So when TLJ has a big date with one of the cheerleaders' professors Anne Archer they swoop in to trim his nose and ear hair give him a manicure and tidy him up. All the middleaged women who love Tommy Lee Jones and his Southern drawl go awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! And the scene where the cheerleaders help teach Jones how to skate is also sure to make those elderly female hearts flutter. I won't spoil it for you and tell you whether he falls or not. I'll give you the joy of finding out for yourself.Then of course there are the jokes that play to the stereotype of some cheerleaders not being too bright. When Jones announces that he's with the Texas Rangers one of the cheerleaders excitedly asks Do you know Derek Jeter? Some people will find moments like this to be stupid while others such as my mother and sister will think they're absolutely adorable.The best advice I can give you is to picture in your mind Tommy Lee Jones living with five cheerleaders. How funny is the image to you? Let that be your guide. If you don't like TLJ then there's not much here for you because he's responsible for keeping this from being a madeforTV movie that I probably wouldn't have had any interest in watching.THE GIST Man of the House isn't exactly a movie to get excited about but it provides enough laughs to keep its head above water. If you like Tommy Lee Jones or hot cheerleaders and you thought the trailer looked halfway decent then this is a serviceable matine or a future rental. Otherwise you probably won't find it worth your time.Rating 3 out of 5";

It was fun to see local landmarks including Buffalo Billiards Threadgill's the campus and the Governor's mansion but how could Tommy Lee Jones go to Threadgill's and leave without eating one deepfried dill pickle??I made a unofficial poll of the women that I know who are over 40 years of age and every single one said   I LOVE Tommy Lee Jones! If that is part of his demographic this movie should do really well with TLJ delivering zingers in that cowboy voice admitting to his 55 years and keeping his smiles for the womanly Anne Archer while wrangling the herd of young cheerleaders. The supporting cast was also fun to watch  just remember this is not a film  it's a MOVIE!".

Of course each of the cheerleaders represents a typical stereotype the dumb blonde the too tightly wound premed major the sassy black girl the fiery Latina and the bad girl. I felt like I was watching a movie script that was written by MadLibs. Hey we need a laugh so lets make Tommy Lee Jones buy tampons and watch the hilarity ensue! Cause nothing says funny like men's reaction to icky feminine products! The movie also misses the opportunity to properly utilize the talents of Pagent Brewster so adorable as Chandler's love interest on Friends who has only a few lines as the uberperky cheerleading coach Binky and Ann Archer who brings a quiet dignity to her underdeveloped role as a professorobject of TLJ's affection.For those of you cheers fans you will be woefully disappointed by the lack of actual cheerleading that is shown. Besides one ridiculous danceoff between the girls and Cedric the Entertainer whose presence in the movie seems to be there purely because it is hilarious to see a large man dance in too small cheerleading uniform which looks more like drill team practice to me there is nary a tumbling pass or pyramid to be seen. Sadly this is no Bring It On. And for all the rahrah girl power the movie feigns to promote the girls are portrayed as bubble headed appearance crazed weight obsessed exhibitionists.That being said the movie wasn't all bad. The laughs were obvious the characters broad the plot unbelievable but there were still the chuckles that come from a fish out of water comedy where you crack a smile in spite of yourself. Tommy Lee Jones does a good job of looking like an exasperated hardass though you can't help but wonder if he's really acting or just cannot believe his agent actually sent him the script. By the way he is a good example to young kids of why you should always wear sunscreen  the man has NOT aged well! All in all not a total waste of time but I wouldn't suggest building your weekend plans around a viewing!".

Man of the House is a lame comedy that fails to entertain the viewer. It offers a simple premise and it does nothing with it. I know movies like this one are supposed to be harmless fun but this one wasn't fun. It was a lazy and unoriginal movie lacking laughs and charm. The casting director did a good job but the actors do little with this weak material. The sad part is that there are five! credited screenwriters for this film and they can't even come up with anything interesting. This movie was made to make a lot of money not to actually entertain it's audience.The acting is just as lackluster as the script. Tommy Lee Jones is obviously doing this for a paycheck and his performance is so dull. His dry sense of humor and his uptightness gets old and annoying fast. Monica Keena probably gives the best performance. She has a few funny lines and she wasn't totally annoying. Christina Milian should stick to singing as her performance isn't very good. Vanessa Ferlito gives the worst performance and she isn't very pretty. Kelli Garner tried too hard to act stupid while Paula Garcs seemed bored in her role. Brian Van Holt was just pale and not very interesting.Stephen Herek has directed good movies in the past but Man of the House is not a good example of his work. Of course he shouldn't get all the blame since he is working with a weak script and no one really seems to be trying. The running time is a brief 95 minutes but it feels so much longer. The funny bits are very few and far in between. There were a bunch of slow spots as well as lame jokes. At least there was some eye candy and this makes the film somewhat tolerable. Besides for that there is pretty no reason to see this film. In the end Man of the House is a lazy boring and unfunny comedy that's better left on the shelf. Rating 310".

Lee ErmeyWhen the first scene of this movie happened I was interested but confused. I had no idea really what was going on. Someone gets shot then they show a guy up on a roof of a building with a sniper rifle in his hand then there's a chase cheerleaders are in another scene seeing another person get shot then finally I kind of catch up with the story. I guess the reason why they call it the Man of the House is because the main star Tommy Lee Jones meets up with these cheerleaders in I guess a question room and asks them questions about the shooting they witnessed mostly about the guy who shot the man in the shooting. Then the main star moves in with the girls in a house the cheerleaders' live in and he is pretty much in charge of them even though it's only the cheerleaders' house. The movie was interesting at the end but in the middle I was kind of confused. I would say there were some confusing parts and most parts I knew what was going on. There was at least one scene where Tommy was thinking that maybe this guy in a mascot suit was involved in the scene of the crime. He especially thought that when he saw a gun in the mascot's hand and he plunged toward the mascot calling his men apparently being cops over too. His men inspected the mascot and the gun was only a water gun and it was all a joke. I was sure in that scene that this guy was a real bad guy but he wasn't. That was the only scene Tommy thought he saw the real guy involved in the crime. I have to say that that scene was a very interesting scene that kept my eyes glued to the television. Also in the movie Tommy kind of falls in love with this woman and has a date that lasts about fifteen minutes. That was one of the boring parts. In my opinion this movie was better than I thought it would be. I can't tell you any more of the scenes in this movie 'cause that would kind of give it away. I told you the most important part the main plot with a few extra scenes here and there and that's mostly what counts. Movie directed by Stephen Herek.".

He introduces them to pizza and its fat content. and the girls give him pointers on dating one of their teachers. But we really didn't need the wedding at the end it was overkill.

	schema:reviewBody "How can you possibly go wrong pairing up Tommy Lee Jones with five hot cheerleaders? Luckily Man of the House doesn't disappoint. Granted it won't win any awards but it does a good job as a time suck with its standard fish out of water story and count them five token hot chicks.The story follows Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas Ranger not the kind that would know Derek Jeter as some of the girls think who is protecting a group of cheerleaders from the University of Texas who have witnessed a murder that is linked to a high powered businessman. The ladies he is protecting include the token hot chick from Undeclared as the brainy one with social anxieties plays the tough as nails one but has all the deep thoughts not too mention the only one who could master the Texas accent Paula Garces who surprisingly is on the wrong side of thirty playing a college student and Chistina Milian best know for her singing career well actually not really both play the fiery Latina chick not sure why they didn't just combine the characters. The standout of the cheerleaders though was Kelli Garner as the boy and man crazy dumb blonde who brought depth and heart to what could have been just your routine Jessica or Paris caricature.

Granted it won't win any awards but it does a good job as a time suck with its standard fish out of water story and count them five token hot chicks.The story follows Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas Ranger not the kind that would know Derek Jeter as some of the girls think who is protecting a group of cheerleaders from the University of Texas who have witnessed a murder that is linked to a high powered businessman. The ladies he is protecting include the token hot chick from Undeclared as the brainy one with social anxieties plays the tough as nails one but has all the deep thoughts not too mention the only one who could master the Texas accent Paula Garces who surprisingly is on the wrong side of thirty playing a college student and Chistina Milian best know for her singing career well actually not really both play the fiery Latina chick not sure why they didn't just combine the characters. The standout of the cheerleaders though was Kelli Garner as the boy and man crazy dumb blonde who brought depth and heart to what could have been just your routine Jessica or Paris caricature.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be honest. My two main motivations for checking out this movie were the great Tommy Lee Jones and a bunch of hot cheerleaders. I expected a fluffy predictable comedy and that's what I got. But it works. There are few laughoutloud moments but it's charming and fun the whole way through. Of course I have to give much of the credit to Tommy Lee Jones. When you're dealing with a broad comedy of this sort it's good to have a talented veteran actor at its center to give it some validity. John Cleese once said that watching a crazy person is not nearly as funny as watching someone reacting to a crazy person. Well Jones does a great job at reacting to this group of wacky cheerleaders and helps make the film even more amusing. I'm sure reallife cheerleaders hate the way they're almost always portrayed as ditsy morons in movies. Well this movie isn't any different so cheerleaders may be offended by much of the humor. I didn't think it was necessary for Harold and Kumar's Paula Garces to play a stereotypical Latina phony accent and all. But unfortunately it's hard to be of Latin descent of Hollywood without getting those degrading roles. Just look at Lupe Ontiveros who was born in the U.S. yet has been stuck playing the typical Spanish maid throughout most of her career. But with all that aside I think one of the reasons why the movie succeeds is because it doesn't often resort to crude and lowbrow humor. There's one joke involving Jones sticking his hand up a cow's behind but other than that there isn't any real bathroom humor. And on top of it all we have a nice action subplot including an exciting finale. Man of the House is good lighthearted fun as long as you're not expecting too much.".

That's like knocking a '63 Corvette because it won't take you to the Moon.Frankly I thought the fiery and colorful animation sequences were sort of prepsychedelicera psychedelia if I may coin a phrase. I was pleasantly surprised by the almost bizarre look of it all and felt a keen sense of having 'discovered' a lost treasure. As an avid film buff with thousands of titles in my film library both VHS  DVD I'm quite aware that there are always new to me films to be discovered regardless of how long ago they were made. And yes after seeing this film on cable a few months ago I purchased the DVD for my collection. I rated this film 9 almost entirely for it's visual impact.Highly recommended viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recently reminded of this little gem after visiting its origins in St Michael's Mount Cornwall. Loved this film as a kid. The attack on the ship was especially effective I recall it being quite scary when I first saw it. The fact that there were 'scary' elements probably set it apart from the likes of the Sinbad and Jason films and I guess this is this reason why its my favourite film of its genre and age. Admittedly the effects may look a little ropey nowadays but that doesn't get in the way of a very entertaining film. As much as I enjoyed it though I can't help but admit that I wouldn't mind someone having a stab at a remake this version will always be there if it goes pear shaped".

Keeping in mind its 40 plus year old release I'd have to say this film was pretty solid. Its antiquated effects only heighten its nostalgic value and fantastic feel but i caution you to still watch this movie with a bit of mercy and leeway.Surprisingly the 'demons' in the castle were rather authentic and creepy in a very contemporary sense check them out as well as the marching dragon men guards on the bridge and the make up of the evil witch alterego of the princess complete with way ahead of their time Micheal Jackson Thriller giant yellow demon contact lenses all of which came off with an eerie modern vibe.I absolutely love how there were so many unique creatures always lurking about like the Star Wars cantina scene or a Power Rangers episode. Kudos to the relentless onslaught of evil magical spells and fantastic beasts that were constantly thrown at the heroes until the end credits rolled. If modern screenplaysfilms of this genre were made with such attention to monsters and battles and true fantasy action versus all the other crapola thrown in to attract non fantasy fans... we'd be in good shape... and maybe even be privy to a simple great fantasy flick that is packaged in an actual 90 minute movie remember those?A non stop eclectic mixture of characters from every conceivable fantasy realm and fairyland mythos intertwine in this flick for a most interesting watch indeed. Also plenty of fun over the top dialogue about witches and demons and dragons and little people plus more cheesy stop animation and I Dream of Jeannie dissapearing acts than you can shake your plastic Viking sword at.A real treat that had previously escaped me as well as an obvious precursor to the pinnacle godfather of stop motion sword and sorcery movies... Clash of the Titans... all hail.As a fun bonus watch for the strange real? almost handicapped limp of the evil wizard Pendragon as well as what appears to be some flaws in the colorization proccess during the demon vs. ship scene.Sure you could rip this movie to shreds and pick it a part at will but why? Its older than your mamma and a lot more fun. So grab a beer gather the kiddies and sit back and enjoy... and just keep thinking to yourself how this thing screams modern REMAKE!!!".

	schema:headline " It was nothing. I kill a giant every morning before breakfast. Starts my day right.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's the fairy tale land of Cornwall England and the Black Prince Pendragon Torin Thatcher plans to abduct Princess Elaine Judith Meredith so as to gain control of the land. However his plans are at first thwarted when farmers boy Jack Kerwin Matthews slays the giant sent by Pendragon to claim the Princess. But Pendragon is not to be denied and a battle between good and evil commences.There's quite a back story to this United Artists feature film. It's loosely based on the traditional tale Jack the Giant Killer and features the use of stop motion animation. The mere mention of stop motion automatically brings to mind the great name of Ray Harryhausen. In 1958 director Nathan Juran had helmed The 7th Voyage of Sinbad with both Matthews and Thatcher starring as the good and evil characters respectively. A big success for Columbia Harryhausen had offered it to UA producer Edward Small who turned it down much to his regret. So here four years later he gathered the same crew for what essentially is a retread of the plot of Sinbad's seventh in the hope of replicating said success. Harryhausen however said no perhaps understandably so his creatures were created for Jack by Project Unlimited under the watchful eye of one time Harryhausen understudy Jim Danforth. While the other effects filmed in Fantascope come courtesy of Howard A. Anderson and Augie Lohman.Columbia sued Small on the grounds of plot similarity thus holding up the release of the film in the UK for several years it wasn't banned as some people seem to think. Once released the film was panned by the critics and many parents were outraged that the film was too violent and scary for youngsters. Small would take this personally and intending to make something of the movie had it redubbed and made into a musical. The result of which is just garbage. Thankfully the film was finally restored to its original glory on DVD and found a whole new generation of fantasy adventure fans with a bent for the lost art of stop motion animation. Kerwin Matthews passed away in 2007 a handsome swashbuckling actor Jack The Giant Killer was his last foray into the fantasy adventure genre. It's at least comforting to know that he got to see this little treasure of a film finally get accepted by an audience.The film itself delivers everything one expects of the genre. The creatures are effective even if the jerkiness shows that it's not Harryhausen at the helm tho this is off set by a wonderful sequence as electricity cloaked witch demons attack Jack's ship. There's a dashing hero a pretty princess a vile and chilling evil doer hell there's even the little imp of the lamp Don Beddoe for some limerick shenanigans. From its delightful story book opening to its final battle between hero and villain Jack The Giant Killer is a rich and playful fantasy. 710".

Personally I think it is a far nicer film than The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad although I still have fond memories of that film rest assuredand its one that I enjoy watching again and again and again.  All the cast Kerwin Matthews Judi Meredith Torin Thatcher AnnaLee Walter Burke Don Beddoes et al give fine performances and the special effects most notably the stopmotion animation the cartoonstyle animation stand up well to the test of time. The story is nice and straight forward and easy to understand.However for me it is Judi Meredith who really made the film.  The scenes where Pendragon Torin Thatcher uses that jewelled staff to turn her from a beautiful kind princess into a beautiful cold and icy witch had a real effect on me when I saw the film for the first time on BBC1 in the summer of 1976.  Even more effective was when she showed Jack Kerwin Matthews her reflection as a wicked witch in the mirror and said Gaze upon my true form. Am I not beautiful?  then she laughed an evil laugh!  It was good that Jack managed to break the spell afterwards.  On the other hand I wish I could have seen a little more of Elaine as a witch in this film.I had no idea that this film was released as a musical until a few years ago.  I haven't seen the musical so I cannot really comment on it. However perhaps it's just as well as I have heard that the musical numbers are lousy.  I saw the film again on Channel Four at Christmas 1997 and it was wonderful to see it again.Jack The Giant Killer offers an enjoyable story great action scenes competent direction great special effects and a professional cast.  Its a must for anybody who likes fantasy films.MATTHEW HYATT".

Unfortunately it is relatively unknown especially in the UK where it cannot be found on DVD or video and it has never seen a release on either of these formats to my knowledge it does however show up every 5 years or so on Channel 4so look out for it there. It also seems to be compared unfavourably with The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad which is a shame as it surpasses this admittedly fine film in many ways. The story is typical fairy tale stuff a poor farmers' son rescues a princess from the evil clutches of a sorceror but it somehow transcends this simple tale and becomes something so much darker and scarier than it's more famous rival. There is a cruel streak running through this film which is totally absent from The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad and which makes this movie more like a horror film than a childrens fantasy.This fact was obviously picked up on by the film censors in the UK who gave it an A certificate children to be accompanied by an adult way back in 1967 when it hit the cinemas here it was also cut by around two minutes of the more violent moments. On the down side the monsters in Jack are rubbery and unconvincing which is unfortunate and does make some of the scenes look very fake indeed and in this respect the film is no match at all for the beautiful models on display in Voyage but the optical colour effects when spells are cast and especially the nightmarish blue tints during the scary witches' attack on the boat are breathtaking and look very magical and there is also a fabulous finale when the evil Pendragon turns into a dragon and fights to the death with Jack. Younger children will find this movie too frightening even now when kids see a lot of things they should'nt. Older kids will probably find it a bit too corny for their tastes. Which only leaves nostalgic adults and the 610 age group left to enjoy this movies' many charms a shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "A well made film that some say copied a lot from 1959's The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.  Interesting I think it's better.  Kerwin Mathews was great as Jack the farmboyturnedgiant killer.  Judi Meredith was far superior than Kathryn Grant in terms of acting and beauty.  Torin Thatcher was once again evil to the core.  The other cast members performed well too as their characters stood out amongst the special effects.  Outstanding supporting characters included the servant Garna played by Walter Burke and the imp in the bottle played by Don Beddoe.The budget for 'Jack' wasn't as big as 'Sinbad' it was about 6 to 1 in comparison.  There were some impressive effects for the time.  Some of them were quite clever such as Pendragon's disappearing trick done with his cape. This effect can be seen recently in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Ray Harryhausen is a tough act to follow he was indeed the founder and master of stop motion animation.  The team for 'Jack' were quite new to the craft but still managed to pull it off.The film is available on DVD from Goodtimes Home Video and taken from the same film transfer as MGM's laserdisc version.  The only difference is that the laserdisc includes the theatrical trailer.  The color is awesome Technicolor and the sound is crystal clear.  The sound effects and music that's well suited and good considering that the film was made in 1962.  I have never seen the musical version if anyone has it let me know.This is one of my favourite films and am proud to have my two sons enjoy it too.".

Kerwin Mathews was great as Jack the farmboyturnedgiant killer.  Judi Meredith was far superior than Kathryn Grant in terms of acting and beauty.  Torin Thatcher was once again evil to the core.  The other cast members performed well too as their characters stood out amongst the special effects.  Outstanding supporting characters included the servant Garna played by Walter Burke and the imp in the bottle played by Don Beddoe.The budget for 'Jack' wasn't as big as 'Sinbad' it was about 6 to 1 in comparison.  There were some impressive effects for the time.  Some of them were quite clever such as Pendragon's disappearing trick done with his cape. This effect can be seen recently in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Ray Harryhausen is a tough act to follow he was indeed the founder and master of stop motion animation.  The team for 'Jack' were quite new to the craft but still managed to pull it off.The film is available on DVD from Goodtimes Home Video and taken from the same film transfer as MGM's laserdisc version.  The only difference is that the laserdisc includes the theatrical trailer.  The color is awesome Technicolor and the sound is crystal clear.  The sound effects and music that's well suited and good considering that the film was made in 1962.  I have never seen the musical version if anyone has it let me know.This is one of my favourite films and am proud to have my two sons enjoy it too.";

For the juvenile viewers even today they will have goosebumps over the witches monsters and giants that our intrepid hero Jack has to overcome.I do like the fact that Kerwin Matthews Torin Thatcher and the rest of the cast play their roles with absolute sincerity. It would not have been appropriate to do it otherwise in a film meant for kids of all ages.The plot is simple evil prince Torin Thatcher has designs on young princess Judi Meredith and tries one scheme with a giant to capture her and spirit her away to his evil enchanted island. He and confederate Walter Burke are foiled by a brave peasant lad named Jack who slays the giant. King Dayton Lummis makes Kerwin Matthews as Jack his daughter's protector and they have quite a few adventures before the happily ever after ending the fairy tale requires.It's still a pretty good family film and a nice bit of nostalgia for folks like me who were kids when it did come out.".

Assisting Jack on his bold quest are eager young boy Peter likable Roger Mobley hearty scruffy Viking Sigurd the solid Barry Kelley and cheerful helpful leprechaun Diablotin the Imp a winningly warm and witty portrayal by Don Beddoe. Director Nathan Juran who cowrote the smart script with Orville H.

Jim Danforth's skillful animation is unfortunately undercut by very poor puppets which were built outside his supervision and control. The first stopmotion sequence is the best with the dancing dwarf from the Princess' music box growing into a giant then absconding with her. I liked the clever way Jack coped with this monster using his wits and materials at hand strangling him with a rope bound to the millhouse wheel. Nice touch when the ogre's hand gets crushed by the millstone. Saw it as a kid of 7 or so originally and it scared me pretty good. Good acting by 7th Voyage of Sinbad veterans Kerwin Matthews as the hero Jack and Torin Thatcher as the evil mage Pendragon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Un Amour de Sorcire had been marketed worldwide with its English feature under the title of Witch Way Love that includes the same cut as the French version. Obviously each one of the actors have done their own voiceover dubbing. During the Autumn of 1998 while Alice Hoffman's novel adaptation film Practical Magic was at the theatres Witch Way Love was on the TV channels in response to that. Both Nicole Kidman and Vanessa Paradis having the kindred spirits had made people think they watch the same movie what they've seen on silverscreen.In my opinion Witch Way Love delivers a warmer welcome from a deeper fantasy world. Whereas Practical Magic was happening in the real world. Other than the great chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman the concept was a failure since it was an awful adaptation. Though Witch Way Love was its director's selfwritten production and whole actors here have offered a great commitment. Technically we're focused into an outstanding cinematography.The plot is about the endless rivalry between the good and the evil. Even though the good is weak is not alone. For the evil draws negativity distrust and bad reputation among the authorities of the fantasy worldlike the immortal wizard Merlin  the whole world comes together to assist the good against the villain. Vanessa Paradis as the goodhearted witch shares the leading role with Jean Reno playing her cousin Molokthe grim warlock.This film is one of Vanessa Paradis's career highlights. On the other hand Jean Reno didn't fit with the evil character for his mood was more likely to play within a duo in order to be funny and evil at once. The cast should have been planned better. Jean Reno needed a partner.Looking for a godfather for the last infant of their witch race MorganeVanessa Paradis came across with an adventurer who shares the same rising sign of the same zodiac sign and born on the same day and the same night with the same eclipse of the moon with the baby. So she reads the birthstone to cast a spell on the adventurer to have him as the godfather of the baby. But the spell has a side effect that she falls in love with the adventurer. There are so many coincidences or better to say serendipity almost every other scene for endless laughs. It's an excellent choice for a family movie.".

I believe that Un amour de sorcire is falling behind mostly because of the audience that have watched it and its comparison to the French cinema that surely has more to present that this movie. Vanessa Paradis and Jan Reno are exceptional as always. Jeanne Moreau is a pleasant breeze that keeps the film from diving too deep but she can only go that far. It could have been better but sometimes although the plot was interesting and original it seemed erratic and failed to fully deliver. It should be approached more like a TV movie that took you by surprise than anything else. It's more like a fairytale. Regarding the plot I have to admit that I liked it and still after all these years I find it sweet and rather intruding. If someone had to summarize it with some spoilers it would be about a witch a painting and a wish that resulted to a baby boy. I always liked to think that Mr. Firth was the prince of the painting as it is hinted at some point. Nonetheless I don't believe that this film would be a let down for the female audience. The young will enjoy the story while the mature ones will enjoy Jeanne Moreau the French countryside and the absence of euro. Concerning nudity it doesn't have much to concern you but the sex scene although not explicit is certainly not just a cuddle at an open field.".

	schema:headline " Probably not as gruesome as the real thing but gruesome enough.";
	schema:reviewBody "Matthew Hopkins was a self proclaimed Witchfinder who started his career in 1644 in Essex England. In a three year career he is estimated to have killed between 200 and 400 witches. The Witchfinder General The Conqueror Worm is a movie based on his success as a prosecutor of witches.Witchfinder General is an interesting movie in that it is part horror part melodrama part historical epic. Vincent Price has one of his finest and most effective roles ever as Matthew Hopkins in this 1968 British Classic. The movie was renamed The Conqueror Worm for U.S. audiences to try and take advantage of Price's fame from Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe inspired series of movies. Except for reading part of the poem The Conqueror Worm during the ending credits the movie has nothing to do with Poe.The basic story is common enough for this subgenre of horror movies There is an abusive official who accuses and prosecutes alleged witches for his own personal gain and personal power trips. There are two other fine British films from this time period that deal with the same subject matter The Devils by Kurt Russell and Mark of the Devil starring Herbert Lom. All three are well made and effective but Witchfinder General is the darkest of the bunch. The tortures are all brutal and unnerving to watch and there is a lot of screaming in this movie. Price plays Hopkins as overbearing and cold bloodedly cruel. He allows a woman to submit to him sexually to prevent someone from being killed then tortures and murders the guy anyway and then later has her tortured and murdered for being a witch. What a guy!The director of this movie was the young and upcoming Michael Reeves who unfortunately committed suicide in 1969 not long after this movie was released. There was a well known feud of sorts between Reeves and the star Vincent Price. At one point Price is reputed to have said to the 25 year old director I have made over 70 films what have you done? with a reply from Reeves I have made three good ones. Perhaps the tension between director and star helped to make this the dark and humorless film that it is. Even 34 years after it's release it still holds up as a beautifully made movie that hardly looks of feels dated at all. The period movies that Price was making with Roger Corman a few years before this film was made while still excellent in many respects are obviously a product of the 60's.Unfortunately this movie has not been released in the U.S. on dvd. There is a British release that includes a documentary on Michael Reeves but for now in America all we have is the MGM midnight movie video release. This film also appears on AMC now and again and in fact I just watched it on that channel yesterday.".

	onyx:emotionText "Matthew Hopkins was a self proclaimed Witchfinder who started his career in 1644 in Essex England. In a three year career he is estimated to have killed between 200 and 400 witches. The Witchfinder General The Conqueror Worm is a movie based on his success as a prosecutor of witches.Witchfinder General is an interesting movie in that it is part horror part melodrama part historical epic. Vincent Price has one of his finest and most effective roles ever as Matthew Hopkins in this 1968 British Classic. The movie was renamed The Conqueror Worm for U.S. audiences to try and take advantage of Price's fame from Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe inspired series of movies. Except for reading part of the poem The Conqueror Worm during the ending credits the movie has nothing to do with Poe.The basic story is common enough for this subgenre of horror movies There is an abusive official who accuses and prosecutes alleged witches for his own personal gain and personal power trips. There are two other fine British films from this time period that deal with the same subject matter The Devils by Kurt Russell and Mark of the Devil starring Herbert Lom. All three are well made and effective but Witchfinder General is the darkest of the bunch. The tortures are all brutal and unnerving to watch and there is a lot of screaming in this movie. Price plays Hopkins as overbearing and cold bloodedly cruel. He allows a woman to submit to him sexually to prevent someone from being killed then tortures and murders the guy anyway and then later has her tortured and murdered for being a witch. What a guy!The director of this movie was the young and upcoming Michael Reeves who unfortunately committed suicide in 1969 not long after this movie was released.

This film still manages to induce general feelings of horror on account of its violence even though it is not really a 'horror' film as such. Watch it for its superb cinematography which lends it an appearance of freshness that belies its 35 years. It still looks as if it could have been made yesterday. Some of the more violent scenes will make you squirm. The cruelty of the period portrayed can only be imagined and the cheapness of life comes across as truly shocking. Vincent Price is excellent as Hopkins though maybe a bit 'mature' to portray him since he was witchfinding in his late twenties and died in his early thirties. To think that this evil man really existed and operated unchecked for several years leaves one cold. A minor masterpiece that all lovers of the macabre should enjoy.".

The version I watched was the restored uncut one and while I thought the film had one or two slight flaws mainly with the script it is very very good. This was the third and final movie directed by Michael Reeves who sadly died of a drug overdose a year after it was released while still in his mid twenties. 'Witchfinder General' certainly shows a lot of promise and is very well made on what I imagine was a fairly modest budget. Many describe it as a horror movie but I think thriller is a more apt term. While it has some brutal and violent moments and it does concern witches there is no supernatural theme. It is similar in many ways to the underrated 'Mark Of The Devil' and Jess Franco's disappointing 'The Bloody Judge' two movies released after this one and undoubtedly influenced by it. Horror legend Vincent Price clashed with Reeves on set with the latter telling him not to ham it up. Price took offence at this but obviously heeded the advice and his performance here is arguably the best of his career. Price is brilliant throughout and the supporting cast are all pretty good especially Reeves regular Ian Ogilvy and Robert Russell as Price's surly assistant and there's a good cameo from Patrick Wymark 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as Cromwell. 'Witchfinder General' is a very good film which deserves to be seen by a wider audience and Michael Reeves death is a tragedy for all movie lovers.".

	schema:headline " The Charismatic Face of Evil";
	schema:reviewBody "The WitchfinderGeneral of the title is Matthew Hopkins a reallife individual who during the English Civil War of the 1640s was responsible for around twenty people being hanged as witches. Most had been forced to confess under torture. Although Hopkins was not as he claimed officially appointed to that position by Parliament it is no coincidence that his activities took place in East Anglia the most firmly Parliamentarian area of England. It is one of the ironies of history that the supposedly modern democratic Parliamentarians were more likely to have a superstitious belief in witchcraft than were the supposedly more reactionary Royalists.The film presents a fictionalised account of Hopkins's career and takes some liberties with historical accuracy. The real Hopkins was only in his twenties at the time of these events much younger than the middleaged character portrayed by Vincent Price. He did not meet a violent end but died of natural causes. His victims were all hanged contrary to what is shown here death by burning was not used as a punishment for witchcraft in England. Apart from Hopkins the main character is Richard Marshall an officer in Cromwell's army. He becomes involved when Hopkins arrests John Lowes the vicar of Brandeston Suffolk and the uncle of Marshall's sweetheart Sara. Lowes is tortured to make him confess but Hopkins promises to spare his life in exchange for sexual favours from Sara. Having obtained what he wants Hopkins continues to torture Lowes and eventually has him executed. Marshall vows revenge on Hopkins and his sadistic assistant John Stearne. Lowes and Stearne were both historical figures Marshall and Sara are fictitious.When the film was released in America it was renamed The Conqueror Worm after the poem by Edgar Allen Poe. Although it has very little to do with that poem this was done in order to suggest a connection with Roger Corman's cycle of films based on Poe's works most of which also starred Price. Although WitchfinderGeneral does not form part of that cycle it does have something in common with Corman's last Poe film The Tomb of Ligeia. Both films were shot on location in East Anglia and both make effective contrast between gloomy indoor scenes and shots of verdant English countryside. In WitchfinderGeneral the indoor scenes have a chiaroscuro feel with dramatic contrasts of light and shadow. The outdoor scenes were shot in autumn and although beautiful the autumnal colours add to the film's melancholy air.There are also similarities with two films from the early seventies Ken Russell's The Devils and Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man. Russell is said to have disliked WitchfinderGeneral so there was presumably no conscious influence but it is noteworthy that both films have a seventeenthcentury setting both were controversial because of graphic depictions of torture and execution and both are about the misuse of religion for political or personal ends. The real Hopkins may have been a fanatic who sincerely believed in the reality of witchcraft. The character portrayed by Price is a hypocrite who has taken up a career in witchfinding out of financial and sexual motives he is wellpaid for his services and his position gives him numerous opportunities for blackmailing women.Many horror films such as the majority of entries in the Hammer series ask the viewer to accept that evil supernatural forces are real. WitchfinderGeneral and The Wicker Man have many differences the latter for instance has a contemporary setting but both reject this position. In Michael Reeves's film as in Hardy's what is to be feared is not the supernatural but superstition not witches ghosts or demons but irrational beliefs which lead people to commit violent acts. The two films have been bracketed together as the only two intelligent British horror films they are certainly the two most prominent rationalist British horror films.WitchfinderGeneral was one of a number of British films from this period which could treat violent themes in a more explicit way thanks to the gradual relaxation of censorship in the sixties but this trend was not universally welcomed and the film aroused much controversy when it first came out. Some hailed it as a masterpiece which confirmed the promise Reeves had shown with his previous film The Sorcerers. Others most notably Alan Bennett in The Listener the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen condemned it for what they saw as excessive even offensive levels of violence. Today we are more used to violence in the cinema than we were forty years ago but some of the scenes depicted here still retain their power to shock. That of course was Reeves's intention to shock us into thinking about the roots of violence. Bennett who can at times be a perceptive writer seems to have been particularly obtuse about this film. The events it depicts are sadistic and morally rotten. That does not mean that the film itself is.The film is today often claimed as a classic of the British cinema although I often feel that this may have as much to do with the tragedy of Reeves's death from an overdose the following year as it does with its intrinsic merits. Much of the film's success is due to Vincent Price and Reeves can take little credit for this. He wanted to cast Donald Pleasence as Hopkins but was overruled by the film's American backers who wanted a more established star. Reeves and Price took a strong dislike to one another and there are many stories about their clashes on set. Nevertheless Price gives an excellent performance as a man who like Hitler is evil and yet nevertheless commanding authoritative and charismatic. This film despite its historic setting can also be seen as a comment on the politics of the twentieth century and still remains relevant in the twentyfirst. 710".

How the man's demise occurs seems irrelevant really as we are treated to an exceptionally extreme portrayal of an individual gone absolutely insane with power courtesy of horror legend Vincent Price. As has been mentioned Price could be a worry for such a serious role his usually tongue in cheek and knowingly camp performances were the things of legend in Bmovies yet here he takes on a persona which is absolutely bafflingly disturbing. The other actors simply hold on for dear life as Price literally bribes the stage then has sex with it before setting fire to it  absolutely stunningly powerful acting that I believe has rarely been bettered.In a way his performance as Hopkins when compared with some of his other notable roles such as Henry Jarrod in House of Wax  the camp and stagey villain mirrors the real life black and white psychology of man here Price is in seriously disturbed mode a foul villainous man who oozes menace malice and distaste for the stupid mortals he often finds himself rubbing shoulders with.To say that 'Witchfinder' is a horror film in the conventional sense 'a scary or malevolent force that must be overcome' would be accurate but it would be doing it a wild disservice just as saying 'Don't Look Now' is a film about a child dying that 'The Wickerman' is a film about crazy pagans and so on Witchfinder General is absolutely not a film about witches nor is it really a film about witchtrials descriptions like this undersell the film entirely. Witchfinder General is essentially a story that could be recreated anywhere the trenches of World War One in a Dynasty in China even in the Wild West  it just so happens that the land of dark ages Britain lends itself perfectly to the influence and utter insanity of the witch trials and the hysteria that surrounded them.Witchfinder General has been bundled in with other British horror films of the late 60's and early 70's for sheer convenience sake films like 'Wickerman' who it conveniently sits next to in my DVD collection! and 'Blood On Satan's Claw' all being billed as similar films yet in all honesty those two pictures would not exist let alone the serious British film industry as we today know it were it not for a film like 'Witchfinder General'. It completely threw open the doors for what horror could be remember up until the 70's it was a jumpy if not forgettable and often quite silly fare  as in some of the excellent Hammer pictures a shatteringly powerful psychological examination of the darkest recesses of the human psyche and though the ending is predictable deserved and utterly justifiable there is no doubt that my last point is proved sublimely by said provocative finale.See Witchfinder General now see a formerly joke actor reinvent his career in a staggering fashion see the most malevolent and evil human being ever committed to celluloid see the insanity of five hundred years ago or even just stay for the beautiful British country side all the while beset by the disgusting characters who have soiled and destroyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "England the 1600s. The country is torn apart by civil war and bloodshed has become commonplace. Matthew Hopkins Vincent Price rides from village to village torturing accused witches until they confess. In a medieval era of warring armies and naive peasants Hopkins makes a lucrative living from others' misery. His judicial system is particularly gruesome the accused are dropped in the river  if they drown they are innocent if they float then they are witches and must be hanged. At first it is difficult to accept that such barbarism could exist in human society but even more frightening is the realisation that civilisation hasn't really progressed all that much since then consider the AfricanAmerican lynchings in the American South which continued well into the 1960s. Michael Reeves' 'Witchfinder General 1968' is a horror film of the highest order stripped of titillating thrills and left to wallow in the vulgarity of human nature. For U.S. release the film was retitled The Conqueror Worm to capitalise on Price's fruitful association with Roger Corman's Poe adaptations.'Witchfinder General 1968' was gleefully advertised as The Year's Most Violent Film! and that doesn't seem far off the mark. However despite depicting in gruelling detail the torture and execution of innocent victims the film isn't exploitative  Reeves does not revel in bloodshed as does the sadistic thug John Stearne Robert Russell but damningly condemns it. On its original release many critics were disgusted with the film's content much as they had been years earlier by Michael Powell's lurid psychothriller 'Peeping Tom 1960.' Fortunately the film does boast the everreliable presence of horror maestro Vincent Price who manages to keep the film feeling respectable. Proving his versatility as an actor Price's performance is surprisingly understated perhaps he felt that the subject matter was already macabre enough without the need for his own unique vocal flourishes. Indeed far from being frightening Matthew Hopkins comes across as little more than a methodical businessman his moral quandaries not necessarily absent but merely set aside to make room for his wages.Perhaps the critics' rejection of 'Witchfinder General' has something to do with the accusatory manner in which Reeves frames the violence capturing the executions not from a moral highhorse but as one of the curious spectators who circles around to gawk at the morbid spectacle of murder. Reeves focuses on the faces of the onlookers which boast an uncomfortable mingling of sadness and fascination. Matthew Hopkins is an opportunist making a living but these are the people who allow and even facilitate the brutal torture of their neighbours. In this way 'Witchfinder General' describes a crucial facet of human behaviour how war and conflict can erode the morals of society. Hopkins' career as a witchhunter thrived during the English Civil War 16411651 which saw the Parliamentarians and Royalists grapple for ruling power and left citizens with tattered notions of moral rectitude. It's telling that above all the scenes of bloodied violence the film's most harrowing moment for me was when a villager witnesses a woman being raped and simply turns his back.".

Home from service briefly Marshall stays with a priest and his wifetobe Sarah Lowes but soon heads off. On his way out of the area he meets lawyer Matthew Hopkins who has been called in by locals to help with some matters. Thinking nothing Marshall rides on having directed Hopkins correctly but only later he learns that Hopkins is more a witchhunter than a lawyer and that the very devil that he has gone to town to unmask is none other than Lowes.Although I was familiar with the title I had neither heard anything good or bad about this film or ever managed to see it myself. With a recent screening on late night television in the UK I decided to give it a twirl and found much to like from the very opening credits where a hung woman gives way to a title credits sequence of wonderfully captured faces in various states of pain andor terror. The imaginative air to these visuals continues even as the film settles down to deliver the story and the whole affair has a great colour and hue to it using some visual effects to improve some shots. Reeves who at 23 probably never expected this to be his last film uses the English countryside to great effect and summons up a great sense of period as well as contrasting it powerfully with the fear and violence of Hopkins' deeds.The plot threatens to be a poor device to show this history in gory detail but generally it works well enough because it makes the characters and the actions as important as the specific story involving Marshall. This moves along well but generally it is Hopkins and his quest that holds the interest because it is essentially evil and cruel  factors that the film brings out very well while observing the slight touch of glee from Hopkins that accompanies the cruel deaths. This is greatly helped by a superbly cruel turn from Price who dominates the film and makes his scenes the best. Ogilvy has a lesser role but is still very good despite not having the material given to Price. Support from Russell Heath and others is mostly good apart from one or two bum notes in small areas  the victims are convincing which was important to make the horrors convincing.Overall an impacting little film that has a basic plot but greatly benefits from the cruelty of the piece strong direction and good performances led by a great Price. Dated a touch but still quite shocking interesting and worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the world of '60s British horror cinema few films were as gritty downbeat disturbing or downright violent not to mention meanspirited as this one. In fact none were. WITCHFINDER GENERAL is a landmark in the history of cinema and along with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD it helped to usher in the new wave of ultraviolent '70s gore films where a happy ending could no longer be guaranteed. It's a brilliant film but also a depressing one to watch nobody will come out of this with smiles on their faces unless they're sociopaths instead a feeling of cold sickness your mileage may vary similar to the gut punch of THE EXORCIST. I love this movie because of the way it paints the English countryside an idyllic and beautiful rural landscape packed with lush foliage and picturesque villages accompanied by the famously lyrical 'Greensleeves' type music. Yet into this Eden comes death painful protracted death. It's a film which focuses on death. Death by drowning burning hanging. and many other varieties.One of life's ironies is that director Michael Reeves himself died after the production of this his last film. His career had been interesting but shortlived but at least this and THE SORCERERS are worth seeing. Vincent Price dominates the cast as the coldhearted Matthew a man you hate yet also one of his more human portrayals of a monster there's no overacting here just a realistic persona of a man without a conscience and out for his own ends. Supporting him are the gleefully sadistic John believed to be a woman in historical stories who enjoys 'pricking witches' and beats a fair number of people to watch. Hilary Dwyer is the damselindistress who undergoes rape and torture and screams her head off Ian Ogilvy is surprisingly deep as the Roundhead who finds himself pushed over the edge by the murderous antics. There's just enough time for Patrick Wymark to show a convincing cameo as Cromwell himself and Rupert Davies to undergo sadism as a priest accused of conspiring with devils.Comment has been made that the structure of this film is similar to the classic revenge western with Ogilvy riding through a rugged and wild landscape in search of his wife's abuser. That may be so but the film is still unpredictable throughout right down to the manic climax. It's an affecting piece of work that rewards close viewing and which still packs the same impact today as it did thirty years ago. Horror fans should buy immediately. Oh and watch out for a cameo from Steptoe himself Wilford Brambell!".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1645 against a backdrop of bloody civil war Matthew Hopkins is a selfappointed lawyer bringing trumpedup cases against those accused of witchcraft and pocketing hefty commissions for his socalled work. Can anybody stop this cruel murderer hiding under the pretence of law ?Watching Witchfinder General is not a pleasant experience but it is a very good film. As a straight depiction of the ignorance brutality and debauchery of the late Middle Ages it is a powerful statement. As a bloody horror film it has dozens of scary and disturbing scenes. At the same time it's strangely beautiful Paul Ferris' lovely score counterpoints the horrible moments and John Coquillon's exceptional photography recalls the period paintings of Rembrandt or Vermeer. Reeves eschews any comic moments or unrealistic moralising focusing purely on trying to recreate the period accurately in his effective hybrid of revenger's tragedy and historical drama. Everyone is bad the authorities are all corrupt the common people are stupid sheep women are chattels to be abused at will and merely staying alive is the only goal in life. Price is magnificently horrible and sinister in one of his most effective performances. Because of its tone and relentless violence the film suffered greatly at the hands of the UK censor had it been made just a few years later it would probably have survived better although the TV print I just watched is a lovingly restored widescreen cut with all the vicious scenes tenderly spliced back in. The most astonishing thing about the movie however is that the talented Reeves was only twentyfour when he made it an unheard of feat in the British film industry at the time. It was his third film the other two are La Sorella Di Satana  The Sister Of Satan and The Sorcerers both also starring Ogilvy and tragically he died of a probably accidental barbiturate overdose in 1969. What could this great young filmmaker have achieved had he lived ? Based on a historical novel by Ronald Bassett Hopkins and Stearne were both real people who wrote accounts of their work and retitled The Conqueror Worm in the US an odd reference to a poem which appears in Edgar Allan Poe's short story Ligeia presumably to try and link it to the CormanPrice Poe series. A great first date movie and good to watch as a double bill history lesson with The Elephant Man.".

The most astonishing thing about the movie however is that the talented Reeves was only twentyfour when he made it an unheard of feat in the British film industry at the time. It was his third film the other two are La Sorella Di Satana  The Sister Of Satan and The Sorcerers both also starring Ogilvy and tragically he died of a probably accidental barbiturate overdose in 1969. What could this great young filmmaker have achieved had he lived ? Based on a historical novel by Ronald Bassett Hopkins and Stearne were both real people who wrote accounts of their work and retitled The Conqueror Worm in the US an odd reference to a poem which appears in Edgar Allan Poe's short story Ligeia presumably to try and link it to the CormanPrice Poe series. A great first date movie and good to watch as a double bill history lesson with The Elephant Man.";

	schema:reviewBody "It took me 35 years to track down a good print of this film. I saw it on the Friday night horror show when I was about 10 years old in the 70's and many of the scenes were so shocking that I was just about traumatized for life. After all this time the movie still possesses the power to hold the viewer in a state of uncomfortable almost nauseous horror.The horror is not just over individual instances of cruelty and bloodshed but of the endless injustice and lust for violence that seems bred into the human race. This I feel is how young director Michael Reeves really saw the world...this is the despair that he felt given life on the screen. Is it any wonder he overdosed on sleeping pills shortly after the movie's release?His death was certainly a tragedy because Conqueror Worm is the work of a master director whose control of image dialog and nuance were clearly visible and just starting to come into bloom. Despite the total bleakness of the movie there is still a beauty to it...the English countryside has rarely looked more appealing. In the midst of this pastoral vista unfolds a tale of hellish corruption and utter madness.The film grips you from the opening scene of a witch being hung. It is portrayed with no sentiment no sign of Hollywood fiction...it is a scene of utter brutality. The screams of the condemned witch are chilling and perhaps it can be said that no movie revolves around the agonized screams and groans of people in torment more than The Conqueror Worm. This stark almost cinema verite portrayal of physical violence and evil gives the movie unbelievable power and force. When John StearneRobert Russell terrific as a completely barbaric thug thrusts needles into the backs of his victims the camera neither shrinks back or zooms in on the wounds. When Stearne himself digs a musket ball from his arm with a knife his own scream is one of the movie's most chilling. As Matthew Hopkins Vincent Price is brilliantly cast. His sinister intellect and commanding presence shine through in every scene. Price knew when he could camp up a role...here he wisely decides to deliver a cold measured performance. Hopkins is a reptile a twolegged snake. He's one of those vile opportunists who takes advantage of ignorance and moral chaos to satisfy his own desires. His kind has plagued mankind since the beginning...and will continue to do so until the end of time.Where does the real horror come from in The Conqueror Worm? I believe it comes from the way that the best and most decent characters are destroyed by the evil roaming Reformation England. The kind Catholic priest John Lowes the one true Christian character of the movie who detests violence and war is tortured humiliated and hung by the neck. The handsome and proud soldier Richard Marshall very well played by Ian Ogilvyis reduced to a raging maniac by the unchecked malevolence of everything he has seen. The final scene of the film is his wife Sarah's scream of complete despair. She screams not because of her own torture or the bloody carnage around her but because she knows Richard is now a ruined man totally unlike the one she fell in love with. That is the real triumph of evil even though Hopkins and Stearne lie dying on the dungeon floor.Is there any decency at all in the world of The Conqueror Worm? Not much but Marshall's soldier friend Robert shows that he has not lost compassion. As Hopkins lies hacked to pieces and writhing on the floor Robert deliver mercy to the Witchfinder by putting him out of his misery. Which only leads to more horror as the crazed Marshall yells You took him from me! Don't look for humor hope or relief here. This is the darkest of films transcending the horror genre and yet encapsulating everything that makes it compelling at the same time. This is one of the strongest films that you will ever see.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who have read myadmittedly drunk review of 'The Dark Knight' it comes out fairly clearly that I take offense when people dismiss the cultfollowings that occasionally build up among those who died young. Now I generally agree that a person should not have his mediocre efforts automatically boosted to classic status because of his death but it irks me when the deceased individual in question was one of true talent James Dean Heath Ledger and many others. To that list you can add Michael Reeves a director who turned out quite possibly the best historical horror film ever made and undeniably the best film to come from Hammer  Amicus wannabe Tigon studios. This is his masterpiece and his final film.The film tells the story of Cromwellian soldier Richard MarshallIan Ogilvy who finds an idyllic life awaiting him when he returns to his fiance SaraThe absolutely gorgeous Hilary Dwyerand her kindly priest uncle John LowesRupert Davies playing essentially the same role as he did in 'Dracula Has Risen from the Grave'. Unfortunately ill winds bring bad tidings when insane Witchhunter Matthew HopkinsVincent Price and his sadistic sidekick ride into town when Richard marches off. Someone has accused Lowes of witchcraft and it becomes clear that in spite of his false private attempts to appear staunch and undemanding of rewards that Hopkins is really a sadistic maniac who is merely doing what he does for profit and to coerce women to have sex with him in return for their freedom. After repeatedly having sex with an initially willing Sara Hopkins has her uncle killed anyway and his assistant rapes her. When Richard finds out he embarks on a quest for vengeance where he will stop at absolutely nothing even if it means killing civilians and disobeying even the stern but kindly General CromwellPatrick Wymark.The acting is superb from all involved and Reeve's inventive methods of cutting from scene to sceneSpecifically a shot of the crashing waves which then switch to a roaring fire are nothing short of remarkable. And despite these touches the film is shot with a naturalistic feel instead of the hued fairytale feel that Mario Bava Freddie Francis and Terrence Fisher would probably have included which makes the film feel all the more real and all the more emotionally affecting. It may take place in postMedieval England but this is no fairytale. The inversion of traditional religious imagery such as when the falsely accused 'witches' are led to their doom on a road that from an aerial POV looks like a crucifix is wonderfully subversive and ironic. Also remarkable is that when at the climax when the supposed 'Men of the lord' are torturing Sara it looks indistinguishable from a stereotypical Satanic sacrifice you'd see in a Chick tract.Still there are several flaws the film's credits go out of their way to emphasize that the events and all characters are fictitious yet Matthew Hopkins  Oliver Cromwell really lived. The story in this film may be fiction but Hopkins undeniably existed and this is not a small gripe for Hopkins is not a small supporting character like Liszt in the '43 'Phantom of the Opera' but the main villain. Also bizarre is how Reeves seems to go out of his way to make Richard's brutal vengeance on Hopkins with an ax out to be the most vile act in the film even though we have seen innocent old men  women slaughtered and women raped by the villains. I can understand wanting to emphasize that the pursuit of vengeance is not to be glamorized but thisAlong with Richard's attack on an Inkeeper seem less to be a major theme and more of a tacked on antimilitary message that goes nowhere since the main theme is exposing the hypocrisy of religious nutjobs like Hopkins it also jibes poorly with multiple scenes where Hopkin's enemies shout that god will see he is punished. It may be comparatively wellwoven into the plot than most tacked on liberal messages but it's tacked on nonetheless. Hacking a man up with an ax may not be heroic behavior but it still pales next to Hopkins's crimes and attempting to make his punishment look anything less than deserved just negates the entire message so far it lamentably causes me to take away one star when it could have been a 10. It's also unlikely that a priest who objects to a soldier simply doing his job would casually approve of premarital sex in this era but maybe it was that attitude that got Lowes accused in the first place. The beginning is also laughably staged.Inspite of those flaws Reeves crafted a masterpiece. His death was a true loss in spite of his reputed onset tyranny. Who knows? With such an attitude he could have become the Stanley Kubrick of the horror genre.Goodbye Reeves. Hopefully this film will inspire new generations to be wary of the current Matthew HopkinsFred Phelps Michael Moore this world has to offer. Beware! Wherever ignorance and closedmindedness exists to be exploited Hopkins still rides out there in the night may we do our best to avoid him and his kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Witchfinder General1968 is an intellegent thoughtful human study of power in a powerless time.  Intellectual horror that plays on the emotional intensity of its characters and the brutality they are capable of achieving.  Pinnalce of British horror which behind The Wicker Man1974 is one of the best British horror pics ever.  With an evil villain in form of Matthew Hopkins who carries around a darkly intellectual karma amid towns of superstitious people.  Effective in showing an aura of brutal evil brought on by designs for power superstition and civil war.Responsible in bringing forth a new subgenre which dealt with the brutal violence religious hypocrisies and sexual debacheries of Middle age Europe particularly the inquisition age.  Witchfinder General1968 deals with its inquisition subject in a forceful and psychological insightful manner.  Later films of subgenre would rely heavily on human eroticism and sadistic violence.  The best of this subgenre besides Witchfinder General1968 are Beatrice Cenci1969 and The Bloody Judge1969.  The former shares a tragic quality with WG while the latter is a portrait of intellectual evil.Rare occasion where Vincent Price plays someone in a film without any camp or humor value.  All the more scary because of Price's ability to balance between dry charm and cold blooded ruthlessness.  Nothing he does in Witchfinder General1968 is darkly comical like roles for Abominable Dr.Phibes1972 or Theatre of Blood1967.  Closer to his portrayal of Prince Prospero in Roger Corman's Masque of the Red Death1964 who shares similar qualities with Matthew Hopkins.  Results in Vincent Price's finest performance and maximizes his acting talent to highest level.Hopkins was the product of a system where anything away from the norm political or religious wise were causes for condemnation as a witch. Powerful display on the chaotic effects war has on a country against itself. Director Michael Reeves depicts a situation when justice and law are performed by those who prey on the weak and the powerless for personal gain. English Civil War lended to Hopkins having a type of power due to lack of a semblence of order.  Interesting how horrible human acts are at their worst during times of chaos and war.Matthew Hopkins was not the only known witchfinder general of his time but is one of the most infamous and notorious of the witchfinders in that era. Very little is known about his life except for his days as a witchfinder which makes him into an enigmatic figure shrouded in mystery.  Hopkins in his day was the equivalent of a bounty hunter in era of American Wild West. What I find fascinating about Hopkins are the different sources concerning his death with one implying by natural causes and another by execution as a witch.  Price plays Hopkins with a chilling and cold hearted demeanor that only he could pull off in convincing fashion.Judging by the effectiveness in film's direction and execution Michael Reeves might have turned out to be one of British horror's best had he lived a little longer.  He is the James Dean of film directors due to amount of excellence done in so little a time.  Reeves shows his skills off in developing characters who are not plain good or evil but people who are capable of both.  One style for whom Reeves is akin to is Lucio Fulci from his late 60searly 70s period with similar themes of social consciousness. Scenes of horror are honestly and powerfully depicted by Reeves.The fabulous cinematography of this film must have made an impression on Sam Peckinpah when he hired John Coquillon to do the cinematography for Straw Dogs1971.  In fact there are many moments which I feel influenced the ideas on the primal side of human being for Straw Dogs1971.  One some of the characterizations of the film's hero would creep up a little into the personality of Dustin Hoffman's math professor.  Two the brooding and fercious mood of the cinematography here is also apparent in Straw Dogs1971.  The cinematography of this film is one of many aspects that gives it a powerhouse emotion.Its American title is called Conqueror Worm even though it has nothing to do with the excellent Edgar Allen Poe poem.  Donald Pleasence was the director's choice for Matthew Hopkins but was declined by AIP in favor of the more marketable Vincent Price.  Although Pleasence might have been good in the role Price brings certain qualities as Matthew Hopkins that Pleasence might not have been able to give.  The relationship between Priceactor and Reevesdirector was one that was a lovehate one. Acting is very good with Price leading the way to give a brilliant performance.Film's erotic elements are a mixture of the implicit and slightly explicit. Story's revenge angle ends with some kind of consequence for the main chracters involved.  Robert Russell does a good job in playing Hopkin's assistent as sleezy and sadistic.  The strong and dry acting of Vincent Price was inspired by his frustations with the director about his role.  A non Corman AIP classic that is deserving of a Special Edition DVD release.The final scene packs a big punch with emotional and psychological intensity.  Disturbing and mind shattering scene which hasn't lost its ability to distress the psyche.  The screams of Sara are enough to stay in one's memory following the sight of the last credit at the end of the film. Reminds me in a way of the final frame of Dario Argento's Tenebre1982 where the main heroine is seen screaming against a backdrop of death and horror.  A moment when none of the main characters come unscratched and ends up with some psychological scar which will affect for the rest of a lifetime.".

Watching it today I'm slightly puzzled as to what peoples problems were at the time but then I thought about it . In 1968 no one had seen the gory video nasties from the 1980s and Vincent Price was best known for starring in rather camp horror B movies  so I guess you'd have to live in the context of 1968 to understand the controversy There's another thing and that is it's always billed as a horror film when broadcast on television but was WITCHFINDER GENERAL originally marketed as a horror film in 1968 ? Stylewise it is similar to a Hammer horror  The cast are composed of familiar television faces  there's day for night filming  the budget is rather similar to a Hammer movie at the time etc but is it meant to be a bio pic ? was it originally intended as a historical drama ? Unfortunately this where the movie fails because there's not much in the way of historical truth  Matthew Hopkins did indeed exist  he wasn't a mythical figure he was a cynical murdering mercenary who condemned people as witches in order to make a load of money but he didn't meet his fate as shown here . It's believed he emigrated to America when the resentment in England got too much for him and carried on torturing suspects There are a couple of good aspects to the movie . First of all Vincent Price gives what is regarded as his best performance and it is fairly impressive though he could have played the role in an even more cynical manner and parts of the script do pick up on the ridiculous trials of the time such as if a suspect is thrown into a river and drowns they're not a witch ! But even if you watch the restored version  That's the version where the picture quality drops during violent scenes  you still find yourself asking why it was so controversial in 1968".

Even here in the USA.The setting is Great Britain of the civil war era with Roundheads and Cavaliers battling for control. The Roundheads being Puritans were the ones doing the inquisiting there and Price is only a person too glad to offer his services.In fact in every society when one wants an orthodoxy enforced there are always people psychologically deranged enough for such work. Price works with a partner in Robert Russell who's a little bit more honest about the fact he's a sadist. He grates on Price a bit but the two find a lot of mutual satisfaction.A lot of the same themes can be found in the Tyrone Power classic Captain From Castile only it's the Catholics enforcing their doctrine in that one.Here Price in his work debauches the girlfriend of Roundhead soldier Ian Ogilvy and when he finds out he becomes a man with a mission.Witchfinder General is a study in sadism and with an eternal message about the mind of humankind being unshackled. Delivered with a really special performance by Vincent Price.".

The story actually has little to do with Poe except for a bit of narration at the beginning and end which I understand didn't exist in the original British version. Naming it The Conqueror Worm was also another play toward this being thought of as part of the series. If you would like to see Vincent Price NOT hamming it up for once playing it pretty straightforward in fact this is worth watching. The role is based in a historical figure in Cromwell's Britain but considerable license is taken with the story. The story might leave you feeling a little strange the ending is a downer even though the good guys win. The fact that the Director died of a possible suicideoverdose soon after has certainly added to it's cult status. There are no scares in the movie to really qualify it as a Horror film but I will recommend it as one based on subject matter and plain weirdness.".

	schema:reviewBody "With civil war raging across England a man like Matthew Hopkins Vincent Price finds it easy to take advantage of the situation for his own personal gain. He plays on the fears superstitions and jealousies of the locals as they take turns accusing each other of being witches. And if they don't confess Hopkins gives them to his sadistic enforcer John Steame Robert Russell to beat it out of them. When Hopkins sets his sights on a priest named John Lowes Rupert Davies and his niece Hilary Heath he unwittingly seals his fate. The girl's fianc Richard Marshall Ian Ogilvy will stop at nothing to get his revenge.Vincent Price gave many nice performances during his career but his portrayal of Matthew Hopkins in Witchfinder General may have been his finest. Price's Hopkins is a very interesting multilayered character. While he has absolutely no qualms about unnecessarily punishing and torturing people he doesn't do the dirty work himself. I love the bit where he has the suspected witches thrown into the river with their hands and feet bound. If they float it must be the devil protecting them. They will be taken from the water and burned. If they sink and die oh well sorry  they must have been innocent. It's certainly a callous view of life that was so wonderfully lampooned in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Hopkins doesn't care about rooting out evil. His objective is the silver he receives when it's all over. He is a cowardly man selling out those closest to him to save his own skin. And he is quite at ease with granting favors and requests in exchange for sex. One has to wonder if Matthew Hopkins ever believed in God and Satan and witchcraft. Or as I suspect did he see it all as an opportunity to line his pockets. Price brings all this to the role. It's an outstanding performance of a multifaceted character. As I said it might just be Price's best.The supporting cast is just as good. Russell Heath Ogilvy and Davis are all magnificent. I was especially impressed with Russell. It's easy to forget you're watching an actor and start to believe you're watching a man who enjoys torturing people. The beating he gives Davies is particular nasty. It would be difficult to play a sadistic bastard any better than Russell does in Witchfinder General.It's a real shame the Michael Reeves didn't live longer than he did. After watching Witchfinder General last night I read the Reeves would have helmed The Oblong Box as his next project. Man would that have been interesting! Reeves brought the necessary realism to Witchfinder General. His film has atmosphere and is rough and brutal. The locations are obviously authentic and the set are appropriately sparse. And the film has a gritty look appropriate for the time period. Slick looking digital effects like we see today just wouldn't work in a movie like this. It's obvious that he was working with a very small budget yet I cannot imagine the film looking much better well the blood might not have been such a bright coral color had he had three time the money.My only real complaint with the movie is with the main female character Sarah Lowes. I realize that she faces unspeakable torture at the hands of Matthew Hopkins' cronies but she bends to his will just a bit too easily. She seems more anxious than Hopkins to jump into the sack if it means saving her own skin. I would have liked to have seen her at least make an attempt to stay true to her fianc. It just didn't fit what I would have expected from the character.Overall Witchfinder General is a real classic of the horror genre. Any selfrespecting fan owes it to himself to check it out. I'm so happy to finally have this on DVD. It's one I'll revisit time after time for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best Krimi films are based on a novel by English crime writer Edgar Wallace and directed by prolific German director Alfred Vohrer and Der Hexer boasts the inclusion of both. Thanks to a thrilling narrative and some interesting lead characters  this film is clearly one of the best of the genre. Der Hexer roughly translates into English as 'The Magician' and the title alludes to the central character  a highly cunning criminal with the ability to baffle police through the use of trickery and disguises. The film begins with the murder of a young girl whom we later discover is the sister of the aforementioned master criminal. When this comes to the attention of the police naturally they expect 'The Magician' to return to London for revenge and so begin an investigation in order to catch the criminal. The Magician is indeed plotting to kill off those responsible for the death of his sister and comes to London with this agenda facing the murderers themselves and the best detectives of Scotland Yard.What really makes this film great is the plot line which is as cunning and clever as the lead character. Alfred Vohrer deftly handles the story which is streamlined and features no filler and ensures that the film is exciting and interesting at all times. There are several twists and turns throughout the plot the mostly unseen lead character providing most of the entertainment and the film never dries up or becomes boring. As is usually the case the story takes place in London and the director does well at establishing the atmosphere of the city which bodes well with the plot line. The plot works in such a way that eventually everyone comes under suspicion of being the murderer and this helps a lot when it comes to generating the suspense. Naturally all these twists and turns need a good twisted ending to wrap everything up and Der Hexer certainly does not disappoint in that respect. The ending is very well done and provides some surprises. Overall this is an excellent entry in the Krimi genre and comes recommended.".

It's a movie made purely for entertainment and it's being a quite silly one with its story and somewhat quirky characters just like a James Bond movie.But the series of movies based on the Edgar Wallace novels definitely have some better movies to offer than this one. This isn't really the most exciting watch and at times I wished more would be happening in the story. It all remains quite simplistic which does certainly go at the expense of its entertainment value at times.Other than that it still remains a well made movie. It obviously didn't cost an awful lot of money to make but they did a more than decent job with its resources. It's actually also being a quite creative movie to watch at times with it directing and cinematography. Perhaps you could say that the movie also benefits from the fact that it's shot in black  white since somehow I think the movie would had been a far more silly one to watch had it been done in full color.Not the greatest but still a enjoyable enough short watch.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Damsel in distress is Sphie Hardy this time and as usual the identity of the killer is not revealed until the very end. The film runs really short for films from the Wallace series barely makes it to the 80minutemark. I have seen a few of these films recently and I have to say they don't do a whole lot for me. The stories are usually unrealistic and it is never edgeofseat material. In this one there are a couple baffling moments too for example when a whole lot of policemen let the suspect just run out of the door in the end. Distracted by a woman shooting blanks? Really? I don't buy it. Another aspect Early on it is told us that all the Hexer wants is his revenge and yet he tries to kill the investigators on several occasions for example with a poisonous snake? Doesn't make sense. Like a couple other things in this film. The only reason why this film is so popular and way higher rated than it should be also here on IMDb is maybe because its unusual ending the bad triumphs somewhat. But this ending really only happens because the detectives turned out to be complete idiots including Fuchsberger's who is depicted as the smartest all the time before and in other Wallace films too.

This film is also loosely based on real life crime story The Sandhamn gang that was brought down by the police in the 1970's. The biggest surprise is the strong direction acting and high production values regarding set designs clothes music etc. Director Hannes Holm usually makes very mainstream Swedish rom coms comedy dramas that hasn't made much impact on me but this is clearlyso far at leasthis best film.Bill Skarsgrd is the son of famous Swedish Stellan Skarsgrd his two other acting sons are Alexander Skarsgrd Gustaf Skarsgrddoes a pretty good job but most impressive is the sourrounding cast Peter Dalle is very goodwinner Goldbug award best male actor for this role Bjrn Kjellman as the alcoholic father etc.The only criticism one can say is that screenplay has some flaws the story sometimes predictable certain characters not that interesting but overall a very good Swedish film easily compared to international productions such as Lords of Dogtown 2005A Bronx Tale 1993etc.Biggest surprise..? The dark complex depiction of Swedish society during 1970s were no one seems innocent. Please check up on Ted Grdestads music on youtube It'll be worth it I promise.".

It's so familiar in fact that the witch character of Baba Yaga was played by the same actor in both films!

A number of the ones that came from the Soviet Union have to get seen to be believed. I had previously seen the Soviet TV adaptations of Little Red Riding Hood and Pinocchio  that one was basically The Partridge Family on steroids and acid  but Aleksandr Rou's Zolotye roga The Golden Horns in English is a more sedate one. True the musical scenes look as if they're trying to make kids need psychiatric help but it's an enjoyable movie. People familiar with Russian fairy tales will know who Baba Yaga is. If not you'll get an idea while watching the movie. Another interesting depiction of her is the Italian movie Baba Yaga in which Carroll Baker starred during the years when she worked in Italy.Yes it's one of the weirder movies out there but you're sure to love it. Another WTF children's movie from the Soviet Union is a 1983 adaptation of Mary Poppins containing 1980s pop music I spent the whole movie wondering how the Soviet Union got its hands on 1980s pop music. Bert  played by Dick Van Dyke in the more famous version  looks like a cross between Elliott Gould and Keith Richards.".

The price is modest mostly in the 3..5 range so that a movie fan can get fresh meat every few weeks even throwing away the magazine unread just for the movie. Mostly you get Bleague action thrillers from Hollywood but there are pleasant exceptions. And SuperIllu a weekly with a focus on East German affairs hasn't yet disappointed me in their DVD extra brought out every first Thursday in a month.I felt disappointed when I saw the year's program started in September 2008 because it would be only children movies alternatingly of GDR and USSR production but I gave them a try.. and the first two issues were definitely worth it.Zolotye roga literally golden horns is fully focused on children. Unlike Disney productions which usually include some fodder for adults as well you have to feel like a child to really enjoy it and not be bored or annoyed by silly overacting. It took me a while to get into it but at the end I was carried away at age 52.The story is of a family getting gradually lost in the magic forest first the twin girls collecting mushrooms then their mother and the dog searching for them finally their older brother and the cat as well. Many nice shots of animals first rather realistic as in a nature documentary and gradually more anthropomorphic  the animals start to talk and somehow act resembling humans. Plus discussions of the mother with sun moon and whirlwind. Unforgettable images like the witch Baba Yaga playing mushroom domino and her shack walking on two hen's legs. The mother as knight in shining armor... quite a trip indeed.Some adults may dismiss this as childish. Let them. Other adults like me can enjoy being thrown back to a child's emotions by this 1972 Soviet movie. And not that you have to order it from a specialized online shop.. you can just pick it up at the newsstand for  2.99. I'm really grateful to SuperIllu for this magic experience. It's only an obsolete movie for children.. but weren't we all?".

Using his penchant for plot and out of his desperate desire to once again be the toast of Broadway Sidney along with Myra cook up an almost unthinkable scheme They'll lure the wouldbe playwright to the Bruhl home kill him and market the surefire script as Sidney's own.

	schema:reviewBody "Every time you think you have a handle on Deathtrap another plot twist comes along. Best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one. Most noted for its on screen kiss between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve which was unfortunately cut from the televised version I saw this movie has a great deal more to recommend it.Sidney Bruhl Michael Caine is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright his last several plays on Broadway have flopped. And while his wife Myra Dyan Cannon is nothing but supportive in both the monetary and emotional sense this does little to make Sidney feel any better. To add insult to injury young playwright Clifford Anderson Christopher Reeve has just sent Sidney a play to look at. It's Anderson's first and Sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer. He jokes to his wife that he should invite Anderson over kill him and submit the play as his own. She laughs with him at first but when Sidney actually invites Anderson over for dinner she worries that he may really be putting his scheme into action. And her fears just may be justified...It's a brilliant script. There are twists and turns all through the plot and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end. It's the kind of film that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and keeps you there the entire time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery.The acting is excellent. Caine gives his usual excellent performance and he does exhibit a knack for playing cultured refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who isn't nearly as wide eyed or innocent as he seems. Cannon's franticness works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a nice performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a psychic.This is a film with an ending you'd never expect and repeated watchings help to pick up on things missed in earlier viewings. An unsung classic that is unfortunately only remembered for a scene which ruffled some sensibilities at the time  and that is a real shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "The comparison to Sleuth the earlier stageplayturnedfilm is obvious and upon my first viewing I too thought Sleuth was better but Deathtrap has at least for me many more repeat viewings in it than Sleuth.I purchased Deathrap in the bargain bin at WalMart figuring that it had Caine and the underrated Reeve and was worth the 6 bucks. It was one of the finest DVD purchases I could've picked up.It's one of those bestkeptsecrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover. And it's totally worth repeat viewings.Though Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turned in bravado performances in Sleuth I was doubly impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of Superman stole the show in what should've been an Oscar worthy performance. I've always felt Reeve was a typecast actor who didn't get much of a chance to shine outside of the Superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like Somewhere in Time but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use thank goodness.I absolutely relished Michael Caine's performance. He was glib deliciously manipulative and sadistic. And watching him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact it was thanks to this movie that I got into a Michael Caine phase and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible. As for Deathtrap there's enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its memorable quotes section. Unfortunately much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot.It's really really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own. Needless to say it's a mustsee. But for me it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time.Repeat viewings are a must. And it deserves to sit alongside Sleuth on your DVD shelf.I'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film I wonder if it wouldn't be...well...just a trifle starryeyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration...where I could count on no sense of moral obligation...whatsoever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Reeve was near 30 when he made this movie right in the middle of his various Superman movies and his character takes quite a different path here. I think it showcases what a fine actor he really was before the unfortunate riding accident cut him short.Here Reeve plays Cliff Anderson a young writer who had attended a mystery writing seminar put on by the famous playwright Sidney Bruhl Michael Caine. Cliff contacts Sidney sends him a manuscript for his first effort a play called 'Deathtrap.' Sidney tells his wife Myra Dyan Cannon that the play is perfect there isn't anything that could be improved. So Sidney now with another clunker opening needs something to get his fame and more importantly his fortune back on track. So he hatches a plan to invite Cliff over kill him steal his manuscript for his own and all will be good again.I didn't give anything away in what I wrote above because all that is revealed in the first few minutes of the movie. But nothing I mean nothing is as it seems from the opening. As the story progresses new surprises develop. And that is the fun of the movie which plays more like a filmed stage play. Almost all the movie takes place inside the Bruhl home on Long Island and there are only 4 characters that matter. The 4th is neighbor Helga Ten Dorp Irene Worth who is psychic and can feel pain at various parts of the house.SPOILERS. When you watch long enough you find that Sidney and Clifford are apparently gay lovers and the whole thing was hatched by them to dispose of wife Myra who has a weak heart. Sidney and Cliff have an apparent fight Sidney apparently chokes him with a chain Sidney and Myra bury him in the garden at night but when Cliff comes back in alive Myra has an attack and dies. So Sidney and Cliff set up house together call each other endearing names even kiss once on camera. There never was a completed play called 'Deathtrap' but Cliff is writing one which is based on what just happened. When Sidney finds out he does not approve than the two men begin to distrust each other. This friction caused their disposal and in the end it is Helga Ten Dorp who writes the play 'Deathtrap' and sees it to amazing commercial success.".

	schema:headline " An excellent mystery movie soaked in wit";
	schema:reviewBody "Deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom as it primarily takes place on one set. The premise is that an accomplished playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play to the loud protests of his wife. Or so you think for the first half of the movie. Past the halfway mark Deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head then right around and then in a mad spin all the time keeping its title appropriate. It's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit. Michael Caine as the senior playwright plays himself in this movie  a slightly loony and very dramatic Brit. No surprises here  he does his usual good work. He gets the best line of Deathtrap which he executes perfectly What is your definition of success being gangbanged in a state penitentiary? Christopher Reeve on the other hand juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious and psychopathic young playwright. He also gets to show off his very toned body which he must've retained coming off the Superman movies. Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another movie that's one of my favorite comedies  Noises Off. It similarly revolves around a play as well although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett John Ritter Marilu Henner Taxi and Mark LinnBaker Perfect Strangers. Together they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bedhopping cast and crew of a play. On the surface the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch. Wish this underrated movie was available on DVD.".

I like thrillers Michael Caine's a good actor Sidney Lumet's a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good.I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but all I'd say is there are LOADS of twists and turns. So many its kind of hard to explain the film's plot line in detail without giving it away. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out. Though I have to give Lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loud.The main cast  Michael Caine Christopher Reeve Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth  were all brilliant in their roles. Though Worth's obvious fake Russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal Irene I think any actor's fake accent would irritate me. Not sure if Cannon's character was meant to be annoyingly funny but Dyan managed to annoy and amuse  at the same time.Anyone reading this  I don't want you to be putoff watching this because of my views  give it a chance you may like it you may not.

Director Sidney Lumet no stranger to film is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on. The dialog is quick fresh and witty. Michael Caine excels in roles like these. Christopher Reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act. Irene Worth stands out as the funny psychic. How about Dyan Cannon? Love how Lumet packaged her posterior in those real tightfitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around but she is terribly miscast in this role  a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive. But why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now? Deathtrap is funny sophisticated witty and classy. The mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat and I was not wholly satisfied with the ending but watching Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction with Levin's elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The trick to creating a good solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot contrivances colorful characters or surprising twists. Anyone who has ever labored in frustration with an unfinishable Sunday New York Times crossword knows that any puzzle that takes too long to solve ceases to be any fun. The best murder mysteries be they on film or in print are slight affairs that get to the point spell out their clues line up their suspects and hopefully zap us with a few surprises being complicated without being unduly confusing. And they play fair on second third and fourth viewings of the clues and red herrings we should be just as pleased to marvel at how well it all comes together as we were at being surprised in the first place. Indeed good thrillers should get better on repeated viewings as we anticipate the double and triple crosses.Sidney Lumet's comedythriller DEATHTRAP as derived from Ira Levin's hit Broadway play is a great example. It moves along at a tidy clip skillfully juggling its clues being almost totally honest with us even when it is lying to us and yet never revealing where it is going even when it is telling us where it might go. It is less a murder mystery movie in the traditional vane than it is a movie about murder mysteries derived from a play about playwriting. Rather than going backward  a murder and then an investigation to explain why everything happened  DEATHTRAP leads us through the crimes step by step leaving ample room for the unexpected as the ads advise it is less a whodunit than a who'lldoit. DEATHTRAP is often compared unfavorably oddly enough to the play and movie versions of SLEUTH though in reality it has much more in common with SCREAM the selfmocking essay on teenybopper horror flicks. Like that clever film DEATHTRAP labels itself a thriller about thrillers sets it parameters a oneset five character moneymaker and then proceeds to deconstruct its genre by revealing itself as the most outlandish and preposterous set of circumstances entertaining enough to persuade an audience to suspend its disbelief. DEATHTRAP bravely gives us a mystery with only five major characters two of which are of minimum importance. Henry Jones as a cagey lawyer is on hand mostly for exposition and to supply us with his penchant for folksy charm and Irene Worth is all quirks and comic relief as a psychiccumsleuth who acts as the nominal detective. That leaves three main characters to be the killers andor the victims It is a testament to Michael Caine's abilities that as Sidney Bruhl a downonhisluck author of mystery plays he creates a character who we intrinsically like and trust even as we recognize immediately that almost everything he says is a lie. As his adoring if somewhat ditzy wife Myra Dyan Canon flirts with being over the top by giving a rollercoaster ride of a performance with a character that by turns seems to be frail or overbearing crafty or hysterical timid or bold and uncompromisingly in love with a less than reciprocating Sidney. The third angle of this unexpected triangle is a fledgling playwright named Clifford Anderson played by Christopher Reeve in such a way that we never quite get a handle on just who his character is enthusiastic preppie wannabe writer semiinnocent victim or cunningly charming sociopath. As the various character dance around each other the cleverly dour script adapted by ace scribe Jay Presson Allen manages to be consistently amusing even as it builds suspense. And even after the final twist an improvement over the play's finale it may not be quite clear just who has manipulated who to do what.Lumet is by no means a master of comedy so he lets his able cast have free reign to flesh out the characters and they all give sharp theatrical yet subtle work with Reeve being particularly noteworthy. But what Lumet does so well is to work skillfully in tight quarters. As he did brilliantly in 12 ANGRY MEN he takes a oneset play and with a minimum of opening up manages to make what could have been cramped stagy and stagnant seem endlessly photogenic and spacious. The setting a country home converted from an old windmill is relatively small but as designed by Tony Walton it manages to be both cozy and charming as well as spooky and treacherous. It is so truly difficult to tell where the studio set and the real country house cross boundaries that to a degree the set becomes a sixth character. And as the scene of the crime it is a most inviting deathtrap indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deathtrap is one of those films by proxy of its stage play roots both based upon and being a satire of that not only gets better by the halfway point it becomes something even more incredible when it focuses on two characters we wouldn't think would be like this together. I'm not talking about the 'gay' thing that shouldn't be looked upon as anything more than a garnish to the piece. I mean how it really becomes even more about the nature of plotting how to make up something that has a beatforbeat rhythm but is strong enough and clever enough to throw people off guard. A work like Deathtrap would've impressed Hitchcock there's a reference at one point in due notice to Dial M For Murder also based on a play about the intricacies of plotting murder as it's about the devilish wanton things with characters and being stylish with camerawork so that nothing is ever too static. This is Sidney Lumet's territory and he does very well at it.It's about two writers one an old pro who is turning sour after a string of flops another who is just about to come out with a first play to show to people and how they spar off. A potential murder is plotted by Sidney Caine and his wife is hearing in plain earshot i.e. in front of her of how it will be done. And indeed we see it done on screen in a moment that is shocking despite what has been leading up to it such as a trick with Houdini's handcuffs not really his cuffs by the way. But then a twist comes  it's a humdinger one of the great ones in movies really  and I was engaged even more than before. What was at first an interesting little story of envy turned plotting for murder becomes a contorted piece on what it means to make it in the theater world. It's selfreflexive even meta. I would kill no pun intended to see how it played on the stage.For Lumet timing is everything how to bend the comedy towards the believable and madcap without losing the reality of the thriller. He called it a melodrama but I'm not sure that would be accurate despite its tendencies. It's a comedy in the style of Sleuth also starring Caine where the fun and whatwillhappennext aspect of it is intrinsic with the character's thoughts and actions. We soon learn if not quickly than at some point that no one can be trusted at their word and that the thrill and fright can turn on a dime into absurdity and wild moments of fancy. There's a scene for example where Sidney discovers something written that follows the events of what has happened so far in the film's story beat for beat. He's enraged it can't get made how dare the person who wrote it! And yet there's not a moment that we can believe what they're saying while it is totally believable how Caine and Reeve are playing the scene. I loved that about the film and about the characters.A note about Christopher Reeve he's better here than in almost anything else I've seen him in outside the obvious choice of Superman. He's given a meaty character with so much that he can play with first he's the young naive guy ready to collaborate with the great Bruhl... then when his true nature is revealed he becomes a horse of a different color. He's a sociopath as Bruhl calls him but Reeve makes him almost sympathetic in a way and every note of his performance felt right funny scary tinged with that glee we have with characters who are craven in what they'll do. Caine to be sure is at his usual tiptop professional self and has some surprises in store with his far he goes with the character as well. But Reeve is the real breakout here. Dyan Cannon too is quite good though somewhat overshadowed by her two male costars.Deathtrap might be too clever or not clever by half but I couldn't see that the first time watching the film. I saw electrifying acting and some amazing dialog and a few moments of direction and cinematography one shot tracking up to Caine's face reading something is remarkable as is the over the top lightning effects at the climax and that it was about something even as it is popular entertainment. It's not as sharp or like a landmark as Network but in its own right is as memorable for its intended audience.".

This movie was made during a period of Caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would star in such award winning movies such as this and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure. What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is Reeves death. He deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in the 5.97 bin at Walmart. Along with gems like The Island and Blame it on Rio.".

But if you really pay attention if you were even to have been in the theater and spent money to be engaged you might well wish you had tried harder and that the movie makers had tried a lot harder. There will always be poignance to seeing Christopher Reeve at his pretty and charming best though he's pretty dull stuff here compared to both Superman of course and the iconic Somewhere in Time from just two years before.Caine is pure Caine hard to fault and if you already like him you'll like him still. I do and he made it sustainable. But the plot? Well it's all farce to the point of not really caring what happens. Even Murder by Death with all its superficial plot twists revels in being superficialit's just fun all around. This one is not quite fun nor is it as ingenious or beautifully written as Sleuth. The source of Deathtrap is a fabulously successful Broadway play and why it didn't quite transfer to film is something to argue about. Sidney Lumet is certainly a really capable director with some classic films like Dog Day Afternoon and FailSafe. behind him. What Deathtrap lacks for a director is true drama however and the finessing the faking the lighthearted coyness requires a certain sensibility not quite working here.I think the two women in the cast the wife and the psychic neighbor are both so caricatured they're hard to take too. Add all of this up and you have mostly the endless twists and surprises to keep you goingand again Sleuth has it all over this one in that camp.Not that you won't be surprised! If you do watch it and hang in there you'll be twisted and amused. Which is the main point.".

Yes the two stories have a lot in common. But Sleuth is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits and the house in Sleuth is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors  the house doesn't really have an equivalent in Deathtrap. And Deathtrap isn't so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good and never as smart as they think they are and deserve everything they get. I'll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre and well worth your time and money. This is America after all. You don't have to choose! I won't give away the twists and turns of the plot but I don't think it matters anyway. I've watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean scary moments when things go all pear shaped. It's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination.Anyone who likes blackhearted comedy and suspense in the Hitchcock style of filmmaking will probably enjoy Deathtrap immensely.".

In the first he's supposed to break through the french doors and the second he appears out of the dark when illuminated by a bolt of lightning he is suddenly seen above Sidney's head swinging a pike or axe for one final attempt to kill Sidney with his dying breath. Both of these sudden appearances are genuinely startlingin the play but not in the movie. The very end too is inextricably squandered.Don't waste your time or money. Unfortunately no other version exists. Wait until a performance comes to your town. We just saw one by a volunteer amateur company in a small ginrickety playhouse which was far better than this.".
