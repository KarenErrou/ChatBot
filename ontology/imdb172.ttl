	schema:reviewBody "A young Korean artist lives in Amsterdam. She is a bit of a loner and has never had a serious relationship insisting that she is waiting for the right person. She works in the public square drawing portraits for passersby but for herself she also indulges in painting her favorite flowers daisies. But all of a sudden she has a secret admirer. Flowers are delivered to her residence every day at 415 usually daisies yet she can not catch the sender in the act. This is because unknown to her her beau is a Korean hitman and he wishes to remain hidden for now. One day in the square however another attractive Korean man sits for the artist and happens to be carrying a pot of daisies. She concludes that he is her shy hero and also the man she has been waiting to find. This second gentleman too has a secret he is an Interpol agent. The assassin can see everything that transpires in the square due to having an apartment close by. Naturally he is disturbed that another man has entered the young girl's life. How will this shadowy love triangle play out? This is a beautiful picture to watch. The setting in Amsterdam and the surrounding countryside is very very lovely. Add in three most attractive young Korean actors and visually any viewer has a stunning panorama in front of them. The story is quite nice too being a mixture of drama and action with a dash of the unexpected. Costumes are very fetching and the production values high. In short anyone searching for a quality foreign film with a compelling story and great scenery would find this movie a wonderful choice for a diverting evening. Should you have someone's hand to hold during the view so much the better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the Korean version of Daisy first. It came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish. I saw it 3 times as I waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive.Then I got the DC and watched it. Wow! I think this is the first REAL director's cut I've ever seen. Amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! The DC is laid out like a hardcore thriller with the love story in the background. It moves at a slower pace than the Korean version.The variations between both versions are so drastic it seems like two totally different movies. I thought I would be worn out watching the movie again toughing it out just to look for the added scenes. That wasn't the case. It really felt like I was watching a whole new movie.While the DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version you'll be hardpressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed. 2 seconds chopped off here. A second added there. An entire scene added here. Another erased there. In both versions scenes have been added omitted or chopped up and reordered. In some scenes entire lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered  while the scene itself was untouched. Even simple sound effects were addedomitted from each version  having a major impact on the mood of the film and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene. What comes across as a tender moment in the Korean version is a sad somber one in the DC. The endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I can tell both versions end a LOT different and were intended that way.I'm assuming most people will be acquiring the director's cut of the film and will find the movie pretty decent but a little long and boring. If that's the case look for the Korean version. Same movie but different feel. I think there's a deluxe 3DVD version that contains both cuts of the film  not sure.The versions compliment each other so well that as a pair I'll watch Daisy more often than I do any of my other favorite Korean movies. Alone I'd say the Korean version is a nice love story that I'd watch once in awhile. The director's cut I'll watch maybe once or twice then never again as I find the pacing dull. But they just go so well together! For what I consider the best experience I'd say watch the Korean version first. Then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about.The editing is the real star of the film.".

They feature so prominently and are used as plot devices you'll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends.Set in Amsterdam Daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life. One a professional hitman eking out a living the other an Interpol agent. Featuring a PanAsian cast Korean Hong Kong and crew director Andrew Lau from Hong Kong writer from Korea and a Thai post production team I could imagine the headaches in coordination.Park Yi Jung Woosung is a hitman who found a soft spot for painter Hyeyoung played by the pretty Jeon Jihyun. It's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies where her clumsiness caught his attention. However being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career he can only admire her from afar do little or perhaps big things for her in an anonymous fashion but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 415pm. He becomes her guardian angel from afar shielding her and keeping her safe from harm.Hyeyoung is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for him to appear but I really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery. Nonetheless she's terribly moved and touched by this sole act. However as the stars would have it interpol detective Jeong Woo Lee Sungjae chances upon Hyeyoung at a town square during one of his undercover missions and he too is captivated by her. In a similar fashion because of his profession he is doubtful if he should make the first move.Which is where the audience would find it frustrating. The lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy then again it's the good guy Park Yi being infuriated by Jeong Woo's pursuit but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself and Jeong Woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly. It's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up.That aside it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued. And it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers or their loved one. But fret not action fans there are enough catandmouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of Infernal Affairs as well as ample gunfights although I felt the ending could have been scripted tighter.What rocks is the clever editing. Telling the story in a nonlinear timeline no worries it ain't that bad you'll still be able to follow the narrative from the points of view of all the leads keeping you in suspense and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event which I thought was extremely welldone.It's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares with plenty of classical music to sooth the soul. As with romance movies all the leads are eye candy  the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgyfaced argh! OK lah at certain angles Jeon Jihyun.If you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the actiontension department then Daisy would be your choice. If you prefer a more conventional weepy then the other Korean movie making its debut here at the same time You are My Sunshine would be your alternative. And yes I totally dig the ending scene which I thought only the Koreans do it best? Kinda reminded me of the JSA one.".

It touches themes about the difficulty of confessing one's love due to difficult situations. The movie is a collaboration of Chinese and Korean filmmakers. That is why the love story was great due to the Koreanswho are wellknown for their classic romantic films and the cops and criminal story was just as great due to the Chinesewho are wellknown for making great action films.The acting was superb in this film.Gianna Jun was spectacular as an actress despite of not having a speaking role for 34 of the film. She can convey emotions without words extremely well which definitely proves that she is an exceptional actress. The same can be said for both Korean actors Lee Seongjae and Jung Woosungwho acted as the cop and assassin respectively. This film was made in Amsterdam which made the setting of the film was truly fabulous. The direction of Andrew Lau Infernal Affairs and the screenplay of Kwak Jae Young My Sassy GirlThe ClassicWindstruck were definitely extraordinary. Since this is the director's cut version the film may be kinda of slow as the first onethird of the story is a narration from the perspective of the three major characters. But inspite of this I still find the positive qualities of the film far too overwhelming as compared to this one flaw.A highly recommended film.This film defines what a great Asian film is all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Again I'm late 6 years to watch a good Asian movie. This makes me think why cinemas in my country only play Hollywood summer blockbusters when there are many better non Hollywood movies out there. Anyway... This movie really reminds me of HK Chow Yun Fat's The Killer 1987. There is a romantic killer and disable girl as his love interest. By then the girl was blind after the shoot out and in Daisy the girl can not speak after the gun fight. Both killers are decent man and have a good self consciousness I doubt there is really a gun for hire out there like our lead actor. But that's all of the resemblance. The tone of Daisy is drama so action is not very intense. Even at the end when the final show down between the killer and the villains the intensity is not very high. But one thing differ this movie from its predecessor it's Jun Ji Hyun. She's really a good actress capable of drawing our sympathy feel her love and pain even though she does not speak nearly for half end of the movie. When she discovered the truth about the man whom she really loved deep down in our heart we really wish happiness for her even though some of us maybe know what's coming. Definitely 810".

This makes me think why cinemas in my country only play Hollywood summer blockbusters when there are many better non Hollywood movies out there. Anyway... This movie really reminds me of HK Chow Yun Fat's The Killer 1987. There is a romantic killer and disable girl as his love interest. By then the girl was blind after the shoot out and in Daisy the girl can not speak after the gun fight. Both killers are decent man and have a good self consciousness I doubt there is really a gun for hire out there like our lead actor. But that's all of the resemblance. The tone of Daisy is drama so action is not very intense. Even at the end when the final show down between the killer and the villains the intensity is not very high. But one thing differ this movie from its predecessor it's Jun Ji Hyun. She's really a good actress capable of drawing our sympathy feel her love and pain even though she does not speak nearly for half end of the movie. When she discovered the truth about the man whom she really loved deep down in our heart we really wish happiness for her even though some of us maybe know what's coming. Definitely 810";

It lacks couple things that would make the audience believe in the story. The main problem I believe is the characters lack depth. The constant flashbacks waste a lot of time telling the same story three times. Therefore although the movie is fairly long there are not enough scenes for each character to develop and show us their personalities. The setting is also unbelievable as well. A bunch of Koreans in Netherland especially one working as a cop and one working as an assassin does this feel like a credible story? The movie is somewhat entertaining the actors and actress did a good job the cinematography is pleasing but I just feel disappointed that all these good effort did not add up to a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the summery suggests this movie works like a slow poison. The pacing of the movie is really slow but that didn't stop me from liking it. After the end of the movie i sat down on my chair thinking about the movie for an hour. And after a week i decided to write the review of this movie. Well i won't call it a review these are my general thoughts regarding the movie. So i warn you there will be minor spoilers. Daisy is a tragic love triangle between a cop a painter and an assassin. Hyeyoungjihyun jun is a 25 years old painter living in Amsterdam who looks after her grandfather's antique shop. One day she meets JeongwooLee sungjae an Interpol cop whose job is to put an end to the Asian mafia in Amsterdam both fall in love with each other but one day a gun fire happens in the middle of the street. Hyeyoung and jeongwoo both got hurt. In this tragic accident Hyeyoung looses her voice and Jeongwoo got shot in the arm and sent back to Korea. Enter park yiWoosung Jung an assassin by profession. He tries to steal the heart of Hyeyoung and also helps her to forget the sad past. After his relentless effort Hyeyoung accepts his love. Everything was working well for Park Yi but suddenly Hyeyoung finds Jeong woo standing at her doorsteps. Thus we have our movie.The plot of the movie is really good and it had the potential to turn into a great romantic movie the only thing matters is the Execution and that is the greatest problem i have with this movie. The screenplay of the movie is really slow. The first 50 minutes were really enjoyable. But after that this movie really drags on. There was no chemistry between JIHyun jun and Woosung jung. We don't feel the romance between those two. We see Hyeyoung as a mute girl fighting with her own feelings and park yi trying really hard to appease her but we don't get to see how he does that and director introduces the time gap of one year. And after one year the situation is slightly changed Hyeyoung and park yi are now couples but we don't see how that happened. And it is replaced by some gangster and mafia plot. And then the whole thing is turned into a convoluted mess. But the last 15 minutes of the movie really worked for me and the ending was something i didn't expect at all. The ending of the movie was really tragic and completely turns the table.Performance wise all three lead actors did a fine job. Woosung jung's role as an assassin is perfect Sungjae lee also did a good job but the performance of ji hyun jun wasn't up to the mark. No offense i liked her acting in My sassy girl and wind struck and even in this movie she did a fine job at first but after she loses her voice i lost interest in her character but again i feel she did an OK job but the actress of her caliber could've done better. The movie is set in Amsterdam which is really weird because i haven't seen any Asian movie filmed outside the continent. Maybe they thought filming the movie in Amsterdam will give the movie a romantic feel to it and i guess it worked at least for the most part.Daisy is a good romantic movie but it's no way comparable to other Korean romantic classics such as A moment to remember my sassy girl and the classic. But the great plot solid performance and a good climax made it a must watch for all Asian movie lovers and also for anyone who want to watch a good tragic romantic story. Sorry for my bad English.I Am a south Asian and English is not my forte but i tried really hard keep this review understandable to the general English speaking people.".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Daisy";
	schema:reviewBody "Simply unconvincing Love is all about timing and it's no good meeting the right person at the wrong place and the wrong time. Well at least for a good 100 minutes of Daisy it seems to be heading towards that way but then all of a sudden director Andrew Lau takes a complete Uturn and goes for anything is possible  the future can be changed. The result is weird confusing unbelievable and a tad too long. Running at 110 minutes Daisy is at least 20 minutes too long and the effect on the audience is straining and dragging on and on which isn't exactly the right type of emotions to have. Without doubt this is an Andrew Lau film the director who helmed a production called Infernal Affairs but somehow it plays more like a typical melodramatic Korean film and adding some spices of Johnnie To's Fulltime Killer. The end product isn't original and the overall feeling is pretty much unconvincing and when the only pros are the beautiful backdrop of Amsterdam the pretty painter and good production values you can tell that a lot of things are heading the wrong direction.The movie goes like this Daisy is a story about the inevitable showdown between a detective and a killer who fall in love with the same woman. In the story Jeon plays a street artist who dreams of opening her own exhibition someday while Jeong portrays a killer who loves her but cannot confess his love to her because of his profession.Sometimes you wonder how the hell a director like Andrew Lau can codirect films like Infernal Affairs and Young and Dangerous and then go on and create crap like The Park Wesley's Mysterious Files when left alone.Whatever the case in Daisy Lau isn't just unconvincing but also disappointing. It is extremely unfortunate that the bright spot of Korean cinema is now resorting to clich and Lau does nothing new but reinforces that fact. Adding to the wound is the casting of hugely popular Jeon JiHyun from My Sassy Girl further enhancing the fact of how the hell did this movie turned out so boring.Jeon JiHyun is alongside Ha Jiwon and Song Hyekyo as Neo's favourite Koreans and while her performance here is hugely different from her loud mouthed fame from My Sassy Girl. She offers nothing new or fresh to the mute role and frankly it is a role that can be done by any other actresses. Muting a talkative girl is as much a pain for her to stop talking let alone for the audience to endure through it. Nonetheless she is an extremely likable character and possessing pretty face to go with it. Lee SungJae performs far better than the Andy Lau wannabe  Jung WooSung. Lee shows some good acting chops and his chemistry with Jeon is romantic to watch. Perhaps it is the moment that he disappears from the screen that the movie becomes a tad too long and leaning towards boredom. In some way his eyes resemble a Tony Leung Chiu Wai with a Korean flair and in an ironic contrast Jung parallels an Andy Lau. Perhaps it is Andrew Lau's fault in filming them as if they are HK superstars rather than letting them be themselves but nonetheless it is a shockingly crap performance from Jung and his encounters with Jeon is stupid and utterly unbelievable.As I mentioned before there is a spice of Fulltime Killer within this film and certainly Jeon's role is not unlike Kelly Lin and Jung being the Andy Lau and Lee as the cop. However despite Fulltime Killer being flawed itself it was still highly enjoyable and utterly and stylishly cool but Daisy is just far too uneven and more importantly unconvincing. Sure there are bits and pieces in the first 90 minutes that is worth watching especially the scene where Lee encounters Jeon in the middle of the beautiful backdrop of Amsterdam their awkward moment of romance is a beautiful moment to endure. Unfortunately those moments are far and in between and the rest is just predictable and unconvincing.All in all Daisy isn't bad movie but it is utterly unconvincing. Even typing this review right now I realise that I have been typing one word over and over again  unconvincing. It is rare that I keep using the same word over and over again to describe a movie but it is exactly the reason why the movie didn't work. Andrew Lau has yet to prove that he can handle a movie by himself and if it takes a codirector for him to have any success then he should stop directing alone. Sometimes a director really needs to know what the hell he is aiming to achieve so that the audience can understand the message that he is trying to put across. It is no good emphasising the point of missed opportunities and meeting the person at the wrong time and place for a good portion of the movie then all of a sudden turning 180 degrees saying that it doesn't really matter. The effect is that of leaving the audience feeling stupid and more unbelievable than believable. Perhaps one word can sum up the whole film and you probably already know what word it would be  unconvincing I rate it 610www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:headline " Although Lacking the Action Andrew Lau's Films are Notable For Daisy is a Sombre Character Driven Love Story About Beauty Longing and Acceptance";
	schema:reviewBody "To have Andrew Lau's name associated with a film like Daisy struck me as rather peculiar upon completion of my original viewing for unlike many of his other works notable often for their action the romantic storyline could almost be comparative to a film helmed by Wong Kar Wai. Though the film conveys a similarity to Mr. Lau's Bullets of Love the strong focus on the three lead characters each of whom experience love and loss in equal measure their narration that assists in scaffolding their feelings and perspectives is unlike what Mr. Lau has previously showcased. However his vision can often be seen during the quick cuts exhibited within the infrequent fight scenes that are often times frenetic yet at the same time focused on the segment's most important characters.The themes of love death beauty and art are accentuated by the poignant soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere while the exceptional song uniquely used for lead character HyeYoung Jun JiHyun further emphasizes the words and opinions that she does not personally give voice to which makes for an even more emotive setting. An artist originally from the South Korean countryside this location alongside the streets of Amsterdam where the film is primarily set heightens the artistic beauty of the world HyeYoung inhabits making a living by temporarily working at her grandfather's antique store while dedicating the majority of her life to her artistic endeavors.Ms. JiHyun brilliantly encapsulates her character's passion for art and equally gives life to her pain and frustration. The antique store helps emphasize her grandfather's fear that HyeYoung if she does not find an acceptable suitor will soon end up much like some of the unwanted items in his store and though she refuses to accept such ideas her initial thoughts on love that are perhaps overloaded do evidently stress her desires. Her heart in secret already belongs to a man she has never met Park Yi Jung SooWung who frequently sends her daisies though does not have the courage to reveal himself to her after dedicating himself to the life of a contract killer.Hoping to one day find her secret admirer HyeYoung coincidentally bumps into Jeong Woo Lee SungJae an Interpol detective who after forming an attachment to her doesn't have the heart to reveal he is in fact not the man who sends her daisies after she suspects him to be the man she's longed to meet. Park Yi has only the capacity to sadly watch there being a deep seeded sense of hopelessness evident in the feature that is used to great affect and though each character is open to love they at the same time are scared of hurting the other especially as both the assassin and the detective begin to come closer to unmasking the other's identity.Despite one's initial assumption that this part of the plot would presumably add much tension to the story a violent bitter struggle for HyeYoung's heart is not what actually occurs. Instead the tension is developed through character choices as viewers are continuously left wondering which of the two men HyeYoung will choose to dedicate her love to and whether or not she still longs to meet the man who sends her daises or if her heart has instead settled for another.Although the film executes its ability to leave the audience guessing due to deliberate gaps in the plot that are filled over the duration of the feature and through a narrative that isn't always chronological the characters are so well developed viewers will potentially be able to predict the directionality and outcome regardless though this never takes away from the emotional intensity of the feature.Despite Daisy's length which could be evaluated as longer than necessary alongside potential accusations about its slow pace the scenes and accompanying visuals never feel forced or out of place their meaningful evocative intent successfully being channeled towards the viewer until the film's conclusion. Though the film's often sombre atmosphere is undeniable its beauty lies in its advocating for and strong admittance of love forgiveness and acceptance.".

	schema:headline " Realistic BDSM relationship";
	schema:reviewBody "I just got back from seeing the new Korean film Lies a portrayal of a consensual BDSM relationship between an 18yearold student and a 38yearold sculptor.First the bad stuff it's not a very good movie. Amateurishly filmed with shaky camera work and some of the weirdest directorial decisions I've ever seen. This is not Last Tango In Paris or anything like it.But if you can get past that what's left at the core is one of the most sympathetic honest and realistic portrayals I've ever seen of BDSM as it's actually played. The two types of players  the sculptor is a primary sadomasochist whose needs for BDSM play are strong innate and nonsituationdependent the student is a secondary sadomasochist who derives her enjoyment of BDSM from her partner's reaction  are accurately and sympathetically portrayed.

	onyx:emotionText "I just got back from seeing the new Korean film Lies a portrayal of a consensual BDSM relationship between an 18yearold student and a 38yearold sculptor.First the bad stuff it's not a very good movie. Amateurishly filmed with shaky camera work and some of the weirdest directorial decisions I've ever seen. This is not Last Tango In Paris or anything like it.But if you can get past that what's left at the core is one of the most sympathetic honest and realistic portrayals I've ever seen of BDSM as it's actually played. The two types of players  the sculptor is a primary sadomasochist whose needs for BDSM play are strong innate and nonsituationdependent the student is a secondary sadomasochist who derives her enjoyment of BDSM from her partner's reaction  are accurately and sympathetically portrayed.

They don't come together for any other reason than to have all out straight up kinky beateachotherup sex and they're not pretending there is any other reason. They glory in it they obsess about it they talk about their last encounter and look forward to the next one. The best thing about it is the way it draws you in and makes you watch just to find out  where will all this end? To all the reviewers who complained about the grapehic sex so why did you watch it? You can't see five minutes of this movie without getting the idea so what were you doing? Tied to your chair maybe? Couldn't get free to turn it off? Held at gunpoint? What a bunch of hypocritical goober heads.Neither of the protagonists is particularly attractive not in the conventional way and I didn't feel that anything was shown for pornographic purposes although that would have been OK with me. It is simply an account of an intense sexual relationship where the whole reason for being together is kinky sex and this idea is followed through the film. You may not have any sympathy with the characters or like them or even be able to empathize at all but you have to watch because you just know it is going to get more intense and it does.Each time J and Y come together the sex gets more intense more brutal kinkier and nastier. They beat each other unmercifully finding ever more severe objects to whale on each other with. Sounds kinda fun doesn't it? The intent though is to show such a relationship and show how it develops where it can go and how it could happen. It even goes one better by making J an older man an artist who is very class sensitive and somewhat tormented. Y is a schoolgirl and her motives are never completely clear as they probably wouldn't be to someone her age in this relationship.I would never have watched this except for the reviews complaining about the graphic sex and violence. That got my interest quick but then I was sucked in by the plot. I just had to know where this was going and predicted some big blow up at the end. I thought that possibly one would kill the other during a beating or their families would intervene. Either way I had to know what happened and that to me is the best part of this movie.".

What sets this film apart from other recent releases that have incorporated hardcore footage as part of their narrative like the astonishing BAISEMOI or Lars Von Trier's THE IDIOTS is that here there is actual warmth and sensuality to the copulation sequences even when the protagonists are beating the feces out of each other making it much harder one presumes for moralists to condemn on grounds of lacking humanity or compassion. Not that they would allow themselves to be seduced by this deeply moving yet quietly disturbing film in the first place. I for one found it exquisitely erotic and frequently sweetly funny with the lovers' DIY approach to SM even  or especially perhaps  in its more extreme moments all of which handled beautifully by the two nonprofessional leads. The pareddown visual style gives the movie an edge and intensity as if you're watching real people in a documentary rather than a fiction film.

	schema:reviewBody "I was at first disgusted with director SunWoo Jang because I had felt that he cheated me. Jang had the potential to create a strong deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element. I couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best  yet this film remained in my mind for days after I viewed it. What stayed with me wasn't the story it wasn't the characters nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film but the transition that Jang demonstrated between Y and J. If you watch this film carefully you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship eager to jump into the unknown but not quite certain the next step. As they continue to meet exploring new avenues of pleasure they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed. Jang initially explores the idea that J is the one that in control of the situation then hauntingly the reversal happens when J becomes obsessed with Y. It is a very small change and due to the graphic content of this film it can easily be missed but it is there. It becomes apparently clear near the end when J cannot live with Y as their meetings become less frequent and J attempts to become a part of normal society. This was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes but alas it was the only element of this film worth viewing.I will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic because there are human elements at the core of this film as underdeveloped as they are they are there. It is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers. What happens behind closed doors is never known  or so we should believe. While the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit director Jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery. Our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh. This is fun at first but again Jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting. This leads me to the biggest issue that I had with this film. Jang had a great story with Gojitmal but where he failed outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side was that he took scenes repeated them time and again without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters. Where was Jang going with this movie? Did he want the sex to tell the stories or did he believe the characters would? He failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about Y and J that we could care less how they resolve themselves. The ending seems almost random at best as Jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two absolute unknowns of this film. I have to give Jang some credit for trying but not much. He attempted to create some substories that would create the personal element that we were lacking but they just couldn't congeal well together. Y's brother and J's wife were those plot points but again due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element these stronger substories became unrememberable and downright dull. Maybe it was just how I viewed this film but outside of the sexual scenes nothing else worked together. We knew nothing about J and Y and that is why Gojitmal failed.Finally I would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us the viewers closer to the emotions being felt by J and Y. From what I can remember and I am trying to push this film far from my mind I don't remember any musical undertones. Gojitmal may have been a stronger film if Jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings. While I understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more. Technically this was a poor film. Obviously an independent film in nature it felt more like director Jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature. I didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above I just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough. This was no Larry Clark production this was subpar and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release! Overall I think I could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that I did enjoy but I felt this film was rushed repetitive and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them. The obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived. Our characters were uneventful our story was underdeveloped and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between Y and J into something more symbolic than sex. To me Jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic  and it failed miserably. This was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make.Grade  out of ".

Maybe it was just how I viewed this film but outside of the sexual scenes nothing else worked together. We knew nothing about J and Y and that is why Gojitmal failed.Finally I would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us the viewers closer to the emotions being felt by J and Y. From what I can remember and I am trying to push this film far from my mind I don't remember any musical undertones. Gojitmal may have been a stronger film if Jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings. While I understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more. Technically this was a poor film. Obviously an independent film in nature it felt more like director Jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature. I didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above I just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough. This was no Larry Clark production this was subpar and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release! Overall I think I could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that I did enjoy but I felt this film was rushed repetitive and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them. The obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived. Our characters were uneventful our story was underdeveloped and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between Y and J into something more symbolic than sex. To me Jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic  and it failed miserably. This was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make.Grade  out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "Whereas the first Wet Dreams film focused on the misadventures of four junior high school boys Wet Dreams 2 focuses on the sexual curiosities of three girls Sooyeon Misook and Sungeun. Sooneun is the most mature and prettiest of the three girls and a number of her all female classmates have schoolgirl crushes on her. She also has a secret admirer called Brainy Smurf who sends her gifts and flowers. Misook is a geeky girl who seems to lack the brainpower to raise her status from geek to nerd. She tends to ask such important questions as what is a rubber? and what is an erection? She quite often gets the back of her head slapped and generally has abuse heaped upon her by her friends and teachers. Sungeun is a pretty waif of a girl whose strong interest in boys spurs on the group's little adventures.As in the previous film a hormonally charged classroom is given a jolt with the arrival of a young teacher trainee. This time however the young teacher Kang Bonggu has a bit of interest in his students as well especially the slender busty Baek Semi. Semi is also interested in Bonggu and being a girl who is used to getting what she wants little can stop her from pursuing her interests. Sungeun of course also develops a crush for the young teacher but she is a bit intimidated because of her undeveloped body. However she pursues Bonggu doing such things as padding her bra pursuing a flasher to see what a penis looks like and even going to Bonggu's apartment and demanding that he have sex with her.Like the previous film Wet Dreams 2 is filled with lowbrow humor. Kang Bonggu farts every time he becomes sexually aroused which is quite often and while it might make the viewer giggle once or twice it becomes old quite quickly however it does produce one of the most humorous lines in the movie. After Sungeun learns that Kang Bonggu farts when he is sexually aroused she states If she Semi makes him fart then I am going to make him sht. Wet Dreams also has a bit of a creepy factor as well. Although the girls are all over eighteen in real life I was a bit uncomfortable with some scenes involving Semi and the physical education teacher who took a number of liberties with the girl such as slapping her on the butt a few times. These scenes reeked of sexual harassment although Semi didn't seem to mind.While better than the first film and with a noticeably higher budget Wet Dreams 2 falls into the same category of film as American Pie and the like. Therefore while it can be entertaining it offers little more than a quick laugh.".

Semi is also interested in Bonggu and being a girl who is used to getting what she wants little can stop her from pursuing her interests. Sungeun of course also develops a crush for the young teacher but she is a bit intimidated because of her undeveloped body. However she pursues Bonggu doing such things as padding her bra pursuing a flasher to see what a penis looks like and even going to Bonggu's apartment and demanding that he have sex with her.Like the previous film Wet Dreams 2 is filled with lowbrow humor. Kang Bonggu farts every time he becomes sexually aroused which is quite often and while it might make the viewer giggle once or twice it becomes old quite quickly however it does produce one of the most humorous lines in the movie. After Sungeun learns that Kang Bonggu farts when he is sexually aroused she states If she Semi makes him fart then I am going to make him sht. Wet Dreams also has a bit of a creepy factor as well. Although the girls are all over eighteen in real life I was a bit uncomfortable with some scenes involving Semi and the physical education teacher who took a number of liberties with the girl such as slapping her on the butt a few times. These scenes reeked of sexual harassment although Semi didn't seem to mind.While better than the first film and with a noticeably higher budget Wet Dreams 2 falls into the same category of film as American Pie and the like. Therefore while it can be entertaining it offers little more than a quick laugh.";

There are things about it that could have been better thought out and some that had inaccuracy but once I suspended my belief it was quite enjoyable.The premise that Japan would start a war with Korea over the opening of the railroad at Dorasan and possible NS reunification was a bit farfetched but I guess as good of an excuse as any to use it worked into the plot pretty well. That Japan forged the JapanKorea Annexation Treaty using a fake state seal and that the real stamp was hidden has been argued for years so there is some validity for that being used in the movie.The assassination of Queen Min was a mixture of fact and fantasy in the movie. Reports from that time are that Japanese dressed up as Korean soldiers along with some disgruntled Korean soldiers took the Taewongun King Kojong's father to the palace at 3 a.m. on the night in question. When confronted by the palace guards the JapaneseKorean soldiers attacked easily overtaking the defenders. In the movie the Japanese were clearly dressed as Japanese although it is possible some really may have been dressed that way I tend to doubt it as Japan wanted it to look like the work of Koreans alone. Also how the queen died as reported by witnesses and how it was depicted in the movie are at odds. Witnesses report she hid in bushes outside the palace was stabbed several times and while still alive was violated wrapped in a blanket and set on fire. In the movie she defiantly confronted the Japanese and died fairly quickly from several sword stabs and slashes. The choice for the actress to play the queen was goodthe queen was a tough young lady and the actress played it well. However Kojong by many accounts was not such a strong person which is why the queen had so much control the actor played him as fairly tough and determined.Having Ahn Sungkee in the role of the president was pretty good he played the part before in another movie so he seemed confident. There were some other actors playing historical parts that were typecast but done pretty well.Again overall I thought it was an entertaining movie. I'll give it 710.".

In the movie she defiantly confronted the Japanese and died fairly quickly from several sword stabs and slashes. The choice for the actress to play the queen was goodthe queen was a tough young lady and the actress played it well. However Kojong by many accounts was not such a strong person which is why the queen had so much control the actor played him as fairly tough and determined.Having Ahn Sungkee in the role of the president was pretty good he played the part before in another movie so he seemed confident. There were some other actors playing historical parts that were typecast but done pretty well.Again overall I thought it was an entertaining movie. I'll give it 710.";

For the men there's the gorgeous Maria Montez OK so the boys will enjoy her too. For the ladies the costuming will simply amaze you. This film can be watched by everyone except small children a couple of killings  non graphic and 1 torture scene  also non graphic. Highly recommend for families with children 8 and over yrs old. Us older folks will enjoy it too. You can watch this many times. It won't get old.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had long wanted to revisit this one since my one and only viewing of it had occurred long ago back in the mid1980s and given that I am partial to Arabian Nights extravaganzas. Frankly I was very disappointed that Universal decided to issue this one on DVD by itself a couple of years ago instead of releasing a Franchise Collection comprising several of its equally colorful followups from the same studio in the end I didn't pick the disc up but in view of the problematic copy I eventually ended up with it would perhaps had been wiser if I did! In fact when I first acquired it on DivX there were severe lipsynch problems this was remedied when I eventually converted it onto DVDR but then there was intermittent jerkiness to the picture. Furthermore when I played it on my Pioneer model the picture froze with a loud buzzthankfully this was not repeated when I placed it into my cheaper DVD player and even the jitters were less conspicuous! Anyway this movie has a lot to answer for it was the ideal form of cinematic escapism for WWII picturegoers and reaped big box office returns for Universal which ensured that they went back to the desert of Arabia for many more times thereafter in the next decade or so. Despite the generic title the film isn't actually a filmic depiction of one of the classic stories but rather Universal's own concoction with every known ingredient thrown into the mix for added value so it is that historical figures HarounAlRaschid rub shoulders with mythical ones Sinbad Aladdin Scheherazade and are subverted or sanitized into the process. Dashing hero Jon Hall plays HarounAlRaschid as a deposed Caliph seeking to regain his throne usurped by his villainous and seemingly lovecrazed brother Leif Ericson the object of his unrequited affections is Scheherazade  which is actually misspelled in the credits!  played by the iconic Queen of Technicolor Maria Montez. Sinbad and Aladdin then are incongruously but humorously portrayed as amiable buffoons by familiar character actors John Qualen and Shemp Howard respectively the latter is always on the point of spinning one of his seafaring yarns yet again before being shut up by his illtempered circus employer Billy Gilbert! The third lead role is taken by exotic Indian star Sabu who had already visited this territory in the quintessential Arabian Nights tale and definitive film the magnificent Alexander Korda production of THE THIEF OF BAGDAD 1940 what the film under review lacks in comparison to the latter is the omission of wizardry and special effects.As I said this formula proved so successful that Universal reunited variations of the star combo several times afterwards  WHITE SAVAGE 1943 ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES 1944 COBRA WOMAN 1944 see above GYPSY WILDCAT 1944 SUDAN 1945 also helmed by Rawlins and TANGIER 1946. Another measure of its being welcome at the time of release is the fact that ARABIAN NIGHTS was nominated for 4 Academy Awards in these categories art directionset decoration cinematography this was Universal's first threestrip Technicolor production and over 60 years later the colors still leap off the screen music Frank Skinner's score is appropriately rousing and sound recording. In this context the choice of John Rawlins as director  best known for the rather weak SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR 1942  was a curious one but in hindsight he conducted the proceedings very capably.".

The actual book The Arabian Nights also known as The Book of One Thousand and One Nights was supposedly written by Princess Scheherazade and consists of many short stories she supposedly invented each night in order to save her life from her crazy husband. In this movie there is no reference to this and apart from some of the names of characters from the book such as Sinbad and Ali Baba there isn't much similarity between them. Additionally if you think too much and question the silliness of it all you'll probably hate the film since it is purely an escapist style filmnot too much unlike a movie serial condensed into 90 minutes. As for me I enjoyed the silly escapism and learned to ignore all the mistakes in the film and the rather limp love affair between Maria Montez and Jon Hall . It was nearly nonstop action and funcomplete with perhaps a bit too much slapstick provided by the very large stomach of Billy Gilbert. However I did enjoy the references to Sinbad and Ali Babaespecially because over and over Ali John Qualen would grab every lamp he found and rubbed it furiously hoping for a genie. Also it was nice to see Shemp Howard in one of his many appearances before going on to replace his brother Curley as a Stooge.If you liked this silly adventure film try watching Hall and Montez in COBRA WOMAN or Sabu in THE THIEF OF BAGHDADboth of which are better than ARABIAN NIGHTS.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the U.S.A. having just entered WWII the people were desperately searching for something to take their minds off of the horrors of war. Arabian Nights served that purpose. It was successful enough to spawn a number of similar films throughout the 1940s. Most were shot in the spectacular threestrip Technicolor process and had similar plots and casts..Make no mistake about it Arabian Nights is nothing more than a B adventure film dressed up in Technicolor with daring heroes beautiful women and slap stick comedy. The film could have done with out the ridiculous prologue and epilogue where a comedic looking sheik or something reads the story to a bunch of giggling members of a harem.The plot is simple. Caliph HarounAl Raschid Jon Hall has put down a revolt by his brother Kamar Leif Ericson and has him being tortured in the public square. Just as he is about to show his brother mercy the brother's supporters attack and free him. AlRaschid and his followers flee and he is wounded near a troupe of entertainers. He is found by Ali Ben Ali Sabu who protects his true identity. With AlRaschid believed dead Kamar assumes the throne.Within the entertainment group is the beautiful dancer Sherazade Maria Montez whom Ahmad loves and with whom AlRaschid also falls in love. Sherazade on the other hand seeks power by becoming the wife of the Caliph. AlRaschid is forced to conceal his identity until he can overthrow his brother. That's basically it.With Billy Gilbert Ahmad Shemp Howard Sinbad and John Qualen Aladdin around to provide the slapstick type humor the story becomes a little more than a Three Stooges comedy.The real villain of the piece is Edgar Barrier as Nadan the scheming trusted assistant to Kamar. He is ready to double cross anyone to achieve his goal of becoming Caliph himself. Turhan Bey plays a Captain of the guard who is equally treacherous. A thin Thomas Gomez stands out as the evil slave trader Hakim who tries to sell off the lovely Sherazade as a slave.Sabu made a career out of this sort of role as the friend of the hero who manages to slip in and out of trouble in a likable manner. Hall Montez and Bey would go on to make similar such sand and sandal adventure films in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "The breathtaking color photography wins massive acclaim here in the first of the Maria MontezJon HallSabu pairings where mostly American actors and certainly none of Arabic background put on traditional Islam attire and play dressup in this cartoonish adventure. Made with the mentality of teenaged boys this silly but often entertaining adventure is certainly outlandish but if you go in expecting realism you will be sorely disappointed. Not as well made as The Thief of Bagdad this still has enough spark to make for a 90 minute trip into the world of fantasy. It deals with two brothers who hate each other Hall and Leif Erickson fighting over the role of Caliph which Hall achieved through being the legitimate heir and Erickson has tried to claim through the assistance of loyal followers willing to resort to the most evil efforts in order to dethrone Hall. When first seen Erickson is strapped hanging in midair having tried to overthrow his brother with hungry vultures waiting for the moment of death to occur. Of course this never comes and when Hall visits his brother he shows a kindness which Erickson literally spits back into his face.Both Hall and Erickson are enamored of the beautiful dancer Montez who only wants to marry the true heir. When Erickson escapes Hall is suddenly injured through a sudden thrust of an arrow and Montez's acrobatic pal Sabu takes off his ring in an attempt to save his life. Not revealing his real identity the recovering Hall must now reclaim his throne and this leads to a battle between brothers to the death. In the meantime there's a ton of juvenile style comedy especially in the casting of Billy Gilbert as the head of Sabu's acrobatic troop. You know the only weapon Gilbert will most likely use is his big belly which as you guess gives an added sound effect every time he thrusts it out to boink somebody off of him. Then there's Shemp Howard as an aging Sinbad and John Qualen as an aging Aladdin still searching for his lost lamp. One funny moment has Qualen rubbing a lamp he's found and the apparent emergence of a genie.Still the scenestealer of this colorful caper is the always magnetic Sabu whose youthful personality and beautiful body are exposed while Hall seems to look on in envy. Sabu and Montez were created for movies like this and even when they become too silly to believe they retain a youthful innocence that makes them absolutely charming and a lot of fun to watch. It's always obvious how things are going to turn out and there is about as much realism and historical fact as there is the believability of the casting but ultimately that does not matter at all. World War II audiences thrived on fantastic stories like this and despicable villains that in the end we knew would be defeated and destroyed much like the villains that the allies were determined to defeat all over the world.".

In order to earn the money to get the operation he works at the docks loading rice before school. But when he discovers with the help of his quirky best friend that he can earn enough money by winning the Korean scholastic sumo championship he decides to give that a try. His superhuman strength makes him a formidable wrestler despite the fact that he is much smaller than the other wrestlers. He puts up with the taunts of his schoolmates and being ignored by his alcoholic father who neither likes nor understands his girlish son. His absent mother is much more understanding but is largely out of his life. He's also in love with his Japanese teacher who he believes will love him too once he becomes a woman. He wins over his sumo teammates be being a good wrestler and an even better dancer. The scene where he teaches his much larger teammate his dance moves is funny and sweet. The big guys bond in a way that is actually rather touching. I suppose the story is rather predictable but the performance of the lead is extraordinary and he projects a real sense of confidence that you wouldn't expect from some one in his character's position. He knows who he is and what he wants and nothing is going to stop him. The closing musical number is also a lot of fun. This is an excellent film that I really enjoyed.".

It's no wonder then that added tender loving care was given to its colourful cadre of carefully drawn characters that elevates it from being just another brave little film that's centred around an ideal. Besides having the benefit of seminating from proved pedigree Like A Virgin manages that rare distinction of actually being quite amusing despite succumbing to that very Korean Achilles' heel of parental melodrama. The truest moments of pleasure primarily stems from its protagonist Oh Donggu's Ryu Deokhwan absurd responses to his chauvinistic reality and his flights of fancy involving an attractive teacher. For the most part the film does approach society without preconceptions allowing itself a fair bit of leeway for fluff and fantasy. There's a sense that its secondary characters become too much of a handful when there's a discernible almost portentous shift in tone whenever Donggu's miserable louse of a father shows up upsetting the thoughtful equilibrium of its comedy that does occasionally become reminiscent of Masayuki Suo's Sumo Do Sumo Don't.".

It's true the characters were not fully developed but it wasn't about the people in the band. It was about the band the authority they subverted and their affect on the young people. Yes it's an old story the powers that be attempt to stop the those kids and their crazy music which in this case could lead to the takeover of South Korea by Communism and as such it's timeless. Although the music is some sort of soulRR I found the band's energy and attitude more reminiscent of the dawn of punk rock.I couldn't help but feel sorry for the audience as The Devils made their debut in Seoul as they sat there quietly not having a clue what to make of them. Enter Mimi the luminous and occasionally pouty Sin Minah with her costumes and dance moves and the public becomes mesmerized.I thought the film took a turn for the worse with the obligatory band member death followed by the brutal treatment of the police in its attempts to end this youthful exuberance by grabbing the longhairs and jailing them. But it just serves to unite the disintegrating band against a common enemy.This movie is not just about a band. It's about the eternal struggle of youth versus authority. The music is fun musician turned actor Cha Seungwoo is a standout. With the exception of Mimi none of the characters were particularly likable but I still had no trouble rooting for The Devils' fight and for the kids of Seoul who escaped to their music every late night. The reunion show is a fantastic climax.And of course you can't forget the three beautiful GoGo dancers they just add to the energy of the film.".

You can in fact apply the formula that most band movies have to this movie. Without spoiling too much it does have the standard things come full circle ending.Possibly the biggest problem with the movie was the music. Used are various 60s70spredisco era American music which is fine considering context but the selections aren't great when couple with the singers and the songs contribute nothing to the plot. In fact the entire setting is unnecessary and could have easily taken place in modern day. This makes any importance that music had at that time in South Korea seem trivial and detaches the viewer from the experience of the film.Acting was fine if a little bit forced.

	schema:reviewBody "33year old director Jaeeun Jeong's Take Care of my Cat is a perceptive coming of age film about five young Korean women trying to cope with the transition from high school to the adult world. Though a bit overlong and somewhat disjointed it is an honest work that avoids genre clichs of sex drugs and even boyfriends. The film received a major award at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2002 but did not gain proper recognition until its DVD release this year. The title refers to a stray kitten Tee tee which is passed between the five girls and as circumstances pull their lives apart serves as a connection between them. Set in the City of Inchon the bleak workingclass environment establishes the mood of the film. According to the director Inchon is a city with many immigrants who came during the war or in the 70s during industrialization. It is a city full of wanderers that matched my characters who were outsiders. The girls are in constant movement. Whirling through the city on subways and buses between work clubs and restaurants we get a sense of their optimism and energy. Programmed to play entire melodies their cellphones ring constantly as the girls coordinate their meetings and activities. In a clever gimmick the director floats the text messages on the screen in bus windows and building walls. While it took me a while to get to know each character each one has a strong and distinctive personality and by the end I felt a part of their lives. Haejoo Yowon Lee is the most outgoing and self confident but can be selfabsorbed and insensitive to others. Through connections made by her affluent family she lands a job as an assistant in a brokerage firm. Although aware of the fact that she is a lowwage earner without much of a future at the company she becomes fashionconscious carries a Louis Vuitton bag and is acutely conscious of her appearance spending money on laser surgery for her eyes. When she moves to Seoul to advance her career it further strains the relationship with the others. Jiyoung Jiyoung OK is the opposite a softspoken sensitive young woman who lives in the poorest section of town with her grandparents in a rundown shack and cannot find a good job. She lacks the means to develop her considerable potential as a designer artist and is prone to moods of sadness and withdrawal. Taehee in an outstanding performance by Doona Bae is the glue that holds the friendships together by arranging meetings and bringing people together.Taehee works for her father in his traditional hotrock healing spa and in her spare time types for a poet afflicted with cerebral palsy who has developed strong feelings for her. Twins Biryu Eunshil Lee and Ohnjo Eunjoo Lee play minor roles as they try to scrape together a living hawking jewelry on the street but their characters seem included more for comic relief than to further the plot. The girl's world seems strange to the older generations but the harsh reality of survival is constant their ambitions often at odds with the maledominated society. Jiyoung wants to be a textile designer but is unable to go to school Haejoo wants a respectable job in the business world and Taehee dreams of escaping from the suffocating restrictions of her family though recognizing that running away is so tacky. She comes into open conflict with her family in a restaurant when her traditional father rather than admitting he can't read the menu orders the most popular dish for everyone. Tension arises between Haejoo and Jiyoung when Haejoo invites everyone to go on a shopping spree even though she knows that Jiyoung may feel left out. Taehee is the most supportive and is there for Jiyoung when tragedy strikes willing to do whatever is necessary to support her. Take Care of my Cat has no peak dramatic moments no plot contrivances that propel us toward certain emotional responses only the sad undercurrent of the inevitability of change in a confusing world. Backed by the moody electronic sound track by Kim Jincheol and Byul I found Take Care of my Cat to be a moving experience. Jaeeun Jeong does not provide easy answers as to the direction the girls will take but by avoiding cynicism she allows us to see their life in terms of possibility.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie works on two levels basically the story that happens and also as a subtle progressive social commentary about the state of korea and how women are somewhat confined and the minor injustices they face all the time. I wouldn't go so far as to call it feminist because what alot of the movie is dealing with is just the basic struggle for existence and how each of the girls can fit into the world somehow.The story at first begins somewhat boring as its unclear what the purposes of the movie are but around 20 minutes into the movie when Hyeju rejects JiYoung's gift of the cat and then later fails to meet her on time at a restaurant it is clear that the movie is finally starting to move with its plot in some noticeable direction. And the way it does so is very smooth and well directed you slowly become immersed in the intricate details of thier world which is a fundamental quality of a of a good movie. As a drama it does its job of immersing the viewer in the emotions of its characters. I think it is a definitely progressive style drama as many other coming of age styled dramas are and is enjoyable to watch throughout because you are always getting a realistic look at modern korean life as the story moves.Worth watching!".

I wouldn't go so far as to call it feminist because what alot of the movie is dealing with is just the basic struggle for existence and how each of the girls can fit into the world somehow.The story at first begins somewhat boring as its unclear what the purposes of the movie are but around 20 minutes into the movie when Hyeju rejects JiYoung's gift of the cat and then later fails to meet her on time at a restaurant it is clear that the movie is finally starting to move with its plot in some noticeable direction. And the way it does so is very smooth and well directed you slowly become immersed in the intricate details of thier world which is a fundamental quality of a of a good movie. As a drama it does its job of immersing the viewer in the emotions of its characters. I think it is a definitely progressive style drama as many other coming of age styled dramas are and is enjoyable to watch throughout because you are always getting a realistic look at modern korean life as the story moves.Worth watching!";

	schema:reviewBody "Goyangileul butaghae aka Take Care of my Cat JEONG Jaeeun 2001Cat tells the story of five young women one year after their high school graduation. It focuses particularly on three of them Taehee played by BAE Doona  an upper middleclas girl who feels trapped by her rather philistine family  who works for free for the family business and as a volunteer typist for a young poet afflicted with severe cerebral palsy Haejoo played by LEE Yowon  a somewhat lower middleclass girl who has a job as a trainee in a brokerage firm and has dreams of unencumbered upwards mobility with all the attendant opportunities for conspicuous consumption and Jiyoung played by OK Jiyoung  an orphan who lives with her impoverished grandparents in a rather squalid slum dwelling who wants to study textile design but currently can't find any work at all to help supplement the meager family income. The other two girls are the twins Biryu and Ohnjo played by LEE Eunshil and Eunjoo currently working as street vendors selling homemade jewelry all strung with the highest grade fishing line.Like Ozu's films this movie SEEMS virtually plotless  but beyond describing the overall situation which I did above I find it impossible to say much about the plot content that couldn't spoil a new viewer's enjoyment of the many little twists and turns of the story. Let it suffice to say that all three of our key characters suffer a number of vicissitudes during the relatively short time span covered by the film.After watching this a second and third time I noted something that had not registered at the time of my first viewing. The film very much reminds me in a number of ways of recent Aki Kaurismaki films especially Drifting Clouds and Man Without a Past which was released AFTER Cat. JEONG and her cinematographer CHOI Yeongkwan also a relative beginner show the same ability to present what OUGHT to be ugly urban settings in a way that gives them an unexpected sense of beauty with no trace of artificial prettification. The humor is JEONG's script is mostly rather deadpan passing by with no attempt to play it up. And she shows a deep affection and respect for her characters even for Haejoo who can test the patience of both her friends and the viewers of the film with her arrogant selfcenteredness. Finally the finale of the film is rather reminiscent of that of the Kaurismaki films I mentioned already saying more would definitely be a spoiler  if this vague circumlocution is a spoiler in itself  accept my regrets.One final word the five young actresses featured here are absolutely splendid one and all. And if there is any justice is the cinematic world at least one of them BAE Doona should be destined for greatness.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a wonderful film. Take Care of My Cat has been something I've been eyeing for a long time and I finally bought the DVD of it.  I thought it was an excellent film and was very well made.The film is directed by newcomer JEONG Jaeeun. The movie stars BAE Doona the Ring Virus as Taehee LEE Yowon Attack the Gas Station as Haejoo newcomer OK Jiyoung as Jiyoung and twins LEE Eunsil and LEE Eunju Asako in Ruby Shoes as Biryu and Ohnjo. All five of the girls are relative newcomers but they all played their parts with great confidence. I was especially impressed with BAE Doona and OK Jiyoung. Their characters' relationship seemingly formed out of necessity and circumstance grew stronger through shared thoughts and misfortune.In the film Jiyoung discovers a stray cat and soon takes it into her care. At Haejoo's birthday party Jiyoung gives the cat to her as a gift. Not even a week after Haejoo a busy corporate girl who is doing the best to survive in a less than satisfactory position gives the cat back to Jiyoung. Throughout the course of the film the cat eventually makes her way through the hands of all five characters each giving her up when changes in their lives force them to do so. The cat is used not to move the plot forward but to externalize the movement of struggle in the lives of the girls. The girls left with the cat in the very end the twins Biryu and Ohnjo are the only ones whose lives require changes that are already present in their lives. Their ending up with the cat symbolizes their confidence with their position in the world. To the others the cat remains a part of the world that they are leaving behind.The movie itself works extremely well. The five girls are all very realistically portrayed all trying to find their place in a world that is different than they had hoped it would be. Both Taehee and Jiyoung live in less than satisfactory conditions and the viewer observes these two trying to make the best of what they have. Nothing is dwelled on forever in this film. Director JEONG Jaeeun instead uses simple observation of events in the present lives of the two to frame the characters' past existence and give them a reason to leave their lives and move into the world. Sometimes this can be through tragedy or sometimes by choice but the justification to pack up and leave is always given.I especially liked the music done by MF. It was almost German sounding and fit the mood of the film perfectly. Although most of the music was diegetic or coming from a source on screen like a radio the nondiegetic MF music was used during turning points in the character's lives or to frame their existence in the world.Some may consider Take Care of My Cat a chick flick and with no less than five main female stars and a very confident female director this could easily have turned into another Sex in the City focusing on nothing but men and sex. It doesn't however and instead loses itself in the complexities of everyday life and the struggle between one's dreams and the reality one must face on a daily basis. The films ending while abrupt and a little too open shows that one must take chances in life instead of remaining where one has been told is the right place to be.Overall this is a great film. It may not be a film for everybody but I found it to be very beautiful to watch. The directing is superb with great framing and pacing. The acting is also very good and seemed very natural. I highly recommend it. It also looks like it will be getting a US theatrical release as well so be sure to check it out. The Korean DVD set is also worth it and includes two short films by the director.1010".

The transitions in their relationships and closeness with each other as they each go their separate way and through their own dilemmas is realistic enough to sometimes make one feel depressed as to how childhood friends grow apart and how adulthood changes the chemistry and makeup of the magic that once was.  As an westerner I must say that I have found a real love of Korean film  it's fresh and different and seems to be in a renaissance period at the moment.  When I think of some of these films having their scripts translated directly to English and played by English speaking actors I find there probably wouldn't be anything special about them. But in their native form with the backdrop of Seoul and the culture they are a refreshing and mind provoking break from the drudgery of American cinema. The story is quite a simple layout but the issues that they each deal with no matter how 'everyday life' they appear are complex to each character just as life truly is.I really enjoyed this film.  I especially liked the innovative way that the director used the cell phone usage between the girls graphically.  The way when they were texting each other he would incorporate it in writing on the side of a building or across a table.  It fit perfectly with the film and didn't jar it or seem out of place.  He also incorporated this for when one of the girls scenes when she is typing for a poet with cerebal palsy.  A really unique use of how to truly convey the daily use of text messaging in Korean society.Like I said I really enjoyed this film.  A stimulating break from most of the choices I find myself having to watch in this country and a great coming of agedealing with the pressures of identity and the grown up world film.".

	schema:headline " Interesting coming of age story with a few good performances and good direction from Jeong but weak in several important areas to the film's overall detriment";
	schema:reviewBody "A group of female school friends find their lives change when they all are out of education and either in jobs or looking for work. After coming together for a birthday party the friends start to drift apart. HaeJoo heads to Seoul to take a job that quickly starts to take over her life while her other friends feeling abandoned and separated are left to take stock of their relationships and lives. As the group starts to drift apart TaeHee and JiYoung start to become closer than they were and try to plan out their lives.When a film is subtitled from a foreign language it is easy to praise it for being excellent when really it is just 'good' likewise it is easy to want to see a film because of the country of origin and not on the merits of the film itself. Finally it is easy to forgive a foreign film for weaknesses or standards that we would frown upon in an American film. I don't know quite why this is  maybe because so few people see these films or it is hard to see them so we want to sound cineliterate and intelligent by seeing 'a great little foreign film' and maybe we blind ourselves to it a little  I know I do it I loved Swiri when really it was just an enjoyable Americanstyle action movie nothing more. So with this film I didn't sit to watch it because of the story but mainly because it was from South Korea and I have seen several from this country recently and liked them.The IMDb reviews for this film generally fall into the trap of forgiving a film for things that you wouldn't forgive an American film for and as such are quite gushing on the whole. This is not to say that it is no good but rather than it is only 'good' and not some wondrous piece of art! The plot is fairly loose and is more character driven than anything else and in this way it suits the style and tone that the film sets out very early on. The freewheeling film would have been better if the film had hit a more realistic and engaging script. The characters are OK but not all of the five or so main characters are easy to get to know  I ended up finding TaeHee easiest to care about and HaeJoo the easiest to understand mainly because her lowpaid hardworked administrator is universally recognisable. The characters are still interesting and make for an OK tale about the difficult stage where school friends drift the workplace takes over the majority of your hours and you find you life changing but it is no more than good for the majority.The script could have been much sharper and the characters much better written and this would have been a much better film as a result. At this point I will admit that perhaps I didn't get a lot of it due to not being aware of the culture that the characters were in but to be honest I think the story is fairly applicable across cultures with only maybe the influence of parental pressures having greater importance. The way the story heads in the final third also betrays what started as a pretty realistic picture of the life of the twenty year olds by going places that seem to have been done in the name of creating more narrative and dramatic flow. The script does manage to convey the chatter and general hustlebustle of city life with the use of text messaging mobile phones and ring tones well done in capturing those still young enough to enjoy the world of pop ring tones while also finding themselves with the income to waste on them!The cast mostly do well but the lion's share of the film is given to three actresses. Yuwon Lee is good but the script paints her a toosimple character in HaeJoo and she is left to deliver the obvious rather than the insightful. As the heart of the group or at least the story Duna Bae is likable and does well with conveying her mix of sadness loss hope and happiness. OK is unconvincing as Jiyoung and is too difficult to get inside as a character. The Lee twins are used just as twins and have no meat on their characters at all  the film lets them drift in and out of view so easily that I wondered why it hadn't gone for a scaled down story and made it about 3 friends instead of 5. Director Jeong makes the film look and feel very interesting with nice use of split screens and a clever display of text messages etc. Her collection of award winning shorts shows she has talent in this area but like many directors of shorts the step up to features has seen problems exposed that a short film by their very nature would conceal. The title and end credits are imaginative and enjoyable even if the style at the end makes it hard to read any names  maybe bothering those that worked on it but not me since they were all in Korean.If my review sounds overly negative maybe I am accidentally overcompensating for the praise it has had from others. I did like the film but I must admit that it was quite weak in many regards. The basic plot works at the start but the writing is not good enough to sustain a character driven story while later narrative twists just take away from what should have been a touching story set in reality. Worth seeing once as a coming of age story but not worthy of the praise it has garnered from some circles and not one I'll be rushing back to for a second viewing.".

It's a drama indeed a subtle one there's no dying lover or at any point will you be at tears. The movie left me unsatisfied it didn't really seem to have a plot to me but if I had to describe it I'd say its about the trials and tribulations of becoming an independent person on your own and then realizing that you have friends and friends are there to support you on your ups and downs.

The premise actually sort of reminded me of The Forbidden Kingdom except way more ridiculous because despite traveling back in time the story doesn't revolve around any mystical stuff. And this movie takes place in japan instead of china. But like I said it's a movie your just going to have to just go with or else your really going to dislike it like the character Shinichi Kawakami's mother in the movie who just automatically accepts what is going on. When the movie takes place during Sengokuera it just didn't seem all that realistic it felt sort of like a live action Disney movie even the interaction between characters seemed a bit childish at times. But than again this was probably aimed to be a family movie and let's just say the acting was pretty terrible for this type of movie and even for a family movie. The problem about this movie is that it goes in a really clich direction from the dialogue to the directions of the characters and everything else. And the movie just seemed to really drag with the characters just constantly infatuated with different time zones which is understandable but it's just really dragged on in this with nothing much going on. Even if it's a family movie little kids will probably get bored about 30 minutes into the movie probably even less. There really isn't any good character development and the chemistry between the little boy and his surroundings wasn't developed very well either. The build up isn't good and there is little to almost not attachment. The plot is about a modern boy going back in time and building courage but there is hardly a moment to build his courage and it's more leaning towards stupidity instead of bravery. Although it's a bummer the blend of the characters from modern time with the Sengokuera time isn't done really well I sort of enjoyed the last 50 or so minutes of the movie very slightly. Probably just because of the inspirational music and emotion even if the battle scenes got worse as it progressed.4.510".

Lethal alien spider meets up local natives and crew and spontaneously catch them and begins to consume people. The spider rapidly multiplies and the protagonists confronting with it .This chiller with middling budget packs thrills chills some good action and few funny moments. It's a hybrid of monster movies from the 50s such as 'Tarantula' and modern American production such as 'Depredator'. The thrilling screenplay is a bit yawninspiring but nifty special effects will keep you from dozing off its author is Steve Johnson he's a nice creature effects designer a perfect craftsman who made effects in 'Spiderman II'  'Species II'  ' Blade II'  and ' War of worlds '  among others. On the whole this is a suspenseful and tense thriller especially at the amazing ending tableau when Chris Potter and Alex Reid have to tackle the gigantic spider at the lair in the final. The tale is well produced by Brian Yuzna and Julio Fernandez owners of Fantastic Factory productions a successful terror movies company. The motion picture is professionally directed by Jack Sholder with rather too much camera movement and there are also lots of lowangle shots of people hanging around waiting to get bitten by the carnivorous spider. Although nothing which haven't been seen before this is not the picture to watch if you are scared of spiders  however the movie is quite entertaining. Utterly arachnophobia people must flee this film.Other movies about those bugs are the following  Tarantula1955 by Jack Arnold with John Agar Tarantula the deadly cargo1977 with Claude Akins Kingdom of spiders77 by John Budd Cardos with William Shatner and Arachnophobia1990 by Frank Marshall with John Goodman.".

And despite a lot of fodder always a good sign to many deaths seem off screen or at least over a little quickly. The movie also could have used some gratuitous nudity If young thing Alex Reid wasn't willing at least allow Spanish star Neus Asensi to release those puppies like she has done in the past. Those quibbles aside I couldn't help but cheer when the puppeteers took the Volkswagen sized spider out for the spin in the second half of the movie.

Much of the film consists of build up with a bit of gore dropped in every so often.  Unless you are terrified of spiders this film won't scare you at all.  I can't say enough of things about Alex Reid who plays Mercer the lead female heroine.  She is incredibly attractive and sexy.  Most of the film she is dressed a la Tomb Raider style if not less.  I believe this is the only film she has done so far but hopefully we can see more in the future.

Luckily though nobody was horribly bad or annoying. The spider and centipedes I'm still wondering why there were giant centipedes in this movie... looked pretty decent. Well decent since I assume this movie had a fairly low budget. Except at the end when the spider starts running really fast along the walls of a cave. That just looked horrible.Im not gonna lie and tell you about the storyline. To be honest I wasnt exactly paying attention that much. It appears that an alien spaceship crashes on a small island and it was carrying a giant spider...or maybe it mutated a spider and made it giant. Then a team goes on an expedition into the jungles to find it. Thats all I got.An enjoyable film but I wouldnt suggest buying it. In fact renting it is kind of going overboard. Maybe wait for it on TV sometime. Thats what I did and I was satisfied.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of the 50s big monster movies like THEM! and their morerecent counterparts films like ANACONDA and especially the TREMORS series. So when I saw a sneak preview of ARACHNID at the Fangoria Weekend of Horrors convention a year ago and being that I'm also someone who likes to give a lot of lowbudget directtovideo movies a chance I knew I'd have to check it out.The setup is simple enough in the best 50s monster movie tradition a team of scientists and exmilitary types travel to a remote island to find the source of a mysterious new virus and in the process come face to face with a giant webspinning terror. The trailer suggested a Godzillasized spider. Instead it's about eight feet tall and maybe ten feet long. Due to the thick accents of some of the foreign characters several costars are from Spain where some of the movie was shot the dialogue is at times rather difficult to understand. There's the usual conflicts between characters the character with a hidden agenda for tagging along etc. If you're familiar with the old monster movies you'll probably recognize these standards. The film takes its sweet time getting going and the spider after a brief halfobscured appearance near the beginning doesn't fully appear until nearly an hourandfiveminutes into the film. When you have a movie in which the star is the big title monster that monster had better show up before the thirtyfortyminute mark. Otherwise interest begins to wander as it did with me. But I hung there despite the boring moments in which characters walk off in the middle of the night after they've seen what happens to people who do the same characters argue characters complain and the main military guy and pilot slowly bond. Once the spider is finally revealed to the characters' amazement and horror the suspense is upped a little bit leading to a frenzy climax in which the pilot and two more men you thought for sure had died having gone off to establish communication to call for help show up to fight back. And of course there's the final shot that screams Sequel!Chris Potter from TV's KUNG FU THE LEGEND CONTINUES makes an appealing hero even if he's not given much to do other than stand around shout orders and fire an M16. Alex Reid who plays the pilot isn't particularly convincing as a tough girl perhaps it was the director's fault but at least she looks nice and like Potter does what she can with the material. I think she would have made a much better Lara Croft than Angelina Jolie. Reid literally looked like Croft in several scenes. The rest are unknowns in stock cardboard roles the likeable slightlygoofy spider expert the scientist his assistant Potter's partners and a handful of native helpers who all are there to serve one purpose spider food. Surprisingly the mechanical effects of the spider are pretty well done for such a film though a few moments of CGI near the climax and at the start of the film are a little on the cheapo side. With a few more understandable actors a quicker pace and some tighter direction ARACHNID might have been at least a mildlyenjoyable time waster perfect for a dull Saturday night. I admit that I have seen worse movies but as it is seeing it once was enough for me.".

And not only are they not CGI but they look excellent too. This is what makes this movie so enjoyable. Through out the movie our heros explore the jungle while trying not to become monster munchies.

	schema:headline " Lots of monster action but it's not all good";
	schema:reviewBody "A familiar tale is given a familiar retelling a middle of the road monster movie which starts off pretty well before degenerating into the typical actionorientated scenario where precise plotting goes out of the window character traits are forgotten and everyone runs around in the jungle trying to avoid getting chewed on by the hungry bad guys. This colourful production at least has a good pedigree behind it it's the second production from Brian Yuzna's Spanish Hammerwannabes Fantastic Factory and the direction is by none other than THE HIDDEN's Jack Scholder. As Yuzna and THE HIDDEN are both established favourites of mine I found myself looking forward to this movie a lot the second from Fantastic Factory after the failure of FAUST and a more traditional Bmovie story. I was disappointed for the most part but the film is not without the odd moment of interest here and there.After the opening titles  the longest I've seen and accounting for about a dozen different production companies  things are looking pretty good in the movie. We get plane wrecks an invisible UFO and even a weirdlooking alien creature making a guest appearance before the plot begins for real. The characters are the usual clichd bunch but with a definite Hispanic feel with only four nonSpanish members of the cast. The dialogue is adequate for the movie and there are a couple of interesting characters amongst the native redshirts the extras in STAR TREK who always died token black character and stereotyped macho types. The first is the tetchy doctor Leon not a villain but sometimes close. Then we have Ravil Isyanov OCTOPUS once again amusing as the scientist member of the party and Alex Reid complete with gratuitous underwear scene as the feisty female lead. Although I didn't personally care for Reid's sullen performance it's certainly the best in the movie and miles above Chris Potter's bland male hero.The film is colourful throughout and makes fine use of the jungle locations. The first half is reminiscent of the oldfashioned jungle adventure movie complete with plentiful dangers and lots of big guys shooting machine guns around into the bushes like in PREDATOR. We're awarded with some cool attacks by mutant creatures  a huge centipedesalamander thingy some horrible ticks and warnings of a nastier creature a giant spider. They also throw in a predictable nightmare sequence and some unwanted sentimental guff to keep it going. At this point Yuzna and crew including SFX ace Steve Johnson throw in the film's highlight an ultragory death involving a man's body getting invaded by ticks which then pop out of his mouth chest and finally his eyeball in an ultrasplattery moment of graphic gore. Anyone who's seen Yuzna's previous TICKS will know what to expect  this guy truly loves bodily intrusion and destruction.Once the spider makes an appearance the film takes a downward turn and loses what little intelligence it possessed in the first half attention to detail personalities realism etc.. The latter half of the film consists of cast members getting picked off one by one by the barelyseen menace which itself is a pretty poor creation. Aside from a gruesome moment with a guy being cocooned the deaths are all quick and precise and disappointingly tame. They make up for it with gobbets of gristle and slime so insecthaters take care. The end of the film is incredibly contrived and not all that interesting as the indestructible spider finally meets its maker and the survivors stagger off into the horizon. ARACHNID is worth watching for the first half of the film and the truly nasty tick death scene but needs switching off when the spider makes an appearance and it just becomes a tame embarrassment.".

	schema:headline " A cheesy good time";
	schema:reviewBody "Arachnid isn't that bad of a creature feature.SPOILERSLauren Mercer Alex Reid a pilot agrees to lead an expedition by Dr. Samuel Leon Jose Sancho his assistant Susana Nues Asensi spider specialist Henry Capri Ravil Issyanov and guide Lev Valentine Chris Potter into a small Pacific Island to determine the cause of a deadly epidemic. Crashlanding on the island they decide to do some exploring where one member is bitten by a strange spider and begins to be eaten from the inside out. Coming upon a native village for help they find it decimated and nearly destroyed. The attacks have not stopped it seems and it maybe a mutated species of spider found by Henry that is causing the attacks. When the suspicions are proved true they try to get off the island alive.The Good News Sure it's predictable derivative and has some pretty cheesy effects but fans of these movies have come to expect that sort of thing to one degree or another. The giant spider is actually rather good and suitably menacing especially it's overall design. When it's dripping acid and wrapping people up in steelstrength cocoons it is genuinely creepy. It's just different enough from the normal look that it's memorable yet sticks close enough that it's still a recognizable shape. The FX team should be praised for the fact that they chose to go with an animatronicsbased model rather than CGI. Also there's a couple nice gory setpieces spread throughout. There's a character sprayed with acid sap in the face and several mangled carcasses strewn around yet the majority of violence onscreen is against the spiders. They're pretty badly injured throughout making for some surprising gore. The highlight though is a particularly nasty attack by some meddlesome ticks which burrow under the skin and then bloodily erupt following some obviously unhealthy white vomiting. It's a strong image that thankfully saves the film. The attack on the outpost near the end features some nice action sequences and a couple of shocks.

	onyx:emotionText "Arachnid isn't that bad of a creature feature.SPOILERSLauren Mercer Alex Reid a pilot agrees to lead an expedition by Dr. Samuel Leon Jose Sancho his assistant Susana Nues Asensi spider specialist Henry Capri Ravil Issyanov and guide Lev Valentine Chris Potter into a small Pacific Island to determine the cause of a deadly epidemic. Crashlanding on the island they decide to do some exploring where one member is bitten by a strange spider and begins to be eaten from the inside out. Coming upon a native village for help they find it decimated and nearly destroyed. The attacks have not stopped it seems and it maybe a mutated species of spider found by Henry that is causing the attacks. When the suspicions are proved true they try to get off the island alive.The Good News Sure it's predictable derivative and has some pretty cheesy effects but fans of these movies have come to expect that sort of thing to one degree or another. The giant spider is actually rather good and suitably menacing especially it's overall design. When it's dripping acid and wrapping people up in steelstrength cocoons it is genuinely creepy. It's just different enough from the normal look that it's memorable yet sticks close enough that it's still a recognizable shape. The FX team should be praised for the fact that they chose to go with an animatronicsbased model rather than CGI. Also there's a couple nice gory setpieces spread throughout. There's a character sprayed with acid sap in the face and several mangled carcasses strewn around yet the majority of violence onscreen is against the spiders. They're pretty badly injured throughout making for some surprising gore. The highlight though is a particularly nasty attack by some meddlesome ticks which burrow under the skin and then bloodily erupt following some obviously unhealthy white vomiting. It's a strong image that thankfully saves the film. The attack on the outpost near the end features some nice action sequences and a couple of shocks. With an air of cheese surrounding it this isn't that bad of creature feature.The Bad News This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but it still has a couple of things wrong with it.

It encounters a quasi invisible UFO and ends up colliding with it after the plane's electronics go off line. The pilot ejects and the plane and UFO crash on an island in the Celebes. He finds wreckage of the UFO after he lands by chute and catches a glimpse of an alien being killed by another alien possibly an animal on board. The second alien then kills the pilot and the plot is set up.Fast forward 10 months and a group is going to the island to investigate a mysterious illness that appears to be related to some type of bite.The rest is fairly routine but the acting is better than average for the two main stars. Well better than average for these types of movies.There is a fair amount of CGI work more than I would have expected on this budget. The special effects are better than usual as well although we still have the occasional plot hole you can drive a semi through.All in all not a bad flick for a Saturday afternoon when you don't want to spend time thinking.".

	schema:headline " Not quite so good to be called a hidden gem but definitely a lot of fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Arachnid may not be a great film and in fact it starts off pretty rocky but it gets better as it progresses and what it does right makes it worth a viewing. The story follows a rescue group traveling to a remote island where the inhabitants have been dying mysteriously. Once on the island the crew discover that it is populated by strange creatures which appear to be hybrids between spiders and other native forms of life. The creatures are not spiders at all though the whole incident has been caused by an alien ship crashing onto the island. The accident has released a rapidly evolving strain of spiderlike aliens and they are quickly picking off the human population. Before they know it this rescue mission has become a fight for survival.When I say the movie starts off rough I mean really rough. Most of the effects used to create the creatures are practical which is a very good thing but at the beginning we see the alien ship and it is created used some computer effects that are not good at all. It's unfortunate because not only does the scene where the ship crashes look amateurish but it doesn't add anything to the story. There's no real mystery about what is happening on the island you know right from the beginning that it's alien spiders. There's a minor sub plot where the crew's pilot Mercer Alex Reid is looking for her brother which we know is the pilot that first encounters the arachnid creatures but it's more of a tossup between is he dead or mutated into a horrible spider monster than anything. Either way you know she's not going to see her brother again. The beginning of the movie is also plagued with terrible dialog and some wooden acting. Once again if you get past the first 30 minutes or so it mostly goes away. Maybe I just got used to it but either way I didn't notice it so much and the movie does get significantly better over time.The biggest strength of the movie is the variety of creatures and the special effects. Because the arachnid alien creature is trying to adapt to the environment it's got a variety of spawns that are pretty cool to see. There are some oversized spiders some snakespider hybrids creepy ticklike creatures that burrow under your skin and let's not forget the boss monster itself. These creatures are all created using stop motion elaborate puppets or cleverly shot miniatures and they're all pretty impressive and very cool to see. You'll likely be disappointed that there isn't a sequel where we get to see additional creatures actually. That's not to say that the special effects are perfect. The budget does show particularly during the beginning and during scenes where we can see the main arachnid alien crawling around on walls and such. It looks just fine but the speed at which its limbs move isn't quite right. If you ever look at insects move they have a really unsettling jittery way of moving their limbs. It almost looks like your eye is too slow to capture the movements and all you see are random snippets kind of like watching people move to a strobe light and the movements of the main spider just doesn't look as good as it would have if these movements had been done using modern special effects.Another positive are the characters in the movie. Well I should say select characters. Several members of the crew sent on the island consist of natives that don't speak English and are basically given no dialog or characterization whatsoever. You can bet these guys are just spider food. The main characters though they're competent when it comes to the situations they're stuck in and interesting enough that you do want to see them make it out alive. It makes a big difference in the scary moments.I also want to discuss one bit in the movie that was really clever. So you know how in every horror movie the group has to split up so they can cover more groundget eaten when they become isolated? Well this movie does that but instead of the second group just getting killed off they actually rejoin the survivors of the spider attacks towards the end of the film. That means you get that tension of the group getting smaller and smaller as the bodies pile up only to get a boost of potential victims towards the end. If you are an aspiring filmmaker I strongly recommend you check this movie out to see the little touches it did well.For all the praise I'm giving the movie I have to admit it really isn't that great overall. It feels like the film needed to go through one more proof read to tighten up some of the loose ends and move this from a better than expected movie to a hidden gem. It isn't great but if you see this one at the video store for a dollar or you spot an ol' VHS copy at a garage sale it's worth a look. Just forgive that terrible intro and you're in for some fun.

	onyx:emotionText "Arachnid may not be a great film and in fact it starts off pretty rocky but it gets better as it progresses and what it does right makes it worth a viewing. The story follows a rescue group traveling to a remote island where the inhabitants have been dying mysteriously. Once on the island the crew discover that it is populated by strange creatures which appear to be hybrids between spiders and other native forms of life. The creatures are not spiders at all though the whole incident has been caused by an alien ship crashing onto the island. The accident has released a rapidly evolving strain of spiderlike aliens and they are quickly picking off the human population. Before they know it this rescue mission has become a fight for survival.When I say the movie starts off rough I mean really rough. Most of the effects used to create the creatures are practical which is a very good thing but at the beginning we see the alien ship and it is created used some computer effects that are not good at all. It's unfortunate because not only does the scene where the ship crashes look amateurish but it doesn't add anything to the story. There's no real mystery about what is happening on the island you know right from the beginning that it's alien spiders. There's a minor sub plot where the crew's pilot Mercer Alex Reid is looking for her brother which we know is the pilot that first encounters the arachnid creatures but it's more of a tossup between is he dead or mutated into a horrible spider monster than anything. Either way you know she's not going to see her brother again. The beginning of the movie is also plagued with terrible dialog and some wooden acting. Once again if you get past the first 30 minutes or so it mostly goes away. Maybe I just got used to it but either way I didn't notice it so much and the movie does get significantly better over time.The biggest strength of the movie is the variety of creatures and the special effects. Because the arachnid alien creature is trying to adapt to the environment it's got a variety of spawns that are pretty cool to see. There are some oversized spiders some snakespider hybrids creepy ticklike creatures that burrow under your skin and let's not forget the boss monster itself. These creatures are all created using stop motion elaborate puppets or cleverly shot miniatures and they're all pretty impressive and very cool to see. You'll likely be disappointed that there isn't a sequel where we get to see additional creatures actually. That's not to say that the special effects are perfect. The budget does show particularly during the beginning and during scenes where we can see the main arachnid alien crawling around on walls and such. It looks just fine but the speed at which its limbs move isn't quite right. If you ever look at insects move they have a really unsettling jittery way of moving their limbs. It almost looks like your eye is too slow to capture the movements and all you see are random snippets kind of like watching people move to a strobe light and the movements of the main spider just doesn't look as good as it would have if these movements had been done using modern special effects.Another positive are the characters in the movie. Well I should say select characters. Several members of the crew sent on the island consist of natives that don't speak English and are basically given no dialog or characterization whatsoever. You can bet these guys are just spider food. The main characters though they're competent when it comes to the situations they're stuck in and interesting enough that you do want to see them make it out alive. It makes a big difference in the scary moments.I also want to discuss one bit in the movie that was really clever.

I've also had it published on an online magazine called Think Online Alright moving on... Why did I ever want a dog? Why did I ever need a dog? Mika 'Say Marimo'We feel you Mika. Dogs have got to be the world's most polarising animals. Haters bitch about their smell fangs and drool while lovers bark about their loyalty and adorability. There are few who find residence in the 'they're alright' territory.Which makes a film about dogs almost impossible to watch objectively. Thankfully All About My Dog Inu no Eiga in Japanese isn't overly concerned with the conundrum preferring instead to unabashedly proclaim its fascination with mutts. Seven Japanese directors from the film anime and advertising industries explore the doghuman relationship in exquisitely crafted fashions. It loosely follows Kentaro Yamada Shidou Nakamura a timid media planner whose latest campaign for dog food is so stiflingnot to mention utterly sidesplittingthat it brings back memories of his childhood Shiba dog Pochi. And weaved between this heartwarming tale are bursts of zaniness from a spontaneous musical or a mockumetary to a dog'seyeview of infatuation.But as innocent as the subject matter is its dissertation isn't. Drawing from frustrations within their respective fields each director constructs a subtle criticism on the disorienting effect of capitalism. Be it the ludicrous demands of clients and management 'My Commercial Lost Way' or the unquenchable desire to be first in anything 'My Dog Is No. 1!' they skilfully juxtapose human irrationality against canine simplicity exposing our blindness and need for earthbound fleabags like these as life guides.Naturally most anthologies are bound to produce some darlings and unfortunately some duds and this is no different. Both Akira Nagai's 'Dog Talk' about a conversation with the inventor of a doggyspeak translator tool and 'Coro in Love' by Shinsuke Sato about a Pug who fantasises about a Pomeranian named Lily despite only seeing her tail are unwelcome interruptions that do little to win more of our affection or our laughs. And the unnamed creamcoloured claymation puppy who's various antics are inserted in between stories becomes tiresome after repeated appearances. He's cute but annoyingly overused. Kinda like Harajuku girls maybe.But 'Say Marimo' by acclaimed commercial director Atsushi Sanada is a stunning closer. A tearjerking dualperspective exploration of the mystical connection between a girl Mika Aoi Miyazaki and her dog Marimo. Sanada effectively utilises the textonblack screen techniques of 1930s silent films while a richly textured soundtrack that trumpets all that is glorious about Japanese music. Complete with the aforementioned quote it is also a poignant summation of the movie. All About My Dog may not be the definitive showreel of cinematic excellence from the land of the rising sun but it beams enough warmth for our occasionally humanweary hearts to turn towards the panting grin of our everloyal best friend.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dog movies are easy to be stereotyped as much as how dog has been man's best friend for thousands of years.It seems to me that Isshin Inudou and other creators of this movie tried to get away from that and there are some evidences there. One is how they have created an omnibus style of movie with 7 directors. The other is that dogs are not the leading roles in this movie. They always remain supportive roles as people's companions. This movie is 'about' dogs but it is a tale that is told from man to man.Putting the main story of Pochi aside for now and speaking of other shorts I think they're overall very nice even though I think Koro the Pug's story could have been better. The movie constructs a solid 'image' of dogs in general by showing them along humans in different situations and in different perspectives then brings a strong end to it. It is a little to typical but I guess it's something that was necessary. I think it was a good ending. The animation right before the last short is quite impressive as well I think I felt more so because I know many people who just get rid of their dogs so fast just because they're not puppies anymore.But in fact the most impressive part of them all was Pochi the last episode particularly so. When Yamada cries out Pochi's name the last time to me it sounded like a cry of mixed emotions including yearning and regret. Last 3 shorts  Pochi animation and Marimo story  have put together stories about parting with dogs and they all do it in different ways. And Pochi's one has the deepest impact in it because it consists people who had to part with their dogs by unexpected events or those who have parted with their dogs and can't see them again no matter how much they regret or yearn. In this short the our usual conceptionview of relation between man and dog is reversed. And therefore I found it very impressive and heartaching. I think it was a story which will directly hit the hearts of those people who had to part with their dogs in other ways than by the dog aging.'All about my dog' seems a little loose when we actually watch it and I suspect that is because we are spellbound by dogs' unique charm. But looking back on it I do think 'All about my dog' is an impressive and original movie. The way of storytelling overall was quite fresh and executed magnificently. And because of it I claim this movie to stand on its own ground apart from other dog movies. I think this movie makes us think a lot about how it has achieved it all as well as about the relationship we have with our dogs.".

A real comedy a real drama. No fake reality no fake emotions. Everything flows in a perfect harmony. The music the picture the characters... Every character in this movie is so unique that you have the feeling that you have met him. You don't have to know Turkish to understand the movie characters speak with their expressions.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie broke by far all time box office records in Turkey and it was highly regarded by critics. It appears all critiques at IMDb so far are also quite positive. But I have several reservations about this movie. One of the first is also expressed by another reviewer. The script is more like a theater play than a movie it is really a series of sketches similar to those you would find in some TV series MASH in the US comes to mind. Second and maybe this was an unrealistic expectation on my part is the absence of a commentary. Somehow I expected a deeper social expose or a commentary about TV entering into social life in rural areas especially in Eastern or Southeastern Turkey. It turned out the Gevas Van locale played no specific role. The movie could have taken place in any town in Turkey. TV changes lives in profound ways everywhere especially in places such as Gevas which I felt was missing in a big way. Third is what I would consider a number of historical errors or omissions. The year is obviously 1974 specifically July 1974. I don't think this was a time when the Turkish TRT TV network extended into small towns via transponders yet especially in Eastern Turkey. At the time even daytime Medium Wave radio reception could not have been as flawless in that area as depicted in the movie. The story about a twomember nontechnician TRT crew delivering a transponder without installing it and the equipment being essentially ready to be plugandplay is not realistic. This is an entertaining movie and maybe that is good enough for many people but based on what I have read I was somehow expecting another Camdan Kalp.".

As most ethnic people can somehow relate to these peoples lives it is a reminder of where they've come from and how they were brought up and therefore simply hilarious. As for those unfamiliar with a Turkish upbringing the towns naiivity as a whole is worthwhile seeing.I found this movie particularly funny because it has a lot of dry and implicit humour which i'm not sure if it would be the same by reading subtitles. Nonetheless it is definitely worth seeing and even after i've seen it 20 times it never fails to make me laugh. Turks came up with one good movie and i think they'll spend the rest of their lives trying to make a better one. vizontele is comedy at its best. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I saw huntsman the opening night midnight showing. I went into it expecting something amazing. It was...alright. Honestly the visuals were really good. I enjoyed the how well Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron portrayed their roles and drew me into the story. The little girl that played Snow White at the beginning had me entranced and everything was going great  then she grew up.Kristen Stewart as the female lead really ruined the whole film for me. She was depressingly emotionless and despite everyone in the film's world wanting to save and protect a otherwise unlikable character due to the character's performance left me neither identifying with nor liking the character. I felt for the little girl at the beginning who was easily 5 times the actor Kristen Stewart was in this film. Everyone I went with felt the same. Throughout the film she is very quiet and what lines she has aren't memorable at all again no emotion. Chris Hemsworth pours his heart out to her in one scene and while she was asleep and ultimately it was his kiss that woke her...she goes on cold and emotionless  feeling nothing for him. Very sad as the first 10 minutes had me very excited for the rest of the film  but then it just fell apart when she failed time and time again to react or become a likable character. She acts the same in the Twilight movies as far as I understand  so I'll continue to stay away from those as well. The rest of the movie was a good production though it dragged a little at parts. To avoid the same problem in the future I will simply abstain from anything Kristen Stewart is in. If you want to see this but haven't seen say  Avengers see that instead.I'd wait for Redbox on this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of fantasy books and films I had very high hopes for this one... Especially when people said oh you liked Lord of the Rings? You'll love this! The verdict? I now know who not to listen to next time. If your tastes are similar to mine you tend to read the books before watching the movies and you don't really follow particular actors. So really I had high expectations for this film  and that might've been the problem... Charlize Theron played the evil queen well but I would've loved it if the film had delved further into the queen's history as several ideas were started but never really explained I have a decent imagination but I don't really think as a viewer I should be entirely responsible for thinking up ways to connect the dots. For instance why is the Queen able to feel everything her brother feels? Why did her mother decide to give her the spell rather than both her and her brother or just her brother? And why once we get into the meat or the attempt at the meat of the story did the Queen spare Snow White's life when she didn't yet know Snow White was the fairest? And if she did know all the more reason! Why spare her?? The Huntsman was I would argue the best developed character  at least in comparison to the others. At the very least you knew enough to explain his drinking problem and his bitterness... That said his wasn't an overly complex character to portray. For exactly that reason it seemed more than a little ridiculous that the Huntsman alone carried the romantic scenes between he and Snow White. For instance at one point as he leads Snow White through the forest he takes a knife to her skirts apparently he thought they were getting in the way. Snow White stares blankly at the Huntsman and it is only once he says don't flatter yourself that you realize the emotion Snow White was supposedly showing was chaste shock. Granted that perhaps if I was more familiar with Kristen Stewart's acting I might have recognized what she was portraying but on the other hand I'm more of the mind that I shouldn't need to know your acting style in order to recognize so basic an emotion. This kind of jarring not in a good way and unbalanced acting was repeated at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned and the Huntsman enters the room. Looking at Snow White one sees only a blank yet tearful smile but when The camera turns to the Huntsman it dawns on you that there was supposed to be some sort of moment passing between them. All in all the chemistry existed only on the side of the Huntsman leaving much to be desired from Kristen Stewart's portrayal. And that of course brings us to Snow White. The character seems to borrow much from Joan of Arc to the point that one might wonder if she wondered into the wrong film. There is an attempt to develop the character but Ms Stewart seems to be little able to carry the development of what might have been a very strong female character. The only hint of real strength comes with Snow White's battle speech which would've been fantastic except for the utter lack of build up to this newfound strength of character. So in spite of the best intentions this moment came across as contrived. If only Kristen Stewart had managed to keep up that pace of energy throughout the rest of the film it might have been more believable. So unfortunately though I had high hopes I actually found myself rolling my eyes frequently and feeling a bit like I was watching someone show off all his super awesome visual effects  which was pretty cool... Just not enough to carry a story. In conclusion if you count yourself as one who likes a good plot great character development and strong female leads... Either lower your expectations or skip this one entirely.".

Charlize Theron  who I had always respected  comes off as a grudgingly aging Real Housewives of Beverly Hills  wait no  Orange County wearing bad eye makeup and screeching in realityTVcaliber hissyfit.... and I had always liked her. Kristin Stewart resembles her MAD cartoon parody. She's able to play the suffering goth waif but when her character is supposed to play fired up or determined she comes off more as a high school freshman that is determined to retrieve her math book from the library before the bell rings for class  not too powerful.... And when Chris Hemsworth gives a standout acting performance as the most believable character in this manufactured dark 'epic' well.... ya know you're in trouble.... I do admire the writers' ability however to cram every clich that has ever been imagined into this 14hour I mean 2hour story. Please note that I am generous in calling it a story since it actually had no plot. The characters had no depth. I was hoping that they would have done more with the wicked queen as that could have been a juicy part but she was about as deep as the aforementioned 'Housewives.' The musical score was magnificently inappropriate for the scenes and built up at the oddest times so that one would expect something was about to happen... instead we are presented with a magical deer that doesn't really do anything but has a white aura around it. However the musical crescendo that accompanies this scene makes you think Something is going to happen it doesn't. OK  last negative criticism  a fun game would be to take a shot every time one of the actors unexpectedly breaks into a Really bad and unexpected British accent. Just sayin. And now I'll say something nice the costumes were pretty good  impressive really.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's an interesting retelling of Snow White and I rather enjoyed the idea of Snow White ending up with the Huntsman as opposed to the fairly personalityless prince.One gets the feeling with this film though that Snow White portrayed by Kristen Stewart deserves the prince with no personality as she has very little personality herself. I cannot call this film completely awful because casting Chris Hemsworth as the Huntsman I believe was an excellent choice. He is full of animation and character even a bit godlike Thorreference intended and is the perfect hero for the film.You get sort of a Twilight feeling with this film though because Kristen Stewart makes what was supposed to be warriorSnow White seem like she needs all the supporting cast to give her a personality and save her. She isn't her own person in this film or the Twilight films.Charlize Theron being the excellent villain that she is ends up overacting and makes her role seem extremely overdramatic. Obviously the evil queen is supposed to be desperate and well evil but you get the feeling that Theron is actually overacting to make up for Stewart's lack of it. Even when she's supposed to be happy you get the feeling that nothing is going on in her head. Stewart's method of acting seems to be empty one's head of everything and say your lines. Toward the end when she makes her speech to rally the troops it is the most emotional we have ever seen her in the film and I had high hopes. Unfortunately due to the writing she essentially said nothing and I feel like the passion of the troops was totally non sequitur to her speech. The only parts of the film that had characters I and others didn't hate were the bits with only the dwarfs and with the children at the beginning. Time was not kind to Snow White. She seemed to have lost not only her personality but her looks as well. Kristen Stewart's lack of acting seems to make everyone saying she's pure disingenuous and even with Chris Hemsworth staring at her in love and admiration trying to convince you that she's worthy of it as you watch her you get the feeling that perhaps he injured his head at some point previously. Even Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron the most likable characters for the majority of the film make you hate them because of the writing of the film. Perhaps the director told Charlize Theron to overact but both ended up seeming ridiculous because of the writing. The religious bit confused me too at a point toward the beginning of the film Snow White says an Our Father and acts pious but not only was there no religion in the original Snow White there are no other references to religion throughout the film. You'd think there were many points where she might pray but did not so I can't see why they felt the need to include it at the beginning. It certainly wasn't to make the film longer. It was too long already.Thus I give this film a 310 and I can only hope that if they actually go through with Snow White and the Huntsman 2 they change the casting of Snow White to an actress more suited to the role. Dye Emma Watson's hair black and cast her if she isn't tired of acting nowadays...! I wouldn't mind it honestly. Also they might need to change writers...and director...and most things about the film...except the visual effects and Chris Hemsworth. I'd say don't change Theron but her character died so...".

There is also no chemistry between Snow White and the Huntsman. In reality the only lead actor who shows any charisma and actual development is the evil queen.

The action sequences are sparse and fairly generic. I was very disappointed with this film. It had potential but a bad script and boringnonexistent acting on Stewart's part destroyed it. If you want an actual captivating fantasy film you'd be far better off watching Lord of the Rings Chronicles of Narnia or even the most recent version of Alice in Wonderland.

At one point in the movie she gave the men a pep talk one of the worst ever! Almost all her dialogues are poor and unconvincing. The only thing that kind of kept me in the audience were the funny dwarfs. Also the CGI was pretty nice. But the bottom line remains acting is the most important and especially that of the leading role...Apart from Kristen the other actors were OK but unfortunately not enough to save the movie.All in all a big disappointment!".

	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time King Magnus Noah Huntley and his Queen have a beautiful daughter Snow White who is raised with her best friend William. When the Queen passes away the King grieves her death but has to fight against a dark invader army. He rescues a beautiful prisoner Ravenna Charlize Theron and on the next day he marries her. On the wedding night Ravenna stabs King Magnus on the chest and brings the enemy army led by her brother Finn Sam Spruell that destroys the King's army. Ravenna imprisons Snow White on the Northern Tower of the castle while William his father The Duke and a few survivors escape from the castle.Years later the kingdom is completely depleted and Queen Ravenna who is an evil witch keeps her beauty draining the youth of young ladies. When the Magic Mirror tells that Snow White would be the source of her immortality she asks Finn to bring the princess to her. However Snow White Kristen Stewart escapes and flees to the Dark Forest. Queen Ravenna brings a Huntsman Chris Hemsworth that misses his wife and she promises to bring her back to life provided he catches Snow White to her. But when he captures Snow White he discovers that the evil Queen lied to him and he becomes the protector of the princess. Meanwhile William Sam Claflin learns that Snow White is alive and he heads to join Finn's men to meet her. The Huntsman and Snow White meet the eight dwarfs that bring them to the magic Fairytale Land. When they are attacked by Finn and his men William also finds them and the group heads to the Duke's castle with the intention of beginning an uprising against the Ravenna. But the evil Queen will try to get her aimed immortality.Snow White and the Huntsman is a wonderful dark adaptation of the classic fairytale Snow White by the Brothers Grimm and adapted to the cinema and immortalized by Walt Disney. The story is excellent despite minor flaws like for example Snow White running and swimming after years imprisoned in a dirty tower and is supported by a great screenplay magnificent cinematography and CGI and good acting. There are unbelievable negative reviews in IMDb and my only remark is that the talented Kristen Stewart has never been more beautiful actually he uses the word The Fairest than the gorgeous Charlize Theron despite their difference of ages the Magic Mirror is wrong. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Branca de Neve e o Caador Snow White and the Huntsman".

Now detailing the plot shouldn't be too hard as we all know the story from childhood Evil Queen Charlize Theron with talking mirror is hellbent on killing her 'pure' stepdaughter Stewart and hires a Huntsman Hemsworth to do the job for her. The Huntsman takes pity on the girl when he finds her and together they become fugitives going on a journey that involves meeting Dwarfs. Seven of them to be precise. What follows is a major battle between good and evil to determine who will reign over the Kingdom the evil Queen or our heroine Snow White?Now I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would it reminded me a lot of Lord of The Rings from the grand music to the mountain scenery and it does feature a few spectacular fight scenes. Visually this is an impressive film however the film focuses too much on visuals and not enough on characters the Dwarfs are glossed over and never really given any time to engage with the audience which is a shame as the group contains excellent actors Ray Winstone and Bob Hoskins amongst others . Kristen Stewart as Snow White seems to think she's still playing Bella from Twilight i.e no range of emotions just a blank stare for the whole film especially when opposite to her is Charlize Theron giving an amazingly dramatic performance as the Queen. To sum up a good retelling of a classic but by no means as good as the Disney Classic which most of us remember.710".

The line Stewart has You cannot have my heart. That was it? Really? That's the big ending that you have? You have got to be kidding me. That in no shape or form should have been the last line of the movie.And the love triangle that they still left in tack at the end it's not that much of a triangle. She doesn't appear interested in either of them. The two men are in love with her and only one is true love. But you would have no idea that is the case because there is no sign of emotion on her part.Don't pay to see this movie. Anyone who tells you that Stewart was amazing in this movie has a very odd definition of amazing. She had about 1520 lines not including the speech. There wasn't much acting required on her part and it's so blatantly obvious that it seems intentional.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the previews for both of the upcoming Snow White adaptations I was excited. The take with Julia felt wrong though it looked pretty good. When I saw Charlize fulminating eyes in The Huntsman I knew it would hard to miss the target. This film delivers because it goes back what inspired the original source haunted forests dirty hopeless villages dark imposing castles and an electrifying and literally heartstopping villain. This one got as far away from Disney as it is possible and works as a perfect bookend to 75 years of attempts to capture the spirit of the original tale.There are changes and it is a very radical spin by making the heroine a stronger match to the diabolical queen a bruised and bitter yet majestic portrayal by the magical Theron an actress who speaks volumes with a look a quick glance or a murderous stare. She is as impressive here as she was in Monster. She wears the fabulous costumes by Atwood by an almost supernatural grace. She is worthy of every crown every jewel every outrageous outfit. She is great because her fantastical character feels almost real and is so powerful that she is missed while she is not on the screen.In this picture Snow White is not a meek and scared child. She must confront unexpected dangers and her evil stepmother and she finds courage pretty much where her enemy does deep inside her soul or heart. Both understand why each's demise is crucial and vital to the other. For most of the film Theron is in a crusade to kill White by taking a hold of her heart. Theron also knows this young princess is the only who can destroy her and that is enough motivation for some amazing trickery.There are plenty of breathtaking moments from the powerful introduction of the duplicitous queen to the most fantastic display of magic on the screen involving fairies. This would inspire even Shakespeare to write a sequel to a couple of his comedies.It is gorgeous and wonderful scene that will have people talking for a while and Spielberg must have inspired others to use a beautiful white stallion for maximum effect in a terrifying scene.Be prepared to be surprised and entertained by many actors doing top work and this is very hard considering how Theron owns the screen. Stewart does very good work as Snow White but the movie belongs to Theron. She is the dark force that lives in the heart of many classics and it is hard to picture anyone else doing anything remotely close.A very good fairy tale with plenty of heart.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Take On A Classic Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "When I heard they were making this film I was slightly anxious how this would turn out. After the disappointing reimagining of Alice In Wonderland I feared this would go the same way. I was wrong. Everything about this film was excellent. The level of design the cinematography the acting and the special effects all absolutely shone and brought this world to life stepping effortlessly from serene and beautiful to tough and gritty in a heart beat.So lets talk about the cast. Yes I had my reservations when I heard the main three characters were all played by nonBrits Stewart Theron and Hemsworth having said that they all played their characters excellently. Stewart's portrayal of Snow White was a subtle and intelligent performance. Her accent and this is coming from a Brit was pretty good in fact all three did very well in that department. Stewart has really progressed as an actress and found her feet in this film. She looked absolutely stunning with the help of incredible cinematography but what impressed me most of all was her characters arc throughout the film. She has really provided young girls with an excellent role model. Turning from a damsel in distress to a woman who can really stand her ground and fight for what she believes in. Chris Hemsworth surprised me in this film. His accent did suffer slightly however it did not detract from what I thought was a great performance. In particular the scene in which he talks about his dead wife to a lifeless Snow White was extremely heartfelt and showed a side to him that I've have not seen in his previous movies. Theron Queen Ravenna played the part expertly. Her character could have easily have become two dimensional but Charlize added a quality which almost gained sympathy from the audience. Her struggle for undying beauty and immortally may be a shallow one however the way she played it with such commitment energy and sometimes poignancy made us completely believe how deeply craved for it therefore earning her right to be so deliciously wicked.I would liked to have seen more of the seven dwarfs and I feel they were slightly under used. Ray Winstone Nick Frost and Toby Jones provided the comic relief the film needed in such darkness however also provided one of the most touching scenes which was acted brilliantly by all and shot stunningly. Adding to the beautiful camera work was the stirring operatic score. Composed by James Newton Howard it really lifted the film and stood out over the chaos of the battle scenes created tension in all the right places and moved me to the point where my hair on my arms and neck stood on end. Finally I would whole heartedly recommend this film. This is the best blockbuster this year and has really given the kiss of life to the fairy tale genre breathing new air into a this classic form of story telling. The director Rupert Sanders said in his speech before the film that he wanted to create a film with heart that he felt has been missing from some movies recently and he really has delivered. It would have been easy for a new director to be overwhelmed by such a large budget scale and special effects but not once did he let it overshadow the story and the characters. Snow White says in the film You will not take me heart which is exactly was Sanders seems to have said to Hollywood Blockbusters as he has created a film with so much heart that not even a poison apple could put it to sleep.".

Her struggle for undying beauty and immortally may be a shallow one however the way she played it with such commitment energy and sometimes poignancy made us completely believe how deeply craved for it therefore earning her right to be so deliciously wicked.I would liked to have seen more of the seven dwarfs and I feel they were slightly under used. Ray Winstone Nick Frost and Toby Jones provided the comic relief the film needed in such darkness however also provided one of the most touching scenes which was acted brilliantly by all and shot stunningly. Adding to the beautiful camera work was the stirring operatic score. Composed by James Newton Howard it really lifted the film and stood out over the chaos of the battle scenes created tension in all the right places and moved me to the point where my hair on my arms and neck stood on end. Finally I would whole heartedly recommend this film. This is the best blockbuster this year and has really given the kiss of life to the fairy tale genre breathing new air into a this classic form of story telling. The director Rupert Sanders said in his speech before the film that he wanted to create a film with heart that he felt has been missing from some movies recently and he really has delivered. It would have been easy for a new director to be overwhelmed by such a large budget scale and special effects but not once did he let it overshadow the story and the characters. Snow White says in the film You will not take me heart which is exactly was Sanders seems to have said to Hollywood Blockbusters as he has created a film with so much heart that not even a poison apple could put it to sleep.";

Both are not quite outstanding but they gave some interesting twists to the story. Unfortunately there is something gold about this but it cares too much to the visuals than anything else. There are also scenes that are taken from other fantasy epic movies. It's good looking but good looking is not always enough.The twist is pretty interesting. The Evil Queen's tragic past more significance to The Huntsman turning Snow White into a gritty protagonist. Though the dwarfs are the same in Tarsem Singh's version. These elements could have made this a memorable and fresh adaptation but they just threw these things to the film lazily. The plotting is mediocre which made the second act a bit boring. The action is nothing but looking good. It looks fascinating but you'll rarely see a real fight.You already know what Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth will do but the audiences are more interested to Charlize Theron's performance. She sort of hammed it up when in rage but she does it pretty well in the rest. Another attraction to this is the visuals. Like I said it's too pretty. It's never wrong for the visuals to be pretty especially to a film called Snow White. It's too pretty they already careless about the plot. Decided to choose the generic way. Heroes meeting new friends settle down fight settle down. Just waiting for the climax to come without any much development.I'm starting to think when I first saw it it's like Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. It's an old tale with a charismatic protagonist turned into a gritty one but this one is a bit different. It refuses to be gritty and wants to be pretty and generic. The real action is few the effect of drama is limited. The visuals can be spellbinding but anything else is just empty. There is a good story in the film but it's told in a generic way with a generic plot and filled with stuff that is borrowed from other films. One might enjoy it by its looks but if you care for more than that then it will be unsatisfying. Snow White and the Huntsman can be part of those clichd modern fantasy movies like Clash of the Titans Conan The Barbarian and Immortals. But at least this film is the best of its kind. It's not bad nor good. It's just a waste of potential of a new good film.".

Charlize Theron is amazing as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth does a bang up job as the Huntsman. The CG effects throughout the movie are very well done and add that little bit you need to a film like this. The PG 13 rating is also appropriate since the film has a very Dark overshadow and may not be the best for small children to view.

	schema:reviewBody "When my friend called me up on the morning of 14th May telling me that she won tickets to the premiere of this movie and wanted me to come along I couldn't believe it. I was half asleep when she called me and in my sleep state I was tempted to say no and hit the hay but THANK GOD I DIDN'T. This movie was absolutely breath taking from the very first scene and it's tremendous considering Rupert Sanders is a first time director. Not even the most experienced directors could have taken this where Rupert took it. The visual imagery was so raw and edgy I could actually feel Queen Ravenna's lust for beauty and her hatred for Snow White and it's safe to say that Charlize Theron was the perfect actress for this role. Only she could make an evil queen seem vulnerable at the same time. Kristen Stewart was a pleasant surprise! After the Twilight movies I had somewhat doubted her abilities as an actress but I'm glad and relieved to say that she proved me wrong. She brought such heart passion and bravery to this role and yes Snow White did kick some ass! KStew was all suited up in armour with her sword in hand ready to fight for her Kingdom unlike the airy fairy Lily Collins in Mirror Mirror. It's refreshing to see young blood bringing something new to cinema and not what has been done a thousand times before so thanks KStew you're definitely one to watch! Chris Hemsworth was fantastic as the Huntsman! A brute with a heart he most certainly is! Chris Hemsworth brought such strength and vulnerability to the Huntsman. He may appear very rugged and unkempt in the movie but don't let that fool you...his character is soft at heart and is willing to do anything to be a good human being but he doesn't show it as most of us do. He chooses to prove his loyalty by giving his word to Snow White...I won't say anymore but prepare for an interesting twist there! The dwarfs were amazing and had such attitude Toby Jones Ian McShane Ray Winstone gave delightful performances and were definitely one of the highlights of the movies.Overall the movie is a solid 1010 and I will definitely watch it again...YOU SHOULD TOO!".

The Huntsman wasn't wearing fancy clothes at the end and it looked like he was going to leave so does that mean she doesn't choose him? I was so confused at the end and mad that they didn't finish the plot. Also the writers held the awkward scenes out too long and didn't hold important scenes out long enough.

I had wriggled my way out of seeing the other Snow White movie but now I was going to have to bite the bullet. I was pleasantly surprised. The story and special effects which are very good are really all just one level of this movie. It's really about different aspects of feminine beauty.The Evil Queen played perfectly by Charlize Theron is very appropriately symbolized by a raven a carrion bird that feeds off of death for its own benefit. Her beauty is objectified. Instead of allowing herself to be vulnerable she embraces the objectification and uses it to spread death and destruction for her own gain. She is particularly threatened by and benefits the most from the beauty of other women. She also obsesses about youth. Has anyone else met this woman before because I certainly have! Snow White is the flip side of the same coin. She is beautiful without being objectified. She has no symbol but is almost portrayed as Mother Nature incarnate. She inspires nurtures and heals. Instead of feeling threatened by the beauty around her she reveals in it. She brings out the best in others. It is clear that she does not need anyone to tell her that she is beautiful in order for her to feel that way.Modern feminism is often laughable. Women can only be free and empowered if they act as libertine as the worst male philanderer without being criticized for it any more than their male counter parts. They must be objectified to be powerful. To them sex is power. They are symbolized by the Evil Queen in this movie.This Snow White is refreshing because she is not a sex toy defined by her beauty. Though she is aided by men she is certainly not defined by them or helpless without them. She is also aided by other women for that matter. She knows who she is and struggles to realize her potential as best she can just like everyone does whether male or female. Her selfrealization does not come at the cost of anyone else's in fact as she becomes freer so do all those who surround her. She does not need someone else to feel smaller for her to feel better. It's a wonderful message.No matter how much your little eightyearold girl begs do not take her to this movie. There was a small child behind me and my wife who often became very frightened by the movie's violence. Take your sixteenyearold instead. Maybe she will see that there is more for her to be than eye candy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arachnophobia is a very entertaining horror movie produced by Steven Spielberg. It's takes the fear of spiders to the next level. The film opens with an expedition in South America where a very deadly tarantula puts the bite on an American photographer killing him in the process. Just before the body gets transferred back to the U.S. the spider sneaks into the coffin. Once in the states the tarantula quickly mates with a domestic house spider and that creates the ultimate nightmare. Before you know it a new strain of spiders have been born that these little creepy crawlers are just as lethal! Jeff Daniels is excellent as the new doctor in town who hates spiders. He begins to realize something strange is happening. A couple of deaths occur and the doc feels that these unexpected demises might be spider related. And man it's a scary ride to the finish. Arachnophobia literally gave me the creeps. And it's also funny. Many of the film's comedy is provided by John Goodman as the town exterminator. He's literally a hoot. The thing about this movie that surprised me is that I was pulled into the story right from the beginning and it kept my attention all the way to the end. Arachnophobia was directed by Frank Marshall Spielberg's long time collaborater in his directorial debut. Marshall did a very good job his first time out helming a film which looked like a promising career move at first. He made his second film Alive a few years later I've not seen this one yet. Then he made Congo which was one of the worst movies of 1995 and hasn't directed another movie since at least not to my knowledge. But Arachnophobia was an above average debut for Marshall. He's got good potential as a director. This isn't a brilliant movie but a good one. And it's lots of fun. One word of warning if you have a fear of spiders don't watch this. You'll probably hate it. Don't say I didn't warn you. out of four".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great film on spiders. I first saw this when I was a child. I am proud to say I have it in my DVD collection. This movie has two big stars in it that I feel give a good performance. They are John Goodman and Jeff Daniels. Daniels plays a doctor from a big city who is to take over as the head doctor in a small town. When he gets there though the old man thats supposed to retire does not feel his is ready to retire. John Goodman plays an exterminator. You have to see the movie to know more on it.The story is pretty good. It may require some thinking. It is like this. The opening scene is a guy going on a trip to South America. After taking picture some pictures he goes to sleep in his tent back where they are staying. A very venomous and deadly spider crawls into his tent and bites him. They way this bite works is he goes into like a seizure for a few seconds and then he kills over. He complained of a fever when he was there so they though it was the fever that killed him. When they are shipping the body back to the US the spider crawls into his coffin.When they get to America the spider finds its way into a barn. In the barn it breeds and creates smaller faster versions of itself. Very slowly people in the town die. The new town doctor decides to get to the bottom of this.I recommend that everybody see this movie. I think it is a pretty good thriller movie. The spiders can look creepy and is a must see for any spider fan. Don't be turned off by films like spiders 1 and 2. Dont let a movie that is over done with action and special effects like eight legged freaks. This is a good popcorn movie. So if you like thriller movies go watch this.".

From the first time the characters see a spider I got anguished. After the first spider bite I asked myself if I really wanted to go on in that journey. Jokes asideI'm a bit serious actually I can honestly state this is a very well done movie. It uses an unexplored theme in horror movies at that time to create a terrifying story that chills almost everyone. Characters are well developed and so is the plot giving credibility to most scenes they built. Also plot has enough elements to entertain you even thought they don't talkshow spiders every time. Of course when it wanted to reach a climax spiders were all they showed but that's the way horror movies use to get there and I respect that. We have 103 minutes of tension fun and jumps and even thought we know or imagine how it's gonna end it never fails in any aspect. I just don't know why they label this movie as comedy in my opinion this is a very serious business hahaha. All in all Arachnophobia is a surprisingly good movie that impacted many children in 90's and will scare everyone who has this phobia for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one of the scarriest movies I have ever seen. I'm a horror fan but most of them are not scarry. No one is afraid that possessed dolls men that won't die or dead men in their sleep are going to kill them. The plots are just too unbelievable. The only thing they are good for is gore and something to laugh at. Instead the title of Arachnophobia is one of the most common fears today. Many people are afraid of spiders and most of us get shivers down our spine just thinking about those pointy little eight legs crawling on our skin. Most of the plot is not that unbelievable. New species are always being found in the rain forest and this wouldn't be the first time that a creature has hitched a ride over to the U.S. The only problems I find in the story are in the end. I will never understand why the spiders swarmed the house but while I'm watching it I never care because I'm too busy jumping. The other thing is while Jeff Daniels is fighting the general. The spider running towards him at full speed while on fire is a bit exaggerated.The movie also has a good comedy relief. Many of the towns people are somewhat humorous but most of it is presented by John Goodman. He plays the town exterminator who tries to talk like a professional but it's clear that he has no clue what he is saying. He also acts big and macho after stepping on a spider. Most of the movie is a cliche but it makes fun of the cliche if you know what I mean.I have loved this movie ever since the first time that I saw it and even after watching it a million times I still jump and shiver at the same scenes even though I know exactly what will happen. After watching the movie there will be some scenes that will stick in your head. Personally I was always very cautious about taking showers after watching the movie.".

I do have to say that I prefer him as a serious actor to his comedic attempts.This film however has been constructed in a less grand scale than Shatner's 1977 Kingdom of the Spiders. As a result Arachnophobia is far more realistic than the overdone KotS. The antagonists exhibit realism are not three stories tall and the acting quality better reflects the talents of the actors involved.All in all?

I didn't actually get to see the movie until the next summer when it was on in a bar in Gran Canaria though. On my way back to the hotel I ran up some steps which made a tassel from my shorts flip up into my face. I thought it was a spider. I freaked.Many people are afraid of spiders actually. Including you. There's probably a spider in your bed right now. That tickle on your arm a minute ago  that was probably a spider. You know that packet of grapes you've been munching on? I think maybe an exotic arachnid hitched a ride here from some far off land in it. I'd sleep with your mouth closed tonight if I were you.A fear of spiders has been in our blood since cave man days. It's a common sense in our DNA that won't go away. They have made easy villains in movies for many years from the awful Tarantula to the awful Kingdom of the Spiders which is still a very enjoyable film and the overlooked Eight Legged Freaks. Frank Marshall tackled the er...eightlegged freaks before the advent of CGI when creature effects were brought to life with puppetry and animatronics done here by Chris Walas who seems to have retired now that his craft is obsolete and it helps the movie feel real and tangible but it's just not creepy or disgusting enough.Jeff Daniels plays an affable GP who moves to sleepy rural Canaima California to escape the city life. The very day he arrives is the moment when a newlydiscovered highly aggressive species of spider arrives in a coffin from Venezuela. It mates with a local right under his nose and sets up a nest in his barn and basement. The locals begin to die of bites from their young and Daniels gradually figures it out as a spectacularly small amount of bodies piles up.Goodman channeling Carl Spackler from Caddyshack for some reason and Sands come and go the latter making some truly moronic decisions while the spiders remain mostly offscreen. Much of the running time is devoted to all the boring bits inbetween. Arachnophobia plays it safe when it really should have overwhelmed us.Even by 1990 PG13 standards it could have set the bar pretty high for any spiderflicks that followed. Instead we get the occasional glimpse a few deaths and a couple of scenes of tension before the actionpacked finale which thankfully saves it.Had David Cronenberg who strangely went on to direct a movie called Spider or John Carpenter tackled the story we might have had a classic as it is Arachnophobia is merely mindless entertainment with the familiar Amblin touch.".

Not only does it make for truly scary filmmaking thanks to the solid direction of longtime Spielberg righthand man Frank Marshall but it also delivers good doses of black comedysomething that has sorely been missing from most horror movies of the last two decades.The film revolves around the small town of Canaima California suddenly being overrun by arachnids of a particularly dangerous variety.  The spiders originate in Venezuela and are exported accidentally to California in the coffin of a photographer who is fatally bitten by one of the spiders down there.  The Venezuelan spider has managed to mate with the local garden spiders of Canaima to produce an incredibly lethal offspring.  All of Canaima's hopes rest on the new town doctor Jeff Daniels who as it turns out has the worst case of arachnophobia known to Man.Without resorting to overt grossness Marshall gets some really good shocks and scares and plenty of suspense something he clearly learned from Spielberg and Hitchcock the film closely resembles JAWS and THE BIRDS in its approach.  Marshall also pays a very direct and witty homage to the Master by having a whole horde of spiders nearly frighten a teenage girl to death while in the showera clear homage to the famed shower scene of PSYCHO.Daniels Harley Jane Kozak and the inimitable John Goodman as the wellmeaning Rambotype exterminator help to make ARACHNOPHOBIA a masterpiece of fright the likes of which had not been seen much in the 80s and which were rarely seen in the 90s.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw this last night. Set at a Wall Street firm on the night in 2008 when the leaders realize that changes in the market will wipe them out if they don't immediately stop selling the products that have been making them all rich the movie centers on the moral dilemma  recognized by some characters but dismissed by others  that they face in unwinding their positions saving themselves but shifting the pain to others.The movie finds a way to hold the mirror up to our civilization showing how we are all complicit in a collective 'dream' one character says at one point in response to another who says he feels like he is in a 'dream' 'Funny it seems like I just woke up'. The dream is the illusion of easy riskmanaged wealth that the financial markets manufacture again and again since the emergence of capital markets 200 years ago until the illusion morphs overnight into a panic. Reality intervenes fear takes over and the 'survivor' is the guy who first reaches the lifeboat. So there are no villains in this movie just people richly drawn beautifully acted characters realized by some of our best actors who relish the opportunity to show what they can do given a killer script and enough screen time between lines to actually be the people they are portraying. Central to the movie's success 1 It gets across the essence of what is going on in the financial markets without bogging us down or dumbing it down2 finding a moral question that can be resolved in a night yet which is nevertheless a perfect allegory for the whole set of moral questions raised by an economy that works the way ours does rewarding false confidence recklessness and deceit as often as industry skill and integrity3 the placement of young innocent but perceptive characters at the center of the drama who function as our eyes and ears who are like standins for all of us who weren't there at the heart of the dream machine when the latest fantasy of easy wealth was exposed as a collective delusion4 really 'gets' the trader ethos and manner  they are a kind of warrior caste foulmouthed impulsive deeply selfish surviving by their ability to outplay their counterparts and yet living by a warrior code that sets boundaries on what they will and will not do to one another having spent three years on Wall Street several panics ago it rang as true as any movie I have seen on the subjectIt's like Mamet except you don't have to work as hard to figure out what everyone's up to. It's like Chinatown except the 'crime' is something far worse than molesting a single young girl. These guys fd the entire planet for Chsake. It's like the best movie I've seen in a little while.What an incredibly sure hand from a director on his maiden voyage! Who is this guy? Whoever you are please don't stop. I would pay a lot to see what he could do with topics like 'the decision to go to war' or 'the emergence of ChinaIndiaBrazilIndonesia from poverty to global player'. Hell I would go see him revive Mother Goose after this debut.I'll calm down now. Enjoy.".

Set at a Wall Street firm on the night in 2008 when the leaders realize that changes in the market will wipe them out if they don't immediately stop selling the products that have been making them all rich the movie centers on the moral dilemma  recognized by some characters but dismissed by others  that they face in unwinding their positions saving themselves but shifting the pain to others.The movie finds a way to hold the mirror up to our civilization showing how we are all complicit in a collective 'dream' one character says at one point in response to another who says he feels like he is in a 'dream' 'Funny it seems like I just woke up'. The dream is the illusion of easy riskmanaged wealth that the financial markets manufacture again and again since the emergence of capital markets 200 years ago until the illusion morphs overnight into a panic. Reality intervenes fear takes over and the 'survivor' is the guy who first reaches the lifeboat. So there are no villains in this movie just people richly drawn beautifully acted characters realized by some of our best actors who relish the opportunity to show what they can do given a killer script and enough screen time between lines to actually be the people they are portraying. Central to the movie's success 1 It gets across the essence of what is going on in the financial markets without bogging us down or dumbing it down2 finding a moral question that can be resolved in a night yet which is nevertheless a perfect allegory for the whole set of moral questions raised by an economy that works the way ours does rewarding false confidence recklessness and deceit as often as industry skill and integrity3 the placement of young innocent but perceptive characters at the center of the drama who function as our eyes and ears who are like standins for all of us who weren't there at the heart of the dream machine when the latest fantasy of easy wealth was exposed as a collective delusion4 really 'gets' the trader ethos and manner  they are a kind of warrior caste foulmouthed impulsive deeply selfish surviving by their ability to outplay their counterparts and yet living by a warrior code that sets boundaries on what they will and will not do to one another having spent three years on Wall Street several panics ago it rang as true as any movie I have seen on the subjectIt's like Mamet except you don't have to work as hard to figure out what everyone's up to. It's like Chinatown except the 'crime' is something far worse than molesting a single young girl. These guys fd the entire planet for Chsake. It's like the best movie I've seen in a little while.What an incredibly sure hand from a director on his maiden voyage! Who is this guy? Whoever you are please don't stop. I would pay a lot to see what he could do with topics like 'the decision to go to war' or 'the emergence of ChinaIndiaBrazilIndonesia from poverty to global player'. Hell I would go see him revive Mother Goose after this debut.I'll calm down now. Enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Margin Call depicts the events that immediately preceded the Financial Crisis in 2008 within a nameless Investment Bank. What I like especially about the movie is the fact that it doesn't try to explain the technical causes of the Financial Crisis but the psychological causes  human failures which are the real cause for the Crisis greed egotism ignorance. Many scenes in this movie deal with very little dialogue instead the body language and the unique atmosphere speaks for itself. The ensemble is just brilliant especially Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons.The movie works solely from inside the nameless firm  apart from minor steps outside. It only portraits the people working inside this company  the normal world is completely left out. The effect is a very clever one The life of these bankers seems totally severed from the outside world they have no real connection with normal people and seem to  speaking exaggeratingly  lack an understanding of real human values that there could be more behind life than just maximizing and making money. They are completely left behind in their own world which somehow got out of control. Even when the imminent truth reveals and the consequences are becoming more clearer it always feels like they are cut off there is a scene in a taxi with Quinto and Badgley that underlines this.But one can also witness the coldblooded atmosphere in the system itself where every person could easily be mistaken as a number. A key figure of the film Eric Dale who gets sacked in the beginning is confronted with two managers in a scene like from Up In The Air. Either are these women robots or have never experienced something like social warmth. One widely held position is that eventually bankers themselves didn't understand their own system and products with Derivatives and Futures etc. anymore. Almost hilarious but sadly true is the fact that many people in these companies seem to have no understanding of Economics and just got into their position due to influence or money. When they are sitting in their conference room and discuss the incident it feels somewhat grotesque.Although this movie works almost completely without music the tension is so immense  thanks to the brilliant actors  that one is forced to focus.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having been the victim of corporate downsizing more than once I was immediately engaged with this propulsive 2011 corporate drama from the beginning as Stanley Tucci's character a seasoned risk management executive named Eric Dale is told in a coldly indifferent manner that he is being laid off after 19 years with the same unnamed Wall Street firm. It's a piercing yet dramatically economical scene that perfectly summarizes how bloodless the corporate world can be and in firsttime writerdirector J.C. Chandor's effort set on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis  it is very cold indeed with 80 of the trading floor being let go. As Dale is escorted out of the building he hands a flash drive to his prodigious assistant Peter Sullivan and tells him to take a look at it and Be careful.Once Sullivan analyzes the data he realizes the universal gravity of Dale's warning  that the firm is so overcommitted to underwater mortgagebacked securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. In other words the projected scenario means the firm will soon owe a lot more than it's worth and the market will be on the verge of an apocalyptic meltdown. What happens after this discovery is a series of sharply intense clandestine confrontations with each level of higherups recognizing the ramifications of the inevitable disaster each one far more nuanced in character than we are used to seeing in films from Oliver Stone about greed and immorality. Blessedly Chandor doesn't stoop to the customary stereotypes in this corporate cage match but what he does manage is capture the moral compass underneath each player by way of a cast that really delivers the goods with powerfully implosive performances.Zachary Quinto Star Trek is initially at the center of the plot as Sullivan and performs well enough in the constraining semiheroic role but the veterans really stand out here beginning with Kevin Spacey who effectively plays against type as Sam Rogers a genuine company man the seenitall head of the trading team who rallies what's left of the trading floor with corporate brio but then faces his own cross to bear struggling to commandeer a fire sale of worthless assets dumped on unsuspecting clients. The other standout is Jeremy Irons who masterfully resuscitates the cool cunning of his Claus von Bulow from Reversal of Fortune as the acerbically survivalist CEO John Tuld. He handily controls the boardroom scene with cutting humor and hostile precision. One of the film's more pleasant surprises is Demi Moore in cool brisk form as Sarah Robertson the top risk officer and lone female executive who knows her career is at stake with the discovery of this folly. Tucci is excellent in his smallish role as Dale and gets to show off his resigned character's engineering aptitude with a brief monologue about building a bridge.Comparatively less impressive but playing their more predictable roles fitfully are Penn Badgley as Sullivan's younger overtly moneyobsessed colleague Seth Bregman Paul Bettany as Dale's nihilistic snakeoil salesman of a boss Will Emerson and Simon Baker as the most morally despicable executive of the bunch Jared Cohen. Mary McDonnell has a brief and frankly unnecessary scene as Rogers' exwife and I didn't even recognize the usually hilarious Broadway personality Susan Blackwell as the hatchet woman in the opening scene. There are a few flaws with Chandor's observant screenplay for example the overly analogous scenes of Rogers dealing with his dying dog and a rooftop scene that plays up Emerson's nihilistic nature too predictably. In addition some scenes play either too murkily or too clinically to achieve the precise dramatic effect they should. I think the absence of a musical score also contributes to the sterility of the proceedings. However as a firsttime filmmaker Chandor more than impresses with his deft handling of such a zeitgeist moment with the Occupy Wall Street protests gaining understandable momentum right now.".

Everyone from Zachary Quinto to Demi Moore brings their Agame. Even supporting characters are oddly fleshed out for a film with such an ensemble cast. Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany give the performances of their careers I think. Only the Jeremy Irons character John Tuld aka Dick Fuld feels a bit over the top while the rest are truly believable wellrounded depictions.Despite having good characters and amazing cinematography the film lacks plot. The backdrop and setting are tense but this doesn't feel like a movie in the traditional sense. There's no evolution of characters no arcs and the ending may leave some wanting.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. Its announcement promised an inside view in the financial industry and particularly how it could cause the recent financial crisis. And precisely this is what it did splendidly. I gave it a very goodmark 5 out of 5 for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.I particularly liked the way they avoided the techno babble about financial products from which we all learned the hard way to be paper constructs only none of these related with things in the real world. The story also clearly illustrates that higher echelons in the financial industry do not understand those technicalities either something we assumed all along but didn't dare to ask for confirmation.Departing from the very different purposes and backgrounds of the main characters the story line got us involved in the attempts of each of them to cope with the situation at hand. Though their job motivations may drastically differ from yours and mine this film had no really distinct good and bad guys.The main characters were properly introduced in the timeline when logically needed. We got the chance to know each of them with their own coping behavior in this volatile environmeant yet everyone bringing along his own human characteristics. In the process we also saw the golden chains to attach each of them to the company making it virtually impossible to cut themselves loose from this line of work. We may call it greed but it is a fact of life that everyone gets used to incoming cash flow however large and unnecessary it may seem in our eyes. Once being there it is logical to buy a bigger house and to send kids to expensive schools. After that there is no easy way back and each one smoothly grows into a life style that is difficult to escape from.The story line as such is not that important apart from the fact that it succeeds very well in tying all the above together. It also maintains a constant tension all the time. I consider both aspects an achievement in itself since nothing really happens in terms of dead bodies physical fights and chasing cars. Only a few short scenes were shot outside but all the rest happened in a standard office building. The final outdoor scene was a bit unexpected I won't spoil it for you but it shows that even bankers are human after all.".

	schema:headline " So That...We...May...Survive!";
	schema:reviewBody "So here goes my first review on IMDb.This is a movie for those that want to see the human element when an investment bank realizes their models are wrong and that they are sitting on a large amount of assets worth less than they are currently marked at.There are 2 errors that just about everybody is making about this movie though. The first is that this movie is about the September 2008 financial crash. That is false. This movie is about the collapse of the CDOMBS market in 2007what led to IBanks going belly up in 08. That also didn't happen in 1 daywhile there were some very bad days it occurred over several months. Google ABX Index and select images and you'll see that for yourself. But for the interest of time and simplicity Margin Call simplified the actions of firms over those several months into 1 day and the actions of dozensif not hundreds of people into a handful which is understandable.The second error is that this nameless firm is one of the Ibanks that went under or was sold like Lehman Bear Merrill etc. The movie is clearly in my mind at least modeled after Goldman Sachs. The first reason is because they are seen as the first Ibank to aggressively try to scale back their exposure to MBS. The second reason would be a spoiler but lets just say that Goldman is pretty aggressive at making way for new blood relative to the others even though the movies depiction was way overblown.I think many will be happy to know that the amount of inside lingo is kept to a minimum but that doesn't mean that you will be able to understand a handful of things mentioned without a pretty good cursory knowledge of financial jargon. Don't worry though its not needed to understand the movie.For those that are looking for a story depicting causes of the financial crisis this movie isn't it. If your looking for a movie depicting evil people conniving in a board room to screw over the public this isn't it. This movie is about an analyst who discovers that the volatility assumptions in their MBS portfolio were false and that it could very easily take down the entire company. Its a movie depicting the increasingly suspenseful and gripping atmosphere when a firm realizes they are sitting on a large pile of illiquid assets worth less than they thought. Its a movie depicting the concern of particular players that their reputation will be shot when they are forced to market make assets that will kill the market for MBS.Its a movie that depicts the actions of a firm So that...they...may...survive.Acting was great. Direction was great. Script was decent! Watch this movie if you want to understand the most accurate depiction so far of the types of characters inside Investment Banks during a scary period.".

The storm unravels in a single 24 hourplus period and the outcome well we can just look at the real world markets to see the outcome.What's really fascinating to watch here is the interests and motivations of the individuals because as much as this is a character piece it's also an essay on the pitfalls of short term motivation. People who know too much are paid a million dollars to sit quietly in a room for a day and not talk. Traders are offered a bonus of 1.4M to meet a personal quota to sell assets they know are junk with an additional 1.3M per person if the whole floor hits quota. An executive loses 60 of his team and cries because his dog is dying yet never thinks to call his son also implied to be in finance to share the news of the pending crash. Execs view what they're doing as the inevitable ebb and flow of the tide waxing about the constant distribution of wealthy and poor how the numbers will never change and how the fallout is ultimately yet another opportunity to buy low soon and sell high later.And that's just it.

The world is ruined but the folks behind it take care of each other even when they're offering up a sacrificial lamb.

Paul Bettany despite a horrendously confusing and uneven accent gives one of the best performances of his career. Stanley Tucci isn't in it much but he absolutely steals every scene he has. Simon Baker and Jeremy Irons are expertly ruthless and Kevin Spacey gives us a glimpse of that talent he displayed in the '90s that has been far too absent this past decade. The film peaks too early leaving a final act that drags quite a bit and there's a symbolic subplot with Spacey's dog that is embarrassingly heavyhanded but it's certainly worth watching if only for the chance to watch a great male cast do their thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. It is absolutely understandable if you have reached your limit for dissecting and analyzing the 2008 financial crisis. However if you can't get enough or are still trying to find someone to blame for looting half your retirement plan this film offers a different perspective and one that proves more personal.Hopefully you saw Inside Job a fine documentary that provided an overview of the collapse. HBO's Too Big To Fail gave us a glimpse inside the Fed's decision making process during the crisis. This movie narrows the focus down to a singular investment bank. WriterDirector JC Chandor serves up a dramatized story that begins with massive layoffs. We see the hatchet crew arriving replete with security escorts as high paid executives are led out to the sidewalk. Stanley Tucci plays a middle manager in the RiskAnalysis department. As he is headed to the curb he hands a flash drive to one of his young analysts Zachary Quinto and tells him to finish it and be careful.Flash forward a few hours and the surviving staff heads out for celebratory drinks while Quinto's character starts churning away on Tucci's formula. Once he realizes that the risk formulas on MBS mortgage backed securities have threatened the stability of the firm he places an emergency call. It is quite interesting to see how this emergency escalates as we are introduced one rung at a time to the hierarchy within the firm ... Paul Bettany Kevin Spacey Demi Moore Simon Baker. This culminates in a late night conference room meeting when the CEO Jeremy Irons arrives by helicopter.There are so many facets to this story. We see how some are in the game for money. Penn Badgley says it's all he ever wanted to do but his obsessive behavior over the income of each manager shows us why. Paul Bettany is a middle manager who realizes the killers such as Simon Baker have passed him by. Demi Moore plays the type who doesn't mind finding a fall guy as long as it's not her. Kevin Spacey is 30 year career man who has survived many crisis by being loyal to the firm while also doing right by the client. Jeremy Irons is the charming powerful CEO who laughs about being as smart as a Golden Retriever but laserfocused on keeping the firm viable.What you can't help but notice is the number of managers who point out that they don't understand the charts and graphs and numbers and just need someone to explain it to them in plain English. We also see selfpreservation at its finestworst and the struggle that some of the characters have in deciding what is the right thing to do. It is not surprising yet frightening still to see that the red flags were flying before anyone acknowledged their presence.When the CEO says the three ways to win are to be first be smartest or cheat we realize huge decisions are made only in the best interest of the firm ... not the economy and certainly not an individual investor. Although this investment firm remains nameless through the film I did find it interesting that Irons' character name is John Tuld. John Tuld ... Dick Fuld ... Just sayin'".

	onyx:emotionText "Greetings again from the darkness. It is absolutely understandable if you have reached your limit for dissecting and analyzing the 2008 financial crisis. However if you can't get enough or are still trying to find someone to blame for looting half your retirement plan this film offers a different perspective and one that proves more personal.Hopefully you saw Inside Job a fine documentary that provided an overview of the collapse. HBO's Too Big To Fail gave us a glimpse inside the Fed's decision making process during the crisis. This movie narrows the focus down to a singular investment bank. WriterDirector JC Chandor serves up a dramatized story that begins with massive layoffs. We see the hatchet crew arriving replete with security escorts as high paid executives are led out to the sidewalk. Stanley Tucci plays a middle manager in the RiskAnalysis department. As he is headed to the curb he hands a flash drive to one of his young analysts Zachary Quinto and tells him to finish it and be careful.Flash forward a few hours and the surviving staff heads out for celebratory drinks while Quinto's character starts churning away on Tucci's formula. Once he realizes that the risk formulas on MBS mortgage backed securities have threatened the stability of the firm he places an emergency call. It is quite interesting to see how this emergency escalates as we are introduced one rung at a time to the hierarchy within the firm ... Paul Bettany Kevin Spacey Demi Moore Simon Baker. This culminates in a late night conference room meeting when the CEO Jeremy Irons arrives by helicopter.There are so many facets to this story. We see how some are in the game for money.

The closest we get is one of Spaceys many crying scenes over the death of his dog that takes place over the dead dog itself. And really that was not much of a thrill.I saw it with a mate that holds a bachelor in economics and I myself hold a masters in economics and international business management. To say that the subject interests us would be to put it mildly.I am also a great fan of Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey and to a lesser extent I enjoy the work of Tucci Betthany and Simon Baker. So its not the cast that is at fault in my book.No its an insanely boring and pointless script that does nothing to interest its viewers. The premise is that somebody finally figured out that a economic downturn is about to happen apparently only Jeremy Irons is old enough to remember that these things do happen once every 20 years or so. The guy that figures it out is at the bottom of the food chain which allows the movie to spend roughly 70 of its play time introducing a new boss that can be flabbergasted at the young gents numbers. Each succession of bosses react mostly the same and by the end you are surprised that they don't call the President of the US nor the British queen to let them know what is going down everybody else is let in on it.Then you get to wallow a bit in the moral scruples a few of the characters. But they are fictional working in an unnamed fictional company so I don't really care.Up to the end we kept hoping there was more to this movie.. A twist a crime a plot.. Anything.. But no.. At least the movie stays true to its docile form and does not try to end with a climax or the like. No we get to see Spacey crying yet again over his dead dog and digging a hole for it and symbolically for the economy. Ohh greatness! I give it a two for all the great actors where some of them actually give a mediocre performance at best.".

First of all it will take you no time to figure out the film has nothing to do with margin calls and but rather trading desk operations. The technical aspects are pretty accurate but they never really fully explain the true nature of the issue.The film lacks a protagonist and for that matter antagonist. Everyone is just sort of there which is real but not real entertaining. In my opinion this film is little more than a collection of well acted scenes that struggle when put together.And no this firm did not act in a manner similar to Lehman but closer to Goldman as someone already pointed out.".

And yet you won't forget her role soon.New York by night was never so well photographed than by Frank G. DeMarco but he lost it to a common xeffects based work as Emmanuel Lubezki's The Tree of Life got it Cinematography Oscar 2012.John Paino and Robert Covelman created dull office spaces that we endure for over 100 minutes without feeling bored 24 hours in an office building that's something! allowing for fluidity of movement of actors and cameras alike. They create realism that is more difficult than the fantastic scenarios of Hugo by Dante Ferretti and Francesca LoSchiavo Art Direction Oscars 2012 for Production Design and Set Decorator.Carolin Duncan may have done a discreet job but each actor and actress is dressed up  or down  according to the moment with precision and respect for himher status in the organization  deserving as much as Mark Bridges with his glamorous The Artist Costume Design Oscar 2012.What did J.C. Chandor lack to deserve an award in comparison to the rather trivial excuse me! Michel Hazanavicius? Directing Oscar 2012.Pete Beaudreau did a wonderful job so as you won't notice is presence in Margin Call  what would have been a good reason to award him instead of maybe Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall Film Editing Oscar 2012.I'd have elected Erin Ayanian and Fabiola Arancibia for their work on Demi Moore rather the overdone makeup of Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland on their Iron Lady Makeup Oscar 2012.Nathan Larson discreet varied mood creation imaginative music certainly beats the expected score by Ludovic Bourse Original Score Oscar 2012 and probably all other nominees hands down.Most of all J.C. Chandor was robbed of award and nomination for his original screenplay that is what the people should be exposed to to understand the reality of the last three years with a perspective that goes through 7 centuries with a dialogue that all actors delivery naturally because they were very careful written by someone who knew what he was writing about! Several dialogues of this screenplay should be mandatory study in Acting and Finance Schools. So with due respect to the old hand of Woody Allen Original Screenplay Oscar 2012 I'll contend that the nominee Chandor should have got the trophy.Summing up 1. I do not understand how come Margin Call did not get a single statuette. 2. I am confirmed in my conceited opinion that good movies are rarely rewarded by the Oscar crowd.PS  This film is rated R probably because of the repeated use of the Fk word despite the characters saying the expletive or the verb are subjected to unbearable psychological and economic pressure. I appeal to all minors of 21 or 18 or whatever to sneak in and watch this movie. You will know what your favourite TV station and your favourite political leader has not told you these last three years.".

The boss of a young risk analyst Quinto is getting fired Up in the airstyle before being able to finish what turns out to be a very important analysis. He throws the usbstick with the data to Quinto with the words be careful. Quinto works on the data and finds out what could be the start of a REAL thriller. Instead the audience is getting a movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a thriller or an interesting documentary fiction of the financial crisis. Another lack of the story is that it doesn't have a lead character. Every character is allowed to bring up his feeling andor motivations as if to show all the humans behind the mediagenerated mask of banksters. There is nobody to sympathize with even. Kevin Spacey's character is given the biggest opportunity to create such sympathy or interest. The most memorable scene though is where the audience is tempted to think that he is about to cry because of having to let so many people go while it turns out that actually his dog is dying. My bet is that the excellent cast of actors got lured in by a promise of making something like Wall Street. I wouldn't blame the director for this flat movie  the script itself doesn't give much more really.".

Western viewers like me with an European background west of the iron curtain know almost nothing about. When this side was portrait in Hollywood or early korean war movies it was dehumanized. Now this movie shows an entirely new angle where ordinary citizens get drawn to the communist site for all kind of different reasons and from all walks of life. From the practical decission to the ideological one from the workrelated one to the adventures one for love or for revenge. All this is seen from the biographical view of a journalist who lived and suffered through this experience. By watching this movie you feel the approach of emotional pain by knowing that some of the wonderful human bonds created will end with tragedy. The war movie action fan will also find this movie packed with realistic and well researched combat scenes. I was truly impressed about every aspect in this movie. Now this is the story The American forces under McArthur land in Inchon the communist front in southern Korea crumbles. Civil proffessionals are being ordered by the communist leaders to join the partisans in the mountains. Whole bands of partisans have very little experience when they meet the regular korean army in pitched battles. Mostly being defeated they suffer under unbearable conditions. When the Chinese army enters the war new hope and optimism arrives giving new live to the battered spirits. Ordinary communist leaders committing reasonable decissions among some atrocities. It paints a very threedimensional picture about their movement without a final judgement. That is very impressive. For a moviemaker this takes guts to do. No sour note on morals in this movie. This is also a movie that portraits female soldiers in battle in ways rarely seen in other war movies. This is the best korean war movie I have ever seen it even outclasses my favorite up to date Tae Guk Gi.".

Not a propaganda piece the film simply shows war from what many would consider the other side of the line. Large scale to be sure the film is much too polished and perfect in a completely artificial way no ones clothes are really ragged there is no dirt and some of the battle scenes have lines that are so neat and pretty even the most polished Hollywood film would blush. To me much of it comes off as silly TV movie.Allowing the film most of its flaws the one that makes me not want to recommend the film is that its much too long. The film seems to keep going and going much like the Energized Bunny in TV commercials. I didn't really see the point after awhile to be sure it covers most of the events of the war and gets the point of its despair across but at the same time I don't think it needed to be over two and a half hours long.War film fans or those interested in Korean cinema may want to give it a try others may want to give it a pass.4 out of 10 should be a 5 but its too long".

The reason Lane does this is to try to make Carey into a responsible man apparently a promise he made to Carey's deceased father. Carey turns out to be fond of drinking women and gambling so in order for Lane to calm him down he travels to find him a mail order bride. From there we'll see whether Carey is tamed. This is a basic western with drama and light comedy. Buddy Ebsen as Lane is fine and the film is easy to watch. Its nothing special but I still didn't mind it. I'm not particularly fond of Westerns and this does not rank anywhere near John Wayne's best but its not bad. I was never a big fan of Mr. Ebsen's TV work but this is a decent film. A curious bit of casting is Jimmy Mathers Jerry's brother as the bride's son. He is in a very small role but it was interesting anyway I didn't know he had a brother. So if you like westerns or are just looking to pass the time I think its watchable. Go ahead its worth it.".

	schema:headline " Minor Gem in a Little Depth";
	schema:reviewBody "Reviewer Wolfgang is correct this is an old fashioned Western. But old fashioned or not it's a minor gem in my little book. Old coot Will Lane's Ebsen got a debt of honor to young wastrel Lee Carey's Dullea dead dad and by golly a debt of honor means just that to old man Lane wornout or not. To fulfill that debt he's got to make enough of a man out of young Lee to deserve the ranch deed Dad entrusted to Will for safekeeping. Trouble is Lee spends his days carousing in town with the nogood Jace Oates while the ranch goes to seed and Jace steals his cattle. Into this unhappy mess rides old Will with his debt of honor thinking maybe a mail order bride Nettleton and her young son will turn the shiftless Lee into enough of a responsible husband and father to deserve owning the picturesque ranch. Thus the movie is ultimately about learning those values that endure and separating them from those that don't perhaps an oldfashioned idea but one to consider especially in our postmodern era.Now the movie would not work so well without three contributing elements. Ebsen's simply superb as the lowkey old man. It's an odd performance so stoical as to be almost deadpan I count one smile in the whole 90 minutes. Ordinarily that would be boring to watch but Ebsen acts subtly with his eyes and in such a steady dignified manner that he doesn't have to say much. Director Kennedy wisely keeps the camera on Will's face when somebody says something important so we know what he's thinking because we know what kind of man he is. That way we participate in what he's feeling we don't just observe it. All in all the honorbound Will Lane is in the best tradition of the dedicated Western hero while Ebsen's collaboration with Kennedy creates a memorable movie character.What an excellent choice Lois Nettleton is as the hopeful young Annie. Standing there on the train platform alone with her young son hoping for a new life with a man she's never seen amounts to an almost aching portrait of feminine vulnerability. Rather plainfaced Nettleton never looked like Hollywood but she brings just the right combination of grit and sensitivity to the role of a bride that you can order through the mail like a package with skirts.The third element is directorwriter Burt Kennedy. Often that combination doesn't work but here it does. He's created the characters and knows just what cinematic effects he wants. It's a very coherent wellcrafted script with a number of good lines. The tongueincheek comedy also comes across effectivelythe marriage ceremony is paced so quickly and humorously that we hardly notice how preposterous it is. Note too how efficiently and humorously Kennedy introduces Will and Lee in the very first scene with character sketches that will come to define them. He also gets a vivid performance out of Warren Oates as the noaccount Jace a role Oates is obviously enjoying and darn near steals the show with.However in my book not everything is aces. Shooting Jace seems to me a mistake given the general tone of the movie. There should have been a less drastic way of removing him as a bad influence on Lee. Then too Dullea as Lee looks the part of callow youth and acts it too but at times the effort comes too close to burlesque. Also old Hollywood just had to be old Hollywood in outfitting Annie in very unfrontierish formfitting dresses. I doubt there were many tailors in early day Montana actually lovely Kennedy Meadows in the scenic Central Sierras. At the same time I doubt that the movie's tame title did the box office any good with its very unWestern connotation.Anyway I expect the few people who read this may wonder why I've bothered to write so much about such an obscure film. But quality I believe deserves recognition no matter how big or small the audience. Also the Internet offers new opportunities to those of us at the grassroots level. A number of minor gems came out of Hollywood over the decades that for whatever reason passed by unnoticed but remain in the archives for rediscovery. Despite its very modest virtues and unpromising title Mail Order Bride I think is one of them.".

When the kids got over there they went to pay their admission being 11 years of age they offered their customary  price admission. Inasmuch as the three boys were not yet 12 which was the arbitrary age that the theatre company had chosen to separate the boys from the younger boys ending their eligibility for the  price admission.Well on this particular Sunday the guy in charge was the assistant Theatre Manager a 24 year old who we'll just call Elmo. Well it seems that Elmo must have been having a bad time at home or something. His inability to maintain his relationship's proper balance apparently compelled Mr. Elmo into compensating for his domestic situation by exerting his autocratic control of the Show's operation that day.With the firm resolve of an Otto von Bismarck Germany's Iron Chancellor and with the assistance of his own version of the SA Brown Shirts Elmo imposed his unbridled will to enforce the theatre's rules and make those subjects young theatre patrons comply toe the line and like it. In short Elmo insisted on the boys pay full freight to enter the Theatre.Only none of the kids were 12 yet honest Injun! But the boys wanted to see the movie I think it was DONDI Albert Zugsmith Prod. Photoplay Associates Allied Artists 1961. Peacefully like the little Gentlemen that they were they surrendered and peacefully settled in for the cinematic arts fest.But once our Mother got hold of this story she called Elmo on the phone but the Iron Chancellor was neither contrite nor compromising about his actions. But Madame I had 400 kids at the matine and they were noisy and there are always some of them trying' to sneak in! Getting no satisfaction Ma called back Monday and talked to the Real Manager instead of that Play Manager. He was apologetic and sent us a bunch of passes to any of the company's three shows. So that's how I got to see MALE ORDER BRIDE. I went a second time and saw another fine film in THE INCREDIBLE MR. LIMPET Warner Brothers 1964.OUR STORY A retired gunfighter Will Lane Buddy Ebsen comes to town to fulfill a promise to a deceased friend to look after his wayward son Lee Carey Keir Dullea. The son is a veritable Hellion but Will answers a magazine advertisement taken out by a Lady interested in Matrimony.Will goes there in person but the Lady turns out to be a saloon woman very attractive but just a tad too old for the young man Lee. The Lady confides in Will that when she saw him come into the saloon she thought that she had found herself a mate. Selflessly she puts Will on to the young Widow who now cooks for the Saloon.Arriving back with the young Widow Cookin' Lady Will in comical fashion forces the young guy into marrying. As it turned out the young Widow had a small son. One of Lee's nogoodnik buddies quips Look that guy went and brought back not only a new Cow but a Calf too! After a rocky road the young woman and Lee do find true love and with her Son they form a family. Will Lane rides out of town alone and lonely.But it won't be for long as in the fadeout scene we see a jubilant heading back into the same Saloon with the Lady who had taken out the Ad in the first place only this time the call was for himself. Fade out Closing Credits  Muisic. MAIL ORDER BRIDE was a very pleasant little film that incorporated some elements that all too often aren't included in the 'Horse Operas'. We had some of what has come to be called 'family values. The cultivation of proper manners and civil treatment of your fellow citizens are important items on the agenda.The film was doubtless a project that came about because of the success of Buddy Ebsen and Co. in THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES Filmways TelevisionCBS TV 196271.

	schema:reviewBody "Buddy Ebsen plays an older man who honors a dead friends request to go back and find his son and tame him by marrying him off to one of those mail order brides whom he finds in a saloon. This concept has been done before and since and the music when Ebsen is off on his cupids errand makes it sound like your in for a musical and Ebsen looks so out of place. In the midst of his Jed Clampett days in 196364 when this movie was filmed and came out  all he is missing is the accent and Jed's hat. The movie is boring with bland characters and really tiresome dialog the young man whom Ebsen tries to get hitched doesn't want a bride and only doing it so Ebsen will leave and give him the deed to his dads land. The actor playing the young man and the woman playing his bride are so boring to watch  no chemistry and you wonder how they will end up together which you know they will.In the end there is a gunfight and Ebsen's character leaves the couple whom have decided to stay married with her little boyplayed by Jimmy Mathers the older brother of Leave it to Beavers Jerry Mathersanother commenter mistakenly posted that he was played by Jerry.You think Ebsen may end up alone as the camera pulls back to him riding away but in the final scene he goes back to the saloon where he found the young bride and you hear wedding bells musiche straightens his tie and goes into the saloon fade out. This last scene refers to an earlier scene when he walks into the saloon looking for what he thinks is a young woman placing an ad for a husband and it turns out she is the owner of the saloon and middle aged. She takes a fancy to Ebsen and thinks he's there for her so in the end he does care for her and ends up going back to pursue her.The rest is left up to the audience to surmise the happy ending. I found the movie boring and Ebsen so out of place  I'll bet he wanted to do his part in one day and be done with this bland movie.One thing I do admit that at 56 yrs old Ebsen was hardly elderly looking or an old man as the plot indicates  in fact he was handsome and sexy for his age at that time. Overall i give the movie 310 ..Not terrible but not good either.".

The movie is boring with bland characters and really tiresome dialog the young man whom Ebsen tries to get hitched doesn't want a bride and only doing it so Ebsen will leave and give him the deed to his dads land. The actor playing the young man and the woman playing his bride are so boring to watch  no chemistry and you wonder how they will end up together which you know they will.In the end there is a gunfight and Ebsen's character leaves the couple whom have decided to stay married with her little boyplayed by Jimmy Mathers the older brother of Leave it to Beavers Jerry Mathersanother commenter mistakenly posted that he was played by Jerry.You think Ebsen may end up alone as the camera pulls back to him riding away but in the final scene he goes back to the saloon where he found the young bride and you hear wedding bells musiche straightens his tie and goes into the saloon fade out. This last scene refers to an earlier scene when he walks into the saloon looking for what he thinks is a young woman placing an ad for a husband and it turns out she is the owner of the saloon and middle aged. She takes a fancy to Ebsen and thinks he's there for her so in the end he does care for her and ends up going back to pursue her.The rest is left up to the audience to surmise the happy ending. I found the movie boring and Ebsen so out of place  I'll bet he wanted to do his part in one day and be done with this bland movie.One thing I do admit that at 56 yrs old Ebsen was hardly elderly looking or an old man as the plot indicates  in fact he was handsome and sexy for his age at that time. Overall i give the movie 310 ..Not terrible but not good either.";

I think these are the aspects that made the film unforgettable although I think it could have been left without some overly melodramatic sequences.It's frankly puzzling to me that diehard fans of Rajesh Khanna write very biased comments here about the film being a Rajesh Khanna film about him stealing the show etc. when actually it's clear that the film belongs to Sharmila Tagore completely. She is a lovely actress  beautiful dignified and she was convincing as both the young lady and the old mother though clearly it's not her best role. The entire cast makes great appearances from Khanna to Farida Jalal. The moments towards the end when the truth is revealed were very emotional and moving. This may be the film's highlight which made up for its flaws. This one is a memorable picture a picture that I feel many would enjoy watching.".

It is funny a little bit eerie sexy another cool big fight scene touching dramatic. Just like his previous films while the movie is really just a comedy the director tries to add in other types of elements and succeeds in making them all work together seamlessly.In this film we have a man acted very well by one of the stars of Kick the Moon who is obsessed with owning his own house because of his eccentric father. Finally when he does get his house he finds out that it is haunted. And so begins the battle for the house ghost vs man! But just like the director's other films the story is not as simple as that and develops quite nicely for an entertaining 2 hours.Definitely worth seeing check it out if you ever get the chance!".

I think the biggest mistake was giving to much time to the character of Leon whom i found annoying. I would have given much more time to the three bookies whom I found very entertaining specially Jerry who is the leader one. In this bad movie the only one who really shines is George DiCenzo's performance as Jerry he should play in a mafia movie he would be great.I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this movie.".

Boy was I surprised to find out that this movie was made in 97 well after most of the actors had good reputations and choice roles. I guess this proves that bad directing can make even the best actors look pretty terrible.  I rated this movie a 3.

His shots were innovative and the various locations in New York although probably used before seemed new and fresh.  A New York that exists but rarely seen. Reminded me of the sets in Wolfen.  I love films that show a city used over and over in countless other movies in a new light.  Plus always keep in mind...it's the Director that elicits the performances from the cast.  I'm sure it didn't hurt that he had a terrific and talented cast to begin with. A dreamcast. Anyway if you can find it...I recommend it.On a scale of 110...a strong 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Argentina's most expensive films is a really horrible one where NOTHING works well. The script is extremely boring and predictable with absolutely no turns as you'd expect in the genre film noir it is trying to emulate.The period reconstruction serves NO purpose to the story other than allowing a couple of characters to wear hats. They could have shot it as happening in 2007 and there would not be any difference. Peron Eva and their politics are mentioned in passing but they play little to no role in the movie. Darin is horribly cast as the main character. His character is often referred as The Kid which makes you think that the character was thought and written for someone in his early eighties and not in his late forties. It becomes hilarious at one point when a seventeen year old calls him kid.Julieta Diaz who is a mildly attractive and interesting woman fails completely like the femme fatal. She lacks the curves sensuality acting and good dialog that made for example Kim Bassinger's character in LA Confidential such a classic. Peretti starts really ridiculous with some of the most horrible lines in the film but it is the only of the title characters that manages to save face by the end.The photography is competent but nothing to write home about. There's also several shots that look badly lit and like they were done on video. The soundtrack is an extremely over the top melodic score that would fit perfectly in any soap opera and makes no sense here. For those speaking Spanish another oddity is that all characters speak to each other too respectfully never calling themselves by name but by using usted seor and their last names. This is even true with those that are clearly old friends. While there's no doubt that in older times there was much more courtesy when speaking the diction used in this movie becomes ridiculous very quickly.Finally as far as the title of the movie The Signal goes.... everybody will be left wondering as at no point it becomes clear what that signal is.".

The script based on Mignona's homonymous novel an credited as Mignona's but with a lot of other hands in it is so obvious and contains things that are really out of place and bring nothing to the film it also creates a moment of tension where the two detectives hint that something 'a sign' the English translation for the title will change their lives. I as a passionate viewer started to wait for that something for that moment but I waited in vain because the movie never begins to flow.Besides there's a constant depressing tone that makes the characters look as if they were in a trance. Somehow and this is a bad thing to say the film manages to pass this feeling on to us and between the trance and the slow and far from credible development of the investigations we contemplate the chance of falling asleep.This is made worse by the fact that there are not many characters and except for some scenes Buenos Aires looks like a completely empty cityLike if the only characters that have to be in a certain place at a certain time are there but nobody else exists.I'm sure Mignona's widow and family must be proud with the result of La seal but I hope that when Darn sits on the director's chair again he chooses something betterMuch better.".

But again let's be fair only Hollywood multimillionaire budgets can accomplish such thing. Now for the script The script is quite mediocre. To such extent that it is unpredictable because it just ends at an unpredictable point a point at which you could have added one more hour of excellent script. This is definitely not El Aura.

If even the junior assistant who handled the car and reveals the photographs appears well I have seen this on every film of this kind no surprises here nor will be ahead in the movie. But then the rest of the film is a lot of confusion and turns of the plot quite clumsy as for example the main character that is shown to us as a very Shrewd men and suddenly becomes nothing else but a clueless fool.I believe however that the worst sin is perhaps not to take the chance to portray Argentine society in those troubled years with all that money spent in all those cars an costumes. The end is really surprising but not because we do not expect that kind of end but I think because it is surprising that all ends there.I think the movie tries to show how facts from the standpoint of the main character no matter if the doubts are clear or not.But leaves you with more questions than answers and the impression that the film bite more of what could chew and in the end you keep specking what it is never going to come.Best luck next time for Darin which by the way gave a good performance but at times it felt into the confusion of his character Peretti was relatively well in his semicomic sidekick but Julieta Diaz steals the screen with a character very much in his step no vulnerable blonds but a centerminded passionate Brunette.".

After all with its darkness shadows deceiving women tough guys and all the other elements make for a satisfying time at the movies. La senal on the other hand fails to create the allure one feels about dramas such as the one depicted in this Argentine film.The main curiosity for taking a look was to watch Ricardo Darin a fine cinema actor making his debut as codirector with Martin Hodara who worked with the late Fabian Bielinski in his two pictures. The movie was adapted and in fact it's dedicated to Eduardo Mignogna in whose novel it is based. Not having read the book we have no idea as to how close the film follows the text in which is based.Corvolan is a sort of private eye working with a partner Santana and whose work involve tailing husbands who are having extra marital affairs and that sort of investigation. When Gloria comes to see Corvolan with a special assignment he feels curious as to her motives but decides to take the case. As Corvolan begins to investigate a sort of Pandora's box opens to unmask political as well as criminal figures involved in racketeering and extortion. Corvolan gets much more than what he expected and his liaison with Gloria will prove to be a fatal mistake on his part.It is made clear the year is 1952. The figure of a dying Eva Peron looms behind everything. There are two references in the narrative about her. It all seem superfluous to the story at hand. Mr. Darin and his codirector have gone for atmosphere rather than substance. Mr. Darin is seen in constant closeups that don't add much to the viewer's enjoyment it is almost narcissistic on the part of Ricardo Darin to want to keep the camera on himself most of the time without any satisfying results. Gloria as played by Julieta Diaz doesn't have enough sensuality she fails to convince she's a femme fatale. Only Diego Peretti in a straight role fares better in the film.One could blame the inexperience of the star of the movie as it must have been a trying time for him to be stretching himself in front and behind the camera. One can only wish the actor well and best luck for his next project and perhaps allow others to direct him objectively in future appearances.".

	schema:reviewBody "Violent film dealing with delinquency  robbing  dirty war  drug addiction and other dramatic events . Strong look about youthful criminality and based on real events  including political happenings in Spain from the 80s  being stared by a devoted to crime young who is living in slums . Hardboiled film about juvenile delinquents  holdups and upon prison life where the starring born in a marginal family is harassed and humiliated until that fury and revenge emerge . It deals a delinquent nicknamed El Nani Frdric Deban who looks exactly like Alain Delon  at the beginning he carries out a violent heist at a mall  after a frenetic car pursuit is detained . But Nani is chased and lockedup  accused for robbing  being led to Carabanchel jail . In prison is harassed by other inmates but he gets independence using his violent means of autodefense . Later on  thanks to a bail he is freed and forced into street hustling and everexpanding life of crime . Nani again hang out with his wife Lola Eullia Ramon and their child . Nani forms a criminal group with Jos Glvez Pedro Carrin and Teo Chema de Miguel and execute heists in San Sebastian and Len . They join forces with Richard Ferm Reixach  the jeweler Molero Miguel Angel Salomon along with El Marques and his wife Yolanda Farr who plan their armed robberies . All of them become involved with a high state power  the police command run by Manuel Soto Albert Vidal . Both of them scheme and carry out robberies to earn money in and around Madrid . As the trio of robbers attacks jewelries but the events get worse . With the change of government  power raising Felipe Gonzalez 1982  the Socialist Interior Minister calls for more police control in jewelry robberies and stolen merchandises are located . The film was released in April 1988  before the judgment of the Madrid Provincial Court in which sentenced three police officers to the disappearance of Santiago Corella .This is mediocre look at delinquency and policy abuse  including shocking and dramatic ending . The film shows the widely dark police and underworld business  as well as the impunity of the security forces to crimes they commit themselves . Inspired by an actual case  giving a realistic look at delinquency world and life behind bars in  however  the police events result to be imaginary and excessive . The best part is narrated into prison because of it reflects the astonishing existence of the convicts  with threats as well as violence and where rules the strongest's law . Matar Al Nani is one of several movies dealing with youth delinquency in Spain during the 70s and early 80s and it belongs to subgenre Quinqui along with Perros Callejeros I and II Perras Callejeras Los Ultimos Golpes Del Torete Yo el Vaquilla mostly realized by Jose Antonio De La Loma  Navajeros  Colegas El Pico   and especially Deprisa  Deprisa by Carlos Saura and later on  La Estanquera De Vallecas   among others . Most films mixed exploitation  nudity  violence  with asocial commentary . Drugs  delinquency  terrorism and generational problems are the habitual themes in this genre  and specially dedicated to the underworld of heroin . Seen today  these films are unique documents on how life was lived and perceived during that period . These flicks were notorious in the years of the Spanish transition to democracy including provoking and polemic issues and played by unknown young people . They still have the gritty edge  the naturalistic approach and the poignancy that made them successful at the time . At style is pretty much urban and realistic as well in the atmosphere as in the fresh happenings . We see their troubles growing in such streets  neighborhoods and some fine locations . These flicks show the ugliness of those barrios  toughness and cold existence of the humble people  including great looks at young life and friendship in the margined side  letting the stories flow efficiently and being realized in realistic style . Passing of time hasn't had mercy with most of those movies  but they represented a time and a way of life in history of Spain  and now they may seem a little bit naive . Matar Al Nani's screenplay written by prolific writerdirector Vicente Escriba is such strong with disagreeable events  but it has not fidelity  neither accuracy  with events distortion and twisting deeds  spreading brutal tortures  including  hitting  punches  hanging  kickass and many other things . Filmmaker Bodegas chose young and natural actors who play middlingly their parts  unafraid of filmmaker's unsympathetic camera and the particularity of the characters .

	schema:reviewBody "Did you ever see one of those awful action thrillers or crime dramas where as Jon Stewart once pointed out all the action takes place in a strip club usually starring Mickey Rourke Eric Roberts Rutger Hauer Michael Madsen or some refugee from the Brat Pack on late night cable? Well Phoenix is the Chinatown of those movies. Which in case you miss my meaning means it's really quite good.This is a supremely fun film if you like or hate but have seen any of these B action flicks.

It's a piece of advice given to him by his late gambler father you'll probably not be surprised to learn.The plot is to pay off the sizable debt Liotta and three of his fellow crooked cops mastermind a heist in a strip club where everything goes wrong while they wear funny animal masks. But as I often tell people it's not like it sounds.If you're still not convinced the fact that Anjelica Huston is a part of this film's great cast should tell you something. Also watch out for the amazing Tom Noonan as a lisping bookie and a scene with Giovanni Ribisi where you can see the conclusion coming but is still satisfying even if you've already figured it out because of Liotta's intense performance.3 out of 4 stars on the fun scale. Probably less on the quality scale.".

Moreover when you have Ray Liotta in the lead role you are going to be pretty good. However this film goes way beyond pretty good and close to perfection. The Movie tells the story of four Phoenix detectives each of which is somewhat less than perfect to say the least. In fact a couple of them are criminals Anthony LaPaglia is great. The story centers around that of Ray Liotta's character a hopeless gambler. However to Liotta gambling is somewhat of an honorable tradition one carried down from his father. He speaks of gambling as if it was his religion. He bets on everything. He starts conversations with people he considers lucky in attempts to get some kind of a hidden tip on a horse. He sees a cute little girl and asks her her name she says Betsy. So he looks for a horse named Betsy. However like he tells one of his partners I don't gamble to make money. His partner's response no st. The more bets Liotta makes the more he loses. Pretty soon he is in pretty heavy to a loan shark named Chicago played brilliantly by Tom Noonan. When his fellow partners suggest arresting or killing the loan shark that is starting to lean heavy on Liotta Liotta is shocked there is no honor in welshing on a bet. From here we see the downward spiral of all people involved in the story. I mentioned the cast in this film and it is an incredible group. What is greater is that each is given a real character to play with unique flaws and traits. Each scene is wonderful to look at visually. Be it a rainy night a heist with animal masks or a brutal Arizona desert. The dialog is sharp and very witty. The images are gritty and slick. Symbolism abounds in every scene. This is really a tremendous film!  out of .".

	schema:headline " At last  a good Danny Cannon film";
	schema:reviewBody "Harry is a police officer  he is also a degenerate gambler in debt to bookie Chicago for 32K. That's basically the plot it seems simple but it is enough to drive the film's core once it has been surrounded by plot twists tension strong performances interesting characters and good dialogue.Hats off to Danny Cannon  he was the great British hope once after making Young Americans and going to the US he then messed up with Judge Dredd. But here he shows that he does have talent to lead a dark thriller successfully  albeit he is helped greatly by the plot and his actors. The film follows Harry and his 3 colleagues as they revolve around several loan sharks and bookies whilst also trying to have lives and relationships. The main focus is Harry's addiction to gambling in all areas of his life. There is also a subplot involving Angelica Huston which is meant to represent Harry's potential redemption but this is not well developed and is secondary to the main story. The story eventually turns into a heistgonewrong movie but even then has enough twists to keep the interest.The main strength of the film lies in the actors that are assembled together here. Liotta plays the role well making it possible to like this person but also making his gambling side believable  it's hard not to feel for him and his bad luck as the film progresses. Anthony Lapaglia Daniel Baldwin Jeremy Piven are all excellent for different reasons as his colleagues. Piven good as the cop drawn into things he doesn't want to do and Baldwin and Lapaglia are as solid as every in corrupt roles. Both Ribisi and Huston are capable of great performances but neither have a lot to work with here in terms of time or plot involvement. Giancarlo Esposito is as good as ever in a small role as Louie the loanshark  but then I've never seen him put in a bad performance even in a bad film.Overall the plot is similar to many other crime thrillers out there. What makes this rise above the normal TV material is a dark atmosphere from Danny Cannon a strong lead in Liotta with uniformly great support from the rest of the cast and tension an twists throughout.".

	schema:reviewBody "This superb thriller features an array of colourful characters and some beautiful cinematography which not only looks great but also complements the rather menacing atmosphere of the piece. The action takes place in an environment in which everyone is corrupt and the threat of violence is ever present.Harry Collins Ray Liotta is a police detective with a gambling addiction whose work brings him into contact with violent criminals and a group of colleagues who are all thoroughly corrupt and untrustworthy. In amongst all this moral bankruptcy Harry is something of an exception as he at least has some albeit unorthodox ethical standards which govern his conduct. His inability to control his compulsion to gamble however eventually gets him into a tight spot when his losses increase to 32000 and local gangster Chicago Tom Nonnam wants to be repaid promptly.Harry's desperation grows as he knows he'll be killed if he's unable to pay his debt but then he's presented with two opportunities to resolve his problem. Chicago promises to cancel his debt if he kills a young man called Joey Giovanni Ribisi who's in police custody because Chicago fears that he might give the police information about his operations in order to get a lighter sentence. Harry isn't prepared to do what Chicago wants and also refuses an offer from his unscrupulous fellow detective Mike Henshaw Anthony LaPaglia who's willing to kill Chicago.In order to extricate himself from the fix he's in Harry devises a plan to relieve a nightclub owner called Louie Giancarlo Esposito of the considerable amount of cash that he knows he regularly keeps in his office safe. Then with the assistance of three of his colleagues he goes ahead with the robbery so that he can pay off Chicago and pursue his relationship with the empathetic barmaid Leila Anjelica Huston who he thinks provides him with his best opportunity for a better future.Phoenix has a great soundtrack some entertaining dialogue and well rounded characters but it's the quality of the acting that's most impressive. Harry Collins is a very troubled and psychologically complex man and Ray Liotta's portrayal of him is extremely powerful. Anthony LaPaglia is tremendous as the completely amoral Henshaw and Anjelica Huston shows the rather resigned manner and cautious nature of someone who carries the emotional scars of the past. The performances of the supporting cast are also strong and make their characters very memorable.".

The only reason why I gave it a try and taped it is because there is a famous actor in it who I usually like to see playing Ray Liotta and because I hoped that the story might be something nice most of the time I like crime movies. And because I really didn't know what to expect from it it's only good that I didn't see that cover photo first. That ugly thing doesn't really give a good impression of what this movie is like. When watching that picture my first impression is that this will be a typical action flick Stalone or JeanClaude Vandamme style while in reality that certainly isn't the case.Phoenix tells the story of Harry Collins a cop whose life isn't exactly going all too well. He's a hopeless gambler who only loses a lot of money and never wins anything. But that's not how he sees it. He considers gambling not as something to make money with he sees it as as an honorable tradition which he has inherited from his father. He gambles on anything he can possibly think of and he really sees a hidden tip in everything the name of a girl a conversation with some people who he considers to be lucky... Pretty soon he has a lot of debts with a loan shark named 'Chicago' which he can't possibly pay. When his colleagues suggest that they could arrest or even kill the man he is shocked. There is no honor in doing such a thing but from one thing comes another and soon Collins and his colleagues find themselves in a downward spiral of corruption deceit murder... A movie with Ray Liotta in it is always worth watching no doubt about that. Even a movie that isn't that good can be saved by his appearance. But this movie didn't need to be saved at all. This was actually a very nice film with some welldeveloped characters and a nice storyline. I might even say that this entire movie was a big surprise to me as it kept my attention from the first moment until the last. And not only Ray Liotta is worth mentioning. Anthony LaPaglia Daniel Baldwin Jeremy Piven... all did a very nice job in this movie. Still in the end I'm not surprised why so little people know this movie. OK it has a cast with some famous people in it like Anjelica Huston Jeremy Piven and Ray Liotta but this is also the work of the same director who gave us movies like Judge Dredd and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. I'm really wondering what made that man decide to do this project in the first place and where he ever found so much excellent inspiration. Anyway there is one thing that I'm absolutely sure of I will definitely recommend it to everybody who wants to hear it. I give this movie at least a 7.510.".

As far as cops and robber movies go this one is outstanding. The movie has a gritty and dirty sense about it. One really senses that they are involved in these sordid tales that take place in the arid Arizona wasteland that is Phoenix. Although this is a movie with no real good guys Ray Liotta is a pretty good guy. The only problem with Liotta is that he cannot stop gambling and this keeps him in trouble with a local shark who might be willing to forgive a debt for a favor. Did I mention that Liotta is a cop? Of course Liotta has interesting partners that work with him all more dirty and corrupt than himself. Great character actors assembled for this one but Liotta is the shining star here. His witty observations and philosophies on life serve as great filler as we wait for the next action to take place. Through out the movie we see Liotta break a number of laws however the one thing he will not corrupt is what he holds sacred to himself gambling. Just watching these cops attempting to dig out of the hot messes they create for themselves is worth the price of this rental. However many more people will want to see it again as they root for their hapless Liotta to get out of the mess he is in. Very good movie!".

I had never heard of it before.Big surprise. Liotta plays a detective on the skids. He's basically a decent character who is fatally flawed by the vice of gambling. We follow his life as  by turns  it deteriorates into a chaos driven by mounting debt. He has cop colleagues who are even less reliable than himself. Collectively they present a bitterly amoral face of modernday policing in Phoenix. This is not a feelgood movie.In crisis he recruits 3 confidantes to rob a familiar hood in order to pay off his debts and something to spare. It turns into slaughter. Their senior officer becomes aware of their behaviour but as well as reporting it decides to cut a slice of the action for himself in a brutal business of corruption doublecross and murder. There is no happyending.The dour characters are set against often gloomy weather and nocturnal activity enhancing the movie's downbeat texture. Even in the desert sun they are often cast into dark relief by the harsh light.Script is suitably cynical and wellchosen. All the players fit their characters well. Anthony Lapaglia Daniel Baldwin Jeremy Piven et al give excellent returns. There's no bad egg in the carton. Lighting sound and editing are all up to the job. Four men walking abreast to a common destiny is a very old theme in cinema. We've seen it in 'Gunfight at the OK Corral' 'The Wild Bunch' 'Resevoir Dogs' and probably others.This movie lacks that touch of comic irony that lights up even the grimmest of Tarantino movies rendering  I think  a greater sense of realism. It's dark and uncompromising it especially reminds me of 'The Grifters' which also starred Ms Huston. I can't say better than that.This movie is definitely a collectors' item. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was no shortage of 'cool' crime thrillers released on the success of Goodfellas in the nineties and while I wouldn't say that this is one of the very best of them it's certainly one of the better ones. Phoenix benefits from Scorsese's leading man Ray Liotta who takes the lead role in this film as a gambling addicted copper. The plot focuses on crime as you would expect but the gambling side of the plot is what really makes and sets it apart from most of the other nineties crime flicks. Ray Liotta is Harry Collins a cop with a gambling addiction and like most gamblers a money problem resulting from it. He owes money he doesn't have to his bookie a man who calls himself Chicago and after being given a few days to pay he soon realises that he's going to have to take steps to raise the money. This prompts him to set up a plan with his fellow coppers Mike James and Fred to rip off local pimp and all round bad guy Louie. Naturally the plan goes tits up and pretty soon all four of them are forced to pay the consequences...The film is never really brilliant though in fairness this sort of film doesn't usually turn me on all that much but it manages to keep a fairly good pace going throughout and doesn't get boring. Ray Liotta has played this sort of role many times before and since and as you would expect he is well at home with the leading role in this film. British director Danny Cannon also director of rubbish such as Judge Dredd and I Know What You Did Last Summer has recruited a decent cast of below alist stars which includes Anthony LaPaglia Daniel Baldwin Jeremy Piven and Xander Berkeley as well as one of my favourite Bmovie actresses Kari Wuhrer. Anjelica Huston also appears but is horribly miscast as Liotta's love interest. There's plenty of what most people will have come to expect from modern crime flicks we have car chases shootouts sharp dialogue and all the rest of it. I'd have preferred the film if we'd have got a bit more of the gambling theme thrown in but that's not too important as overall this is a more than passable effort and I'm sure crime fans will enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films that somehow falls under the radar and languishes undeservedly in obscurity. In a fairly convoluted plot Ray Liotta plays an honest cop with a gambling addiction who comes up with a plan to rob a loan shark in order to pay off his debts. He enlists the aid of three of his colleagues Daniel Baldwin Jeremy Piven and the unappreciated Anthony LaPaglia who gives a filmstealing performance here unaware that one is sleeping with another's wife and is under investigation.Although the story unfolds a little too slowly at times writer Eddie Richey's script has a lot of depth lending some diversity to a bunch of what could otherwise have been genrestereotypical tough guys. The quality of the writing is high with some offthewall dialogue and unique insight into such diverse subjects as King Kong Threeonamatch Looney Tunes cartoons and Dostoyevsky's gambling addiction. Brit director Danny Cannon creates some arresting images an alternately sunscorched and rainsodden Phoenix in monsoon season and manages to create loads of atmosphere despite often selecting extreme closeups to emphasise the thoughts and emotions of the characters. There are no weak performances but together with LaPaglia the everdependable Ray Liotta stands out in the lead role.The ending is probably weaker than it should be because it takes a little too long for all the strands to be neatly tied but this is still an impressive piece of entertainment that deserves to be better known.".

He enlists the aid of three of his colleagues Daniel Baldwin Jeremy Piven and the unappreciated Anthony LaPaglia who gives a filmstealing performance here unaware that one is sleeping with another's wife and is under investigation.Although the story unfolds a little too slowly at times writer Eddie Richey's script has a lot of depth lending some diversity to a bunch of what could otherwise have been genrestereotypical tough guys. The quality of the writing is high with some offthewall dialogue and unique insight into such diverse subjects as King Kong Threeonamatch Looney Tunes cartoons and Dostoyevsky's gambling addiction. Brit director Danny Cannon creates some arresting images an alternately sunscorched and rainsodden Phoenix in monsoon season and manages to create loads of atmosphere despite often selecting extreme closeups to emphasise the thoughts and emotions of the characters. There are no weak performances but together with LaPaglia the everdependable Ray Liotta stands out in the lead role.The ending is probably weaker than it should be because it takes a little too long for all the strands to be neatly tied but this is still an impressive piece of entertainment that deserves to be better known.";

Noonan turns in an even creepier performance here than he does in Knockaround Guys and LaPaglia's corruptbeyondallbelief Detective Henshaw is practically the polar opposite of the straightforward good guys he plays in movies like So I Married An Axe Murderer and Empire Records.

Of course this is a minor flaw. Ray Liotta  though typecast unfortunately  gives an intense compelling performance as a gambling addict. This isn't his best role by any means but he is quite competent as usual. I always enjoy his work and he is undervalued in my opinion.

Mike is a foul completely unrepentant morally corrupt cop with a permanent stubble and a paunch that hides his physical strength.  His eyes glinting windows on his ugly world show us that he's always calculating the odds weighing the outcomes checking out the angles to make situations serve his purposes.  He's a keen if cynical judge of character and smart in an animallike way.  All this puts him at odds with his friend and fellow cop Harry Ray Liotta the main character. Harry's more of a wounded psyche type chronic gambler with a heart of gold haunted by his father's credo that you don't welsh on a bet and you don't rat on others especially your friends.  Once Harry states these core beliefs you know how this is going to work out for him.The movie is put together very well  excellent performances by all Giancarlo Esposito as slimy loan shark and Jeremy Piven as weak whipped cop are standouts wellplotted if familiar storyline with appropriate pacing.  Angelika Huston is wasted in a small role but the backstory that her character suggests adds significantly to Harry's characterization.".

As your watching the film Phoenix your tempted to call your local police precinct and report a crime in progress the movie only to put down the phone feeling the police that your calling are the same police in the film.Ray Liotta Officer Harry Collins is about the most normal of the bunch of cops focused on in the movie Officers Mike Henshaw James Nutter Fred Shuster  Let. Clyde Webber Anthony Lapaglia Daniel Baldwin Jeremy Priven  Xander Berkely. Collins lives by a code that he follows in that being a sick and degenerate gambler he doesn't welsh on a bet that he made which is the movies main storyline. Collins wants to pay off his lone shark bookie Chicago Tom Noonan 32000.00 that he owes him in betting action and he doesn't want to kill anybody. Which is something that Collins seems to have a lot of trouble keeping from doing in the movie. Besides Chicago there's also LouieGlancario Esposito a pimp drug dealer and loan shark who has Officer Henshaw working for him as a collector and enforcer. Incredibly the cops in Phoenix are even worse then the aforementioned gangsters that's just how bad they are. The police in the movie are made to look so bad that even their boss Let. Webber Xander Berkley who at first we see trying to set them up and have them arrested for their crimes is really only interested in ripping them off of their ill gotten gains and keeping them for himself. Collins is always betting in the movie from horses to cards even to cockroaches and raindrops rolling down his car windshield that makes you wonder how he can find time to do his job as a Phoenix policeman? Phoenix is so antipolice that it makes you dislike the cops on the screen even if you want to find a reason to like them which it gives you none. Besides being corrupt the copsCollins Henshaw Nutter Shuster are also very stupid as well. They end up wiping themselves out in some of the most ridicules shootouts that I've ever seen in a cop movie. There's a ripoff of Louie's joint later in the film to get his weekly or was it monthly  take of some 250000.00 that was so funny as well as bloody and brutal that it looked like a scene out of a Marks Brothers comedy. Anjelica Huston  Brittany Murphy as Leila and her daughter Veronica were totally wasted in the film and I have the feeling that they had much bigger parts in the movie but most of their scenes were left on the cutting room floor lucky for them. Ray Liotta was at his best playing the sick and unstable Officer Collins which seen to be the kinds of roles that he been playing in movies over the last ten years or so. The cops in the movie were co corrupt and horrid in their actions that they made the corrupt cops in the film Serpico look like boy scouts stealing cookies from girl scouts. In one real nauseating episode Officer Henshaw has the terrified wife Sibel Ergener of Carl Murphy Dunne put out for him as her helpless husband is handcuffed to a pipe in their home. The next day Carl kills himself and Henshaw on the scene with Carl's wife present calmly puts his finger to his mouth as if to tell her to shut her mouth about what happened between him and her and Carl if she knows what's good for her. The most sympathetic cop in the movie next to Collins Officer Shuster had his wife Katie Kari Wuhrerhaving affairs with almost all the cops in the precinct except Shuster's partner Collins. Still Shuster thought that Collins was also involved with Katie and sets his partner together with Henshaw and Nutter up to get caught by Let. Webber who unknown to Shuster is also having an affair with Katie. Let. Webber was only interested in getting the 250000.00 that the corrupt cops ripped off from Louie and after getting his hands on the cash shot both Shuster who died and Collins who survived and got away. Collins ends the movie by killing Chicago and his mobsters for murdering a witness who Collins refused to kill! Thats because killing is not what Officer Collins is all about! that makes a lot of sense doesn't it? Anjelica Huston in the small part that she had in the movie was about the most positive person in the film. That doesn't say much were everyone in it the cops and gangsters were about as sympathetic as Charles Sweet Charlie Manson.".

The film is based on a book by Javier Garcia Sanchez Los Otros which by the way it's the title of a better known film The Others by Alejandro Amenabar. What I still don't know is whether Amenabar was inspired on this novel or as the IMDb page indicates he wrote his own screen play.Directed by Norberto Lopez Amado this film came out after the more commercially successful Amenabar's movie. It's strange to have two movies about more or less the same theme filmed by two totally different directors giving also two different accounts. If you haven't seen the movie stop reading right here.Nos Miran is a horror story. It starts in a flashback when we see a group of children playing in a railroad yard. Young Juan loses a dare and must lie flat on his back while an incoming train goes over him. At the same time his young sister disappears in mysterious circumstances. The story goes forward as we watch a grown up Juan now married to Julia with two children of his own a boy and a girl. Juan works for the police department where he is given the task of solving the mystery surrounding the disappearance of a wealthy man. In pursuit of this goal Juan discovers a link to the case when he is referred to go to an insane asylum to try to talk to the police detective that was involved with the case originally and now is a lunatic. The only thing he gets out of this person is They're watching us.This is a Gothic tale where reality and the perception of life in other dimensions blend to give a spooky feeling that yes we are in reality being watched. But is the director referring to an abstract idea or is he giving his own input in why people in his own country disappeared because of political turmoil? Knowing that Spanish directors in general love to have their own input about how they feel about their country one wonders if the disappeared ones are the ones that either had to go away for fear of their lives or are they the ghost of the disappeared in the civil conflict?Although the film has a vague ending it creates an atmosphere of mystery and menace lurking behind everything in Juan's house. We don't ever know what really happened with Juan. All we know is that he has been wounded in a leg but that is not the reason for his demise.Carmelo Gomez does his best work in one's humble opinion in this movie. His performance is multi layered. He expresses his confusion and his fear in a way that he hasn't done before. Either he responded to the material or to the director or he liked what he is doing here. Iciar Bollain has nothing to do in the movie. The veteran Margarita Lozano is also totally wasted as she stays away from the mystery that is at the center of the action in her own house. The children Manuel Lozano and Carolina Petterson are good in their portrayal of Alex and Laura.".

It's pace is deliberate and while you probably won't get any jump out of your seat scares you do get some spooky moments and an overall creepy atmosphere. I agree that the film starts out like a police drama but as Juan delves deeper into the disappearance of a married man he uncovers the startling fact that thousands of citizens from Spain have disappeared throughout the years without a trace. From there the story starts to take a different spin and we also are introduced to the former detective who handled the case. He just happens to be locked away in a psychiatric facility where he mutters just two words over and over again Nos Miran or They're Watching. I'm sure many will probably turn their noses up at the ending as it may seem hokey or too hollywood to them but I love it. I think it works perfectly and if I may respectfully disagree with the other review I found all the questions neatly answered and resolved at the conclusion.

	schema:headline " Interesting mix of Gothic horror and police drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Spain's horror film industry had a huge comeback in the 90s with directors such as Alex De La Iglesia Jaume Balaguer and specially Alejandro Amenbar a generation of young directors that demonstrated that there was a lot more in Spain besides Pedro Almodvar's famous melodramas. The nightmarish nights of Spain's big cities the grim Gothic memories of the country's past and that characteristic black humor that Spaniards domain very well have become the ingredients of the dark fantasies of Spain's new horror films and started a school that has begun to give fruits. Director Norberto Lpez Amado is one of this fruits as Nos Miran his first film is an excellent effort in the horror genre that shows the evolution to what Amenbar Balaguer and De La Iglesia started more than 10 years ago.In Nos Miran Carmelo Gmez plays Juan Garca an excellent detective who has been assigned the Barreiros case one of the most famous unsolved mysteries in the story of the Police Department the case of a man who one day simply vanished without leaving a trace. While at first it seems as an easy case of a missing person the mystery surrounding brings back Juan's memories of his own sister Sara Eva Llobregat who as a girl disappeared in eerily similar circumstances and Juan begins to descent into an spiral of madness and obsession. As Juan's investigation takes him to the field of occultism his wife Julia Icar Bollan fears that his husband will face the same fate as the previous Detective in charge of the Barreiros case Detective Medina Karra Elejalde who is now an inmate in the local asylum unable to say anything else besides they are watching us.Written by Jorge Guerricaechevarra famous by his work with Alex De La Iglesia and based on a novel by Javier Garca Snchez Nos Miran is at first a police mystery with noir undertones but soon it begins to descent into darkness as the plot thickens and the horror elements begin to take over. While it may not be the most original mix Guerricaechevarra offers an effective and captivating story that toys with the duality of sanity and madness and where reality is never what it seems. Almost void of his usual black humor Nos Miran is a serious Gothic horror where the very real horrors of the urban nightmare collide with the supernatural.Director Norberto Lpez Amado shows an amazing talent for a first time director as everything seems to be in the right place to create an effective horror film. The remarkable use of the camera to create an atmosphere of dread is one of the film's main assets as well as the eerie score by Bingen Mendizbal that almost always sets the perfect mood for every scene. While it's true that Lpez Amado shows the influence of those who came before him mainly Amenbar's the touch of film noir he adds to film suits as a glove the police drama part of the story and truly makes Nos Miran to be something more than a derivative Gothic horror.As many critics have said before Carmelo Gmez is truly at his best in this movie as he truly becomes this troubled complex character in a frighteningly believable performance that certainly is the highlight of the movie. As the film is focused completely on Gmez character there is little room for the supporting characters to developed however some of the supporting actors do stand out mainly the kids Carolina Petterson and the young Javier Gonzlez who is also in El Espinazo del Diablo who give terrific performance for their young age. Icar Bollan also gives an effective acting but she is definitely overshadowed by Gmez. The excellent Margarita Lozano appears in a small role but her screen time is very limited and it could even be considered as a cameo.While Nos Miran has apparently all the ingredients for an excellent film it's main problem is the fact that it truly feels derivative and unoriginal. Guerricaechevarra's take on Garca's novel focuses more on the mystery instead of its effects as the novel does and the Detective's madness is an angle not fully explored a missed chance in my opinion. While the lack of Guerricaechevarra's usual comedy does help to enhance the movie's atmosphere it also creates some tedious moments where the slow pace of the film feels unpleasant.Despite having these flaws Nos Miran is another excellent horror film from Spain and a proud example of what seems to be a Renaissance of horror in the land of Cervantes. Like Romasanta Palabras Encadenadas or El Espinazo del Diablo this movie seems to prove that modern horror not only comes from Asia. Hopefully we'll be hearing more from both Norberto Lpez Amado and Carmelo Gmez. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "A police detective reopens a case about the mysterious disappearance of an important businessman and he finds out there's more to this bizarre case than he first thought. Where he discovers the previous cop that was on this case is in a mental hospital he himself is starting to get manipulated and starts seeing people in reflections that aren't really there. Is it another dimension where the strange beings roam and what does all this got to do with his childhood.This pretty much could've been a pearler of a film but yep but it ended up being tiredly underwhelming. This is because the whole mystery of this case slowly fades into tedium after the great first hour and the ending just lacked creditability. Although that's just me. I thought is just copped out and took a sudden turn that didn't fit in the overall picture. Some might say it was a perfect way to end it but that's my thought. I'll admit the film doesn't break any new ground but it's slickly produced with its incredibly well done direction and disquieting locations. The air is thick of atmosphere a very unsettling awe that builds from the gloomy and cold settings. That of the cinematography which covered these settings was truly striking by making you feel as if you were right there. While the faint hearted score that prominently sinks into the film just eats away at you. It puts you into a daze of discomfort and totally unhinges you. The story is what kinda derailed it for me. The supernatural touch is constructed into it beautifully by painting an uncertain picture that seems to haunt you by mixing reality with the spirit world and implying we're being watched all the time. Leaving the door open for different interpretations. The actual topic of people disappearing without a trace and that's means everything they left behind still in the same spot is indeed scary and it does chill you to the bone. It's driven by its mysterious plot and the confronting script that pulls you along for the ride. Although the more I learned about what was happening the less I seemed to actually care. It benefit from not having any jump scares but still it was predictable to know if something was going to happen and after the tight first half it just dwindle in an unconvincing fashion throughout the final scenes. The performances were good and Carmelo Gomez as the police inspector conveys a figure that you care for and truly believe with the emotions he goes through. He is one of the things that keep you wrapped in the dim story.I'm glad I took the chance on watching it but I'll say seek out The Nameless instead which is more a tailor made mystery that's truly disturbing. Overall an okay horror mystery that has some class and pours in some interesting ideas into this chilling subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nos Miran is a very good and interesting film that has creepy elements but it is not the allout horror some people do not like. It is similar to The Sixth Sense and like The Sixth Sense it gives us something to think about for days.... or months.... or possibly years. I have watched it six times and every time I like it a lot. It does not start very fast but it is interesting from beginning to end. I enjoy it very much and if you like films like The Sixth Sense you cannot leave Nos Miran out of your life.This review was originally written by me in Spanish and then I translated it to English. Because of differences between the languages some parts of the review may sound choppy.... I am not a professional translator but I translated my original Spanish review to English to the best of my ability. I am putting this in the review in protest that IMDb.com would not allow me to submit a review that had both the Spanish and this English translation despite the movie being in Spanish and my desire to allow people who may primarily speak Spanish to understand my review better.".

	onyx:emotionText "Nos Miran is a very good and interesting film that has creepy elements but it is not the allout horror some people do not like. It is similar to The Sixth Sense and like The Sixth Sense it gives us something to think about for days.... or months.... or possibly years. I have watched it six times and every time I like it a lot. It does not start very fast but it is interesting from beginning to end. I enjoy it very much and if you like films like The Sixth Sense you cannot leave Nos Miran out of your life.This review was originally written by me in Spanish and then I translated it to English. Because of differences between the languages some parts of the review may sound choppy.... I am not a professional translator but I translated my original Spanish review to English to the best of my ability. I am putting this in the review in protest that IMDb.com would not allow me to submit a review that had both the Spanish and this English translation despite the movie being in Spanish and my desire to allow people who may primarily speak Spanish to understand my review better.";

A young boys sees her daughter been abducted by an eerie supernatural force and becomes a specialist about abducted people.

Finally he is abducted in the same way in the mood of protecting his relatives. It reminds the Mulder arc story from the beginning of the 1st Season to the end of the 7th. Norberto Lpez Amado does an uninspired directing of this movie and wastes acting talent of all the cast its a shame how Karra Elejalde looks on screen.Nos miran is another unsuccessful try of doing a Spanish scary movie and the list is getting longer. Jaume Balaguer Darkness Fragile Paco Plaza Romasanta Second Name and Brian Yuzna's friends from Fantastic Factory this is worst that the late films from Troma should look for better scripts in order to satisfy the audience.".

He just followed that strange thing without even saying goodbye to his family. Then somehow in the end he ended up in his office?And in the end what is the reason that he wants to lock his own children?

	schema:headline " Bibi Aur Ghulam";
	schema:reviewBody "For years Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam has been known as an inalienable asset in the history of the Hindi film industry and not without a reason. The movie fully deserves to be called a timeless classic and its story is relevant and fascinating even today almost half a century after its release. It is an artistic and intriguing presentation of the nature of passion and desire. Guru Dutt was a master of his craft. Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is excellent in story writing execution and acting. The music is sublime the sets are fantastic and the movie exemplifies what true cinematographic excellence of those times was. It is shot beautifully with a background score that enlightens the film's melancholic mood. The film is quiet focused and balanced and has a very subtle feel to it thanks to all these aspects. Abrar Alvi's direction is superb  he captures the atmosphere of those times with great skill his script is marvelous and many of his rich dialogues remain memorable even today and are often cited by lovers of Hindi cinema. All said and done Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam wouldn't have been what it is if not for the transcendent performance of the divine Meena Kumari. Her mesmerising beauty grace and screen presence cannot be described in words but to put it simply when she was onscreen no one else existed. Her portrayal of the tormented and deeply frustrated Chhoti Bahu is both heartfelt and artistic. Chhoti Bahu's desire to get her estranged husband's affection and become a mother and her attempts to please him by taking to alcohol only to become a fervent alcoholic herself and remain the same neglected wife are all aptly displayed. Kumari plays the role with great mastery her appearances in songs like Piya Aiso Jiya Mein in which she dresses for her husband and particularly the seductive Na Jao Saiyan... are astonishing her big expressive and often tearful eyes her brilliant dialogue delivery her emotional outbursts her breaks into anguished and sarcasm laden laughs and ultimately her nostalgic monologue towards the end are unforgettable.While Kumari dominates the show utterly one must not forget the great job done by the rest of the cast members. Guru Dutt playing the role of the innocent Bhootnath who later becomes Chooti Bahu's confidant and close friend acted like only an actor acting in his own film could. Rumour had it that he was actually the one who directed the movie simply because the movie is identified with his own style of filmmaking. This rumour was disproved by people associated with the film but Guru Dutt the actor still played his role exceedingly well probably due to his involvement with the film as its producer. My most favourite scenes of his are those in which we see Bhootnath as a middleaged architect. There is a kind of yearning and sadness in his eyes which is real and easy to relate to. Waheeda Rehman played Jaba wonderfully and her character's transformation from an arrogant and careless young lady into a suffering and loving woman was natural and convincing. Rehman as Chhote Sarkar was restrained and effective.As mentioned Hemant Kumar's music for the film is great. Shakeel Badayuni wrote fantastic lyrics for the songs and so every song has a story of its own and comes at the right places fitting the situations. Every song is very much a part of the narration and contributes to the story. Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle were the voices of the ladies and did a great job. Among my favourite scenes in the movie is the one right after the Na Jao Saiyan... number in which Chhoti Bahu bursts out at her husband after he criticises her of becoming mad as a result of her heavy drinking while she turns on him to reproach him for being the only reason because of which she sacrificed her basic values and all just to please him. A frequent quote in the film that of Chhoti Bahu asserting that she is not like other landowners' wives being much more devoted and caring is very memorable particularly because it's well delivered by the lady. All in all Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is a gem of Hindi films. It is an alltime great movie and much of it because it has an alltime great performance by Meena Kumari.".

Her mesmerising beauty grace and screen presence cannot be described in words but to put it simply when she was onscreen no one else existed. Her portrayal of the tormented and deeply frustrated Chhoti Bahu is both heartfelt and artistic. Chhoti Bahu's desire to get her estranged husband's affection and become a mother and her attempts to please him by taking to alcohol only to become a fervent alcoholic herself and remain the same neglected wife are all aptly displayed. Kumari plays the role with great mastery her appearances in songs like Piya Aiso Jiya Mein in which she dresses for her husband and particularly the seductive Na Jao Saiyan... are astonishing her big expressive and often tearful eyes her brilliant dialogue delivery her emotional outbursts her breaks into anguished and sarcasm laden laughs and ultimately her nostalgic monologue towards the end are unforgettable.While Kumari dominates the show utterly one must not forget the great job done by the rest of the cast members. Guru Dutt playing the role of the innocent Bhootnath who later becomes Chooti Bahu's confidant and close friend acted like only an actor acting in his own film could. Rumour had it that he was actually the one who directed the movie simply because the movie is identified with his own style of filmmaking. This rumour was disproved by people associated with the film but Guru Dutt the actor still played his role exceedingly well probably due to his involvement with the film as its producer. My most favourite scenes of his are those in which we see Bhootnath as a middleaged architect. There is a kind of yearning and sadness in his eyes which is real and easy to relate to. Waheeda Rehman played Jaba wonderfully and her character's transformation from an arrogant and careless young lady into a suffering and loving woman was natural and convincing. Rehman as Chhote Sarkar was restrained and effective.As mentioned Hemant Kumar's music for the film is great. Shakeel Badayuni wrote fantastic lyrics for the songs and so every song has a story of its own and comes at the right places fitting the situations. Every song is very much a part of the narration and contributes to the story. Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle were the voices of the ladies and did a great job. Among my favourite scenes in the movie is the one right after the Na Jao Saiyan... number in which Chhoti Bahu bursts out at her husband after he criticises her of becoming mad as a result of her heavy drinking while she turns on him to reproach him for being the only reason because of which she sacrificed her basic values and all just to please him. A frequent quote in the film that of Chhoti Bahu asserting that she is not like other landowners' wives being much more devoted and caring is very memorable particularly because it's well delivered by the lady. All in all Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is a gem of Hindi films. It is an alltime great movie and much of it because it has an alltime great performance by Meena Kumari.";

Of course there are compromises made to accomodate marketneeds such as a couple of superfluous songs and some farcical comedy. But if ever there was a case for releasing a director's cut lovingly restored its here. God knows what the censor's scissors threw away. Meena Kumari's performance is the finest given by an actress in Indian cinema....and I will go on to say that its the finest performance given by an actress that I have EVER seen a close second is Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice. Meena Kumari acts with her FEET  thats the first we see of her with her dialogue spoken as a voiceover then a cut to her incredible face the eyes betraying a glitter of obsessivecompulsion that is the character's core. Its a performance that stirs you like few will courageous and uninhibited honest and intense. Its centrepiece is of course the drunken tirade against her husband accusing him of impotence. In this as indeed in every scene she goes beyond acting into a realm that exists only in the gut. Another great Indian film that is not available on DVD at least not in our own country.

	schema:reviewBody "Guru Dutt's 'Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam' remains one of the most accomplished pieces of art in Indian cinema. No wonder why it is referred to as Indian cinema at its best. Starting with the technological aspect I was amazed by the excellent cinematography. The movement of the camera that guides us to the world of the characters to their minds to their emotions and to their fate. The way the camera focuses on Choti Bahu's sad eyes or the way it zooms towards Jabba's face while she cheerfully sings demonstrates the importance of characters' nonverbal language. Likewise direction is topnotch. Not a moment is wasted on trivial subplots. Everything in the movie seem to fit like a jigsaw puzzle whether it's the songs the haunting background score the sets the emotions portrayed by the actors the performances etc.Performances are first class. We see Guru Dutt as the young and middleaged and naive Bhootnath. He beautifully brings both comedy and intensity to his character communicating mostly with his expressive eyes. His relationship with the tragic Choti Bahu and the simple but headstrong Jabba is superbly portrayed through a wonderful chemistry between the actors. Meena Kumari gives one of her finest performances as the doomed Choti Bahu. Her scenes with Bhootnath and one particular scene with Rehman just before she drinks alcohol for the first time is mind blowing. Waheeda Rehman being one of the finest actresses brings grace and equally makes her presence felt in a comparably smaller but noteworthy role. Rehman as Chote Babu is brilliant.'Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam is about love fear jealousy anger greed addiction lust ignorance despair sadness and redemption. Many of the movie is set during the British Raj. We see most of the events through Bhootnath's eyes. He falls for the vivacious and lovely Jabba. However when he meets Choti Bahu he's amazed by her beauty and they too develop a loving relationship. We are hinted that he blames himself for Choti Bahu's fate and yet he sees tries to forgive himself.What was it about alcohol that Choti Bahu got attached to? All she craved for her husband's love but even when he requests her to leave alcohol she can't. We see her offering herself as a prostitute so that Chote Babu won't leave for the brothel. Did she feel in some way grateful to alcohol that she had her husband back? Was it the alcohol itself? Was it a whole other state of mind that had nothing to do with her surroundings? Whatever it was it destroyed her.However she the one person she always relied on was Bhootnath and whenever he'd appear she had a smile on her face except that one time when she's about to make that request that would change her life. Bhootnath the only person she confided in was the last we see her with.We also see a jealous Jabba who is afraid that Bhootnath is slipping away. After all who is this Choti Bahu that seems to intrigue him so much? She hopes that Bhootnath might express his love but fears that the love is for a mysterious Choti Bahu.In a sentence I'd say go watch this movie otherwise you would never know what you've missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watched it many a time and still can't get off it. There are so many new things observed this time too. The use of lighting when Bhootnath explores the hums coming across in the Palace. It was typical Guru Dutt style the narrative being told from the perspective of a servant ghulam and it is conveyed as if only what he sees and not what happens when he is not there. Even the typical item song of the dancer if I may call so is showed as an observation of Bhootnath.Acting is so superb and so into the character. Bhootnath is the innocent bihari villager who does not have a great deal of worldly knowledge. He does have a dialect of the villager who is fascinated by the city life. The enticing and naughty girl Jaba played by Waheeda Rehman is so endearing and charming. The conversations of Waheeda and Gurus Dutt and very lively and enthusiastic. The chemistry for sure is so great and in subtle nuances there is a huge lot of meaning.Music is actually not up to the standard if I can say expect for very two special and exceptional songs Bhawara Bada Nadaan and Na Jaao Saiyyan.All the performances are apt but one that stands out and is so very awesome that I like to watch it again for it that was Meena Kumari's Choti Bahu portrayal. So royal that it hid the pain so gracefully but she wants to give her wish a chance and since she could not she resorts to a much terrifying habit that later ruins not just her but the whole family and the palace.Meena Kumari had the royal grace and presence and Guru Dutt had that innocence charm. This acting was extracted mostly by Guru Ditt as he could only derive such expressions. Another notable thing is Make Up. The first scene and the immediate next scene are so much contrast that it took a while to realize what make up can do if used properly.The art direction is superb as the movie transcends from the once royal to the now bereaved family the soul of palace also diminishes. The climax scene in which Bhootnath finds truth speaks a great deal of what happened to place and also the first scene where construction is happening.Watch it for the dialogues the expressions and yes for Meena Kumari. My rating is 55 for one of the best films ever made.".

Rather we get a lot of the same from Frank and that is exactly what should be expected. I think in the modern era of the high concept action movies they have forgotten how to just show the audience a good time. This movie and it's predecessor take us back to a time when action wasn't bogged down by complicated stories rather the star's charisma and action were all that one needed to enjoy their time in the theater.These movies have no lofty aspirations other than to give you one hell of a ride for an hour and a half.

	schema:reviewBody "TRANSPORTER 2 isn't going to win any awards for its story whatever happened to Luc Besson anyway? but for a fun action movie it's about as good as 2005 offered. Jason Statham reprises the role of Frank Martin a driver with impressive skills in or out of his car. The 2nd film is at least as silly as the first and not quite as corny in the script making it a very entertaining way to pass 80 minutes.Obviously the aim of the film is to capture some of the style of Golden Era Hong Kong action films and Jason Statham does a great job with the help of Cory Yuen's choreography which is very imaginative and clever though he reuses a few ideas e.g. the hosepipe from KISS OF THE DRAGON. Unfortunately the film is blighted by HollywoodStyle camera work and editing which detracts from the choreography... westerners still haven't learnt how to shoot a fight scene as well as a Hong Kong crew despite having 10x the budget available to do it... too many closeups shaky camera that goes against the movement of the action and editing which obscures rather than emphasises what's going on. I'd love to see the action scenes reedited by one of HK's premier action film editors.Still small quibbles really since Hong Kong has pretty much stopped making action films this fun anyway and TRANSPORTER 2 is still plentifully entertaining as it is ".

The 2nd film is at least as silly as the first and not quite as corny in the script making it a very entertaining way to pass 80 minutes.Obviously the aim of the film is to capture some of the style of Golden Era Hong Kong action films and Jason Statham does a great job with the help of Cory Yuen's choreography which is very imaginative and clever though he reuses a few ideas e.g. the hosepipe from KISS OF THE DRAGON. Unfortunately the film is blighted by HollywoodStyle camera work and editing which detracts from the choreography... westerners still haven't learnt how to shoot a fight scene as well as a Hong Kong crew despite having 10x the budget available to do it... too many closeups shaky camera that goes against the movement of the action and editing which obscures rather than emphasises what's going on. I'd love to see the action scenes reedited by one of HK's premier action film editors.Still small quibbles really since Hong Kong has pretty much stopped making action films this fun anyway and TRANSPORTER 2 is still plentifully entertaining as it is ";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm just an average guy who wanted to see a film on a Friday night with a few friends. And thats just what this film turned out to be.Now i'm all for a good action film but this was a little TO Hollywood for my book. I went in expecting a somewhat good time and came out having one more or less. Let me explain.If your wanted to see this for plot and as a realistic high standard action film your going to be VERY disappointed. The stunts though really cool looking are virtually impossible to pull off  realistically. The transporter was almost supermanlike in a film that was based on a realistic present day world and he pulled off things that SHOULD NOT and COULD NOT have happened. This is the negative side to the film and really the plot was Mediocre at best. PLOT Spoiler The whole virus idea is so overused at this point in time and since they didn't expand on it enough until the end it didn't really matter. The ending however well it looked rushed. Althougth it became more and more like a James Bond film then a driving film with each scene.Now  the positives If you wanted to see a action film that would mildly entertain you on a Friday night this is a great little flick. Sure it's not the best and sure it's not the most realistic but it was fun overall. Now I know there are a lot of people who won't see a movie just because the plot is really unrealistic  But if your like me it dosn't take much to be entertained. Just to be simply entertained this was a good film. You get to see some cool action scenes and while they are Hollywood style and almost superhuman at points they are still very much so enjoyable. The plot can keep you somewhat entertained as well as the characters however they arn't the best. The action is the glue in this case.Overall  It's an average film. I'd say 56 out of 10. If you want to see an action movie with decent fighting and stunts or have nothing better to do on a Friday night give it a look.If your looking for a film to keep you entertained and enrich you in a realistic plot with realistic events pass this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a confession to make... I enjoyed the first transporter film! It involved car chases martial arts action and all sorts of implausible things that kept me entertained for the majority of the running time. It was relatively short had some pretty cool moments and was generally a bit of ridiculous fun that needn't be taken too seriously although the concluding chapter sold the first half short the final fight and resolution of the movie left me thinking 'They're ending it like that...!?!'.Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the sequel which suffers blisteringly from a syndrome I like to call sequilitis... a perilously common and highly contagious disease with its epicentre in California. It leads to movies which can be described at best as 'ok' or 'just above mediocre' being unnecessarily dragged through another 90 minutes where everything is faster bigger and more explosive. It can even happen to the better class of film witness Godfather 3... Anyhow here we have what may well become a test case to compare against all future sequels...Now I've once sat down to watch an Uwe Boll movie... I endured at least ten minutes of Plan 9 from Outer Space... Whoever made Lost in Space got 5 of my pocket money circa 1998... And I once watched an entire episode of Corination street... All these were experiences I have tried and failed to forget from the awfulness of the dialogue to the woodenness of the acting the preposterous scenarios and the long list of other problems they all share. It is now time for me to add another 'film' to that list Transporter 2.This movie lacks just about any redeeming features. Clearly none of the production crew have even heard of the concept of physics while the director who was also responsible for the Luc Besson penned snorefest Danny the Dog titled 'Unleashed' in the UK doesn't seem to have the slightest clue as to what he's meant to be doing. He merges CG that a kid with an Etchersketch could improve upon with gun play that John Woo would say 'Now come on that's really too over the top!' His wardrobe department deserve to be taken out and shot while the casting people may be lucky to escape such a fate...Everything about this film sucks and Luc Besson would do well to stop penning any more of this dreary garbage. He's turned his once promising career into a litany of cinematic trash producing writing and being involved in dozens of films a year none of which are worth watching. This isn't even the most recent catastrophe with Revolver Angel A and many other poorly planned rush jobs helping to fill videostore bargain bins across the world. The director of Leon and Nikita really should know better.So too should everyone else involved. An audience really isn't going to accept that a car can fly upside down clip a bomb on a passing crane land on the other side of a bleeding one hundred foot wide maybe more river as the bomb explodes... and then drive off into the next scene... it's not just impossible it's insultingly preposterous and the dodgy CG only serves to further deny us any feeling that we're watching a film crafted with any degree of love or skill.Instead we're inundated with ridiculous notion after ridiculous notion... implausible scenario after implausible scenario... and so on and so forth. From a female villain who goes out in nothing more than lingerie a see through shirt and two fully automatic laser sighted silenced pistols to a horrendously unsympathetic family who you practically want to die of a biologically impossible disease... no one emerges with any credit.The exception to a very small extent is Jason Statham and it is he who gives the movie its only all right moments. Called upon to do nothing more than pretend to drive look moody and occasionally beat people up he shows as limited a range as he did in the first film... but is hardly being called upon to do much more. A couple of the car chases are OK one or two of the 'one men versus a lot of other people' fights are quite cool and his demeanour throughout does allow us to believe that his character Frank Martin really would take this course of action. Other than that it's nothing but bad news...Matthew Modine is wondering where his career disappeared to... Amber Valletta clearly regrets getting involved... Kate Nauta will not be gracing any films soon God willing... and the rest of the cast are generally asking themselves quite how they became embroiled in such an awful movie Keith David and Francois Berleand for example are two men way above this kind of crap. Overall I can't warn you enough not to see this film it's got practically nothing to recommend it and you'll only feel cheated of 87 minutes of your life plus whatever the cost of the rental. Please don't waste your time... it's far more precious than this pile of rubbish.".

I can appreciate farfetched action films as long as they stay within relative distance of reality. Transporter 2 goes way beyond reality in well into stupidity turning Frank Martin from delivery man into indestructible superhero. After a while you'll realize this man can do anything and will always walk out of the worst scenario alive. It totally kills the excitement.And as if the plot wasn't flimsy enough the narrative just completely shatters and will leave you disorientated and lost among the brawling and battling. Characters come and go with no explanation subplots are abandoned and the film is totally void of a denouement or climax. There's no satisfaction in the silly story being wrapped up.All Transporter 2 really does is showcase a bunch of totally farfetched fight scenes while failing at everything else that could have made the film a contender. Even the relentlessly silly Danny the Dog did better than this.Even though it's made by a European director and producer and funded with European money something that gave the first such a unique feel this feels an awful lot like a Hollywood trash flick. It's a shame the series had to stumble so soon. Since the end hints a third one can only hope that Leterrier and Besson get their act together. What began as a series made in the style of Taxi Ronin and Kiss of the Dragon has ended up tumbling into world where movies like Stealth and SWAT live. And that ain't good.Oh and I'm tired of hearing about the movie's socalled homoeroticism. Like I just said this film is made by Europeans who are not as homophobic as the rest of the world and see nothing wrong with a man visiting another man for a holiday. Frank Martin is not gay.".

Like I just said this film is made by Europeans who are not as homophobic as the rest of the world and see nothing wrong with a man visiting another man for a holiday. Frank Martin is not gay.";

You thought I might say that the film's action scenes was better than the first. I have to answer yes on that. But there's a flaw There are too many action scenes! There is one after another and another throughout the whole film! It really gets tiring during the end when you just want no more action scenes! This is probably my first movie where I said that the action scenes were too much.This film really had potential. I liked the beginning in the movie but not the rest as much as the first movie. The acting in the film by Jason Statham was good but Amber Valletta's acting was better. The special effects was good and yes this film is more ridiculous than the first.If you liked the first or an action fan this is a good action movie but you might get tired of the multiple action scenes in here.

	schema:reviewBody "The Transporter 2 is about Frank Jason Statham a man who will transport anything no questions asked. All he requires is that you stick to the deal and follow the rules of which he is very strict with. In the sequel Frank is transporting a young child named Jack Billings Hunter Clary to school and back on weekdays. That's right Frank is babysitting. Nothing wrong with that as it has little to do with the actual story once the movie gets going.Due to an elaborate plan by the main villain Gianni Alessandro Gassman and carried out by his ruthless girlfriendsidekick Lola Katie Nauta young Jack is kidnapped. Of course Frank is the prime suspect by the police and is pursued from that point forward by the police.After following the kidnappers orders and paying 5 million Jack's parents retrieve him safe and sound and everything seems great. Without giving anything away this is where the real problem begins.Katie Nauta delivers a stand out performance in what I believe is her film debut. She has an awesome screen presence and would have liked to see her have a bigger part. She is exactly what Hollywood needs in my opinion. Someone sexy new and a little different. She reminds me of both Rebecca Romijn and Fairuza Balk.Jason Statham is great as usual. Easily the best part of this movie. Jason is England's answer to Jackie Chan. The fight scenes are a little more over the top than the original movie and the same goes for the car chase scenes. While the chase scenes were wild in the first one it does not come close to the absurdity in the sequel. As seen in the preview the car jumping scene is not very realistic. It looks like it belongs in XXX State Of The Union. Don't get me wrong I liked that movie and I like this one. A lot. I just wish it could have been more like the original. I would still recommend this movie and rate it 810.".

The writers and director make frank out to be not a mere astute wheelman and fighter but rather a one man army a superman of sorts. they packed in more choreographed nonsense than the average Jackie Chan movie. I seriously cannot say enough bad things about this director. A few times he made a nod in Sergio Leone's direction but minus the brilliance that director was known for. The fight scene with the female assassin near the end was so crouching tigeresquire it made me literally shout obscenities at the screen. The final showdown on the plane was so predictable that the second the plane was introduced onto the screen my friend said here comes your BIG Hollywood ending. he was right. Just pointless overacted tripe. Those scenes on the plane looked like an episode of the Thunderbirds circa 1966. As for the driving this movie is packed so full of CGI car stunt nonsense it's sickening. CGI can look fake but this...this looks like adobe photoshop bad. The bomb on the car and hook on the crane thing had me shaking my head. and you know who i feel the worst for Jason Statham because they ruined this character big time using this sequel to try to make him the next Megaaction Hero. This movie is to the transporter series what Bladetrinity was to that series. Convoluted selfabsorbed unintelligent cinematic rubbish. Anyone who tells me that i'm being too harsh on this movie is obviously easily entertained. This movie will insult your intelligence.Looking to a third installment i'd expect Frank will be transporting birthday gifts for orphans and fighting terminators.".

	schema:headline " Sequel to a great action film is in most ways better than the original yet is some how missing something to make it perfect";
	schema:reviewBody "The original Transporter is one one of my favorite films. Its mindless fun with great characters that makes me stop every time I run across it while channel surf. How could they top it? Apparently quite easily.The plot of the movie has Frank relocated back to the US Miami in particular where he is filling in for a friend who is the driver for the family of a federal drug official. During his time filling in he has grown close to the young son of the family and promises not to let anyone hurt him. Of course the boy is kidnapped and Frank is not only a suspect he's also the only one who can save the boy and stop the real plot which involves mass murder.The key thing to understand about this film is that it is completely fantastic and unreal. The stunts the plot the whole thing is completely impossible. If you can accept that fact and just go with it the you'll have a great time. If you want reality in your movies stay home this movie is completely unreal.The action is spectacular and the film makers have out done themselves. Its amazing. Everything about the fights and chases is absolutely first rate.The characters are great. Frank is the same great character from the first film. We get to see him actually grow as a person. We feel for him as we see him act as the frantic surrogate father and our heart breaks as we see somethings go wrong. Taconi the police inspector is back and is a joy to behold. I wish that he was better used but just having him on screen is enough for me.The villains are monstrous people who will do anything to anyone for money or pleasure. They are truly suitable foils for our hero. They are so good that you never know from the get go how bad things are going to get or if Frank will actually get out of this alive. Its so nice to have bad guys you can really hate.The plot is much tighter than in the first film which completely broke down about half way in. Sure the first movie was fun to the end but you had to ignore the fact that it really didn't work. Here the movie is a very tight very taut thriller that seems almost alien when compared to the first one which seemed less serious.The fact that this is a tighter and better plotted thriller makes the fact that there is a major plot jump less easy to accept. There is a moment when Frank finds out whats really going on and he doesn't really tell anyone. He doesn't clue in the police which he should considering whats really transpiring he just continues the one man crusade to get the bad guys for those keeping score its about the time he leaves the biolab.Yes I understand that the movie up to this point has more plot holes than you could drive a fleet of trucks through but there is a whacked internal logic that allows for some of the holes but not this. It wobbles the film slightly in that other things become more glaring like the sense the film is missing part of the soul that made the first film such a great balls to the wall thrill ride.Don't get me wrong I love this movie and as a guilty pleasure its probably going to be on my list of best films of the year but I should have liked it more... which is an odd thing to say about a film I'm rating 9 out of 10.Great action. Great Characters. A plot with more holes in it than all the swiss cheese ever made. If you love action see this movie.".

If you want reality in your movies stay home this movie is completely unreal.The action is spectacular and the film makers have out done themselves. Its amazing. Everything about the fights and chases is absolutely first rate.The characters are great. Frank is the same great character from the first film. We get to see him actually grow as a person. We feel for him as we see him act as the frantic surrogate father and our heart breaks as we see somethings go wrong. Taconi the police inspector is back and is a joy to behold. I wish that he was better used but just having him on screen is enough for me.The villains are monstrous people who will do anything to anyone for money or pleasure. They are truly suitable foils for our hero. They are so good that you never know from the get go how bad things are going to get or if Frank will actually get out of this alive. Its so nice to have bad guys you can really hate.The plot is much tighter than in the first film which completely broke down about half way in. Sure the first movie was fun to the end but you had to ignore the fact that it really didn't work. Here the movie is a very tight very taut thriller that seems almost alien when compared to the first one which seemed less serious.The fact that this is a tighter and better plotted thriller makes the fact that there is a major plot jump less easy to accept. There is a moment when Frank finds out whats really going on and he doesn't really tell anyone. He doesn't clue in the police which he should considering whats really transpiring he just continues the one man crusade to get the bad guys for those keeping score its about the time he leaves the biolab.Yes I understand that the movie up to this point has more plot holes than you could drive a fleet of trucks through but there is a whacked internal logic that allows for some of the holes but not this. It wobbles the film slightly in that other things become more glaring like the sense the film is missing part of the soul that made the first film such a great balls to the wall thrill ride.Don't get me wrong I love this movie and as a guilty pleasure its probably going to be on my list of best films of the year but I should have liked it more... which is an odd thing to say about a film I'm rating 9 out of 10.Great action. Great Characters. A plot with more holes in it than all the swiss cheese ever made. If you love action see this movie.";

Jason Statham is somewhat a likable hero with some screen presence but in the movie he turns into Neo from The Matrix literally even flying at some points.

Lots of gratuitously enjoyable T  A action so densely packed you need to blink a little more often than normal to get ready for the next scene. And lots of good clean actionfilm fun. However this was NOT a stand alone movie it had a basis of rules we have come to expect this universe to obey. It had a very well laden rather uncommonly found and well built foundation and it is obvious that the makers of this film decided to completely ignore that foundation thusly as a sequel Transporter 2 well what can be said is that this was one of the worst sequels ever why? Because it obeyed all the tried and true bad sequel rules the most major two of which are addition of flavors and acceleration of importance both of these thrown in with a brand new love interest and a near cameoappearance type performance by Franois Berland where he played a masterful and taught protagonist in disguise in the first movie he played something more on par with Brain the dog character from the inspector gadget cartoon whilst the transporter himself turned from a simple character with simple values into an international super spy relying more on gadgets and stealth than his fists or personal cunning but i digress back to my previous point. The addition of a female assassin who is so sexy she in fact does not wear a full set of clothing once in the movie her entire wardrobe consisting of lingerie and fishnets with the occasional super thin robe just screams desperation from the filmmakers as an addition of flavor. While the first movie had a more humanitarian plot as the problem in question was not plaguing the planet had it continued it would not be on ones doorstep but none the less is a hot political topic whilst the sequel was more James Bond not bad mouthing the legend mind you and over the top than anything as an acceleration of importance this is supposed to put you into a state of recognition as a REAL threat whereas this scale of global threat presented in this fashion was too unreal to ever even begin to believe. If nothing said so far as put this movie in bad perspective then let me sum up the worst of scenes in the entire movie for you a bomb threatening to detonate soon is attached to the bottom of the transporter's super car and so faced with this threat he decides to jump his car over a docking area very close to a dangling chain with a hook on the end so close in fact that it hits the bomb attached to the bottom of the car hard enough to yank it off without altering the trajectory of the car at all.

I mean it was like watching my life on the screen the gritty realism of it was just off the scale! I don't really get who the friend with the French accent was all about.

What they forgot to mention is that the two who wrote it were only responsible for writing the credits and all the jokes deleted for the sake of not causing mass suicide. Put more delicately this movie almost makes Pootie Tang look Oscar worthy which ironically enough was made fun of in the last Scary Movie for being horrid. Coincidence? Yeah not even some sort of Karma dealing fiend would wish this movie upon the world.So you ask What makes it so bad? I bet your thinking that all of the funny stuff was in the previews right? No actually there was no funny content in the previews at all it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie. Much the same way Hogan's Heroes was funny to people who weren't in Auschwitz during the Holocaust the previews are funny to those who haven't seen the movie. When you actually see the movie you start to ask Why was that funny in the preview? The answer You can see pretty flowers if you ignore the fact that they are growing from the corpse of a man who died during a freak green house accident.Do yourself a favor rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer. It'll be twice as funny make three times more sense and be only a fifth as painful.".

And let me tell you after seeing this travesty for myself I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie Epic Moviemore like Epic Dud is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude vulgar overfamiliar and even contrived and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now that I don't like any of the recent FriedbergSeltzer movies merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in that's how painful I found it. All in all probably not quite the worst movie ever but along with movies like Home Alone 4 NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions and one to avoid even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 110 Bethany Cox".

Why Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge would be in this I have no idea. But Crispin Glover? The oddball actor who was so great in films like Back to the Future River's Edge What's Eating Gilbert Grape and more? Yeah that's him all right as Willy Wonka dancing around to crappy songs.

I don't typically expect much from crappy spoof movies but I at least expect them to try. This came off as too much of a bad Saturday Night Live or Mad TV sketch that runs on way too long. A number of SNL's movies have felt that way but really....Why can't they ever pick good two of the six writers from Scary Movie? I feel like I've seen this brand of dumb humor a million times before albeit much better presented. I don't mind abstract references that would seemingly change the storyline the four protagonists becoming part of Wonka's candy but seconds later reverting to normal for example but these Family Guy style cutaways were so poorly done it almost made me want to leave. I felt genuinely ripped off longing for satires like Spy Hard Last Action Hero and Spaceballs. A friend and I debated whether this film or Scary Movie 4 was worse. We agreed it was a tie.The first two Scary Movies were funny because they didn't let the flat parts slow them down. Scary Movie 2 contained a number of bad jokes but it was okay because the filmmakers had a general idea of where they wanted to take the story and at least made a concentrated effort to tone down the absurdist humor in places where it wasn't needed.Epic Movie temporarily halts the predictable unfunny jokes close to the end of the film when Kal Penn who made two Harold and Kumar references also falling quite flat even amongst the largely tweenage audience spells out the film's morala sappy and poorly placed monologue on the importance of family. The repetitive use of the word Bitch to refer to the antagonist played by Jennifer Coolidge Stiffler's mother in American Pie a point also mentioned got tiring. I will admit there were a few laughworthy moments notably in the name of Jack Sparrow's parody Jack Swallows. The actors were all fairly devoid of talent especially that kid from the MySpace movie playing Ashton Kutcher and the directing seemed nonexistent.Seeing the trailer is a bit of a spoiler as well as you can tell when certain parts are coming up effectively ruining the humor. Plus the trailer has all the reasonably funny moments. It feels as if they directed the rest of the film as merely filler between the points showcased in the preview. I'm honestly not sure whether this review is in fact spoiling anything because the trailer does a pretty good job of that on its own.My recommendation don't see it in theaters. Don't rent it. Don't even watch it on TV when nothing else is on. Forget it was even made. Trust me you're not missing anything.".

	schema:reviewBody "When filling out this review I immediately selected '1 awful.' It struck me that awful is simply not accurate enough to describe this film. This film is a time vampire. Sucking and taking away the precious moments of your life that you'll never get back.Some claim there is an unfair bias against Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer but after seeing this film that is simply not the case. How anyone gives these guys money to make films is beyond me. A freshman at any US film school could make a better movie than this. Hell my dog could make a better film. These films are utter and complete garbage. I'm embarrassed to be a part of this generation after seeing this movie. The worst part about these films is the script. Yes I do realize it's supposed to be a comedy but a movie needs to have a script for it to actually work. These movies just parody random scenes from movies and then try to make them fit together. You go from Borat Prince of Narnia to Pirates of the Caribbean and it's just mind numbingly bad there's no cohesion between the scenes and it makes it that much more painful to watch. There's not a single funny moment in this movie. NOT ONE. I challenge anyone to find a scene that is actually funny and gives you a hint of a smile. The acting is terrible the set pieces are absolutely horrible and the only people who find this remotely funny are 13 year old prepubescent teens. It honestly stumps be how this film grossed 86 million dollars according to wikipedia. This is the biggest fraud next to Enron. These guys should stand before the International Criminals Court for a crime against humanity.".

	onyx:emotionText "When filling out this review I immediately selected '1 awful.' It struck me that awful is simply not accurate enough to describe this film. This film is a time vampire. Sucking and taking away the precious moments of your life that you'll never get back.Some claim there is an unfair bias against Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer but after seeing this film that is simply not the case. How anyone gives these guys money to make films is beyond me. A freshman at any US film school could make a better movie than this. Hell my dog could make a better film. These films are utter and complete garbage. I'm embarrassed to be a part of this generation after seeing this movie. The worst part about these films is the script. Yes I do realize it's supposed to be a comedy but a movie needs to have a script for it to actually work. These movies just parody random scenes from movies and then try to make them fit together.

Twisted man too twisted! Thoreau wrote in Walden that the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. In 'Little Children' we see that quiet desperation played out to full effect by desperate housewives excons and damaged loners. A deep study of loneliness 'Little Children' is morally ambiguous and doesn't judge. It uses humour it uses dread and it is a film that is at times quirky intelligent and ultimately fascinating.I liked a lot of things about this movie and in the week since I saw it I've grown to like it more. Thematically it should have been a terrible downer a collection of people who've all settled into what seems like the beginning of the end. They've married started having kids and every single one of them wakes up in the morning with dread. Is this all that is left? They have become or more importantly believe that they have become completely purposeless in the next of a continuing doldrum of empty days. Eternity awaits and eternity is purposeless existential hell.What is remarkable about a film whose subject should be so bleak is the warmth and humour within it. Characters in 'Little Children' reject the lack of purpose the unhappiness and try to reinject a passion for life that they once had. At its most extreme the quest for passion and purpose is lead by Noah Emmerich  certainly most of the humour comes from his character. Winslet Wilson and Emmerich are all flawed who isn't? but sympathetic. And then there is Jackie Earle Haley.How difficult must it have been to play a convicted sex offender who is both repellent and gasp sympathetic? If you're Jackie Earle Haley and you are stealing a film away from bigger stars and you've got a great part then apparently it isn't very hard at all. Creepy potentially dangerous but also fairly benign and pitiable Haley gives a much overlooked performance in what is quickly becoming a much overlooked film. He has given what I think is one of the best performances this year and what is certainly the best performance of his entire career.'Little Children' is twisted man too twisted but it is also very good and very compelling. Well worth the risk and extremely well paced. It was only after the film had ended that I noticed how long the film was. Completely engrossing I recommend it highly.".

	schema:headline " Suburban Paradise Lost";
	schema:reviewBody "You couldn't change the past the narrator of Little Children tells us at the movie's close but the future could be a different story. The lives of the men and women who live in the very paragon of bland suburbia appear to be crunchy and even somewhat unforgiving on the outside but inside they break well just like a little girl. A veritable sea of emotions from love despair neglect and hate churns below their pristine everythinginitsplace veneers.The placidity of this particular neighborhood is jolted by two things the arrival of a sex offender Jackie Earle Haley and the emergence of a relationship between marriedbutnottoeachother Sarah and Brad both events directly and obliquely are remarked upon by the nattering nabobs of middleclass conservatism in the town particularly the rather particular hausfraus and soccer moms.Sarah Pierce Winslet is a distant mother and wife when she and her daughter Lucy visit the neighborhood playground she sits away from the other mothers. As an indirect result Lucy doesn't play with the other boys and girls on the seesaws or merrygoround  she just plays quietly. Meanwhile as the emptyheaded women babble to each other but not Sarah a newcomer enters their midst  a stayathome father Brad whom they mockingly call behind his back of course The Prom King. Sarah's marriage seems empty and devoid of purpose. Brad for his part is married to a breadwinner  his wife Karen Jennifer Connelly is a documentary filmmaker who's completely absorbed with her work. Like Sarah Brad is a little emotionally distant from his wife and their son Aaron so it's no wonder he and Sarah become constant companions throughout the long hot suburban summer spending their days either at the park or at the public pool.The other main story thread involves the community's reaction to the presence of Ronnie McGorvey convicted as a sex offender for flashing a young boy. Soon there are fliers on telephone poles and an angry outrage group is formed led by expoliceman Larry Noah Emmerich who seems to be more upset with Ronnie's existence than anyone else in the town.At its core the movie is about repression and settling  staying with someone just because they provide you comfort but no love is no reason at all the film explains.

But the brilliant caveat here is that Ronnie is by no means a victim  not only did he do what he was accused of although he shows remorse and a lot of selfhate but he shows that he's capable of more of the same.In fact that's the genius of Todd Field's film  not only are people flawed but they're believably flawed. In Little Children people make decisions for selfish reasons and there's no wondrous epiphany that somehow saves the soul and good standing of the poor decision maker  people live with what they've done or they don't make the decision in the first place.Winslet and Haley were nominated for their work here the firstever nomination for Haley who was probably best known as Kelly Leak in the Bad News Bears films. He's eerie and creepy and utterly human as Ronnie McGorvey. You never really feel sympathy for the deviant but you might feel a twinge of unease. For Winslet this was the fifth nomination for the beauteous Briton and it's astounding that she hasn't yet won. Then again she's only 31 years old! Little Children is a stark seamless unsettling story that grabs a hold of your psyche and twists it almost to the breaking point relying on strong performances by Winslet Haley Wilson and Emmerich as well as a tortuous plot that provides quite a jaded look at the tranquility of suburban life.".

	onyx:emotionText "You couldn't change the past the narrator of Little Children tells us at the movie's close but the future could be a different story. The lives of the men and women who live in the very paragon of bland suburbia appear to be crunchy and even somewhat unforgiving on the outside but inside they break well just like a little girl. A veritable sea of emotions from love despair neglect and hate churns below their pristine everythinginitsplace veneers.The placidity of this particular neighborhood is jolted by two things the arrival of a sex offender Jackie Earle Haley and the emergence of a relationship between marriedbutnottoeachother Sarah and Brad both events directly and obliquely are remarked upon by the nattering nabobs of middleclass conservatism in the town particularly the rather particular hausfraus and soccer moms.Sarah Pierce Winslet is a distant mother and wife when she and her daughter Lucy visit the neighborhood playground she sits away from the other mothers. As an indirect result Lucy doesn't play with the other boys and girls on the seesaws or merrygoround  she just plays quietly. Meanwhile as the emptyheaded women babble to each other but not Sarah a newcomer enters their midst  a stayathome father Brad whom they mockingly call behind his back of course The Prom King. Sarah's marriage seems empty and devoid of purpose. Brad for his part is married to a breadwinner  his wife Karen Jennifer Connelly is a documentary filmmaker who's completely absorbed with her work. Like Sarah Brad is a little emotionally distant from his wife and their son Aaron so it's no wonder he and Sarah become constant companions throughout the long hot suburban summer spending their days either at the park or at the public pool.The other main story thread involves the community's reaction to the presence of Ronnie McGorvey convicted as a sex offender for flashing a young boy.

	schema:reviewBody "Out of all the Oscar Bait films I've seen this year this film beats them all. Little Children is an unbelievable masterpiece about what it means to grow up. This idea is brilliantly portrayed through characters  while categorized as adults  have yet to outgrow certain adolescent stages.Brad is a man who never got the chance to experience the spotlight in his youth and now he desperately craves attention acknowledgment or admiration in any form.Sarah is a woman who never learned how to grow past her own selfishness. She is angry at her daughter for needing attention when all Sarah wants is some time to herself.Larry is a man who still harbors bullylike tendencies and desperately just wants to fit in and be one of the guys. This is seen through his treatment of Ronnie  the pedophile who was just released from prison and returned to the neighborhood.Ronnie is the dangerous man. The man who cannot connect with people his own age and seeks sexual gratification with children or with people who  like him  cannot fit into the adult world.This isn't an action moving  it's an interaction movie. The scenes between characters have you nailed to your seat and deeply invested. The characters interact within their small community and their actions with each other build into a climatic explosion that forces them all to face truths about themselves and  finally  accept their responsibilities as mothers husbands fathers and humans. This accepting is what separates little children from adults immature from mature.The tale is moving sad hilarious dark breathtaking thoughtprovoking and many other creative adjectives. It forces you to reevaluate your idea of yourself and your thoughts on others. It forces you to see people you would normally loath and dismiss in a differently light. This a movie you will come out of changed. If you only see one film a higher I cannot recommend this one more.".

The boredom condition of Emma Bovary and Sarah Pierce are very similar both fell trapped in an unhappy marriage and have love affairs to escape from their boredom. This movie really deserved the nomination to the Oscar in the categories of Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role with Jackie Earle Haley having a topnotch performance in the role of a deranged sick man Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role to the stunning Kate Winslet one my favorite and best actress ever  my only remark is that at least for my eyes and taste she is a charming and beautiful woman and apparently Sarah Pierce is a plain woman and Best Writing Adapted Screenplay to Todd Field and Tom Perrotta that were able to perfectly develop a complex story with entwined lives of many characters in an adequate pace and eroticism. In the end Little Children is one of those unforgettable and highly recommended movies. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Pecados ntimos Intimate Sins".

	schema:headline " A Highly Unusual and Exceptional Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Can there be such a thing as a feelgood movie about marital infidelity and suburban ennui? If so then I believe this haunting powerful and superb new movie from Todd Field may be it.A feelgood movie was not in the least what I was expecting from this based on the trailers and on Field's prior film the astringent and depressing In the Bedroom. And it's not like I left the theatre feeling the need to break into song. But unlike other films about the stultifying atmosphere of suburban America and the prisons so many people seem to make out of their domestic worlds Little Children ends with a distinct feeling of hope and optimism. In other domestic dramas the characters are frequently unlikable and they appear to drift through their worlds allowing things to happen to them without taking any responsibility for themselves. In Little Children Field does not present us with a handful of caustic stereotypes but rather with a cast of actors who create warm but flawed human beings. These characters don't drift through life. They have things they care about and they want and feel that they deserve some of the small happinesses that all human beings have a right to. But they also screw up make bad decisions act irrationally. What saves them and the movie is that in the end they all wake up realize they're chasing dreams and decide to make something of the lives they have rather than the lives they think they want.I thought this was a hopeful message and one that carries with it a tremendous impact in this post911 culture when the safety nets on which we've built our existences have been ripped out from under us and we're left trying to make sense of a scary world. This film in its closing moments states outright that there's no time like now to begin taking control of our own worlds and making of them what we want. The best weapon we can wield against an uncertain future are our children who can learn from our mistakes and make something new rather than simply repeat an endless cycle. As for the acting.....Kate Winslet shines as Sarah the suburban mom who doesn't fit in and embarks upon a reckless affair to fill a void in her days. Her performance is one of those small triumphs of acting in which Winslet builds a living breathing human being from the ground up through a series of subtle and thoughtful choices. Patrick Wilson such a limp noodle in the screen version of The Phantom of the Opera is pitch perfect as Brad the stud who attracts Sarah's eye. And the other actors take full advantage of their smaller roles Jennifer Connelly as Brad's loving but distracted wife Jackie Earle Haley as the film's most tragic figure Noah Emmerich as an excop who takes homeland security into his own hands and Phyllis Somerville who has a couple of beautifully heartbreaking moments as the mom of an outcast.The screenplay is thematically elaborate. There's hardly an element of one character's storyline that doesn't find a parallel in the storyline of another. The theme of parenting is of course central but beyond simply focusing on the responsibilities parents owe their children the film goes deeper and examines how parents' behavior affects their children and the extent to which parents can change the world for good or bad through what they hand down to the children who inherit it.A bracing fantastic film.Grade A".

I found myself so affected by it because of the sheer unpredictable storyline going to predictable then going back to the unknown.You will watch how people whirl themselves into their own actions and then try to find a way out of these consequences. Then they free themselves at times to trap themselves next. Absolutely brilliant with an array of emotions succeeding to one another.Visually sumptuous. People stayed in the theater and talked about it.Looking back you feel afterward how much love and dedication from director crew and actors went into it. Just a stunning beautiful movie.".

I found myself so affected by it because of the sheer unpredictable storyline going to predictable then going back to the unknown.You will watch how people whirl themselves into their own actions and then try to find a way out of these consequences. Then they free themselves at times to trap themselves next. Absolutely brilliant with an array of emotions succeeding to one another.Visually sumptuous. People stayed in the theater and talked about it.Looking back you feel afterward how much love and dedication from director crew and actors went into it. Just a stunning beautiful movie.";

'Little Children' zooms in on suburbia navigating the world of desperate housewives and husbands. The dish proves a pleasant diversion with crisp performances and a tasty centre.So tasty in fact that Little Children is one of the most interesting films of recent years. It is far from the greatest and is not devoid of faults but a genuine evocation of interest should be attributed to Field's story. Every character unflinchingly demands our attention. We want to know more about precisely everyone in the community. In the front row for fascination sits Ronnie the resident child molestor who pends between likable and freak. He is the overriding nominator for 'Little Children'  and his presence greatly upsets the parents.Yet most salience is given to Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson as Sarah and Pierce  two lonely bored and desperate housespouses who in the midst of having nothing to do innocently begin an extramarital affair with each other. Through calm narration the film introduces Sarah as an anthropologist and remarks how she is different from the contingent of housemoms. However it becomes apparent that the director is the anthropologist and not Sarah. Indeed Field studies human relationships accordingly interweaving loneliness desperation jealousy lust and betrayal. Sarah in fact loses her 'objective' stance and melts in with the rest as she indulges in her passion with Brad.It needs to be said that 'Little Children' often tips over into comedy and it is this refreshing edge that bumps it up to 810 on my scale. It treats serious subjects such as pedophilia infidelity and loneliness  but it does so with the spark in the eye. A consistent cloud of laughter seemed to hover in the air of my theatre at the Stockholm Film Festival and Kate Winslet was undoubtedly the catalyst. She gives a fine performance with excellent emotional transparency layered skill and above all with an inherent funny bone that translates to a goofy woman. The humour is surprisingly intune even with the other characters with all their quirks and afflictions such as childmolestation and online pornography.Toward the end 'Little Children' patiently crafts a sense of impending doom that deserves much credit. Nevertheless the ending isn't the best imaginable. The film could benefit from being slightly shorter. Lastly the use of cute kids as tearjerkers is a disappointing cheapshot used a little too often and seems mostly a tiresome American phenomenon. Yet as a whole entity Little Children is a very interesting film that makes the best possible use of characters relationships and suburban drama. Throw in a few exceptionally neat steadicam shots  Scorsesestyle  and the experience is complete.8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Love the Children";
	schema:reviewBody "The acclaimed director of In the Bedroom brings a brand new type of adulterous love tale. Todd Field coadapts Tom Perrotta's novel and never leaves the source material unattended. The film is multilayered with subtle undertones and illustrious questions wrapped into a parable of two people Brad Adamson Patrick Wilson and Sarah Pierce Kate Winslet individuals that feel so disenchanted with existence that they find comfort in one another. Brad is married to Kathy Jennifer Connelly a beautiful Documentary film maker that pushes her husband to pass the Bar Exam that he's successfully failed twice. She sends him on nightly trips to the library to study where Brad often gets sidetracked into watching a couple of young skaters skate around. Sarah is working on her dissertation and retires to the playground everyday with her daughter Lucy to reminisce with the women of the neighborhood. Sarah is married to Richard an awkward man with underlying motives and fantasies. Although his vanishing in the film is as awkward as he is.Upon talking about raising children and busy schedules the women of the neighborhood are delighted with the return of Brad a.k.a. The Prom King who indulges their erotic fantasies. The attraction between Sarah and Brad isn't as obvious from the beginning but a small bet will change that. The two acquire at first a friendship in the interest of simple companionship a get away from their spouses where they could feel support. After the sexual tension is ignited it remains there through trips to the park pool and Sarah's infamous laundry room.Todd Field's brutal honesty of adulthood in Suburbia is strikingly palpable and he never leaves the mind of the characters. Unfortunately Field and Perrotta often bring many questions about morality and judgment to the table and leave the subjects murky. The adaptation is great but there are so many points and features to make in this narrative the two writers couldn't tackle each task. The dialogue is always engaging and inviting for the viewer I always felt the need to listen to every word.The performances for the most part are remarkable. Patrick Wilson's Brad is extremely characterflawed. His immaturity is evident in every scene and Wilson does an impressive job of portraying that. Brad is stuck in a world a world somewhere in between high school graduation and yesterday's pasta dinner. His identity seeking is never exposed until the meeting of Sarah and his immaturity is never more manifested until the finale. The underdeveloped character of Kathy is sometimes bothersome but with the flow of the story it fits the aura of the picture. Jennifer Connelly does well with her minimal screen time but it isn't the marvel of the film that stands out like other lowscreen time performances have been in the past. Also the great Noah Emmerich and Phyllis Somerville are great in their respective roles.The two standouts lay in the unknown comeback of Jackie Earle Haley who plays Ronald McGovern a recently released pedophile searching for a new beginning in a town unkind to the power of forgiveness and profound origination. In Haley the viewer finds the most sympathy of all the players and this viewer was delighted to find it. In no way are people accepting of pedophilia but we can start to sympathize with anyone who yearns for the restart of any kind and becomes bewildered and astray in the process. Haley's Ronnie is so tortured in his soul but does find security and contentment in his loving mother. She offers solace and guidance in Ronnie's rebuilding of life that adds to the atmosphere and provides a beautiful emotional center to the Children. The other standout could be no other than the most talented young actress working today Kate Winslet. Her Sarah like Ronnie has a tortured persona along with a yearn for happiness that is missing in her life. The symbolism of trains in the film gave amazing insight to what Sarah and Brad were really about. Winslet falls inside of Sarah and never comes to the surface. At 31 Winslet is still thinking of different ways to enchant the audience and give us something new every time. The vivacity of Sarah is sometimes hard to swallow because of her priorities with her child and Brad but in the finale you will feel comfort in the choice of her character. But this is not by any means the best performance of her career but a definite contender nonetheless in the competitive Actress race.The best part of the film is the complete wrapping of it in general. Despite the many questions left unanswered I have never felt so satisfied with the resolution of a dramatic picture like Little Children. There is however a coy hollowness at the center of the film but the rest makes up for seemingly unavoidable flaws that came about. Oscar consideration should focus on Picture Director Actress Supporting Actor and Adapted Screenplay and hopefully that can be in its future. This is a very artsy type movie not for everyone but if the Academy is feeling like nominating a House of Sand and Fog meets In the Bedroom with a subtle side of Closer then we'll have our dramatic independent film of the year in the Oscar race.Grade 12".

	schema:reviewBody "Todd Field's Little Children's screenplay was written in collaboration with Tom Perrotta on whose eponymous novel it's based. Perrotta wrote Election's Bad Haircut's and Joe College's funny ironic screenplays before this. But though mildly satirical at times in its vision of middleclass white infidelity this second film at last from the director of the powerful 2000 In the Bedroom with its themes out of Cheever or Updike also moves toward the solemn and the shocking.One big reason for that is a second plot about a justreleased sex offender and a troubled excop who turns into a selfappointed protector of public morality campaigning to drive the exprisoner out of town.Brad Patrick Wilson is a househusband caring for his little boy while feebly preparing for his previously failed bar exams. He has a gorgeous but emasculating wife Kathy Jennifer Connelly who's a successful PBSstyle documentary filmmaker. Sarah Kate Winslet with an MA in English in charge of a recalcitrant little girl with whom she has little patience at times has a welloff distant husband Gregg Edelman who's a pretentious adman who gets off on Web porn. Sarah and Brad meet in a park where moms take their kids in East Wyndham Massachusetts. They wind up kissing when they first meet mainly to shock the other moms. Brad and Sarah spend a lot of the summer minding their kids together at the municipal pool. This turns into a torrid affair with frequent sex at Sarah's husband's large house. They're attractive and attracted and their general dissatisfaction with their spouses and with where they are now heightens their need to throw themselves at each other with the utmost abandon.Meanwhile Ronnie former child actor Jackie Earle Haley vividly remembered from Bad News Bears and Breaking Away and strong in a new way here has come into town he's the sex offender a painfully selfaware one and he lives with the one person who loves him his aging mother Ruth a convincing Phyllis Somerville while the excop Larry Noah Emmerich wages his war as a oneman committee. Larry and Brad have met and Larry persuades Brad who already wastes time watching boys skateboarding when he's supposed to be boning up for the bar exam to join a night touch football league team made up of cops  and thus the infidelity and the sex offender elements are linked. But they would be anyway because this is a small community. And one particularly hot day Ronnie comes to the municipal swimming pool and causes an outcry when he's spotted ogling young girls under water.The other moms from the park who were afraid of Brad and called him the Prom King are gently satirized by a voiceover narration spoken by Will Lyman of Frontline on PBS which sounds like a high school educational film. Perrotta is after all a comic writer. But more of that later.The movie has a bright intense clear visual style sometimes making use of extreme closeups. Since the acting and directing are fine this gives things a feeling of authority. It's also effective in underlining both the satirical and the sensual aspects of the story and heightens the emotional effect when the narrative lines move toward crisis.Brad's development the novelbased voiceover tells us may have been arrested by his mother's dying when he was in his early teens and this explains why he watches the skateboarding boys with such longing they're having the playtime that was stolen from him.Another theme is that of Cheryl Marsha Dietlein Sarah's friend and neighbor who babysits with her daughter when she's having sex with Brad speedwalks with her and gets her into a bookdiscussion group leading to a pointed scene in which Madame Bovary is discussed and Sarah defends the adulterous heroine as someone who revolted in search of freedom. The older women nod approvingly while one of the park moms doesn't get it at all.Partly because it's hard to juggle all these elements from a 350page novel the ironic narrative voice disappears throughout the film's midsection.At the end matters all come to a head with Brad and Sarah with Ronnie and with his erstwhile nemesis Larry and a lot of tension is created through Hitchcockian crosscutting between these climaxing threads.Field has avoided the extreme finale of his first film  this one shares such heavy concerns as families infidelity crime and confronting death but by contrast this ending though breathless and troubling is ultimately sweet and marked by reconciliation and acceptance. One may wonder if underlying issues have really been resolved. The film feels somewhat overlong but the nuanced characterizations and fine acting and the attractiveness of the central couple entertain and interest us mightily.Perhaps the one weakness overall is a slight uncertainty of tone which explains why some viewers are troubled by the voiceover and also by its long disappearance midway. If situations are seen primarily as highly serious or even horrifying it's hard to see how the satirical feel fits in and at the end we seem to have lost touch with where we started out. Ultimately as with so many American stories on film the writers seem to have tried to tackle too much material. Nothing wrong with that but they haven't quite got the worldview to encompass it all. Technically though Field has achieved more polish and shown more confidence even compared to his already admirable and powerful first film of five years ago. The cast is wonderful well chosen and well used. Field is an experienced actor he knows the craft. This has got to be a film to think about at year's end when best lists are made up.".

	schema:headline " very smart about Little Adults with odd screwups";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie does a wonderful job of representing the undertow of confusion and stuckness that threatens to pull people under. It cuts among interlocking stories that each center on someone who is about to dive down beneath their established life and for entirely normal believable reasons. 45 minutes into the film all the main characters have thrown themselves into the vortex creating the uneasy fear one feels for people who are about to risk everything they've deliberately built up in order to end a sense of suffocation that is much less concrete than the secure surface of their lives but somehow more real. This is strong suspense film about that crucial question of whether or not our own happy lives actually make us feel alive.The movie covers an updated version of Cheever territory  the despair beneath the comforts of American suburbia. Little Children is better than American Beauty and The Ice Storm and is intelligent about the effects of thwarted desire in the way of Todd Haynes's Safe. It has the eerie disorientation of The Swimmerj It's particularly shrewd about the original source of romantic yearning itself. The film's real LIttle Children are the parents from two different families who fall in love with each other. They are the stayathome Mom and the Mr. Mom who remarry each other informally at the neighborhood pool where they spend every summer day taking care of their adorable kids. Together they are as bland as they are in their actual marriage. Their interest in each other doesn't unearth some suppressed power or depth in themselves which is always the assumption behind the affair. It reflects their mutual wish to recapture the unrestricted experience they associate with childhood  no bar exams no dissertations to finish no spouses with budgets or habits of Internet wankfests at the work computer. You can see the affair coming with the first encounter between these two fairhaired parents who are the bored and aimless and also subordinate to their focused and competent spouses in each of their marriages. Unlike the breadwinners these two are still looking for what they want to do in life. When they seem to find that thing in their daily poolside parenting and then later in their daily sex they are put by the film into strict parallel with their preschool kids sharing their afternoon naps. It's a nice dream  play and sleep play and sleep all feeling unforced and unchangingly attractive every day happily the same. As if.The other true thing about the movie is that Sarah and Brad Winsett and Wilson resolve to run off together and then chicken out and chicken out accidentallyonpurpose in ways that allow them to go home to their focused successful spouses who are capable of taking care of them and yet go home without acknowledging to themselves that this is what they really want. Sarah concocts a panic attack when her child wanders out of her sight for five minutes in the nighttime park where she had gone to meet Brad. Brad interrupts his trip to destiny to fulfill his wannabe skateboarder dreams injuring his beautiful body and giving himself the perfect excuse never to try anything again. Lots and lots of us finally stand up for ourselves only to take this kind of dive right away as soon as we decently can. One reason is that we stood up for the wrong thing even though it took us forever to do so.So can the problems be overlooked? Well let's inventory them. The movie polarizes straight and sensitive suburbia in a phony way. The other moms are stereotypes of sexual repression living on the edge of hysteria. When Brad and Sarah first kiss in front of them on a jokey dare from Sarah the moms grab up their kids and flee just as the neighborhood moms do later at the pool when the registered sex offender is found swimming around with a mask and snorkel. The same false polarity infects the original marriages the dominant spouses are so disconnected from their partners that you wonder how they could have been married for even a few weeks why would a phony moneygrubbing brander ever have married a failed English lit PhD student or vice versa and why would a smart documentary maker ever marry the pretty but superdull Brad whose soul can be filled through the camaraderie of nightleague football? In the film's clunkiest moment Ronnie the sex offender has a date with an attractive clinicallydepressed thirtysomething played well by Jane Adams bonds with her in a sympathetic fraternal way and then as she's praising their conversation in the car starts to jerk off and threaten her like a possessed maniac. The moment destroys the analogy between criminalized and normal perversion that had helped to humanize Ronnie his mother is the film's strongest single character played brilliantly by Phyllis Somerville. His automutilation at the end just reproduces the suburban sexual hysteria the film supposedly critiques. Equally implausible is that his tormentor the other unloved man excop and nightleague loser Larry turns into his rescuer this is the kind of instant redemption that the basic intelligence of this film would rule out.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie does a wonderful job of representing the undertow of confusion and stuckness that threatens to pull people under. It cuts among interlocking stories that each center on someone who is about to dive down beneath their established life and for entirely normal believable reasons. 45 minutes into the film all the main characters have thrown themselves into the vortex creating the uneasy fear one feels for people who are about to risk everything they've deliberately built up in order to end a sense of suffocation that is much less concrete than the secure surface of their lives but somehow more real. This is strong suspense film about that crucial question of whether or not our own happy lives actually make us feel alive.The movie covers an updated version of Cheever territory  the despair beneath the comforts of American suburbia. Little Children is better than American Beauty and The Ice Storm and is intelligent about the effects of thwarted desire in the way of Todd Haynes's Safe. It has the eerie disorientation of The Swimmerj It's particularly shrewd about the original source of romantic yearning itself. The film's real LIttle Children are the parents from two different families who fall in love with each other. They are the stayathome Mom and the Mr. Mom who remarry each other informally at the neighborhood pool where they spend every summer day taking care of their adorable kids. Together they are as bland as they are in their actual marriage. Their interest in each other doesn't unearth some suppressed power or depth in themselves which is always the assumption behind the affair. It reflects their mutual wish to recapture the unrestricted experience they associate with childhood  no bar exams no dissertations to finish no spouses with budgets or habits of Internet wankfests at the work computer. You can see the affair coming with the first encounter between these two fairhaired parents who are the bored and aimless and also subordinate to their focused and competent spouses in each of their marriages. Unlike the breadwinners these two are still looking for what they want to do in life. When they seem to find that thing in their daily poolside parenting and then later in their daily sex they are put by the film into strict parallel with their preschool kids sharing their afternoon naps. It's a nice dream  play and sleep play and sleep all feeling unforced and unchangingly attractive every day happily the same. As if.The other true thing about the movie is that Sarah and Brad Winsett and Wilson resolve to run off together and then chicken out and chicken out accidentallyonpurpose in ways that allow them to go home to their focused successful spouses who are capable of taking care of them and yet go home without acknowledging to themselves that this is what they really want. Sarah concocts a panic attack when her child wanders out of her sight for five minutes in the nighttime park where she had gone to meet Brad. Brad interrupts his trip to destiny to fulfill his wannabe skateboarder dreams injuring his beautiful body and giving himself the perfect excuse never to try anything again. Lots and lots of us finally stand up for ourselves only to take this kind of dive right away as soon as we decently can. One reason is that we stood up for the wrong thing even though it took us forever to do so.So can the problems be overlooked? Well let's inventory them. The movie polarizes straight and sensitive suburbia in a phony way. The other moms are stereotypes of sexual repression living on the edge of hysteria. When Brad and Sarah first kiss in front of them on a jokey dare from Sarah the moms grab up their kids and flee just as the neighborhood moms do later at the pool when the registered sex offender is found swimming around with a mask and snorkel. The same false polarity infects the original marriages the dominant spouses are so disconnected from their partners that you wonder how they could have been married for even a few weeks why would a phony moneygrubbing brander ever have married a failed English lit PhD student or vice versa and why would a smart documentary maker ever marry the pretty but superdull Brad whose soul can be filled through the camaraderie of nightleague football? In the film's clunkiest moment Ronnie the sex offender has a date with an attractive clinicallydepressed thirtysomething played well by Jane Adams bonds with her in a sympathetic fraternal way and then as she's praising their conversation in the car starts to jerk off and threaten her like a possessed maniac. The moment destroys the analogy between criminalized and normal perversion that had helped to humanize Ronnie his mother is the film's strongest single character played brilliantly by Phyllis Somerville. His automutilation at the end just reproduces the suburban sexual hysteria the film supposedly critiques. Equally implausible is that his tormentor the other unloved man excop and nightleague loser Larry turns into his rescuer this is the kind of instant redemption that the basic intelligence of this film would rule out. The problem is the film undermines the quasiheroic struggles of their flawed main characters  Ronnie Brad and Sarah  so that their weak and pathetic ends make the earlier dramas seem unreal in retrospect. If they fold THIS easily then what were we watching the previous two hours.The men in this film  ouch. They are useless and dangerous by turns. The women are suffocated and unhappy. The American middleclass comes off badly  spoiled unfocused and without the strength to save itself or anybody else. We are the movie says the little children of world.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of seeing the premiere of Little Children at Telluride. The incomprable Mr.Feild hid behind the curtain near the concession at the back of the Nugget Theater wringing his hands looking a wee bit nauseous. It was all very endearing. The film is superb. Amongst the American fare it tops my list of films fromTelluride next to the incomprable 'Day Night Day Night' directed by Julia Loktev. For me it was all about Jackie Earle Haley. Haley sneaks onto the screen 45 minutes into the narrative bursting the happy bubble of familiar ups and downs of married with children life. The result unnerving edgy tension that could be cut with a knife. Haley's performance is vulnerable awkward and possibly the strongest male role to light up the screen this year. Haley deserves accolades praise and loads of attention. He's been a favorite darling of mine for ages...something I had the good fortune of recounting to Feild after the screening. Feild provides many questions and very few answers. Haley's character may have been released from jail for indecent exposure to a minor yet Feild does a delicate balancing act without faltering on the side of good guy bad guy. This is NOT a film about pedophiles. This is a film about faults judgments weaknesses that consume chew one up and spits you out again. And in the end the entire paradigm of suburban life has been twisted shaken pushed and pulled.There is tragedy openness shifts that do not add up to ultimate conclusions. This complex tale weaves passion disillusionment love lust desire ambivalence. But most importantly the tender web of MotherChild relations WITHOUT ever vilifying Mother. Feild breaks from this poisonous obsessive castrating oedipal mothersubject paradigm and addresses the people who float in and out of crisis above and beyond being tied to their social roles and traditional moral codes. Winslet encapsulates the awkward intellectual mom who loves her daughter but has very very human ambivalence towards this 247 duty of unconditional loveacceptance and never ending giving. Finally she decides to give something back to herself by playing out a torrid love affair with the Prom King Patrick Wilson another character ripe with flaws and exudes humanness. This should win many many many accolades for 2006 it's a rare stand out. A powerful disturbingly familiar tale played out eloquently and held at benign distance via the brilliant use of odd narration. It's a strange convention but Feild masters this as he skewers and satirizes and describes it's subjects with authority. The narration was pleasantly reminiscent of Fishing with John often obvious but nicely pushing the plot along with often more than a hint of humor. The serious tone of the narrator serves to punctuate the utter ridiculous paradox of the banalities of being 'married with children' and having a flashy adventurous love affair in and around the locations of everyday stay at home summer existence the park the pool the evening football game.The Affair never reveals itself as the beallandendall answer to disillusionment and sadness of suburban middle class marriage. Nor the causeeffect that sets the plot in motion. Even more satisfyingly the affair does not legitimate the happy normative narrative ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Todd Field follows up his Academy Award nominated 2001 film In the Bedroom with a much more accessible entry. Field's 2006 Academy Award nominated film Little Children is magnetic  a movie that manages to be artistic and entertaining all at once. It's part drama part satire and determined to have an impact.The film strikes an incredibly strange balance between the serious and the surreal by taking the familiar and by now cinematically worn out subject of parents in unhappy marriages and marrying it with a wry narration played is if it were lifted from a BBC Documentary on Jane Goodall. The narrator serves as a warm and sometimes funny guide through the lives of Sarah Pierce Kate Winslet and Brad Adamson Patrick Wilson two stayathome parents locked into an empty and unsatisfying routine of childcare in a haunting treelined suburbia while their spouses live more interesting lives out in the work force.We meet Sarah in a park where she sits apart from the other nattering emptyheaded mothers and tells herself that she's not one of them. Little Children's view of fulltime child rearing is a bleak one. For an ambitious and intelligent woman it's almost a death sentence or at the very least a big giveup. Sarah loves her daughter but she also loved having a life. Now her life is her daughter and whoever or whatever Sarah once was is gone replaced by the word mother. The real Sarah long dead and buried by a pregnancy is reawakened when she meets Brad.Brad is the sexy stayathome father from down the street and the fantasy of the other mothers in Sarah's park. She meets him on a bet and finds in Brad the intelligent dissatisfied companion missing amongst the other blissfully dull easily satisfied soccer moms. As these things often do their relationship boils and builds into something torrid and Sarah is left struggling to live a private life as a mother and a private socially unacceptable life where she's truly alive.Little Children works brilliantly as a mesmerizing character study about the way we judge others and ourselves. Field distills this theme masterfully throughout and braids the strangely sad sometimes disturbing story of Ronald James McGovery's Jackie Earl Haley re assimilation back into a fearful judgemental society with the primary tale of Sarah and Brad's desperate suburban angst.The point here for Field isn't to demonstrate some urbane superiority over the suburban milk and cookies set but rather to provide a frank examination of what's under that sticky jam encrusted surface. Little Children examines the sacrifices that must be made for parenthood and picketfence living and holds them up to the harsh light of reality. It doesn't judge instead it seems to be asking us not to judge and see parents for what they are Living breathing emotional beings with unfulfilled hopes dreams and aspirations beyond whether or not to give their kid juice with breakfast.There are lessons to be learned in Todd Field's lush and beautiful film and they're right there out in the open. Unlike other films of its genre it never talks down to its audience or layers its theme under a thick viscous of snobby arthouse imagery. Little Children mixes plain authenticity with a sharp wit for a completely unique quirky take on playground politics.".

I can't imagine why Little Children was overlooked at this years Oscar. In my opinion it stands its own against The Departed et al.

The final scenes where Ronnie the man arrested for exposing himself to a minor completely reverts to childlike fauxretarded behavior and smashes his mother's menagerie of glass figurines. Tennessee Williams this is not. When he castrates himself at the end I actually groaned out loud. Naturally since it's Hollywood everything is restored to the status quo at the end. Everyone has an epiphany and sees the light and goes back to their unhappy marriages. I was dumbfounded! I kept thinking about all those people on Oscar night  the voters and the people involved with this film and all the critics who gave this movie its reputation  actually cooperating with this idea that THIS is the best Hollywood can do in terms of social commentary. In the Bedroom was a very different movie but mostly because there were better actors and a basis of solid writing by Andre Dubus. This script and the book it was based on are the lowest common denominator. Shame on Hollywood for peddling such crap.This is an update on 1950s sexual hysteria. It's not smart and it's not art.".

As the film began I thought it was going to be a comedy a satire. We see three typical suburban housewives we're taught by the intrusive narrator... typical suburban housewives? What lazy shorthand twaddle. What is a typical urban house wife? Sitting apart from them  this is meant to sledgehammer home the point  Sarah was not a typical suburban housewife? Huh? Why because she has a MFA? I've lived in cities all my life and I would say that the bridge and tunnel crowd if you'll excuse the expression comes in all stripes. Sarah is played by Kate Winslet. We are later told by the narrator that she's unattractive and boyish... Kate Winslet? Kate Winslet's husband who is having a virtual affair with an internet porn star is a nothing character. He is there for no other reason that to make Winslet's character sympathetic in her adultery. Patrick Wilson who plays the unemployed exjock is positively pallid  he is so bland and lifeless that we wonder what his wife a documentary film maker played by Jennifer Connelly is doing with him. Apparently as I read later Connelly is meant to convey a brittle nature cold and cunning but in this film she seems fragile  a quality virtually always conveyed by Connelly. She seems to adore her son she's affectionate her son adores her. But apparently I was supposed to see her as distant and unable to be loving with her son in contrast to her instant empathy with the children in her documentary.Then a man who exposed himself to a minor gets out of jail and moves to town. This rallies those suburbanites in fear. He we are told by other characters is a child molester. He too becomes an instant stereo type  all childmolesters are piggyeyed pockfaced minimonsters with zero social skills who live with their mommies. For crying out loud! What makes child molesters scary is they have no distinguishing characteristics. In real life we find out the youth pastor is a child molester or our accountant or our brotherinlaw.The whole thing rang utterly false.".

I was warned by a writer friend of mine that the pedophilia might turn me off to the film but the issues raised were brilliantlywoven into the plot line and I never shy away from watching films that portray potential realities.It was a good film. The actors were spoton and Jennifer Connelly was also really great. I recommend this film to anyone.The movie ended on an ambiguous note i'm not sure how I feel about the outcome of how the characters ended up. The love affair between the adulterers was charming and real but in the end it seemed like the end of the film took upon a moral note without convincingly demonstrating how the characters ended up in their decisions. It's almost like the story decided not to carry things through and reveal the possibilities of the plot line because the film 'had to end.' Despite this it was a good film and raises a lot of questions.".

Being a parent myself I wanted to laugh a little about our anguishes and dreams and little regrets.Little children felt like a horror movie. I came out deeply sad. Sarah Kate Winslet is surrounded by a company of perverts her husband Richard is in love with an internet porn star Ronnie is a child abuser  really scary very convincingly played by J E Haley simply mean people the other mothers as soon as they notice that Sarah has more pride and courage than they have Larry the excop who has a logical explanation why he is so mean but no excuse in a more subtle way Kathy Adamson played by J Connelly and cold hearted idiots like handsome Patrick. For Sarah there is no way out. There is nobody she can trust and she is very lonely among all those deranged or mean people.She meets Patrick and has a very sweet relationship with him. She accepts his inferior intelligence and his primordial fear of his wife and she understands his difficulty to accept his own feelings. They both try hard not to hurt anybody's feelings. Patrick's wife Kathy notices nevertheless. Strangely she barely reacts. I didn't understand this figure she is very controlling toward Patrick but gives him no warmth no confidence no answers. It seemed to me she didn't really care very much for him as long as he did his chores and wanted no sex with her. Kathy scared me almost as much as Ronnie.The end is just weird. Patrick is in love with Sarah they had wonderful sex which he craved for he knows she waits for him in a park at night in a neighborhood with not 1 but 2 dangerously deranged men he knows she has her little daughter with her. And he forgets her on his way to meet her. He's just fooling around then falls on his head. That's all. Now if this is not a bad screenplay I don't know.Then Ronnie's horrible mother  she seemed for me more than a sufficient reason to become as mad as he was  dies and he castrates himself. The movie tries to sell you this horrid scene as some kind of catharsis of self inflicted justice. This I found shocking. This guy is sick he belongs in an asylum or hospital not amputated. What's the idea ? Are all deranged people to blame ? Should they kindly punish themselves ? Probably the screenplay was written by people with completely other values than me. They probably can laugh at all the humiliating and scary situations in which they place Sarah but I wasn't able to laugh even once. If you have children and want to see a nightmare this movie is for you. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are both doing a great job a pity Wilson's role is so inconsistent and in the end plainly absurd. A star for each of them. Poor Jennifer Connelly her role is close to meaningless she seems to be there just so Patrick Wilson has someone to be afraid of.".

	schema:reviewBody "A release that I had looked forward to for almost a month after seeing the trailer in the theatre it had finally hatched in October. Tom Perrotta's satirical 2004 novel had been released and I was able to finish reading it before the film's impending release. The film stars Kate Winslet who along with Guy Pearce have both mastered the American accent in ennui Academy Awardwinning Jennifer Connelly who unfortunately does not have enough screen time and rising newcomer Patrick Wilson destined to become the next Josh Lucas. The other comeback and so many reviewers have mentioned him already is the return of former teen heartthrob Jackie Earle Haley Breaking Away The Bad News Bears as a parolee pedophile who is carefully insinuated in the film's climax. A redeeming endeavor on film involving such an unredeeming character. The film is about two married suburbanites who are stayathome parents that embark on an affair Winslet and Wilson while their spouses are bringing home the bacon. Winslet's husband is already a pathetic sap whose addicted to internet porn so it's not hard to empathize with Kate's endeavors although the right thing for her would to up and leave him but then that would be an entirely different movie. Wilson who is married to Connelly is different because despite of how slightly emasculating she is on her husband the woman is still likable. At the film's climax Kate tells Patrick that their sneaking around is weird and she wants closure which of course a lot of people in her position would want as well. Although in the book her character never asserted herself like that. I also found myself comparing the film to the novel which at times seemed overwritten. There were subtle changes that were made due to time budget and cinematic reasons but the best change was of the ending as opposed to the book's. The book's ending was so contrived and implausible Field did a superb job with coming up with something less anticlimatic and more shocking. This is one of those rarities in where you can honestly say that the film was better than the book. Another sequence that was excised from the movie that was in the book was the fact that Kathy had not only figured out that Brad was having an affair with Sarah but she acted as if they were competing athletes and that he received the gold medal and she just got the silver instead and that it wasn't fair to her. That too was implausible and I was relieved that that was gone. In the book Sarah Winslet was more needy and Kathy Connelly was producing a documentary about WWII vets rather than Desert Storm.My real complaint about this film aside from the underusage of Connelly was the narrative voiceover that would present itself throughout the picture. Although it was wellwritten taken verbatim from the novel at times it was slightly distracting. It seemed to offer a perspective of the character's innermost feelings at times but it also seemed as if the narrator was talking to the audience as if they were children and it seemed unnecessary. But that is probably the desired effect here with the narration the viewer almost feels as if they are watching a psychology film studying infidelity with that borderlinebaritone ominoussounding voice sequestering the characters and their actions from the audience. The narration did provide some comic relief for the audience though whereas Todd Field's first film In the Bedroom did not. Field probably learned from that and proved with a vengeance that he could make a better film. I would not be surprised to see this film on the ballot around Oscar season Kate Winslet truly deserves props for her performance especially at the end where her character breaks down you can sense the overall frustration that she has and her epiphany is spliced within her sobs. Jackie Earle Haley without any word said deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination but I know because of the lack of publicity and the limited number of theatres this film venued at there is little hope for a little film with little in its title that will really score big.".

Last seen directing 2001's excellent In The Bedroom Field delivers another remarkable drama with Little Children. He proves again his insight into real people and real relationships is a bit eerie and almost tough to watch as we often recognize ourselves in his characters.An incredibly well acted movie led by the usually mediocre Kate Winslet and an on the rise Patrick Wilson The Alamo Hard Candy and this year's Running With Scissors the cast creates an atmosphere of real life allowing us to forget the performances and concentrate on the multilayered story cowritten by Field and novelist Tom Berrotta. The genius in the film is in so many specific moments within the scenes. Jennifer Connelly as Wilson's wife and although still beautiful she is scary skinny at the dinner table when she realizes Winslet as she is putting her daughter on the floorboard of the car Wilson as he sneaks off the train and the mothers at the swimming pool when they realize a predator has pierced their inner sanctum. That predator is Jackie Earle Haley who is just outstanding in his brutally tough role. Haley was seen earlier this year in All The King's Men and hopefully is experiencing a real comeback. Although he will always be remembered as the talented center fielder in Bad News Bears he definitely has more to offer.Really good dramatic stories are so rare these days. Movie makers tend to be frightened of the tough decisions we all face every day and they fall back on proved formulas and feel good fluff. This movie is real and tough and will force you to analyze your life and perspective. What a marvelous thing to be able to say about a film.So yes I highly recommend the film but more importantly implore Mr. Field to not leave us hanging for another 5 years. Film lovers need you!!".

Winslett has problems with husband... exit husband. Guy is about to take bar exam but meets Winslett... exit bar exam. In fact about the only time he can stand up is playing football with a bunch of excops COPS!!! so ludicrously macho that The Village People couldn't have played them. On the way to elope guy decides to skateboard with some kids and literally falls off the plot... exit elopement. Which is just as well because Winslett seems to have been struck blind when a staggering pervert walks past her and she fails to notice the blood from his self castration. At this point she has to go in search of her child who has obviously read the rest of the script and decided to exit. Now its obvious the title is a reference to the emotional infantilism that has infected these people but they do not stand out in... Boston as depicted in the film. I was just waiting for the invasion of the legions of zombies but apparently the film is meant to be serious. If this film appears on a screen in front of you... exit immediately.".

I like lists so let's list some.!!!As always SPOILERS ahead!!!A black woman who's not even 40 calls herself an old woman during the deportation the deportation itself is a complete fraud pick out a cop and follow him around. It shows that their instructions were just run in that direction and act mean but for crying out loud don't hurt yourselves! the laptop reprogramming of the ED9something cops who don't know how to defend themselves when they've got guns and the punkers got sticks robocop who loses every fight he's in dream sequences on screen like a soap opera in the first movie they were just a readout of the brain activity. A lot more real Robocop obviously not weighting anymore then a normal man these days 2 of the rebels carry him and the japanese man responsible for the killing can just walk around among his victims never in danger. And do I even have to mention the flying he's doing?Add unmemorable villains and not one engaging action sequence and this movie has really nothing going for it. The decission to have no blood in the movie is almost funny when they have no trouble having a couple of suicides in the story. The story itself isn't that worth it then one might say? Let's just say it's impressive how they can make an almost epic theme reminding of the holocaust so incredible boring and unadmospheric. I certainly didn't care for any character that's for sure.At least Robocop 2 had action and humour going for it.210 hey it still is robocop".

	schema:reviewBody "Robocop 3 1993 was an unwanted sequel that helped killed a studio and sat on the shelf for over two years. Why was this movie made? Who knows it didn't make a dime and the film makers tried to make him kid friendly which killed the series in the process. The movie was so unwanted that Peter Weller didn't want to reprise his role of Officer Murphy for a third time. Whilst the second film was extremely dark and depressing the third installment swung wildly in the other direction. Two wrongs don't make a right. The director and writer Fred Dekkar should have known better. He made a couple of fun and watchable movies in the past. What ever made them click misfired on all cylinders in this boring and safe for the family sequel.Well this movie killed it's box office draw. Nobody wanted to see a kid friendly Robocop. The next time it appeared was on the small screen in two syndicated television programs. Neither raised a big stink and Robocop went back into mothballs. A shame really because Robocop was cool. Hell part two is a classic compared to this celluloid tripe. Recommended for diehard Robocop fans. Other need not apply except children who want to see Robocop in action.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin let me get this out in the open Robocop 3 is easily the worst movie of the trilogy.OK now the rest of the review.Though this is the worst movie of the series Robocop 3 manages to find a way to redeem itself be it intentionally or unintentionally by being incredibly cheesy and ultimately a load of fun! The film doesn't even really seem to be a direct continuation of the series though it does reference the first movie several times via flashbacks. The story is just about as dull as it could get and the acting leaves much to be desired. Not to mention the one saving grace this film could have had special effects does nothing to help save the movie from falling to BMovie status.I'm not sure why Peter Weller was not brought back for this one but I think he was wise to avoid it. Robocop has been reduced to cheesy oneliners and badly choreographed fight scenes. However I think this adds to the movie's charm. The film seems to take a very tongueincheek look into the world of Robo and this saves it from being a complete failure. Also it seems as if the writers or director were watching a lot of Japanese anime one of the main villains in the film is a ninja who is seemingly unstoppable many of his scenes are so stylized you'd swear you're watching an anime. Rip Torn also adds to the film's silliness as the head of the corrupt corporation OCP. He makes the main conflict in the film not even seem threatening due to the fact that he isn't menacing at all.Overall I'd say this film is more of a comedy than a scifi flick. It contains so many cheesy moments that it's best enjoyed with a small group of friends my close friend opined once This is what Mystery Science Theater 3000 was made for how right he was. If you are a fan of the series because of the grittiness and realism displayed in the first avoid this entry. However if you're looking for a good cheesy popcorn style scifi film by all means get some friends together and have fun! This film was made to be laughed at!".

	schema:headline " A TV Movie quality follow up that borders on ridiculous...just didn't go right";
	schema:reviewBody "Now I won't say that Robocop 3 is the mega disaster that a lot of reviewers call it. I mean Robocop 3 lost the benefit of being an eighties action film so granted the violence and foul language would be toned down because suddenly the political correctness of the 90's was in full swing. So that meant making Robocop more family friendly. They also lost Peter Weller from the lead which I didn't realize how great he was as Robocop until he wasn't him anymore. I have to wonder if screenplay writer Frank Miller was angry at the creators of Robocop so he spun this tale as a cruel prank because Miller is no slouch at writing he is a legendary comic writer 300 Sin City XMen etc. and the story for Robocop 3 borders on ridiculous. All of the dark gritty atmosphere is pretty much gone from the original film the tongue in cheek political humor is gone as well despite some off attempts to do exactly that. And it is true what reviewers have said that Robocop has suddenly become a complete weakling. He spends so much of the film repeatedly falling on his robo butt and trying to get back up. He's lost all of his cool factor all of his heavy hitting super hero instincts.Robert John Burke takes over the robo suit as Robocop and Alex Murphy. He just doesn't seem to have a handle on the character and doesn't give as much effort as Peter Weller did. Maybe it's because the first two films were so much better but Burke just isn't cut out for Robocop and spends most of his time trying to get back up on his feet. Rip Torn takes the helm away from The Old Man as head of OCP. Torn is a decent actor but he doesn't seem to have near the screen presence that Dan O'Herlihy had in the original films. They do mention The Old Man several times so to close his portion of the story. John Castle is one of the villains in the story as McDaggett yet another corrupt OCP Officer working to rid the city of Robocop. He's okay a little strung out and insane but decent enough. He doesn't hold a candle to previous villains in the series. Nancy Allen returns thankfully as Robocop's partner Lewis and the film does give her character something of closure so I give them kudos for that. Robert DoQui also returns for his third go around as Sergeant Reed and for the first time in the three films he really gets into the action which is terrific. Jill Hennessy joins the cast as Dr. Marie Lazarus who personally takes care of Robocop. Her performance is a little bland as she often is in her roles. It's a big cast with some decently memorable faces but I can't cover them all here.So here is why Robocop 3 is NOT the disastrously horrendous film that some make it out to be. First of all it ends the trilogy with a final big battle between OCP and the Detroit Police Department which essentially brings OCP down. It also brings back some of the familiar faces from the series and gives closure to the story on Lewis although her and Burke just don't have the chemistry that her and Weller had as partners. The story is decent enough and simple enough to follow but it just doesn't hold up to the previous two films. The entire aspect of Robocop flying is so ridiculous and they surely had to know that it was ridiculous. If it ain't broke don't fix it and they do fix the unbroken recipe which essentially ruins the series. It is true that Robocop 3 was a fall from grace and this film felt like the quality of a TV Movie which is maybe why all future Robocop installments hit Television. A rather bland disappointment. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't care what people say. I think this film is cool. It is flawed but it is still far cooler than RoboCop 2 or RoboCrap as I like to call it. The drama in this film makes it unique amongst its predecessors and it is much better than the likes of 'Batman Forever' another film unique in its own franchise. SPOILERSThe plot sees OCP going ahead with Delta City. They hire a mercenary group called 'Rehab' to 'escort' the people from their homes and into rehabilitation camps. The police hate this idea and once a stray bullet hits officer Ann Lewis RoboCop is seriously ped off. The plot is simple but it is superior in its simplicity. It is the campy oneliners and gags that let this film down on more than one occasion. Things like RoboCop commandeering a pimpmobile and Sergeant Reid having to deal with a drag queen prostitute are just a few of the things that had me fuming at the television screen. I'd say it is for this reason that a lot of people hate this film with such a passion. Another reason that this repelled Robofans was because it had very little political satire other than the fact that the main characters were trying to beat the system for the good of the people. There is very little 'MediaBreak Advertisement' sequences and even the ones that are shown have strong relevance to the story. This is probably because this film is aimed squarely at children so that more action figures can be sold. However I quite enjoyed the drama of the people rebelling against the corporate monster OCP for the rights to their own homes. I especially loved the part where even the Detroit Police Department thought that OCP had gone out of line throwing their badges at an OCP executive and leaving the building to go and help the civilians reclaim their homes. This is something you don't usually get in a superhero film if you want to call any of the RoboCop films 'superhero' films. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!It is pretty obvious that they gave RoboCop a removable gunflamethrower attachment it attached to his hand to sell action figures. The same applies with the jet pack seen at the end of the film. However I felt that they were incorporated into the film quite nicely and the flying scene however fake is pretty cool if you take it with a pinch of salt. Especially with Basil Poledouris' theme music booming in the background.END SPOILERS Overall RoboCop 3 does not deserve to be in the 'Bottom OneHundred Films' list. I believe it should be in 'The Best Sequels' list. If you enjoy RoboCop because he's a superhero and not because the films he appears in usually have strong political satire in them then this is the film for you. 610.".

Instead of a drug lord in cahoots with an OCP CEO or a drug cult in bed with local politicians like the first two we have a platoon of fascist security guards called the REHAB which make Homeland Security look like a Girl Scout Troop! They tear down people's houses while the residents are still living in them! They not only relocate the inhabitants but they execute them like criminals! Why execute them? I mean is there a cheap source of fuel in their fluids or something? What? This tells me that the plot is thinner than a teenage supermodel with anorexia! Next Robocop goes on patrol in this postapocalyptic Detroit with his partner Anne Lewis who eventually gets killed by REHABprobably looking for more homeless people to execute. Anyway Robo is framed for her murder. OCP has awarrant out to arrest Robocop. What? Yeah that's a laugh! Arrest something that's gonna' kick your ass if threatened! Isn't against his programming to kill another fellow officer? Since he's on the run and OCP is deep in the red they run crying to this Japanese corporation and send over this android ninja. Was it something new to anticipate? Yes! Was it something like the intense whiteknuckle action of Predator or the legendary scifi One Must Fall faceoff like in the Terminator movies? HELL NO!The fight sequences are dreadfully ridiculous at best as realistic as flying pigs and anal probes by alien invaders! I knew then it was for kids under 13! Spoiler The ninja confronts Robo in fight to the death and all this tin can could belt out is Your under arrest for destruction of police property! All while the ninja kicks his ass and takes off part of his arm. This movie is a goddamn joke and a half! The characters are twodimensional and more goofier than a hippie on whipits! REHAB recruits street punks that look more like rejects from an 80's metal video! Wait a minute! isn't this supposed to be Detroit! The same city that is predominately Black. Then why are there crazy white kids with Mohawks and piercings out the ass causing crime instead of kids with baggy pants and Uzis! Why the hell would the Nazis...I mean the REHAB hire thugs to do they dirty work for them when they should have the manpower themselves? Good God what have these bastards done with the Robocop franchise? They kiddieized it! What no killer cyborgs no David Koreshtype drug lords no social satire of American society? Come on this is ROBOCOP here man! Spoilers Ahead!The final battle of this bullt excuse for a movie has Robocop in a jetpack! A jetpack! The last words from the REHAB Fuhrer are Stupid fools! Does this sound like a common Robocop villain? I don't think so! The ending is so pathetic it almost made me gag. I said to myself this can't be Robocop 3...it can't be! Maybe it's a cheap imitation like they did with the Universal Soldier films. Alas it was the real deal. ARGGGGHHHH! Let's get one thing straight Robocop is not Dick Tracy or Superman!He is not a comic book kiddie hero who flies! He is an Rrated movie hero! Whoever directed this blasphemy to sciencefiction cinema should be sent to a Siberian gulag! Because he allowed some corporate dumbass with the mental capacity of a hyperactive 7 sevenyearold hooked on PixieStix and Jolt Cola to destroy a cult classic!They should have stopped at Robocop 2! Then waited for Verehoven to come back because when he left the magic left with him! This movie isn't worth the money to rent from Blockbuster! And you're an even biggerass fool if you're stupid enough to buy the DVD! Don't look at this travesty...you'll go blind!".

I mean is there a cheap source of fuel in their fluids or something? What? This tells me that the plot is thinner than a teenage supermodel with anorexia! Next Robocop goes on patrol in this postapocalyptic Detroit with his partner Anne Lewis who eventually gets killed by REHABprobably looking for more homeless people to execute. Anyway Robo is framed for her murder. OCP has awarrant out to arrest Robocop. What? Yeah that's a laugh! Arrest something that's gonna' kick your ass if threatened! Isn't against his programming to kill another fellow officer? Since he's on the run and OCP is deep in the red they run crying to this Japanese corporation and send over this android ninja. Was it something new to anticipate? Yes! Was it something like the intense whiteknuckle action of Predator or the legendary scifi One Must Fall faceoff like in the Terminator movies? HELL NO!The fight sequences are dreadfully ridiculous at best as realistic as flying pigs and anal probes by alien invaders! I knew then it was for kids under 13! Spoiler The ninja confronts Robo in fight to the death and all this tin can could belt out is Your under arrest for destruction of police property! All while the ninja kicks his ass and takes off part of his arm. This movie is a goddamn joke and a half! The characters are twodimensional and more goofier than a hippie on whipits! REHAB recruits street punks that look more like rejects from an 80's metal video! Wait a minute! isn't this supposed to be Detroit! The same city that is predominately Black. Then why are there crazy white kids with Mohawks and piercings out the ass causing crime instead of kids with baggy pants and Uzis! Why the hell would the Nazis...I mean the REHAB hire thugs to do they dirty work for them when they should have the manpower themselves? Good God what have these bastards done with the Robocop franchise? They kiddieized it! What no killer cyborgs no David Koreshtype drug lords no social satire of American society? Come on this is ROBOCOP here man! Spoilers Ahead!The final battle of this bullt excuse for a movie has Robocop in a jetpack! A jetpack! The last words from the REHAB Fuhrer are Stupid fools! Does this sound like a common Robocop villain? I don't think so! The ending is so pathetic it almost made me gag. I said to myself this can't be Robocop 3...it can't be! Maybe it's a cheap imitation like they did with the Universal Soldier films. Alas it was the real deal. ARGGGGHHHH! Let's get one thing straight Robocop is not Dick Tracy or Superman!He is not a comic book kiddie hero who flies! He is an Rrated movie hero! Whoever directed this blasphemy to sciencefiction cinema should be sent to a Siberian gulag! Because he allowed some corporate dumbass with the mental capacity of a hyperactive 7 sevenyearold hooked on PixieStix and Jolt Cola to destroy a cult classic!They should have stopped at Robocop 2! Then waited for Verehoven to come back because when he left the magic left with him! This movie isn't worth the money to rent from Blockbuster! And you're an even biggerass fool if you're stupid enough to buy the DVD! Don't look at this travesty...you'll go blind!";

This movie has so much problems I can't even begin to count.The first RoboCop was a classic best action rated HardR film the second one was amazing underrated science fiction action film that stays true to the original film. This movie is abomination. A young girl reprograms ED209 so that he stays a loyal as a puppy! I don't want to see a droid been loyal as a puppy that is horrible wooden and awful lame stinker of a movie.You have two samurais and RoboCop get's his ass kicked by one of the samurais and he doesn't do anything. A little girl safes RoboCop from 2 samurai cyborgs so that they destroy each other with their swords. Awful.There is no Peter Weller in this movie I am glad that he pass this movie to do other projects. Nancy Allen returns she is hot in this movie but by the first hour she is killed off! Why? What happened why did Nancy Allen insist to be in this movie only to get her character killed off? So that she could get a paycheck? What is wrong with her.What happened? Why did Frank Miller and Fred Dekker made such a terrible script? The screenplay is terrible the dialogues in here are terrible not memorable and pretty dull. Was it because ORION had a finical problems and in a desperate attempt they try to make a family action PG13 movie to get more audiences? sadly this movie failed! Peter Weller Dan O'Herlihy and Belinda Bauer did not return the movie it self doesn't have an adrenaline or rush excitement or anything. This movie sucks ass. Robert John Burke makes terrible type of RoboCop he is awful and another STINKER cop again.His suit is awful I hate that RoboCop has a Gun Arm and he replaces his awesome gun from the first two movies with a machine gun on his left arm wow stupid. Why RoboCop has a prototype flightpack and he flies after he was ass kicked by a samurai. Gosh the effects for this movie were horrible and really poor.This movie is poor and really a shame it could have been a good movie but it turned in to a lack of pile of sht. I hate this movie I hate it why couldn't have been a good movie why?Fred Dekker really make a terrible horrible direction and I don't really like it a lot. This time they used music from Basil Poledouris in which audience complained about the music in the second movie but even the music score does not help and make this movie unique like the first one was it doesn't. This Robocop in here is awful and this movie stinks Frank Miller you make a lousy sequel that no one wants.I do have this movie on Bluray disc and I am not going to broke it or throw it away like mostly people do I am going to keep it in my collection but I am not going to watch it anymore because I HATE this movie to death!I am giving this movie F 110 doesn't deserve to be called RoboCop 3 by the way the acting from everyone is wooden and terrible in here and RoboCrap is a wooden bitch in here. This and RoboCock 2014 are both stinkers and they both suck a dick. They both can kiss my ass!".

He looses his faithful partner to the evil corporation and tries to save the homeless while trying to stay together for the evil robocops that Japan has sent over. Can Robocop defeat OCP once again? And by the way you'd think after all the evil talk from the first and second Robocop movies OCP would have gone out of business by now.Robocop 3 is very over the top again like the line stated in the movie Just follow the explosions to see where Robocop was. But I think there must be someone out there who is absolutely in love with this movie or the trilogy itself as for me?

The plot carries on the established Robocop saga in a far better way than it predecessor did so and I think it's about time a little light was shone on this fact. Mc Daggett is a strong and believable villain and Robert Burke did an excellent job in replacing Weller. The plot is extremely well structured and paced and tells a genuinely interesting story of corporate greed stampeding over peoples rights. Now I'm not saying Robocop 3 had any big social message but the rebels were entirely believable Robocop's side switching was handled very well and the whole story just gelled naturally. It wasn't exempt from problems of course. Niko was maybe a bit to much for most Robocop fans to accept the SFX and action scenes were well wanting of a couple more mill being spent on them and the end fight between Robo and the Otomos just flat out sucked. However what should matter to most people is the story and acting. On both of these levels Robocop 3 scores and I genuinely wish people could see past the number 3 at the end of the title and give this film more of a chance.

	schema:reviewBody "Robocop is a classic science fiction movie that didn't had too much luck with the sequels. Robocop 2 was a flawed  but decent sequel that was almost universally hated by the audiences and the critics. Too bad  because it stayed true to the original. It didn't had the freshness  depth or heart of the first one  yet the violent action and dark satire was still there. The franchise still had potential and I believe that with some effort there was still a chance for interesting next installments. Unfortunately the Orion studio had financial problems . They decided to make Robocop 3 as a family friendly action movie rated PG13 in desperate attempt to gain as wide audience as it is possible. Robocop 3 was filmed in 1991 but was not released until end of 1993 due to production company Orion going bankrupt. The result ? A movie that is one of the worst movies EVER and a final nail to the franchise coffin.Making a Robocop 3 movie with PG13 rating makes just as much sense as making a porn movie with no sex at all  maybe with some brief nudity here and there. ITS TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT of the original movie ! It has no heart no brains sly social commentary and no hard violence. Robocop 3 became the very thing that first two movies were often laughing at  a politically correct hero in a gutless  soulless and brainless Hollywood movie.To be honest a PG13 Robocop 3 movie COULD work. The story has some potential and you can make a exciting and deep PG13 action movie The Dark knight. Unfortunately the whole movie seems to be aimed at kids and has a cartoon approach to it that just doesn't works. I'm amazed that this even is rated PG13  not PG.Peter Weller made a wise decision not returning to the role of Robo and choosing Naked lunch to do instead. I recommend to watch that movie instead of Robocop 3 . It may not be for everyone  but at least it's entertaining. Orion tried to hire Michael Dudikoff American ninja  but ended with Robert Burke . I can't say anything else about him except that he was in this movie. And that for some reason the studio modified his voice so it sounds annoying. Dan O'Herlihy the old man from the first two films does not appear in this film. The rest of the regular cast is back  unfortunately they don't have too much to do.Robocop here is basically a zombie with no personality. He also disappears for a large part of the movie. The regular cast has very little screen time and awful dialogue to work with. The new characters are annoying  especially Nico  kid genius hacker. The main villain is not one bit interesting or menacing. The acting here is awful with people either underplaying or overplaying their parts.The story here takes some elements from what comic book writer Frank Miller prepared for Robocop 2 . Mind that both Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 were heavily rewritten and have only few elements from Miller's original script. The story here could work. Unfortunately the screenplay is filled with cheap humor  predictability and stupidity. I found a site on internet which points out that Robocop 3 has faults in every scene ! The direction by Fred Dekker is apathetic. The pacing is lackluster. The action scenes are pathetic. The special effects are embarrassing  especially when you consider that Jurassic Park was in theaters that same year.This movie deserves every bad comment it gets. There are no redeeming qualities to this junk. After this movie there were two lame TV shows and cartoon. The franchise was slaughtered. I give it 110.".

	onyx:emotionText "Robocop is a classic science fiction movie that didn't had too much luck with the sequels. Robocop 2 was a flawed  but decent sequel that was almost universally hated by the audiences and the critics. Too bad  because it stayed true to the original. It didn't had the freshness  depth or heart of the first one  yet the violent action and dark satire was still there. The franchise still had potential and I believe that with some effort there was still a chance for interesting next installments. Unfortunately the Orion studio had financial problems .

	schema:headline " RoboCop 3 The franchise killer!";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems that every movie franchise has one a movie so bad that it kills the series. RoboCop 3 sadly is no exception. OCP has begun to move forward in their master plan to create a better Detroit this plan is known as Delta City. Unfortunately for the citizens of Detroit this means destroying their homes. There is strong opposition to this so OCP deploys armed mercenaries known as Rehabs. Their job is remove people from their homes by force. One of these people is a computer whiz kid named Nikko. After her parents are arrested by the rehabs she is found and taken in by the leader of the resistance movement. Meanwhile it is revealed that OCP has been bought out by a Japanese corporation. This comes into play later So a short time later RoboCop and Lewis track Nikko down at an old church. Unfortunately so have the rehabs and their leader McDaggett. He and the rest of the rehabs have orders to kill all the people in the church but RoboCop and Lewis refuse to stand down. RoboCop can't fire on the rehabs because of Directive 4 I'll explain what this is later. McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs open fire on them and thus Officer Anne Lewis is killed. I'm sure many of you can guess why this infuriates me on multiple levels! Not only does RoboCop do absolutely NOTHING to save the life of his friend and partner but the biggest problem is that her death has zero meaning or purpose! This is one of my favorite things to complain about in a bad movie or sequel. If you're going to have a main character die IT MUST HAVE A PURPOSE!!! For example in Star Trek II Spock dies to save the lives of The Enterprise's crew. In Aliens Gorman dies to atone for his mistake. In Cruel Intentions Sebastian dies to save the woman he loves. In RoboCop 3 however Lewis dies only to get her out of the film and to add a cheap revenge motive for RoboCop to get the bad guy. So...anyway RoboCop takes a bazooka to the chest McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs leave him for dead He joins the resistance and decides to fight for their cause the Japanese corporation dispatches a robot samurai to deal with RoboCop and the resistance the cops all quit when they're forced to work with the rehabs RoboCop takes out McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs and of course saves the day. Now let me explain what that Directive Four crap was and why it makes no sense here. In the original film Directive four was a failsafe put in by OCP's corrupt vice president. Which meant that RoboCop could not apprehend or act against any member of OCP. Here's why it makes no sense First of all you would think that after the events of the first film that RoboCop's designers would've taken that out so something like that wouldn't happen again. Second after being left for dead by the rehabs RoboCop simply deletes the directive. If he could do that at any time why didn't he just do that earlier and why couldn't he do that in one of the previous films? To sum it all up RoboCop 3 pretty much sucks all around. The climax was halfway decent but the rest just sucked. The lead actor doesn't even come remotely close to filling Peter Weller's shoes the humor isn't funny Anne Lewis dies for no reason the main villain isn't even the least bit threatening and 90 of the time RoboCop is always getting his a kicked! I don't blame Frank Miller for the movie being bad everyone knows that the studio determines how a movie is made and how it will turn out. In fact If you're a fan of RoboCop and want to see What could've been. I recommend you pick up one of Frank Miller's RoboCop graphic novels. I've read one of them myself and it was excellent! You'll get much more entertainment from reading one of them than you'll get out of this cinematic pile of crap! Like most poorly done sequels RoboCop 3 could've been great but all it turned out to be was a lastditch effort to squeeze out more money for the studio. If you haven't seen it skip it. If you have do yourself a favor and pretend it never existed!".

The Old Man from the previous two films is gone either died or resigned after the events of Robocop 2 the movie doesn't say and is replaced by the CEO Rip Torn. The Delta City Project inaugurated in the previous film is falling behind schedule and OCP incurs in debt leading to its takeover by the Japanese corp. of Kanemitsu.

A band of freedom fighters spring up Robocop and Anne Lewis track them down after seeing a little girl joining them in an abandoned church. Unbeknowst to them the Rehabs have tracked them down and orders them to leave the building to them. Robocop and Anne Lewis refuse but when Anne gets seriously injured and dies a few minutes later he quits the force and joins the rebellion while undergoing structural repairs in his programme.Robocop 2 may have shocked some viewers for its excessive violence but it is better than this one. The storyline is more coherent than the last film in the sense that all main ideas make it to the end but it's too simplistic. While Part 2 was ultraviolent and gloomy this one went into the opposite direction. Sure the absence of the first two films' graphic violence would make it more appealing for kids but this movie just has little to make up for it it starts off very promising but it gets sillier as the it progresses culminating in a ridiculous fight between Robocop and the Samurai which is a far cry from the excellent finale between Robocop and Robocain in the the second movie giving the impression that the filmmakers have run out of money by that point.However Robocop 3 still has some worthwhile moments to spare it from becoming a candidate for MST3K. Most of the action sequences save the aforementioned fight are wellstaged and creative and the film has some creative use of CGI. Robocop's new gadgets the jetpack and his cannon are worthy additions and our hero still knows how to make an entrance diving from the highest level of a parking lot and dropping down 10 storeys below.Peter Weller however did not reprise the role most likely because he has grown tired of having to walk into that baggy costume for hours and hours on end and sweating buckets in the process and he's replaced by Robert John Burke. Burke is a worthy successor to Weller mimicking his movements down to the smallest details but it just doesn't feel the same without him.Bottom line Robocop 3 is the worst of the series but it's not as terrible as some people tend to exaggerate.Trivia the beautiful Jill Hennessy appears here as Robocop's leading programmer just before becoming famous as Kincaid in Law and Order and later in Crossing Jordan.".

When it came to this film I wasn't sure what to expect. Peter Weller had moved on and Robert Burke had taken over as the ironclad police officer. According to the majority of viewers RoboCop 3 was garbage. Turns out though I liked it. Maybe not as much as the first for various reasons but at least this movie carried forward with the story of Alex Murphy. Unlike the first sequel that drove us in circles.RoboCop is back one more time to save the city of old Detroit. But this time it is on a much bigger scale. It is not mentioned to how the old man of OCP disappeared but it's assumed that he finally died. Now in charge of OCP is the CEO played by actor Rip Torn and it's up to him to make sure a place called Cadillac Heights is ready for deconstruction within a certain date. So to remove the people from this area requires a group of officers called The Rehabs. But as the audience will discover early in the intro that these officials aren't very helpful nor do they care.The head of the rehabs is Paul McDaggett played by John Castle. John Castle is good as a selfless official but that's all he is. He's not a Boddicker and not a Cain. Burke as RoboCop isn't a bad fit either. Yes it would have been better to still have Weller in the suit but hey you do with what you have. And yes Burke makes Robo sound funny but it's really not that annoying. As long as the voice isn't high or super low pitched it shouldn't be that big a deal. Even when Robo's helmet is off the makeup department did a swell job having him look like he did in the last 2 films.Costarring Burke are some of the last remaining characters from the cast of the first film. Felton Perry is still playing Johnson only this time he seems like he's having a hard time picking sides. He's been apart of OCP for a long time but soon realizes how corrupt the company has become along with its massive dept. Of course I don't understand how he didn't see that with half his fellow coworkers biting bullets and attempting to fly out windows. Nancy Allen is still around as Anne Lewis Murphy's first and only partner. Even sergeant Reed Robert DoQui from the last 2 films is still there. He too realizes the corruption of OCP and decides to take a stand. It's nice to see OCP finally lose its foundation.One thing in particular I did not find enjoyable is the lack of bloodshed during this film. The director of this sequel is Fred Dekker and it surprised me that he allowed this film to be rated PG13. Why Dekker? You made Night of the Creeps 1986 and that was rated R? I mean at least you still could have had the screenplay release some four letter words to get it an R rating. And it's not productive to make a sequel and have its rating changed from all the others that came before it. I understand that the reason is to have a broader audience of ages but how does it help when the kids don't even know who RoboCop is or what his background was? It's a plan of failure and Dekker should have seen that.Not to mention that RoboCop has a machine gun that he can now attach to his body. God that would have been cool to see if this film was rated R! Plus he can fly now too. Yeah big deal to some of you skeptics but it really is a nice addition. Basil Poledouris is back as well to do the his noted music again for this franchise. So that's a plus. And the best part is by the end of this film Alex Murphy at least finds a group of people who don't treat him like an investment but more like a human. Isn't that what we wanted from the past two films? I did.Having the last installment being rated PG13 was a wrong move but it can be seen that Dekker's team tried hard to bring back the other elements that made the first film a hit. And for most it should please its fans for at least making that attempt.".

The first movie is great and having seen it again recently still holds up well and even the sequel is not as bad as I once thought it was but this however is tripe.

His employer gives him a last chance to keep his job and he is assigned to travel to the remote village of Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel Marsh House that belonged to the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow. Arthur befriends Daily on the train and the man offers a ride to him to the Gifford Arms inn. Arthur has a cold reception and the owner of the inn tells that he did not receive the request of reservation and there is no available room. The next morning Arthur meets solicitor Jerome who advises him to return to London. However Arthur goes to the isolated manor and soon he finds that Eel Marsh House is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a woman dressed in black. He also learns that the woman lost her son drowned in the marsh and she seeks revenge taking the children of the scared locals.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Woman in Black is directed by James Watkins and adapted to screenplay by Jane Goldman from Susan Hill's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Radcliffe Ciarn Hinds and Janet McTeer. Music is scored by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Tim MauriceJones. Plot has Radcliffe as young London solicitor Arthur Kipps who is sent to the North East village of Crythin Gifford to clear up the affairs of deceased woman Mrs. Drablow. When he arrives he finds that the memory of Drablow and her remote house of Eel Marsh holds the village in a grip of fear particularly those who have children.....It's fitting that that bastion of British horror Hammer Studios should be behind this delightful period ghost story. For this positively oozes old fashioned values harking back to all those wonderful spookers set around a creepy village that featured an even creepier castle or mansion at its core. More presently the film has kindred links to the likes of The Orphanage The Others and The Changeling while the vengeful spirit acting out of Eel Marsh House is pumped by JHorror like blood and Darkness Falls' Wraith bitch nastiness. So clearly The Woman in Black is not a fresh arrival to the horror splinter where the ghost story resides. However great period ghost story films are in short supply and Watkins' film most assuredly is a great entry in the subgenre.Propelling it forward is Watkins' Eden Lake excellent sense of mood and crafting of palpable unease. Quite often the better ghost story films are better because they operate on a what you don't see is what scares you more level Watkins has managed to keep that aspect of his film whilst also giving us enough of the truly terrifying spirit to jolt us in our seats often showing her to us and not to Radcliffe's Kipps! When the shocks come and there are many and they are bona fide underwear soiling they act as merciful releases from the built up dread but then when Watkins doesn't deliver a shock we are left waiting uneasily darting our eyes all over the expansive frame searching fruitlessly for a glimpse of something troubling. Did that wind up toy move? Is that a pallid face we just glimpsed in the shadows? That damn rocking chair is the scariest there has ever been! And on it goes....A film such as this is only as good as the production design and setting for the story. Thankfully Watkins and his team have nailed it there as well. Eel Marsh House exteriors are Cotterstock Hall in Northamptionshire perfectly foreboding while the beautiful village of Halton Gill in the Yorkshire Dales gets a Hammer Horror make over to become Crythin Gifford. But it's with the interior of the house where the makers excel an utterly unforgiving and upsetting place brilliantly under lit by Tim MauriceJones for maximum scary effect.On the acting front the film rests solely on the shoulders of Radcliffe and he comes up trumps. Initially its awkward accepting him as the father of a young boy and once he gets to Crythin Gifford he is dwarfed by all the other adults who live there but once the Victorian setting envelopes him the awkwardness evaporates and the characterisation becomes more realistic and easy to sympathise with. The character is changed from the book meaning Radcliffe has to carry inner torment as well as exuding an outer coat of trepidation blended with stoic fear. It should be noted that for much of the picture he is acting on his own reacting to the house and the overgrown gardens and marshes in short he is terrific and it augers well for his adult acting career. In support Hinds and McTeer are pillars of professionalism with McTeer's Mrs. Daily a creepy character in her own right but it's also another neat meditation on grief that sits alongside Arthur Kipps'.The ending is also changed from that in the novel and it's already proving to be divisive. How you react to it and it is up for a twofold interpretation may dampen your overall enjoyment of the picture? Personally I have no issue with it I was still sunk in the cinema chair breathing heavily at that point! The certification and the presence of Radcliffe ensures that a teenage audience will flock to see it many of whom will not get the horror film that they are after. Hopefully the word will get out that this really is only a film for those who love a good boo jump ghost story of old that's its target audience and that's the people whose reviews you should trust. 910".

Yes it contains ghost film elements we have all seen before but they are cleverly and patiently arranged so that the viewer becomes totally enveloped in atmospheric dread. Sure there are jump scares but these are also complimented by many shots which unfold slowly and effectively. It sometimes reminded me of the 1961 film The Innocents if that gives you a better idea. Radcliffe is also a worthy focal point of the film keeping most of the fear and anticipation unspoken throughout.I would not nominate this film for any kind of award but it achieves what I believe should be the ultimate goal of all horror movies to draw us in so close that when our fear manifests itself onscreen it is already too late to turn away.

Over all this film was wonderful and I would recommend it. And I must say Dan Radcillffe did a great job. He may not be the most incredible actor but he has really improved so much. It's most evident here because he could not hide behind words or a wand he could use just his face and body language. They are an actor's tool after all. To be able to carry a film with body language is something to be commended. Few actors can.On another note I adored the fact they never hid the Woman in Black. They embraced her from the beginning with little traces of a face in the windows as they were passed. The simplicity of the film was what I think made it so terrifying. There weren't blood and guts flying around with a poor sap strapped to an operating table while a deranged lunatic tries to connect him to the anus of another. It was a simple yet effectively frightening ghost story. I can say I loved every second of it.If you love horror films give it a go.

	schema:reviewBody "30 years and several retools on from Susan Hill's now seminal pocket novel comes the big screen adaptation of The Woman in Black. Swapping the lingering lifespanning impact of Hill's Dickensian book of the dead for a hollow yet effective houseofhorrors yarn that'll have you stirring in your seat and out of it.The film's setup is more or less identical to the book but with a few baffling tweaks Arthur Kipps Daniel Radcliffe is a solicitor and widowed father of one who's summoned to a remote town and manor on an eerie northern marshland where he's to settle the estate and will of a recently deceased old hag. Somethings wrong with the place though. An ominous figure stalks and taunts and haunts the townspeople. A child falls whenever it is seen a woman in black.If there's one thing horror movies have taught us it's that ghostly old dears and kids are a recipe for new underwear. And what do you know The Woman in Black has them both in droves. All of which reside in a haunted Victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere. The film charts Kipps' probe into the strange happenings from inside the damned estate in this simplistic yet effectual horror gem that's as playful and frightening as it is enjoyable.As a standalone picture director James Eden Lake Watkins' Woman in Black is as sound a horror of this ilk and purpose come the hauntedhouse caper has been done to death then done again over the course of cinema's history. The Woman in Black is the best of its kind for quite some time. When measured against the book though it comes up short. Despite remaining faithful to its source through large parts and absolutely nailing the location Jane Goldman's screenplay omits certain key scenes as well as the haunting bookends that made Hill's novel one the finest ghost stories of all time.

	onyx:emotionText "30 years and several retools on from Susan Hill's now seminal pocket novel comes the big screen adaptation of The Woman in Black. Swapping the lingering lifespanning impact of Hill's Dickensian book of the dead for a hollow yet effective houseofhorrors yarn that'll have you stirring in your seat and out of it.The film's setup is more or less identical to the book but with a few baffling tweaks Arthur Kipps Daniel Radcliffe is a solicitor and widowed father of one who's summoned to a remote town and manor on an eerie northern marshland where he's to settle the estate and will of a recently deceased old hag. Somethings wrong with the place though. An ominous figure stalks and taunts and haunts the townspeople. A child falls whenever it is seen a woman in black.If there's one thing horror movies have taught us it's that ghostly old dears and kids are a recipe for new underwear. And what do you know The Woman in Black has them both in droves. All of which reside in a haunted Victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere. The film charts Kipps' probe into the strange happenings from inside the damned estate in this simplistic yet effectual horror gem that's as playful and frightening as it is enjoyable.As a standalone picture director James Eden Lake Watkins' Woman in Black is as sound a horror of this ilk and purpose come the hauntedhouse caper has been done to death then done again over the course of cinema's history. The Woman in Black is the best of its kind for quite some time. When measured against the book though it comes up short. Despite remaining faithful to its source through large parts and absolutely nailing the location Jane Goldman's screenplay omits certain key scenes as well as the haunting bookends that made Hill's novel one the finest ghost stories of all time. Fans of the book will find it hard to fathom why these decisions were made. Maybe Goldman and Watkins wanted to stamp their own uplifting mark on the tale. Shades of Kubrick's Shining? Not quite. I won't reveal what transpires in Hill's novel but if the film had followed suite it would've had greater substance and longevity.Grafting Harry Potter onto its setup ensured Watkins' film spun a profit before it hit a single screen.

	schema:headline " Positive evocation of Dracula and other period Hammer films";
	schema:reviewBody "Creepy and offputting The Woman in Black really is a terrific thriller. It's intended to shock and in many scenes it is successful. It's a moody psychologically scarring throwback to the old Roger Corman movies based on Edgar Allan Poe stories with an amazing adult performance by Daniel Radcliffe as a young lawyer out of his depth. Arthur Kipps Radcliffe a downonhisluck attorney is asked to travel to a remote village and find out if a recently deceased woman has left any heretofore unknown wills. It's Kipps' last shot at success his employer sternly warns him. His journey to the village is eerily similar to that undertaken by Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Something's not quite right with the town which clearly doesn't want him around something to do with children being murdered and people blaming a dead woman. You know how it is.Kipps' sleuthing leads to more and more questions. Who was the woman ostensibly his client really? What relationship did she have with the town? And what of those treacherous marshes and that long and winding road to the main house that is impassable when the tide is in? Why is it that every time Kipps turns around a shadow darts away? Understanding that these are all staples of the great horror movies of yore doesn't mean that this film is stealing it is merely authentically replicating the desolate atmosphere in which a whisper can signal death.I entered the theater knowing very little of the movie's content. Was it to be a mystery and we'd find out who the titular woman was at some point? It is and we do but that is only part of the puzzle. The best horror movies in my opinion are the ones that build just the right amount of suspense and then pull the rug out from under the viewer. A slow buildup must have a satisfying payoff. Showing the evil the lurks in every other scene dilutes the fright quotient. This movie doesn't do that. It pulls no punches to our psyche. It is so closely shot by Tim MauriceJones who's best known for his work with Guy Ritchie. MauriceJones' style here is to capture almost every shot from Kipps' perspective thus bringing the audience that much closer to the terror he's supposed to be feeling. Radcliffe to his credit never comes off as some innocent lad who's just starting out in the business and although Kipps is perplexed  much like Edward Woodward's character in The Wicker Man  he is determined to see things through even though he has strayed a bit from his original mission. Something is definitely wrong here and it involves the children. Are they to blame for the nefarious goingson? Are their parents? No one is saying anything. To make matters worse for Kipps he has a young son of his own whose mother died in childbirth and who is coming to visit Kipps in a few days. The grief felt by the parents of the fallen children only heightens Kipps' own fears. There are several moments that on the Internet would be called shock videos. Everything seems normal and then BAM something pops out of nowhere. In lesser movies this might be seen as a crutch a way to stun your senses to get a particular reaction but here it all fits in and it conveys mortal terror. The Woman in Black's identity is revealed very early in the film so the mystery isn't who she is but why these events keep occurring. Is it all superstition or is there something more to the spiritual aspect of the plot?The ending is tidy and satisfying but it is by no means conventional or predictable. In fact it opens up even more questions. But more importantly director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman based on a book by Susan Hill do not take the easy way out. People do not necessarily live happily ever after. Story threads are not necessarily sewn up tight. It is a riveting film steeped in a macabre atmosphere teeming with the potential of death with every slow approach to a corner or a locked door.".

Anyways back to my own theories nowwhen Kipps stays at the house overnight. he had access to a tonne of documentary evidence that could have been used to expand on why jennet's sister took her kid away and why she wouldn't let her see him.I'm guessing most probably because jennet was already mentally unsound before the child was born and the child was born out of wedlock because the father did not want to marry a crazy chick or the affair was broken off before the wedding causing her to lose her mind. the father's surname is on the birth certificate. at the house Kipps finds a picture of the Drablows where jennet is seen in one of the windows which would suggest that she lived with them. also she hangs herself in the nursery at the same house which cements the fact that she was living there when the child was alive. so why does she send Alice letters instead of saying things to her face? since she was already living there jennet might have had access to the child though she may not have been allowed to have him call her mom or to even get to meet the child often enough which might have strained her unsound mind even more. now they never really showed how Nathaniel was left to sink into the marsh when everyone else survived. a boy of 7 is definitely agile enough to be able to jump over the back end of a coach or to hang onto his mother's enormous dress to avoid drowning. and his body is found right in the middle of the carriage too which would suggest that he was probably incapacitated or sedatedreally ill and was already on the floor of the carriage and not moving when the carriage was sinking. since he wasn't accepting jennet as his mother perhaps she drugged himmade him ill before this mishap occurred and since his body was never recovered they couldn't confirm a poisoning or grave previous injury. or maybe jennet tricked him into eating something poisonous or jump off a floor or some other way tried to make him kill himself and Alice and her husband were just rushing him to a doctor when the carriage fell into the marsh. this would explain why jennet hates kids and has them kill themselves. she did it to her own kid too. and the guilt and the insanity made her blame her sister and commit suicide.and the reason why she hates her sister is not because Alice doesn't let her see the child or give him her cards it's because she is jealous of her and wants a husband child house the whole shindig which her poor mental health and premarital affair and having a child out of wedlock made impossible.jennet kills kids to exact revenge on happy families because she couldn't have one herself. and the reason why she keeps the souls of the kids with her is because none of them accept her as their mother the daily's kid keeps visiting his motherhowever in the end the joke's on jennet as Joseph's soul is saved by the soul of his father and the family is reunited in death. in the end she shows her face and that of the other dead kids to Sam so he too becomes a believer and possibly starts to take his wife's claims that their dead son contacts her more seriously.in the sequel I'm guessing jennet and the kids haunt soldiers and they adults die which means that her curse kids will die was broken off by Kipps.".

I recommend it to anyone that enjoys real horror movies such as the movies with Oliver Reed. The location this movie was filmed is spectacular and the ending is unbelievable. This is definitely a movie that has people jumping in their seats. It is not overdone and each of the actorsactresses do a fine job. This is filmed on location at Layer Marney Tower in Essex England. The film was planned to be shot in 3D but that plan was later scrapped. I am happy that it was scrapped because this film does not need that kind of theatrics. It's well written with a great plot and excellent acting.".

	schema:headline " A Good Ghost Story Developed at a Slow Pace and Beginning Similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula";
	schema:reviewBody "In London the lawyer Arthur Kipps Daniel Radcliffe still grieves the death of his beloved wife Stela Sophie Stuckey on the delivery of their son Joseph Misha Handley four years ago. His employer gives a last chance to him to keep his job and he is assigned to travel to the remote village Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel Marsh House that belonged to the decently deceased Mrs. Drablow Alisa Khazanova. Arthur befriends Daily Ciarn Hinds in the train and the man offers a ride to him to the Gifford Arms inn. Arthur has a cold reception and the owner of the inn tells that he did not receive the request of reservation and there is no available room. On the next morning Arthur meets the solicitor Jerome that advises him to return to London. However Arthur goes to the isolated manor and soon he finds that the Eel Marsh House is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a woman dressed in black. He also learns that the woman lost her son drowned in the mush and she seeks revenge taking the children of the scared locals. The Woman in Black is a dramatic horror film by Hammer with a good ghost story developed at a slow pace. The beginning is very similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula when the young lawyer Jonathan Harker is sent to a remote village to a real estate business and has a cold reception by the villagers. The vampire is replaced by the evil ghost of a woman in black that takes the children from the dwellers. The conclusion is a little disappointing but the film certainly makes the viewer startle many times along 95 minutes running time. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Mulher de Preto The Woman in Black".

I went in expecting it would be more thriller like like Sleepy Hollow of Depp and Radcliffe will not able to throw off the shadow of Harry Potter and when I saw him I thought of Potter and if this would somehow be a continuation of the same character acting but I was quite wrong. Its a really good horror movie of the oldfashioned kind i.e. all good suspense no effects and nonsense. Radcliffe has done an amazing job and he has been successful is losing Potter ! If you are in the mood of a true oldstyle spooky thrills and chills kind of movie which builds on pure suspense and the protagonist's acting then this is it. Its really gripping and creepy !".

	schema:reviewBody "As a kid growing up in the UK the Independent TV sector was split into regions with HTV being the regional channel where I lived. Each region had a good deal of control over their own programming and Monday nights were always film nights in the HTV region. As these were relatively late night showings around 1030pm these films were almost always horror films which meant either classic Universal American International Pictures or of course Hammer Horrors. It was the Hammer films that I enjoyed most  Christopher Lee Peter Cushing Ingrid Pitt etc etc so it was sad to see the studio go into such decline. But now with this wonderfully atmospheric haunted house story plus the remake of Let The Right One In and one other whose title has escaped me for the moment the studio  or at least the company that has taken over the legendary name  is back to doing what it does best scaring the life out of film goers the world over!! This film has all the hallmarks of a classic Hammer film the old village full of unwelcoming locals the local pub with an even more unwelcoming feel We're packed to the rafters all week  even if Kipps is the only guest to be seen! the bleak landscape and of course the wonderful old house usually on top a hill but in this case on an island that gets cutoff from the mainland by the incoming tide twice a day.Into this arrives the aforementioned Kipps Daniel Radcliffe in his first big post Harry Potter role looking into the estate of the late owner of the old house. As he looks into the papers etc he finds more than he bargained for and then the fun really begins as the ghost of the title character starts to weave her evil presence over the proceedings.As the mystery over the Lady In Black begins to unravel the atmosphere builds and the shocks come fast  although not so fast that you don't have time to catch your breath between screams! Daniel Radcliffe handles his role very well and shows a lot of promise for a good post Harry career and the supporting cast  full of good old British character actors like Ciaran Hinds all play their parts to the full.The ending has been described as Hollywood but personally I felt it fitted in well and showed a certain amount of redemption impossible to fully explain without giving the ending away which I do not want to do here.This is not your blood and guts type horror rather one based on character story line and atmosphere and is well worth a visit if you like being scared out of your seat! Whilst this may not be the Hammer of Bray Studios etc it is good to see the name back emblazoned on the big screen again and doing what Hammer do best... BOO!".

	schema:reviewBody "Daniel Radcliffe's first film role after the end of Harry Potter is playing a lawyer in the early 1900s. OK that's cool. This film is both an adaptation and a remake but I have neither read the book nor saw the original film so I went into this film with just one wish please creep me out.And for the most part this film does that pretty well. I was creeped out throughout a lot of this film and jumped a descent number of times. I think the reason it works so well is because it has great atmosphere there is a twenty minute long sequence with almost no dialog with Daniel Radcliffe just walking around the house. And for a PG13 horror movie there are some pretty terrible ways in which KIDS get killed. The ending has balls it is both sad and happy at the same time. The acting is good and it has really good production value it really looks like the early 1900s.Now there are a few problems I had the first twenty minutes have a few of the cheap jump scares like a crow flying across the screen. Thankfully the scares get more real as the film goes on. There were a few times where I did feel kind of bored. And this may just be a personal problem but Daniel Radcliffe looks way too young to have a four year old kid. I mean he's 22 I know they had kids early back then but come on but like I said maybe it's just because I'm so used to him being Harry Potter.The Woman in Black is the best horror film of 2012 so far granted the only other one I saw was the Devil Inside but I did enjoy this film and recommend you check it out.".

First of all let me say how beautiful I think the film was technically the visuals were a lot of the time stunning despite children killing themselves left right and centre. However I struggled to get past the fact that it all seems done before not that I mind this greatly no but it really did hinder the film from being truly original. When it came to the fact that 'The Woman in Black' was killing children that's where I have a problem with this film. Whenever I watch a horror film one of my favourite things is that visceral feel you get feeling the character's feelings being scared at the right points. Very early on in the film it felt we were told and realised that Daniel Radcliffe's character was effectively in no danger at all and that this 'ghost' was not after him at all. This to me made it less scary yes I did jump when the music became deafening and a woman's scream howled out to the audience but is that what really makes a good horror film?Overall I did not dislike this film but I fail to acknowledge the hype that has been built up around it. Daniel Radcliffe's performance is decent but nothing extraordinary well done him though for continuing on in acting and not trying to be known just as Harry Potter although that is already the case. The film offers many jumpy moments which is to be expected but my favourite moment was the beginning which to me was the creepiest of them all.".

	schema:headline " A lot like Dead Silence meets Insidious.";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts out slowly with a bit of humor. Actually 3 girls died and some people in the theater found it funny. I kinda doubt that's what the filmmakers had in mind. A drawing by Radcliffe's son in the movie drew the most laughs and it was a recurring prop that was later used as a plot device. The only other recognizable face was Ciaran Hinds from Above Suspicion. It has an eerie feel to it as if some sort of filter was used to make the movie feel like how the haunted house looked. Yep it's one of those types of movies. To sum it up Harry Potter is playing a lawyer who has to settle the affairs of the house and it becomes a cold case and if he doesn't his job is on the line. This is more of a horror mystery. There wasn't much lawyer work going on. A lady lost a son she's dead her son is dead under mysterious circumstances she can't move on until it's solved you get the picture.Radcliffe just happens to be the character who has to work in the house and you already know he uncovers the truth. During his discoveries the plot begins to unravel and some of the antagonist's intentions and supernatural powers are revealed. The number one problem with this movie is the use of jump scares. There were just too many of them in my opinion. Not that the audience didn't react to them because that's what jump scares are supposed to do but there were some genuinely scary moments that didn't need to use that technique. Thankfully some didn't. This really is a scary movie. There's a very long scene where Radcliffe is experiencing about as much Amityville stuff as one can handle. That scene in the house was very well done and suspenseful. It's just you the house Radcliffe and all the various haunts. The director did a good job with that. Most of this movie takes place in the daytime like Feast 2 not a good comparison I know but they still did a good job building suspense.Without giving too much away The Woman In Black lost her child and that means everyone else has to lose theirs too. The girl setting herself on fire scene was good but I think the other death scenes should have been on par with the quality of that one for added chills. Props play a big part in the movie. Specifically dolls and toys. If you're sensitive to children dying or anything related to that you don't wanna watch this. It will scare you. It's not gory or graphic but clearly the audience sympathized with what was going on in the movie when those particular scenes came up. The biggest error in the movie was the addition of the dog that accompanied Harry Potter into the haunted house on one of his return visits. What happened to the dog? You know what? Someone said exactly that out loud. Gimme a Napoleon Dynamite IDIOT for that guy!But seriously the dog was just forgotten completely. There were a lot of clues as to what would happen later in the movie. Lots of foreshadowing if you pay attention. You can figure out how the movie is gonna end if you do. Speaking of it's a very good ending. Sad yet happy at the same time. And even then some knuckleheads in the audience had to spoil things by saying the obvious right before those scenes started. The climax pretty much happens right at the end of the movie and it concludes shortly after that. The overriding theme is grief and how to deal with it. The Woman In Black's grief was resolved or so it was thought. With that resolution you think the movie is done but it's not. There's a very brief scene explaining why she continues to do what she does but prior to that it's not really explained why.All the minor details are there but there's just not enough exposition. 35 minutes more of an explanation about her son's death and her feelings towards those involved in his death would have made the final revelation of her intentions make more sense. Not that it doesn't but for this type of movie it needs to be shown. The absolute ending is nice. We get a clear image of what she really looks like. It's very reminiscent of Insidious in that aspect. A new revenge horror icon has been created similar to Freddy Krueger in the fact that she kills kids. Yeah yeah I'm exaggerating but this was a very enjoyable horror movie that does its job by scaring you and keeping you interested the whole way through. It's not gonna keep you awake at night but you'll enjoy the ride. Solid acting scenery and special effects all the way around despite the minimal cast and budget. Worth paying for and seeing on the big screen but just make sure you see it with an audience that doesn't have the maturity level of a Peanuts character. Nothing happens after the credits. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. The movie poster ain't that great yet still relevant to the movie and it's rated PG13 but those detriments shouldn't stop you from giving this a chance.".

Not that it doesn't but for this type of movie it needs to be shown. The absolute ending is nice. We get a clear image of what she really looks like. It's very reminiscent of Insidious in that aspect. A new revenge horror icon has been created similar to Freddy Krueger in the fact that she kills kids. Yeah yeah I'm exaggerating but this was a very enjoyable horror movie that does its job by scaring you and keeping you interested the whole way through. It's not gonna keep you awake at night but you'll enjoy the ride. Solid acting scenery and special effects all the way around despite the minimal cast and budget. Worth paying for and seeing on the big screen but just make sure you see it with an audience that doesn't have the maturity level of a Peanuts character. Nothing happens after the credits. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. The movie poster ain't that great yet still relevant to the movie and it's rated PG13 but those detriments shouldn't stop you from giving this a chance.";

The setting and time period have all the makings of a great spook flick.

	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Living Dead the independent horror film made in 1968 had perhaps the eeriest moment I have seen in film  the lady getting stabbed by her own possessed daughter while her screams are heard in the background. The repeated motion of the daughter's hand striking with the knife is seen but I don't recall having seen the actual penetration of the knife. Although we do see the dead woman lying in the corner with pain and shock on her face  this is true horror. Very few movies bring this kind of terror  Rosemary's Baby The Blair Witch Horror Carrie etc. The best part about them is how we are constantly aware of the imminent tension and are lead to it slowly thus intensifying the impact when it hits us. Night of Living Dead kept me unnerved right to the iconic ending when it rained all its force with a sweep. How wonderful to have such movies among us!Then there is The Woman in Black  predictable derivative tedious and clichd. We are aware that there is going to be an element of horror because it written on Daniel Radcliffe's face even when he has not faced it. How many times do I have to see spooky children that seem to be controlled by some supernatural element? Their blank expressionless faces their slow walk and synchronized actions. This time we have creepy dolls and toys as accompaniments the mother who brings such toys for her children is an unfit one. Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur a young solicitor sporting some sideburns and a sweaty haggard look whose wife is dead and now lives with his four year old son who notices draws a stick figure of him with an unhappy look. Oh such a clever boy roll eyes! He has to handle an estate which no one is ready to tread especially the quiet ominous country people who believe the house is cursed. Daniel steps in and sights a woman veiled in black hence the name. The villagers tell him to keep away as their children because of his visits to the place. But Arthur for some reason known only to him wants to unravel the secrets. Perhaps he may get a raise!The movie is excruciatingly boring partly because Radcliffe looks tense when he isn't supposed to be and is relatively calm when he is supposed to be frightened to death. The direction itself is so indicative that it's a horror film with the affected spooked up style of talking even in the exchange between Radcliffe and the lawyer. I don't like this senseless overstatement of fear its shoddy. Radcliffe's Arthur smells a strange air in the village with most of the residents being unfriendly and reserved. Everyone has that look which says 'Yeah this is a horror film! Be frightened!' I would not have been surprised if they had added Bela Lugosi's  Be Afraid! monologue. The fear factor is close to nil I swear the entire theater mostly comprising of women and teenage girls remained dead silent throughout. Even when the ghost's presence became more and more evident. And I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes' consensus that it may not provide enough of them for viewers attuned to modern highstakes horror. It is a slighting remark since there are some viewers like me who are attuned to modern highstakes horror but appreciate more the horror that is subtly but effectively delivered. This movie was commercial mess.I wouldn't recommend The Woman in Black to anyone  it is devoid of any unsettling moment and may be too boring even for 13 year olds.My Rating 2 out of 10".

For Charlie the future is less clearly defined. A smalltime hood he works for his uncle making collections and reclaiming bad debts. He's probably too nice to succeed. In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of because of her epilepsy and a friend of her cousin Johnny Boy a near psychotic whose troublemaking threatens them all  he can't reconcile opposing values. A failed attempt to escape to Brooklyn moves them all a step closer to a bitter almost preordained future.";

	schema:headline " Quintessential early Scorsese and one of De Niro's most convincing and varied roles.";
	schema:reviewBody "The first time that Robert De Niro appears upclose in Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets is to the tune of the Rolling Stones' Jumpin' Jack Flash. It's from this point forward that the movie leaves the realm of being a 'good film' and becomes 'one of the greatest films of all time.' Simply put the energy of Mean Streets is fantastic. De Niro's flamboyant entrance is one of many iconic moments in the film which has influenced just about every crime film made since  for good reason.And yet ironically Mean Streets is rarely acknowledged as the masterpiece that it is perhaps because a number of people actually forget about it. Everyone remembers Taxi Driver Raging Bull and GoodFellas in particular but Scorsese's breakthrough remains one of his most important and honest pieces of work given little recognition apart from the praise by movie critics who do remember it.Harvey Keitel giving one of his most realistic and threedimensional performances of alltime plays the lonely and worried Charlie a 20something New York City Catholic who is haunted by his friend Johnny Boy De Niro the local loner who has to jump off the sides of streets in order to dodge the local Mafia thugs he owes money to.Mean Streets has been accused of lacking a point and one critic calls it 'too real' but I'd take this over most recent films any day of the week. Mean Streets doesn't have a dynamic arc like most motion pictures do  sure there's the rising action leading up to the climax but it doesn't move from one frame to another trying to figure out the easiest way to end the movie while managing to stress all its points in such a manner so blatant that a fouryearold could pick up the themes.It respects its audience enough to study its characters in such a way that they are given ten times as much depth as those seen in modern films released through Hollywood. As Johnny Boy De Niro paints the ultimate portrait of a typical street loner  a dumb kid who 'borrows money from everyone and never pays them back.' Charlie much smarter and wiser takes Johnny under his wing and tries to help him get a job so that he can pay back what he owes to a local kingpin. However Johnny is so irresponsible and stupid that he doesn't show up for work and begins fighting with the mob  leading up to an inescapable conclusion that features some very ancient themes colliding together. It's the classic tale of redemption and escaping one's past and if the film has a point it is that some people can't change and you'll get what's coming to you even if you've got other people helping you out.The film does have its technical flaws such as poor dubbing inconsistency and the occasional goof. It's a raw movie filmed on a low budget by a young and far more nave Martin Scorsese. But all his typical elements are in place to be expanded upon later in his career.Keitel and De Niro are superb particularly De Niro who shows great range very early on in his career. Almost unrecognizable in shabby clothing hats and a scrawny figure to boot this is a role that would typically be more suitable for Christopher Walken or other charismatic character actors  but De Niro pulls off the role with intense talent proving once again that he can handle any type of role. He's known for his psychotic roles but in Mean Streets he plays the opposite of Travis Bickle. Johnny Boy isn't unstable or psychopathic  he's just wild and stupid.Keitel channels all the thoughtful consciousness of an older child considering Johnny Boy to be a brother of sorts. He feels that if he fails Johnny he will somehow fail himself.Mean Streets is a careful character study that never resorts to cardboard cutout caricatures or the standard clichs of the genre. Dialogue does not exist to move action forward towards the next adrenalinepacked sequence Mean Streets focuses on its inhabitants with such strong emotional power that it's impossible not to be caught up in its grasp. A true classic from start to finish and undeniably a very moving film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mean Streets has all the characteristics we have come to associate with Scorsese  the fluid camerawork the expressionistic lighting the sudden explosions of violence the eclectic soundtrack.  In later films he took cinema to new heights with the flowering of his technical skills and the broadening of his material but Mean Streets remains unsurpassed for the emotional intensity which only a young director passionate about film and intent on making a personal statement could achieve.The theme of the film is contained in the famous first line 'You don't make up for your sins in church you do it in the streets' a Scorsese voiceover.  An extended preface which delineates the nature of the film and its characters before the narrative begins includes brief cameo scenes introducing the four protagonists a much copied device see for example Trainspotting.Scorsese's alterego is played as in the earlier 'Who's That Knocking At My Door?' by Harvey Keitel giving the performance of his young life.  He is Charlie a junior member of a Mafia family who collects debts and runs numbers but who also has aspirations to sainthood. The other key figure is his anarchic friend Johnny Boy played with ferocious energy by de Niro.Charlie is introduced coming out of confession dissatisfied with his penance.  Reciting words doesn't mean anything to him and he can't believe that forgiveness could come so easily.  Deliberately burning his hand in a candle flame is a more effective reminder of the pain of hell.  The camera follows Charlie from the altar into Tony's bar a redlit inferno and when Johnny Boy comes in to the tune of Jumping Jack Flash Charlie recognises that this is the form his penance will take.  Johnny Boy is the cross he must bear.  'You send me this Lord' he says resignedly.Johnny Boy's irresponsibility and impulsiveness make him everything Charlie with his controlled anxious guiltridden persona is not.  The argument which follows in the back room about Johnny Boy's debts deserves its reputation as one of the great scenes in seventies cinema.Charlie's life moves in well worn claustrophobic circles.  Hardly anyone outside his immediate circle appears in the film and other ethnic groups are viewed with suspicion.  The characters seldom appear outdoors or in daylight. Charlie inhabits a world of bars pool halls and cinemas.  In the one scene he appears in sunlight he looks ill at ease.  The suit and heavy overcoat he wears reflecting his Mafiosi ambitions look distinctly out of place on a beach.  It's significant that in this scene Teresa his girlfriend scorns his smalltime gangsterism and challenges him to join her in moving away to a new life. But Charlie is trapped by his desire to please his uncle.Scorsese has said that his choice in adolescence lay between becoming a priest and becoming a gangster and that he failed on both counts.  Mean Streets allows him to explore that choice to devastating effect.".

They deliver the goods big time. They are both so watchable and make up at least half of the movie's appeal. In fact 'Mean Streets' is an inherently watchable movie overall helped by some fine dialogue and Scorsese's trademark energetic and involving camerawork. The main draw is the antics of the characters and their relationships rather than a highstakes narrative. Dramatic things happen but don't relate intrinsically to the central plot that of De Niro's character Johnny Boy his debts to clubs bars and old pals along with his longsuffering buddy Charlie Keitel.In comparison to other Scorsese films which is inevitably going to happen if this is not your first Scorsese it is very low on scale and as mentioned before low on stakes. This is no gangster epic or psychological portrait but simply a 2 hour window into the streets of New York. It is certainly worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Good film misunderstood underappreciated";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people hated this film they didn't see a point in it they didn't understand why it ends the way it does. They got frustrated gave it bad reviews wrote it off. When I don't understand something I generally watch it again... and again until I do understand it. This is a fantastic film let me explain why. The music is great. Perfectly fits the time period and setting I dunno how much they had to pay in royalties for the songs in this film but I love em'.The camera work is fantastic. There's a scene where the camera gives you charlie's viewpoint stumbling wobbling across the bar lights flashing people dancing music blaring then zooms out to his smiling happy face. Yeah I know its not the beginning to Citizen Kane but its a great scene nonetheless my favorite in the film. Then there's the filming of the street festival and the overall way which New York is captured so perfectly. It feels like you are really in the city the movie has that gritty feeling to it.The dialogue is perfect many of it is ad libbed by Deniro and Keitel. This is the beginning of ad libbed dialogue for deniro You talking' to me? There's a scene where Keitel confronts Deniro outside the bar to ask him about his debt the exchange is perfect it could never have been written and its executed beautifully.The acting is also fantastic throughout.So great acting great filmwork and great dialogue all come together to create a wonderfully realistic film.Now the end of the movie maybe you didn't understand it so I'll explain the film. I'll try not to spoil the ending.OK so Charlie does some bad things he works for the mob after all and he wants to repent for his sins so after going to church and then later seeing jonny boy in a bar he thinks that God has asked him to repent for his sins on the streets by helping out Jonny Boy. He doesn't believe that saying a few hail mary's or confessing washes away one's sins. So enter the walking train wreck that is Jonny Boy.Now what type of person is Jonny Boy? He has no sense of responsibility he does not answer to anyone he does not obey any rules he never does what is expected of him.Hmm so what type of person is Charlie? There are several scenes in the film that let you know what type of person charlie is. The statement Charlie loves everybody and everybody loves Charlie almost sums it up. Charlie wants to please everyone. But his life is full of conflict. You can't be in the mob and be religious it just doesn't work that way. You can't hang out with guys who are racist and date an African American. These are just a few examples but suffice to stay that Charlie wants everyone to like him the local mob boss his friends his God but he also wants to be happy and do the things he wants to do. There is conflict in all of this. Some of the other people that charlie wants to please eg. God and the mob boss have conflicting agendas. Some of the people that charlie wants to please conflict with what he personally wants to do with his life eg. he is embarrassed to be dating the epileptic because he thinks it shows weakness to his friends but he loves her and she makes him happy.You cannot please everyone. The irony of this film and this is a little spoiler is that while charlie is trying to save jonny boy he should take a few lessons from him. Jonny Boy does whatever he wants without thinking about who he might upset or disappoint. Charlie is the complete opposite. Yeah Jonny Boy is destructive and his life is falling apart but the point is that the two of them represent two opposite extremes. This is why the end of the film is tragic its the lesson that you can't make everyone happy that life is full of conflict. How we deal with conflicts in our lives the decisions we make they sum up who we are as human beings they shape our lives.So there are many reasons why this film is great. I watch it every once in awhile and it really is one of my favorite films.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I see this particular film getting high marks I have to sit here and wonder if it's simply because Mean Streets is a Scorsese movie with DeNiro and Keitel as stars. I rented this as a supplement to some other Scorsese movies I saw in a college class about gangster films and I had fairly high expectations. I was falsely built up.Where is the plot? Can someone please please tell me this? I thought there was a beginning to a plot when Charlie went to the boss and was told to stay away from Johnny Boy and Teresa so he could get his restaurant. But just like everything else in the flick that all kinda fell apart when Johnny predictably started acting the fool again. Charlie mentions at the start of the movie that he atones for his sins on the streets and that is the only reason I can really think of for him to try to protect Johnny Boy who was obviously doomed from the start. One of the most recognizable conventions of the gangster film is the young disrespectful street thug getting whacked for said lack of respect. It's obvious from the very beginning that Johnny Boy is either going to die or get severely hurt for his actions and the rest of the movie is just an exercise in how to bring Johnny to an end which could have been done in ten minutes and saved me an hour and a half.My main beef with this movie is just serious lack of a plot line.I feel I've been hard on it so I have to say that I did like the scene setups the bar brawl especially I hope it was intended to be comical because I was LMAO and way the camera moved around the street. The streetlevel view lends a lot to the feel of authenticity. If there is one thing this movie does well it's portraying an authentic feeling of being on the streets of NYC. The thugs on the streets of NYC however are not always that interesting.".

The streetlevel view lends a lot to the feel of authenticity. If there is one thing this movie does well it's portraying an authentic feeling of being on the streets of NYC. The thugs on the streets of NYC however are not always that interesting.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the things that I love the most about watching the old classics is when you can so clearly see the beginnings of what later became such trademarks of a director actor even a genre. Martin Scorsese begins a long line of films about the gangs of New York with Mean Streets a gritty look at the underside of New York City that foreshadowed much of the same stark realism portrayed in Taxi Driver a few years later. It reminds me of the minimalist realism of films like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing another urban classic.Robert DeNiro plays Johnny Boy the fast talking kid who owes money all over town and never seems to care to pay anyone back. We meet other characters who owe people money and their apologies at not being able to pay are genuine they realize that they're not going to get late fees added to their debt or Last Notices they're putting their lives on the line. There is genuine fear on their side and genuine malice on the side of the people they owe money to but Johnny Boy just doesn't seem to care.Harvey Keitel plays Charlie Cappa who is constantly trying to get Johnny Boy to shape up and pay off what he owes knowing the danger that he is in and frustrated at Johnny's lack of interest or care in the fact that he owes so many people so much money. Johnny and Charlie live in the same environment but completely different worlds. Johnny holds himself in and laughs everything off occasionally venting his frustration in quick bursts of violence Charlie is much more contained but is tormented spiritually. While Johnny gets himself into endless debt with people that collect by any means necessary Charlie goes to confession and holds his fingers over flames to remind himself of the dangers of the afterlife should he mess up in this one. Catholicism is a major character in this film.The movie is set in New York City in the late 1960s where Scorsese grew up in presumably something of a similar environment. Something must have gone differently since he ended up one of the most famous directors in the world rather than dead like so many characters in his movies do but he creates this environment in Mean Streets that gives an incredible view into the dangers of the life that so many people lived and continue to live there. I've never even been to New York but having seen so many of Scorsese's films I think I can understand why the environment could have had such an impact on him that it dominated most of his career as a filmmaker.There are some classic scenes in this movie that would have been much more widely quoted were it not for the even more quotable lines from Taxi Driver. Mean Streets for example is where you find the classic speech by Robert DeNiro I'll call it the I borrow money from everybody so I owe everybody money so I can't borrow money no more so I borrow money from you because you're the only jerkoff around here that I can borrow money without paying back! speech. I love that one especially the expression on his face he's having such a great time.But considering the world that he lives in it's almost understandable the way he cares so little about placing himself in danger. In a life as bleak and unpromising as the one that is portrayed in this movie it is to be expected that someone will display passive suicidal behavior. Johnny knows he's never going to go to college he's never going to be a doctor or a businessman or drive a nice car he's going to grow up working menial jobs and live an obscure and meaningless life in his eyes and that's what the movie's about.Charlie seems to have similar feelings looking to the Catholic Church not only as a means of salvation and spiritual fulfillment but for meaning as well. Granted that is a very common goal for people getting involved with religion of any kind but even more in Charlie's case. He is certainly the levelheaded one between him and Johnny but his future is not a whole lot brighter. Regardless of how much more responsible Charlie is than Johnny or how hard he tries to get Johnny to straighten out and pay off his debts they both live in the same world and so do their debtors. It is a world that is described in the lyrics of one of the songs in the movie Have you ever had a wish sandwich? It's the kind where you take two pieces of bread and wish you had some meat.".

The opening credits done to the tune of Be My Baby suck you right into the film and the rest of the movie is peppered with Scorsese's loving treatment of popular music that would later become one of his most endearing hallmarks.

The religious iconography the brotherhood of crooks the attraction to the gangster lifestyle the keen eye for depicting violence in artistic and startling ways...these are displayed here in Mean Streets in their rawest form.Though flawed in many ways Mean Streets set the stage and laid the the template for the type of film Scorsese would perfect seventeen years later with Goodfellas.

DeNiro is another small time hood but he's completely and psychotically out of control. He's borrowed a few grand from local loan shark Robert Romanus and Romanus wants his money. Now during the climax scene DeNiro does ask a relevant question why after he has borrowed and stiffed everyone in the neighborhood would you lend him any money?In fact Keitel is all that's standing between DeNiro and gangster retribution. Is it all worth it even for Amy Robinson who is an epileptic and for some reason Keitel's uncle Cesare Danova thinks that disqualifies her as a potential bride.The story is a bit muddled but the characters especially Keitel and DeNiro are unforgettable. Mean Streets made the career of both of them and of director Martin Scorsese. Keitel has become a valued character player and DeNiro a star with an astonishing variety of roles. In fact next to John FordJohn Wayne Martin ScorseseRobert DeNiro is probably the most successful directorplayer combination in film history. This must have been a labor of love since Martin Scorsese grew up in Little Italy grown a lot smaller since he was a kid there. No doubt Keitel DeNiro and the rest are drawn from characters he knew.

	schema:reviewBody "Mean Streets is a gritty lowbudget drama that tells the story of a young man whose loyalties to his friend his girlfriend and his religion all become incompatible with his career in organised crime. The action takes place in New York City's Little Italy where a group of smalltime mobsters do a great deal of posturing as they attempt to prove to themselves and others that they've got what it takes to become important and powerful in their own neighbourhood and inevitably their dealings with each other often become very unpredictable and volatile.Charlie Harvey Keitel is an essentially decent guy and a devout Cathloic who works as a collector for his uncle Giovanni Cesare Danova who's the local Mafia boss. Charlie's committed to his career but is also tormented by the guilt that he feels because his work and his religious beliefs are totally irreconcilable. His anguish over this conflict is profound but he's also troubled by the fact that his uncle disapproves of his longtime friend Johnny Boy Robert De Niro and his girlfriend Teresa Amy Robinson and his uncle's feelings are so strong that he's made it clear to Charlie that unless he's prepared to distance himself from both Johnny Boy and Teresa he won't get promoted to a more important role in his organisation.Johnny Boy is a reckless gambler who owes money to numerous loan sharks who are getting very impatient with his lack of concern about paying off his debts. Charlie's inclination to protect his friend regularly makes his own life difficult and frustratingly Johnny Boy doesn't have the intelligence to take the good advice that Charlie gives him. Teresa is Johnny Boy's cousin and Giovanni disapproves of her because she's an epileptic and he interprets that as meaning that she's sick in the head.Local loan shark Michael Richard Romanus is a lowlevel operator with delusions of grandeur who's desperate to collect what he's owed by Johnny Boy. When he asks for his money to be repaid Johnny Boy's stupid hotheaded reaction causes Michael's patience to reach breaking point and this precipitates a sequence of events that eventually culminate in the action that brings this story to its violent conclusion.Mean Streets is notable for being the movie that brought the talents of Martin Scorsese Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel to a mass audience and also won them a great deal of critical acclaim. The movie's most striking quality is its authenticity which is mainly attributable to the fact that Scorsese who wrote the screenplay with Mardik Martin based so many of the incidents and characters on actual events that he knew about involving people that he grew up with in Little Italy. The interactions between De Niro and Keitel are also a highlight of the movie because their exchanges are often electric and display vividly how incredibly talented these guys were even as inexperienced actors.The pop songs and Italian music that feature on the soundtrack are so resonant of the time in which the action is set and the culture of characters that they add immeasurably to the realism of the entire piece in a way that an original score couldn't possibly have achieved. The sheer intensity of this movie and its preoccupations with issues of ambition loyalty and religious guilt are real strong points and make it both fascinating to watch and very memorable.".

Harvey Kietel is also worth a watch too. I'm a fan of gangster movies not primarily beyond of the usual violence that is included but the portrayal of the way of lifepolitics which usually provides thoughtful and provoking entertainment.Unfortunately this wasn't one of them.The story follows smalltime hoodlum Kietel whose religious principals affect his conscience while collecting debts and doing other menial hoodlum activities. These activities although menial should be easy enough to pursue but Mr Smallttime Hoodlum is distracted by his loose cannon friend De Niro a reckless showboy gambler running a heavy debt with other mobsters whose patience is wearing very thin.What follows is an epic borefest trying to disguise itself as social commentary and character studying. In truth it's just a plodding overhyped melodrama which raises above criticism because of its director and cast.Don't be fooled and avoid.".

Unfortunately I thought Id either given my dad a bad tape or the video hadnt been tuned into the TV station properly since the picture quality was very poor and everything was filmed in a sickly red colour and thats just the bits I could make out because for most of the movie the contrast was terrible with everything being dimly lit . It wasnt until a couple of nights ago when I saw MEAN STREETS on network TV that I realised that the poor picture quality wasnt anything to do with duff videotapes or out of tune video recorders  It was down to the fact that the original print suffers from some terrible lighting and cinematography that gives the impression that the movie was made on 8mm by a bunch of twelve year old boysThats bad enough but what brings the film down  And I noticed this on first viewing in 1991  is that Scorsese has forgotten to write a plot to his screenplay . I think Martin Scorsese is god where making movies is concerned but not even he can escape criticism by making a movie that goes nowhere . For the most part MEAN STREETS resembles those Harry Endfield characters The Scousers with New York accents  You alright Johnny Boy ?   You asking me if Im alright ?   Yeah I am . What the f you gonna do about it ?  Its like this all the way through the running time up until the last ten minutes when Marty finally realises hes got to introduce an incident in order to finish the film The acting from Harvey Keitel is totally convincing while De Niro is superb  Something that cant be said for most of his recent performances  but by writing a low concept hyper realistic screenplay Scorsese has effectively ruined the movie in its conception .

Intelligentlymade film about desperate characters living on the edge isn't especially profound though it is intrinsically exciting in a showoffy way.

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Scorsese's 'Mean Streets' has Scorsese Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel on the top of their game from early in their respective careers.An often overlooked film there is much to enjoy for anybody interested in the first collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro.Make no mistake about it though  whilst De Niro is captivating in his role as Johnny it is Harvey Keitel's Charlie that holds the film together. De Niro disappears for lengthy periods. His character  a loudmouth who owes money to everybody left right and centre with no intention of paying it back  is all the better for it. You an tell they had a lot of fun filming this. There are also strong performances from supporting cast such as Richard Romanus as Michael.With most great film makers the evidence is there in their early films and Scorsese is no different. There is some fantastic camera action going on here. There are also some well choreographed set pieces where everybody knows where they are meant to be at the precise second they need to be all in one fluid shot with very few camera cuts or edits. The soundtrack and the lighting also really adds to the style and feel of this film.This probably won't be for everybody however. There is little story going on  just the everyday hustle of a few small time crooks. This is in many ways is the complete opposite of the style of 'Goodfellas' and 'The Soprano's' and certainly nothing like 'The Godfather'. The biggest concerns going on are small time loan sharking business and stolen goods. Ideas are picked up then discarded shortly after.So watch if you're interested in seeing a master film maker at work with strong lead roles who would all go on to be part of some of the most important films of all time. See them before they became stars in no small part due to this collaboration.710.".

	schema:headline " The birth of a master !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Martin Scorsese had made a few movies before Mean Streets this was the film that brought him critical acclaim for the first time in a big way and this was the film that showcased the birth of a master with a unique sense of style and cinematic language. The screenplay for Mean Streets written by Scorsese and Mardik Martin was based on a story idea by Scorsese himself. He really wanted to make a film about the life that he himself was very familiar with coming from an ItalianAmerican neighbourhood. The film certainly feels very personal and has to be a cinematic reflection of his early life and experiences.I think a comparison between Mean Streets and two other Scorsese gangster films namely Goodfellas and Casino is interesting. While all the three do come under the bracket of gangster films but I think Mean Streets is significantly distinct from Goodfellas and Casino in the way it is structured. Goodfellas is very tightly structured and the narrative always moves in a very specific direction. Mean Streets on the other hand is very loosely structured. The screenplay doesn't have a lot happening in it and the narrative is very episodic in nature. Scorsese uses this loose and episodic narrative structure to his benefit as it helps him to really pay attention to and develop the characters that make up the film. Charlie and Johnny Boy's relationship serves as the backbone of the film but in reality Mean Streets is Charlie's story. The film is about him his insecurity his religious ideas his friends his neighbourhood his family and last but by no means least his guilt. Although Scorsese introduces all the boys of the neighbourhood i.e. Charlie Tony Michael and Tony with their own individual scenes that established them as the guys we will follow but in reality we actually get inside the mind of only Charlie. Charlie is a fascinating character. Right from the first shot of the film we get to be aware of the fact that he is a devout Christian and he really fears the prospect of having to pay for all the sins of crime that he has committed. Unlike his other friends he is respectful of people and has a heart. He is respectful of the lord but wants to serve penance in his own way which is to help the wild and slightly dimwitted Johnny Boy. He wants to save Johnny Boy and in turn get saved himself by God. He actually confronts many instances where he can choose what he wants and what is good for him but we see him repeatedly choosing the opposite. He is attracted to the black dancer but the collective racism of his friends prevents him from approaching her. He can get together with Teresa leave this life and this neighbourhood but he doesn't and cites the prospect of owning a restaurant which his uncle dangled in front of him as the reason to not go away. Like his other friends in the locality Charlie is also plagued by a firm sense of insecurity. He knows that the life he leads is not ideal and he knew as a devout Christian that he will pay but he is fearful of going out of this neighbourhood and going somewhere where he is not a bigshot. So he in his mind manipulates things to satisfy himself that by doing good for Johnny Boy he is serving his penance without having to leave this life. So although in an explicit sense the bond between Charlie and Johnny looks pure with a firm foundation of brotherhood in a way Charlie does all he does for Johnny mainly because of selfish reasons and his personal desire to serve penance and get 'saved'. Ironically it's this desperation to save Johnny Boy that brings Charlie down. These complexities in Charlie work majorly because Scorsese in his storytelling doesn't judge Charlie. He is presented as a normal person with flaws.Even at such an early stage in his career we can see Scorsese experimenting extensively here with new and fresh ideas and techniques for the time. There are so many examples of fantastic filmmaking like the super 8 footage during the opening credits with the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby' the long Steadicam shot when Charlie enters the bar dancing with the Rolling Stones' 'Tell Me' playing at the back Johnny Boy's entrance in the film with 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' playing etc. I also love how Scorsese shoots all the scenes in Tony's bar in striking red neon light giving the bar a hellish look. I don't think the film is flawless. The editing in a few scenes is a bit choppy which is expected from a young filmmaker. There is an extended scene in the bar where a Vietnam Veteran is given a party. I thought that scene went on for a little too long and became a little too flashy and selfindulgent. Apart from that the film is brilliantly directed.All the actors perform well but clearly the headliners are Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Keitel is absolutely brilliant in expressing the inner guilt and the complex and sometimes conflicting emotions distressing him along with his desperation to help out Johnny Boy. Robert De Niro in his first of many collaborations with Scorsese is absolutely dynamite as Johnny Boy. The manic eccentricity that De Niro gives to the character is highly impressive. Mean Streets isn't about the plot. It's about the characters and mainly about Charlie. It's about a character who is well aware of the fact that the life he leads is not ideal. But just like the boys in Fellini's 'I Vitelloni' the fear of exploring the unknown prevents him from abandoning the life he knows to pursue something new. Mean Streets gives us an glimpse of the beginning of one of the greatest filmmaking careers in all of film history.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1838 Charles Godwin Stephen Dillane is an English gentleman sheep farmer with a comatose wife who hires a Swiss woman to have his baby. Godwin crosses the English Channel where Elisabeth Laurier Sophie Maureau responds to his ad for a surrogate mother. From the very beginning there's strong chemistry between them which is partly why he hires her. She needs the money to help her father who's in prison.Godwin chooses three days to be with Elisabeth presumably based on some sense of when she'll be fertile and they meet at a resort hotel on the coast of England. The second night the chemistry between them ignites and  by the third night  they're madly in love. However they dutifully repress their feelings and keep their business bargain. Godwin goes home and leaves her to have the baby.Elisabeth gives birth to a baby girl who's taken from her before she even sees it. Since she's in love with the absent father it's not hard to imagine what her pregnancy was like nor the intense deprivation she experiences when both father and baby are lost to her. The scene fades from the image of the ivy growing outside the room where she gave birth to a watercolor painting of ivy and then uses imagery from Elisabeth's paintingdiary to keep track of her growing attachment for her daughter.When the story switches back to Godwin we're introduced to his father and also to an American sheep farmer who eventually proposes to Elisabeth. Godwin's father is a member of the aristocracy and a profligate rake and spendthrift who has serial verypublic love affairs. We learn that Godwin's wife is comatose after a riding accident that took place shortly after their marriage.Godwin is a complex and intriguing character and Stephen Dillane plays him to perfection. Dillane is so charismatic in this film that it makes me want to jump through the screen screaming! To my mind the only performance that rivals Dillane's repressed but smoldering 19th century Britishness is Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.For Dillane's outstanding performance  and all of the film's outstanding performances  we have to thank William Nicholson's excellent writing and direction along with the almost mystical cinematography of Nic Morris. As writerdirector Nicholson exploits the medium of film to do what only film can do and that's weave a narrative subtext that propels the story through interdimensional dreamlike symbolism. The accessible and yet subtle overriding metaphor of firelight is carried throughout the film starting from the first moment when Godwin and Elisabeth are alone together. Godwin says something like I didn't realize that fire cast so much light. Do you mind? This consideration for Elisabeth's modesty in such an awkward situation sparks the first sympathy between them. From that moment it gets more and more difficult for them to pretend that they're just there for business. Unwittingly Godwin repeats the same sentence when they're alone together seven years later. Firelight and love are synonymous. The subtext about human relationships  especially relationships between husband and wife children and parents is also explored through the imagery of Elisabeth's desire to shout the boathouse in the lake breeding sheep the estate the sisterinlaw another exquisitely convincing performance by Lia Williams Godwin's father Elisabeth's family history etc. Everything in this film is essential to a fully realized threedimensional portrait of human relationships and there's nothing extra. The filmmaking is just plain masterful.And did I mention the costumes?The best films go beyond the capacity of words to convey meaning. Sometimes half remembered dreams leave us with a wordless understanding that evaporates like steam if we try too hard to explain it. For me this film goes beyond words to convey meaning in the same way that dreams do. Elisabeth shows up at Godwin's estate seven years after she gives birth to accept a position as governess to their daughter. Her interactions as incognito motherteacher with beloved spoiledchild Luisa another fine performance by Dominique Belcourt are nothing short of poignant. There's a miniMiracle Worker going on here. The scene were Godwin fights Elisabeth for the key to the schoolroom is incredible.The other aspect that resonates with me personally is what this film says about the plight of women in 19th century Europe and how the exceptional courage and intelligence of one woman who believes in herself can overcome the hardship of circumstances. Women are only fifty percent of the human race but our issues as a subgroup of mankind have to take a back seat to all of the other subgroups where males are fighting other males for dominance with the common denominator that they all subjugate women. I love the scene where Elisabeth convinces her daughter that education is the only way out of spiritual prison for a woman. I have always admired Sophie Marceau but she really goes beyond herself in this film thanks to the exceptional script direction cinematography costumes and performances of her fellow actors. A beautiful and accomplished actress rises to the occasion of portraying a beautiful and accomplished woman struggling to survive in exceptional circumstances.At first we're confused about Elisabeth's appearance at Godwin's estate to become governess to his adopted daughter. When they met seven years before he had to hide his identity so we never know if or how she finds out his name. However Elisabeth eventually confesses that it took her seven years to find him so we know that the narrative is driven by her desire and intentions. The moment when Godwin asks her if she regrets this is among the best in screen history in my opinion. Since increasingly films live beyond their time I have no doubt that someday this masterpiece will be viewed as a major film classic.".

She agrees to enter into what might be viewed as an indecent proposal with Charles Godwin a well to do English landowner in having a sexual relation for the sole purpose of giving him a child his sick wife can't give him. Elisabeth must renounce to all claims of the baby.

After some research I found that I have seen him in some character roles but nowhere is he as handsome as in this film.

Sophie Marceau is a beautiful governess who seven years prior was hired by a rich Englishman to conceive a baby because the man's own wife had been seriously injured but did not die after a riding accident.  Marceau's motivation is to pay her father's debts and get him out of prison.  Thus the two principal characters are having this weekend affair  out of a sense of duty to others.  Unlike many movies set in the mid19th century the rich people in this movie are not one dimensional and heartless and the poor people are not powerless victims. Marceau manages to track down her child after 6 years and becomes her governess. The girl has become a spoiled brat and Marceau is the first to teach the girl how to read and much about life.  There is not exactly a happy ending in the Hollywood sense.  In order to get something one must take risks and be willing to give up other things.".

	schema:headline " A truly underrated gem consider yourself lucky to find it";
	schema:reviewBody "Fantasy book author William Nicholson made his first and so far only effort at moviedirection with this 1997 English Gothic romance based on his own screenplay. Sophie Marceau the French princess in Braveheart plays a Swiss governess named Elizabeth in late 1830s England. Desperate to pay a family debt she sells herself to an anonymous English gentlemen for three days in his efforts to produce an heir for his family. Harsh and uncaring at first they fall in love but both have agreed never to see or speak to each other again for the sake of keeping up appearances. Elizabeth conceives a baby girl who is wisked away seconds after birth. Heartbroken Elizabeth writes letters to My English Daughter until she can no longer keep her promise. Seven years after the baby's birth she tracks the child down now a spoiled brat living on a remote Sussex estate. The daughter acts up as she pines for her usually absent father. Her father's wife has been in a vegetative state for a decade after a riding accident and even the the daughter knows she is not the real mother. Elizabeth takes a job as the girl's governess to be close to her unbeknownst to the girl's father. When the father Charles Godwin returns from London he is appalled at the mother of his child showing up again in his life as well as the rekindling of a romantic fire he has desperately tried to convince himself is long burnt out. Themes of duty to family maternal love and desperate attempts to hold back passion are played out in perpetually foggy and snowswept landscapes and around fireplaces in the Godwin Victorian mansion.Performances by the actors are uniformly excellent. Marceau and Stephen Dillane as Charles Godwin share a chemistry rarely captured on film but also look for Dominique Belcourt as the daughter Lia Williams as Godwin's longsuffering sisterinlaw Kevin Anderson as the visiting American who falls for Elizabeth and veteran British actor Joss Ackland as Godwin's father whose selfindulgent hedonism dooms the family to ruin. It's never apparent that this is Nicholson's first time out as a director. Nic Morris's cinematography of the English countryside and Marceu's exquisitely beautiful face lit by firelight is something to see and Christopher Gunning's stringladen score is dramatic and overthetop which it really should be.Although rife with gray and icy colors painful family obligation stark settings heartbreak euthanasia held back emotions and rigid social mores the underlying theme of the Firelight is that true love conquers all. It's never really gotten the attention it deserves.Released by Disney's Hollywood pictures the movie played briefly in American arthouses back in 1998 and was released on VHS the next year to very little fanfare. Disillusioned Nicholson never directed a picture again although he hit paydirt when he cowrote the script to Ridley Scott's Gladiator in 2000. Firelight has been sporadically available since then on demand on the Encore movie cable channel. A Region 0 barebones DVD was released in Hong Kong of all places it's available on Amazon.com and ebay. If you find a copy it's definitely worth purchasing.".

I have given it five stars out of ten just to place myself precisely in the middle. For quality it is worth more and because it may be construed as condoning aspects of immoral behaviour less. Whether it does actually condone that which is wrong is open to debate. So too is the matter of predictability. Are you expecting blissful lovers to disappear into a glorious sunset?For this period drama you do have to suspend reality and accept the parameters required for the film to work. We are asked to believe that way back in the first half of the nineteenth century a comatose woman seemingly unable even to blink would have survived for years and still have significant life expectancy. Medical science makes such a thing possible in our time but how would the patient have been fed in those days? Don't let such considerations put you off. For other titles we accept time travel real people living inside computer memory oriental gentlemen waving scimitars who run up vertical walls and jump over tall buildings and still enjoy the show.Sophie Marceau's acting was outstanding. Who would have thought that Elisabeth Laurier in 'Firelight' and Lila Dubois in 'Lost  Found' were played by the same person? Stephen Dillane playing Charles Godwin was more than adequate as the other main lead. The rest of the characters were well cast each contributing significantly to this very moving tale. 'Firelight' covers part of the lives of two essentially principled people trying to find a way through the distressing circumstances with which each was faced. If they took a wrong turn which of us is going to throw the first stone? Judgment of every individual is God's prerogative. If this film does nothing else it does show why there is a debate about euthanasia. I had two special adult friends outside our immediate family early in life one as a child and one as a youth. Both had flaws in their characters but were excellent mentors. I chose to adopt some of their traits but not others. A couple of years past retirement age I bought my first television and have since discovered films. I find these very instructive giving me insights into the human condition which I would not have otherwise. As with my mentors I am using my discrimination when assessing any messages suggested by each movie. I found 'Firelight' emotionally stimulating its characters eminently admirable in many respects but used my beliefs and discretion in determining the validity of any moral that may be inferred from its plot. Isn't this what we all do?Some review comments seem to be denigrating Charles Godwin unfairly. It was Lord Clare who ruined the estate by his profligacy. Charles on the other hand was trying to keep the boat afloat as a sheep farmer. To suggest that Charles viewed Elisabeth as little more than a chattel doesn't ring true with me. I gained the impression that he was considering her as well as himself right from the beginning. I also felt that their motives tended towards the welfare of others rather than their own selfish ends. The firelight allegory might also be less simplistic than is being suggested. If I am recalling events correctly I thought the initial use was to introduce a plot continuity. This was progressed to a vehicle used by Elisabeth to allow her daughter the opportunity to break free of her antagonistic attitudes. At some point the firelight rekindled a significant memory. Finally for Amy the firelight was conspicuous by its absence. Were the words May God have mercy on us just a common expression or were they spoken from the heart? Judge for yourself.I looked for the DVD hoping that it would have an audio commentary. Guess what? Buena Vista has allowed the title to become currently 'out of print' so I couldn't even buy the film itself ! That surprised me considering the number of reviewers and the high average rating. I'm looking forward to seeing this film again but will have to wait for it to come around once more on TV. Do keep an eye open for it in your programme guides. If and when it appears it's well worth watching.".

The musical score blends beautifully with the story. The love story draws you in and won't let go. The ending is satisfying and believable. English manor life in 1838 is exquisitely portrayed.

Here I found out that many people think the same.Searching the web as I said I also ran across the director's statement that I cite hereInspired by Nicholson's fascination with 1940s movie love stories Firelight is a film that awakens the romantic spirit in each of us. For his film directorial debut Nicholson wanted to create a boundless romantic story about lovers forced apart by outside forces. To do so he had to set his story in another place and time. To achieve that oldfashioned level of romance the writerdirector asserts I had to go back to a place and time when there were forces stronger than individual desires. Contemporary love stories are relationship stories because the obstacles that prevent people from loving each other are essentially selfinduced. These kind of stories can be charming but you can't build up an enormous head of steam with them. I wanted to create a story about how love can redeem people about how it can totally change their lives. I wanted to create that tragic feeling you have when two people are perfect for each other love each other but yet cannot have one another. Nicholson set out to write a film in which the focus was on people and their emotions. As he worked on the screenplay Nicholson developed a very clear and simple visual style for the film. I wanted people's feelings to be the central issue of the film and I wanted nothing to distract from that. The idea of firelight became central to what the film is about. The story is about light about winter about coldness and empty rooms where the eye goes toward the one source of heat the fire.To conceive a good film is one thing but to make it is altogether different sometimes very hard. Nicholson succeeded fantastically but praises must be given to all the cast as well Sophie first.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Nicholson's 'Firelight' is a visual feast. It's not hightech special effects extravagant sets or costumes or the scenic flowery locations that create the visual beauty but rather the simplicity of it that is beautifully captured by the camera. It is the subtlety and gentle treatment that creates an atmosphere that is cold or warm. Notice though in the scenes where the temperature is supposed to be freezing there is a coldness between the characters but the scenes with the firelight reflect a warmth in the characters. The story itself is pretty simple. There is hardly any 'main' conflict that drives the story. Any plot device that is presented is almost immediately resolved like Elisabeth getting Louisa to study Charles giving Elisabeth a onemonth notice and then falling for her. The movie moves at a rapid pace but Nicholson has handled the sequences quite well because none of it looks rushed. The love scenes were tastefully shot.The acting is excellent. An incredibly beautiful Sophie Marceau does a phenomenal job. Stephan Dillane too does an equally convincing job. The supporting cast is good too.'Firelight' is not without its share of loopholes. For example considering that the film is set in the 1800s how did they manage to maintain a comatose patient so well in seemingly such good health? Regarding the death sequence why was such a cruel form of euthanasia by having the victim freeze to death chosen? The happy ending also feels a bit awkward but that may be because one would normally expect a tragic solution.In short 'Firelight' is a worthy film because of its visual and poetic beauty. I am very picky about romantic films and loath movies such as 'Titanic' but if the movie has something more than pretty props to offer something that is both visually enticing and lyrical then I am ready to give it my time.".

Knowing nothing about the film except that it's being described as suspensehorror and stars Patrick Wilson and a 14 year old girl I went in expecting another bad to mediocre slash film. I couldn't have been more wrong! Hard Candy is an intense psychological drama with incredible performances by both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. The two actors are practically the only two people with lines in the film aside from some brief appearances by Sandra Oh and Jennifer Holmes. Thusfar I have only seen Wilson in The Alamo and Phantom of the Opera but I was blown away with how he handled this performance. The slow suspenseful film is set mainly in the Los Angeles home of photographer Jeff a 32 year old man whom Hayley a mature 14 year old girl who met him online suspects to be a pedophile. The pacing was steady and phenomenal  after a brief exposition we get into the real suspense about 20 minutes into the film and it doesn't let up from there. The cinematography and camera work went excellently with the film. Rather than being extremely gory the adult themes of the film lead to a more psychological creepiness. There are also questions that remain unanswered until the end of the film when everything is wrapped up nicely  leaving you puzzled to the true identities and motives of the characters throughout most of the duration.Horror films are not my cup of tea but psychological drama is. An early fall release date has been rumored and I can only hope this movie doesn't get lost in the shuffle between summer blockbusters and Oscar season. I also hope Lion's Gate markets this film for what it is and doesn't try to aim for fans of slash or a teen crowd.".

Unfortunately it shouldn't have been Jeff that I was growing to like and possibly love. It should have been Hayley. Here's this little psychotic girl who's running around drugging pedophiles so she can kill them and saying I am every little girl you've ever touched! over and over again. She was a total pain in the ass. I wanted her to die. I wanted Jeff to break free kill her and then go get some therapy to help him quit having sex with children. That shouldn't have been the case. I should have been on Hayley's side which I would have been if she'd actually had a past that allowed me to empathize with her motives.I sat through the whole movie because I truly believed that somewhere in the film a real plot would emerge or some characters would start to develop or someone would cut out Hayley's tongue so she would finally shut up.I loathed this movie.

But Hard Candy doesn't want to be shallow. It wants to be intellectual. And what do you get? A heroine who is as morally reprehensible as her victim. A heroine who spouts references and smart talk beyond her years. This just doesn't wash. Hayley if we can call her that is not really a character she is a just a mouthpiece for Brian Nelson's pretentious dialogue. Her selfsatisfied talk is annoying and unconvincing and is part of the reason why Hard Candy is such an astonishing failure of a film  a fact supported by its dismal Box Office performance. Hayley is simply not a sympathetic character and neither is Jeff and the film's penchant for ambiguity further clouds any sense of background and motive that might justify what is happening in this trashy faux arthouse film. The film also has no sense of irony and subtlety Nelson could have made points about the hypocrisy of Hayley and the rolereversals she undertakes but that would have disrupted the smug dialogue.Hard Candy is also one of the most implausible films committed to celluloid. I am not convinced why Hayley did what she did how far she planned everything to the last detail and what her motives were. The film barely explains why she did what she did save the stilted dialogue at the end which further reinforces the film's desperation to be ambiguous. Even the brief appearance by Sandra Oh as the inquisitive neighbour is an embarrassment. Why didn't she ask about the blood on Hayley's forehead? The script is to busy being smart to gloss over such inconsistencies. The acting is also very annoying especially Ellen Page who was a bit onedimensional in her role. Avoid this nasty amoral little film.".

Then he gets out from his chain after the operation and it seems like it was easy. So why he did not get out before? Then at the door with the Asian woman she loses her wits suddenly?

That's the one point that I gave this horrible piece of work. Never have the words an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back been more deserved.However if you are a teenage girl with notions of vigilante vengeance this movie might give you some confidence since she superhumanly pulls it off with barely a scratch. You wonder why this child genius is not working for the police already since she is able to solve a crime weeks before the homicide unit can.Since the girl is 14 there is no nudity no sex relatively little violence not even much swearing. I don't know why this thing is rated R except to fool people into thinking it might be some kind of suspense thriller. It is clearly a PG13 and is safe for teens to watch...If Haley really wanted to torture Jeff she should have just shown him this film. He would have admitted anything at that point.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was about the most uncomfortable disturbing film I have seen in a long time. It has just been released in France September 2006. The acting was is places very good even excellent but making a 14yearold into a brilliant revenge killer for a pedophile does not send an acceptable message. In fact any male who sits through the castration scene could not possibly emerge with any empathy whatsoever for the girl! There is extreme moral confusion here and the pedophile is actually a more sympathetic character than the girl. Even so the movie lets her win and one can easily imagine a series of sequels in which she forces any number of evil men to do themselves in. Apparently as with many other films the idea of personal extralegal revenge still has appeal for some people even though it represents reversion to a method a addressing evil which has caused untold suffering throughout human history. I maintain that the film is immoral as well as revolting. I advise my friends not even to think of seeing it. I don't think I have ever felt so strongly against a film in my life I'm 64 years old.".

	schema:headline " A poor attempt to be controversial...";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing so many controversial films made outside of Hollywood this attempt at shock cinema comes across as flat and somewhat uninteresting. Remember all the home invasion trash that Hollywood was spewing out in the late 80's into the 90's? Films like Fatal Attraction Hand That Rocks the Cradle Single White Female etc. These were all entertaining and fun to watch once. But they are not considered 'great cinema'. The controversial topic of pedophilia is used here in an exploitative way to mask the fact that Hard candy is just another trashy 'home invasion' type film only without the artistic style that some of those other films had. A teenage girl manipulates a man in his 30's into trusting her and inviting her into his home where she can turn the tables on him a guy who Hayley suspects is a child molester. Jeff the man played by Patrick Wilson takes a drink offered to him by Hayley Ellen Page. Of course the drink is drugged and Jeff wakes up tied to a chair. Original huh?Thus begins a series of very predictable cat and mouse games involving scenario after tired scenario of events that we have seen played out many times before. A big problem with this film is that we can't care about any of these people Jeff is a creepy but boring photographer who likes to photograph young girls and talk to them on the internet. He has no problem with taking home a girl Hayley's age and giving her alcohol and letting her disrobe for a sleazy 'photo shoot.' Will Hayley kill this creep or castrate him? Who really cares? And although Hayley is a teenager she is way WAY too tough and too smart to ever become a victim of a sexual predator. In fact she is more informed on the subject of predators and perverts than most adults. Also she is extremely jaded cold and calculating to ever elicit sympathy from the viewer. In fact she was horrible. If she found herself in contact with a possible child molester than she should have simply called the police. But if she had done that than this stupid movie could not have been made. Truthfully this 'little girl' has so horrid that by the end of the film I was hoping that Jeff would break free from his restraints and give her a good beating! Hard Candy depends far too much on it's 'shocking' subject matter to get attention. So much so that it seems that little thought was put into the actual making of this film. Especially considering the fact that it is not shocking at all. Hollywood has a way of watering down these taboo subjects to make the material suitable for mainstream consumption. From beginning to end it is poorly and unimaginatively shot. Most of the film takes place in a very bland house. It features not one single frame of creative or artistic camera work or editing in it's entire running time. Ellen Page although a competent actress became less believable as the angry vengeful teenager as the film went on. And the character Jeff didn't come across as a particularly 'bad guy' or a 'good guy' for that matter. When a film features only two main characters for it's entire running time than these characters need to be developed beyond the onedimensional portrayals seen here. Some of the dialog was cringeinducing and the ending was pretty unbelievable. I think that the viewers that found this to be a good film or a shocking film have never ventured out of the 'mainstream'. They have never heard of directors like Augustin Villaronga or even Gregg Araki. There are films that touch on similar subjects in a way that make this Hollywood trash look like an absolute comedy in comparison. There is even a more accessible film dealing with this 'vengeful Lolita' subject matter A seldom seen little gem called Poison Ivy featuring Drew Barrymore as a young vixen who uses her seductive nature to destroy a dysfunctional family. It might be a bit trashy but it is quite atmospheric and beautiful to look at. At least that film doesn't pretend to be something other than what it is and Poison Ivy actually gives more insight into the mind of a teenager who has some mental problems that are manifested through her overt sexuality. But the character of 'Ivy' is somehow sympathetic and easier to understand and to feel something for. Hayley from 'Hard Candy' is as cold and unfeeling as the movie itself. It might sound inappropriate to compare an 'exploitationtype' film like Poison Ivy with Hard Candy but actually Hard Candy is a trash film masquerading as a more legitimate work. Do not be fooled by the sleek production values here the film is exploitation little more. 'Hard Candy' is strictly 'bythe numbers' thriller material trying to appear like an important issue film. It uses a touchy subject to attract viewers Pedophelia. And that is exploitation. It worked with me. When I read about this one I just had to see it. I regret wasting my time here. But this is a Hollywood film so I should not have expected more. You shouldn't either.".

	schema:headline " Hard Candy is a powerful and disturbing look at people we meet on the Internet.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hard Candy is about a teenage girl named Hayley Ellen Page who likes to surf the web and explore internet dating like most normal teenagers. The film opens up with an instant message chat between Hayley and a much older guy named Jeff Patrick Wilson. Jeff and Hayley plan to meet up later that day where their meeting turns into an unexpected series of events. A very intense psychological drama ensues I just got back from an advanced screening of Hard Candy at the Philadelphia Film Festival. And let me be the first to say this movie was remarkable. The idea behind this film is so powerful and disturbing at the same time. This movie focuses on two people Hayley who is a 14 year old girl and a 30 something pedophile named Jeff. A movie's subject matter is something that is a serious issue in the world and I think this movie takes the idea of it to a new and unique level.During this film I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. You watch with amazement as this little teenage girl who seems so innocent really controls the entire situation. She is smart and has planned everything and anything and the film flows together so nicely. Even though Hayley isn't an overly likable character I was cheering her on throughout the whole film. She was such an intelligent and wicked character who seemed to be just sickened by pedophiles.Another thing which was very interesting about this film was that it actually relied more on the facial expressions and dialog then on actual images. There is one part in the film which is extremely disturbing and is something I never seen in a film before. The scene involves Hayley doing an operation to say it in an inexplicit way. During that scene we never see what's happening but it was spine tingling just seeing the emotions and listening to the dialog of the characters. A powerful scene which was so intense and disturbing I may never forget it.Lastly I liked how even though the film was a very powerful drama the script had some light humor in it as well. The line about Roman Polanski was a classic as well as the whole I'm an honor roll student line. The film is so serious at times it was nice to get a chuckle here and there to allow audiences to take a breather from being pinned to their seats with suspense.Like I previously stated there are only two real characters in this movie those being Hayley and Jeff. Ellen Page does an incredible job and delivers a mindblowing performance. Her character is both demented and likable. Patrick Wilson was great as well. He gave a very interesting and powerful performance as a pedophile who didn't want to admit he had a problem. His emotions during this film were incredible and extremely realistic.Hard Candy was directed by first time filmmaker David Slade. I feel this is a breathtaking and powerful first film about an uneasy subject matter that so few talk about. His unique craft of capturing not only the characters emotions and anger but also the unique camera angles is remarkable. Also the unique scenes of darkness and colors were brilliant. I like the fact that the director didn't make the characters out to be fictional characters but someone who we can meet on a daily basis.The screenplay was written by Brian Nelson who is also a first time screenwriter for a feature film. I normally don't review how I feel about the screenplay but this one was so unique and daring that I feel I have to. The way the script develops the characters is amazing and how the film actually has a real ending instead of one of those copout choose your own ending films that so many people are using nowadays. What the film does is leaves everything at the end open to discussion. Why did Hayley do what she did? Who is Hayley really and so forth. It's an incredible screenplay that Mr. Nelson should be extremely proud of.Bottom Line Hard Candy was such an amazing film with powerful intense scenes and great acting. The script is extremely fresh and takes the idea of a pedophile film to a new level. This film allows its audience to think and also be shocked by what's going on during the film. It's not a movie for those who like lighthearted films or films that are completely resolved in the end. Hard Candy is really one of those mind fck films that when you leave the theater you just want to talk about what just happened. It's a remarkable film that will stay with me for many weeks to come.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Hard Candy is a 910. A powerful yet disturbing film that touches on a subject matter that is constantly being ignored in our world but be warned this film is definitely not for the weak hearted crowd.".

I like the fact that the director didn't make the characters out to be fictional characters but someone who we can meet on a daily basis.The screenplay was written by Brian Nelson who is also a first time screenwriter for a feature film. I normally don't review how I feel about the screenplay but this one was so unique and daring that I feel I have to. The way the script develops the characters is amazing and how the film actually has a real ending instead of one of those copout choose your own ending films that so many people are using nowadays. What the film does is leaves everything at the end open to discussion. Why did Hayley do what she did? Who is Hayley really and so forth. It's an incredible screenplay that Mr. Nelson should be extremely proud of.Bottom Line Hard Candy was such an amazing film with powerful intense scenes and great acting. The script is extremely fresh and takes the idea of a pedophile film to a new level. This film allows its audience to think and also be shocked by what's going on during the film. It's not a movie for those who like lighthearted films or films that are completely resolved in the end. Hard Candy is really one of those mind fck films that when you leave the theater you just want to talk about what just happened. It's a remarkable film that will stay with me for many weeks to come.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Hard Candy is a 910. A powerful yet disturbing film that touches on a subject matter that is constantly being ignored in our world but be warned this film is definitely not for the weak hearted crowd.";

	schema:reviewBody "I give this a 3 out of 10 just for a 2 seconds of accidental humor and the one twist which i sort of liked until the movie ended and I realized Hey! That made no friggin sense. This movie is unbelievable the actress overacts her part and the pedophile is such a complete friggin idiotmoron I can't even understand it. Seriously who crawls at someone with a scalpel in plain sight. I found that more funny and sad then suspenseful. And the Circumcision how did she know he was going to escape? The bonds were obviously not meant to let him escape or he would've successfully done it the first time. There's no real hero in the movie just an villain who they try and make you sympathize and an antihero who's more sadistic then anything else. For those of you who haven't seen this movie let me put up a rough synopsis.1. Girl and guy setting up meeting in person over instant messenger. thats right the first five minutes of character development is all instant messenging...WOO.... 2. Girl and guy meet up for coffee and you have to think this is the dumbest girl ever.3. Girl talks the guy into going back to his place to listen to some stupid no name band.4. After drinking the girl slips the guy a roofie and ties him upthats where they present the fact he's some kind of child molesterkiddie porn peddler 5. Guy tied to a rolling chair watches as girl rambles for what seems like ever finally getting to the conclusion she's going to trash his house looking for evidence against him.6. During the search girl finds a loaded gun under the bed and sets it on top.7. She finds his safe and gets the combination the guy watches as she opens it and when she gets close enough he kicks her in the head. the scene is so ridiculous looking I couldn't stop laughing. Its sorta like in anchorman where jack black punts baxter.8. Guy grabs gun but as soon as he gets...sorry rolls back into the living room she is nowhere to be found.9. Girl jumps out of dark corner wsaran wrap and suffocates him mobstyle while he misses with just one shot. you think the neighbours down the block would here 10. Girl ties him to table and tells him she's going to castrate him. This is where i see the funniest acting face in all my life. Check out the guys look when she's explaining it to him.11. During the long and drawn out scenea lot of these in this movie the guy is castrated. She leaves him saying she's going to go take a shower and then leave forever.12. OK now the guy somehow musters the strength to escape the table and guess what? She had only put a binderclip over his balls! It was all a ruse. Wow I didn't know binderclips felt like castration. Anyways..13. Guy grabs a scalpel off the table and heads to the shower to um...lacerate her.14. Oh my god a step ahead of him again! Somehow she was hiding behind the door with a tazer. Personally if it were me i would've escaped before I thought i'd been castrated...but thats just me.15. Anyway she goes and uses the phone after she zaps him in the tub but you see her walking around and this guy is in plain view crawling very pathetically by the way down the hall towards her. No joke its the dumbest looking thing i've ever seen.16. So she tazers him again and he passes out.17. Next thing we know he's hanging from the ceiling and she's telling him if he kills himself she'll destroy the evidence he found. He proceeds to mountstrangle her and escapes from the noose. He grabs a nice and chases her onto the roof where she says she's called his long lost love and if he hangs himselfconveniently a noose on the roof too she'll destroy all the evidence and his old girl won't know jack.18. You know what the guy does? He hangs himself? Its the worst ending to a movie ever. You never find out what the girls real name is she just wanders off in this red pseudored riding hood outfit. Only time you see it in the whole movie. This is a film which should've definitely been left for Lifetime. Only the bipolar could truly appreciate it. Anyways hope you enjoyed my review. Please god don't watch this.".

She turns out to be a kind of avenger for all pedophiles victims and ends up by castrating him and pushing him to hang himself. It's a good idea to have the alleged pedophile played by a young attractive actor but that's about it. Things I found annoying the girl was so infuriating that I would have liked to see her choke on one of her many wisecracks like Grace Kelly in Dial M for Murder or Gwyneth Paltrow in just about any film they are righteous and beautiful but boy you just wanna squash them like flies. Why do you have to spoil what could be a thought provoking film with irony and smartass film references? I do not condone child molestation but I am very very suspicious of teenage girls from Lolita onwards I am a woman in case you're wondering violence is always wrong but is it always violence? What about statutory rape? Isn't this some kind of a legal oxymoron? Ultimately I would have appreciated a little more exploration of the grey areas that surround the concept of child sexuality and of the boundaries attached to the idea of selfservice justice. I think a little less petulance and sarcasm and a little more empathy and silence would have helped... And by the way the cinematography was excellent but so what? Any MTV director worth his salt could do the same or better. Conclusion a missed opportunity.".

Though it is not one to recommend for Family Night Hard Candy offers an intriguing onetime viewing thanks to the effectiveness of its twoman show approach. Let's make that a oneman onegirl show. I don't need a rash of emails reminding me of my chauvinism.What the filmmakers have done is said Hey Patrick Wilson! Ellen Page! We're placing the two of you in a restricted space and putting the entire movie on your shoulders. Best of luck! Granted I'm paraphrasing but this is no exaggeration. There are a total of five people in the movie and only Wilson and Page are given more than five minutes of screen time. Given this challenge the two thespians more than hold their own.I don't know if Wilson should take this as a compliment but he's very convincing as a dangerously innocentseeming pedophile. What makes him so creepy is his charm. He's a smooth suave sexual predator. Most young girls are smart enough to do wind sprints the moment they see a dirty unkempt man who looks to be carrying more diseases than Paris Hilton.But Wilson is a goodlooking successful photographer. He can't be bad right? You look older than you are and you certainly act older than you are he tells Hayley perfectly manipulating her young fragile emotions. And hey he can't be dangerous. After all he obviously has the most innocent of intentions! Why else would he reassure her that he's aware of the legal boundaries? She's puddy in his hands.This all starts quietly enough but once they get to his house gears are shifted and everything goes haywire. That's all I'm revealing regarding the story but I do have to give kudos to Ms. Page who turns in an impressive performance. I did feel she was a bit too precocious and worldwise at times but she still does a great job showcasing a wide range of emotions of this potential young victim.Despite the interesting concept of the twoperson show it clearly has its limitations. At 103 minutes this is just way too long. After a while it becomes too obvious that certain scenes and lines of dialogue are like most songs on recent Rolling Stones albums inserted for no other reason than to serve as filler. The worst example being a scene involving Sandra Oh's neighbor character. The only purpose it serves is to deliver a little faux drama. That subplot is dropped faster than Britney Spears' baby never to be heard from again.Hard Candy refuses to send you prancing home with a smile on your face or a song in your heart but if nothing else it serves as a strong warning that you should probably pay close attention to who your kids are communicating with online. At least warn them that sometimes the person they least suspect could be the one to be most wary of.A quick word of warning to all you guys there is one particular scene where what we perceive is happening will absolutely make you squirm in your seat. You'll most likely watch it through squinted eyes. I haven't felt that uncomfortable at the theater since the My Own Private Idaho fiasco. I suggest you be prepared.".

Not to be outdone by the young star Patrick Wilson gave an excellent performance. The whole movie was a twisted roller coaster of not knowing who to believe.

I almost puked and I was hardly able to finish it. It's far more worse and disgusting than e.g. Misery that IS rated as horror  if this movie was rated like that meaning being rated correctly I wouldn't even watch it.Second This movie is about a sick mad twisted insane fourteen year old girl who both psychically and physically tortures a guy for almost all the duration of the movie. In the end it's revealed that he's a pedo who somewhat participated on raping a girl or what and that this insane girl just took justice in her hands but what she does to him should not be done to any person on this planet. Not ever OMFG. I feel so sick now. Still shaking.And even after seeing the end of the movie when they reveal what terrible thing he did and who he actually was I still felt actually sorry for him after what he endured  and I still think that the girl was twisted weird and insane. My advice Do NOT even bother watching this movie  ...unless you feel like a stupid twisted Bstyle psycho horror with almost no point and no logic but lots of tension and many pointles atrocious blood scenes. If it at least had an interesting ending... but what happens is just predictable  I expected that from almost the very beginning. I am still asking myself  why the hell did I actually watch this sick piece of unpleasantly scary pointless crap?The one and only good? thing about the movie is acting. Feels very realistic and true. TOO REALISTIC actually as for my taste in this kind of genre...".

The story as a whole follows suit as ridiculous failures of logic and underdeveloped red herrings quickly strain the story's credibility to a breaking point. This midway point a frustrating copout is but the first of a series of twists and turns that needlessly convolute and frustrate rather than introduce any new ideas.

But what made those films successful was the sparseness of their dialogue which forced them to let raw moods and actions speak for themselves.

Trust me sure you've seen dumb thrillers but this one is unique in many ways.Nowadays in the AGE OF Paris HILTON anything is possible whether in reality or fiction. If you think the Saw movies are cretinous you ought to check this piece of crap out. A 14 yearold girl wreaks revenge on a criminal pedophile and she does so by becoming Charles Bronson James Bond and Bruce Lee. Take your pick. Oh yeah I nearly forgot and she is Nostradamus as well the way she predicts and knows everything in advance.The first  and main  twist comes about 15 minutes into the movie the girl has lured the pedophile into a trap not the other way around. You think that's dumb? Hang on. She talks and thinks like an adult having had her lines written by someone who has obviously never met a 14 yearold girl much less spoken to her. I dare anyone to find a 14 yearold girl who talks and thinks like this! So anyway she drugs the guy and then talks to him.And talks. And talks. And talks.And then suddenly we have some MTVstyle action! So strange.And then there is more talk. More lecturing from the girl. She chastises him for being a pedophile  which is all well and fine  but she does so like an ADULT. And that is what is really annoying i.e. unrealistic and utterly absurd about the movie. Plus she goes on and on.Then she castrates him. Now the way she does it  apart from being very unrealistic  i.e. her behaviour during the whole procedure indicates that the girl has to be psychotic. Her behaviour is psychopathic throughout the movie she is a good actor enjoys torture is charming and so on. All the traits of a psychopathic serialkiller.In the end she makes him VOLUNTARILY hang himself! All the humanity! All the stupidity! This is supposed to be a revenge movie but revenge movies are supposed to be fun. This isn't fun. The feeling one gets is that the girl is such a psychopath and yes 14 yearold psycho girls with the education of a college professor ARE rare  another dumb aspect of the silly characterization that she will eventually kill a whole bunch of people some innocent ones too. Psychopaths don't normally dish out moral poetic justice. They kill moreorless randomly. Terrible characterization. As if though those morons De Palma or Stephen King came up with this ridiculous character.And because the writer must have sensed how farfetched the girl's character is he makes her say I'm an honour student about 50 times. As if her being an honour student could explain the absurd levels of her maturity knowledge physical abilities and even psychic abilities! Check out that dumb scene one of MANY when the guy frees himself after castration and the way she surprises him in the shower! Oh how I laughed! Now I am the last person to oppose castrating pedophiles especially dangerous ones but if you want to make a serious movie about this subject then BE serious. Don't use dumb movies like Misery as your inspiration or guide. Make the girl act like a girl not an adult and don't make her into some kind of allpowerful allknowing Terminatorandroid that cannot be destroyed. The movie has completely failed because I was laughing at scenes that were supposed to be exciting.To sum up if you are looking for a movie that seriously and above all  REALISTICALLY  deals with pedophilia do not make the mistake of watching this malarkey. This is just another moronic thriller this time dressed up in indiemovie clothing.I saw this movie just after finishing V For Vendetta another major piece of crap. I think I'm starting to give up hope that there are any good movies made these days.Email me if you want to have my heavily altered subtitle files of crap movies such as Der Untergang and Bergman's Cries  Whispers.".

In it's best moments this film explores the complexities of vengeance and psychology. It tries to be clever by pulling a role reversal  but this eventually wears thin and the dialog becomes didactic and contrived. I still think it is worth seeing for the strength of the leads alone. Patrick Wilson does a fine job as a suspected pedophile. He elicits both sympathy and disgust. Ellen Page as the young girl is absolutely fantastic. Her performance is brilliant and even frightening at times. She's good even when the script can't match her talent. I look forward to seeing her in many films to come. Finally a young actress who is more than just a pretty face  I'm so tired of the Natalie Portmans the Hillary Duffs and the Jessica Albas of the world. Good luck with your career Ms. Page.All in all Hard Candy is worth seeing. Maybe I'm just a sucker for movies with tiny casts and realtime pacing. But there are some genuinely suspenseful moments in the film although in the hands of lesser actors these scenes would disintegrate. And though I was annoyed by the contrivances and implausibilities of the script I found myself the next day thinking about some of the issues raised therein.At times Hard Candy reminded me of Polanski's Death and the Maiden though H.C. is nowhere near as good. Ellen Page's Haley character is similar to Sigourney Weaver's character in the Polanski film. Both women are terrifying through the cold precision of their revenge. The problem with the Haley character is that she would have to be supernatural to accomplish the things she does in this film. And of course if she was supernatural we'd have a completely different film on our hands  High Plains Drifter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tomorrow is Forever is a typical example of the type of films that came out of the Hollywood of the 40s. This seems to have been brought to the screen as a vehicle for Claudette Colbert one of the most admired actresses of that era. Under the direction of Irving Pichel we get a wonderful account of a woman whose husband is killed during the last days of WWI. The music score by Max Steiner enhances the film although it feels obtrusive at times.Claudette Colbert was a prolific star of all the melodramas that were tailor made for her to shine. Her Elizabeth Hamilton in this film is a typical role she and other actresses played during that era. Tomorrow is Forever is interesting because of Orson Welles' appearance as the supposedly dead husband that returns under a different disguise.Today's audiences don't have patience to deal with what for the movie going public in the early days were able to allow in the reality department. Some negative comments to this forum express that viewpoint but in spite of them films like this will always be immensely rewarding for those fans that feel comfortable with the plots created for this type of movies.Claudette Colbert makes a wonderful Elizabeth. Orson Welles was the real surprise in the dramatic role that Ms. Colbert championed for him at a time of his life that he wasn't recognized for his genius. George Brent a reliable actor is seen as one of the decent men he played in films. Lucile Watson as Aunt Jessie is an asset. The young Richard Long plays Drew the eldest son that has no clue who his father really is but grows up believing the kind Lawrence is his dad. Natalie Wood as the young German girl Margaret showed a talent for stealing scenes from much established actors.This is a film to be cherished by people who love the genre.".

The music score by Max Steiner enhances the film although it feels obtrusive at times.Claudette Colbert was a prolific star of all the melodramas that were tailor made for her to shine. Her Elizabeth Hamilton in this film is a typical role she and other actresses played during that era. Tomorrow is Forever is interesting because of Orson Welles' appearance as the supposedly dead husband that returns under a different disguise.Today's audiences don't have patience to deal with what for the movie going public in the early days were able to allow in the reality department. Some negative comments to this forum express that viewpoint but in spite of them films like this will always be immensely rewarding for those fans that feel comfortable with the plots created for this type of movies.Claudette Colbert makes a wonderful Elizabeth. Orson Welles was the real surprise in the dramatic role that Ms. Colbert championed for him at a time of his life that he wasn't recognized for his genius. George Brent a reliable actor is seen as one of the decent men he played in films. Lucile Watson as Aunt Jessie is an asset. The young Richard Long plays Drew the eldest son that has no clue who his father really is but grows up believing the kind Lawrence is his dad. Natalie Wood as the young German girl Margaret showed a talent for stealing scenes from much established actors.This is a film to be cherished by people who love the genre.";

	schema:headline " Reason NOT Overwhelmed by Sentiment";
	schema:reviewBody "I am stunned to see the vast majority of commentators describe this great film as typical sentimental and melodramatic. That is to completely overlook the various philosophical and psychological aspects of the movie. Isolationism. Pacifism. Opposition to global hegemony and tyranny. All of these are at the essence of the dialog and the story. The need for humans to deny the temptation to live in the past and to embrace the future is the core of the movie  in addition to its TITLE. Reason must overcome emotionalism.That is made especially apparent in the scene where Kessler Orson Welles implicitly compares Mrs. Hamilton Claudette Colbert to his young charge Margaret Natalie Wood. While Mrs. Hamilton lost her husband on another continent the Nazis murdered Margaret's parents right before her eyes. She is terrified by a popper because it causes her to relive the sound of bullets the smell of gunpowder and the sight of blood  her parents' blood. Kessler gently coaxes Margaret into pulling the string on a second popper to prove that she doesn't need to be a victim of her fears. She can learn that it is not dangerous but a mere toy. She can overcome.The climactic scene between Kessler and Mrs. Hamilton is equally fabulous. The tension steadily mounts as Mrs. Hamilton presses Kessler to admit that he is her husband. Until his direct denial the dialog is so sublime that it makes sense whether delivered by the woman's lost husband or by Mr. Kessler. But it is not sentimental. To the contrary Kessler's powerful philosophical arguments and psychological insights compel Mrs. Hamilton to reassess her life and come to the realization that it has been is and promises to be good. To throw that away for a memory would be sheer sentimental folly. Embrace the good life you have is the very clear message.Generally the acting is superb however in particular this is possibly Orson Welles' finest performance. There are no obvious doubletakes or overlylong stares that are dead giveaways in most films that deal with a character with a hidden identity. This is a fabulously subtle performance. Welles' makeup is a little obvious and theatrical but is not a distraction.In an incredible  and incredibly overlooked  performance Natalie Wood convincingly portrays a young Austrian girl who speaks German as her native tongue has lost both parents to Nazi violence and is suddenly thrust into a strange new country. Her performance is one of the best juvenile performances in all American cinema. The Max Steiner score is also very good although I wish it had been a little more sub rosa. Just turning down the volume of the score to make it a little more subtle would have improved the film a little. However it beautifully captures the mood of each scene.This movie has layers upon layers. It contains paradoxes and ironies that are profound enough for real reflection. The characters provide profound contrasts in philosophy and psychology. The device of having a husband apparently die but in actuality refuse to return home because of his broken condition provides ample opportunity for sentimentality. But that device is merely the springboard for a much richer exploration of the meaning of life and our place in the world. To fail to recognize this is to minimize this fabulous film and miss its point.".

Max Steiner's score is almost nonstop to such an extent that it can probably rank as one of the busiest background scores he ever wrote if not the most distinguished. He lays it on a bit thick at times along with the mounting soapsuds.Having said that don't be discouraged from watching the film. Orson Welles may have made his name on CITIZEN KANE but here he truly shows his artistry as a character actor after only a brief glimpse of him as his younger self in a flashback. Director Irving Pichel draws a rich complex performance from him that has to be one of the best he ever gave throughout the '40s. Richard Long does nicely as the young man who is really his son and Lucille Watson is excellent as Claudette's mother in law.

	schema:reviewBody "Rather unsung but worthwhile this tearjerking wartime drama will entrance some viewers while unintentionally amusing others. Colbert plays a young newlywed whose husband Welles goes off to fight in WWI. He is severely injured refuses to come home to her or even give his name to authorities and is presumed dead. Pregnant and alone she relies on her employer Brent and his aunt Watson and before long agrees to wed Brent who is very much in love with her. Flashforward twenty years and Colbert and Brent have two sons the first one actually Welles' though this is kept secret. Welles crippled aged bearded wearing thick glasses and sporting an even thicker accent comes to town to work for Brent never dreaming that his former wife is now Brent's spouse. Just as Colbert has finally found a degree of happiness and has nearly forgotten Welles whom she loved deeply WWII threatens to break out and her eldest son Long is eager to go and fight! The film details the questions mysteries and miseries of Welles and Colbert as they encounter each other again after two decades. Unabashedly sentimental and hearttugging it is likely to please fans of tearjerkers while causing the eyes of pragmatists to roll feverishly. Colbert is lovely and exceedingly good in her role. It's always distracting in hindsight to view Colbert's films and observe the way she refuses to allow herself to be shot from her right side but she's not as bad about that here as in some other films. Welles is mercilessly hammy and is buried under some truly horrendous age makeup. He goes way overboard in virtually every area yet somehow it works to the film's benefit! Brent already one of the most wooden of actors is made even more so by the presence of Welles but it's a nice contrast. Long has a particularly good early role even if he hadn't quite grown into his nose at this point! He is given a strong sizable role for an actor his age. The alwaysreliable and entertaining Watson gives solid support. One of the greatest things about the film however is the utterly adorable and memorably adept presence of Wood as Welles' adopted daughter. Impossibly articulate inhumanly precious and achingly touching in her role as a war orphan she is a thorough delight. It was her first major role and she handles it with surprising poise and assurance. Her older sister instructed her on how to cry during the film suggesting that she recall a ghastly accident she had witnessed involving her dog being hit by a car. It's very poignant to see her dainty little fingers helping Welles unbutton his vest knowing that her life would later end so tragically. Working alongside Welles no doubt helped prep her for her famed role opposite Edmund Gwenn in Miracle of 34th Street one year later.".

I cried during most of the movie the first time I saw it.  There are also wonderful performances by George Brent and young Natalie Wood.  Tomorrow Is Forever is a movie you need to see at least once!  It's great!";

This film is a clinic on dialog.The acting was great across the board but the direction story script and casting were especially good. It was a tightly woven story and an unusual one at that.Wells put in his best performance. Could it have been better maybe but the way he delivered those heart rending lines...........well maybe it couldn't have been much better. His deep rich voice together with the tenderness wisdom and compassion. Well it doesn't get much better. People who didn't appreciate that have not actually experienced life yet.

	schema:reviewBody "This powerful and heartwrenching melodrama takes its strength from the intensity and honesty of the central performance by Claudette Colbert who makes the whole thing believable despite various story weaknesses and implausibilities. Orson Welles and George Brent are both very effective in the other lead roles though Brent has little do but be sympathetic and attentive which he always did very well in films whereas Welles has to do some serious acting. This is a story of the wreckage of private lives caused by wars. The extreme situation portrayed here may have been rare but such things must have happened occasionally. It is incredible to think that this important film has never been released on DVD. I had to acquire it on an old VHS video. The story concerns a young husband Welles at the time of the First World War who 'surprises' his wife Colbert one day at their comfortable home in Baltimore by putting on a uniform and announcing that he is going off to War. As we all now know this kind of behaviour was common at the time when all the young men didn't have any idea what they were getting into and thought it would all be over by Christmas. So he went off to fight in Europe and Colbert got a telegram informing her of her husband's death. She was pregnant and was looked after by George Brent who fell in love with her and married her. But the problem is that Welles was not dead at all he had lost his dogtags in the trenches and ended up in a German hospital for months with terrible facial scars and severe wounds. Having been as he imagined permanently and severely deformed he opted not to return home and impose such a humiliation on his wife. Instead he decided to remain 'dead stayed on in Austria and became a Germanspeaking chemist named Dr. Koestler assuming this false identity and new life with the aid of his Austrian doctor who employed him. But 20 years later the Germans having taken over Austria Welles with a desperate limp and a beard had to flee after his mentor was murdered by the Nazis. He brought with him a charming little orphan girl who had seen both of her parents murdered by the Nazis also. This little girl is played by the seven yearold Natalie Wood in her first genuine acting role she had made brief uncredited cameo appearances in two previous films playing for instance a little girl who drops an ice cream cone no big acting job there. It is strange to think that I am writing this in era when so few people now remember who the amazing Natalie Wood was. Her early death at 43 cut short her career. But she was one of the leading young female stars of her generation. See for instance my review of her in THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED 1966. Altogether she made 66 films in her short life and is probably best remembered for WEST SIDE STORY 1961 GYPSY 1962 and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE 1955. Her most characteristic whimsically smiling expression particularly around the eyes is to be seen here when she was still a tiny child. In the part she speaks very good German with a decent accent. Wood was from a Russian immigrant family and her parents barely spoke English. There will never be another Natalie Wood. Well Welles and Wood he pretends she is his daughter to get her through customs make their way to America where Welles has secured a post as a chemist in his old home town of Baltimore to see how the land lies there as he no longer has his life in Austria. He goes back to the old house and sees that it is empty. But before long he comes face to face with Colbert who does not recognise him as well as his 20 yearold son by her who does not even know that Brent is not his father. In fact ironically it is Brent who is now Welles's employer because he owns the chemical company. Welles continues to pretend to be Koestler but it is difficult for him. He becomes increasingly involved in the family affairs of his former wife and his son and slowly she begins to suspect that he may really be her exhusband. Colbert convincingly portrays the profound emotional agony of this impossible situation and Welles heroically continues to insist he is someone else while Colbert's belief that he is her original husband becomes stronger and stronger. Meanwhile Welles is forced to intervene in a tense emotional situation regarding his son who of course doesn't realize that he is his son. This all becomes increasingly fraught and we don't know what is going to happen and I'm not going to tell.".

After her husband John's death in the first world war Elizabeth Colbert finds out she's pregnant. She ultimately makes a new life for herself with Lawrence Brent and together they have a daughter. Lawrence raises the son Long as his own. When Dr. Kessler Welles a scientist working with her husband first appears at their home Elizabeth doesn't realize it's John who never returned to the U.S. because of his crippling debilitating war wounds. He has a young child with him Margaret Wood who it turns out is the child of his late doctor and his wife.This is a beautifully done movie in every respect including Max Steiner's music though a little strong at times and holds the viewer's interest throughout. Colbert is lovely as a tormented woman who has to deal with the prospect of her son going off to war as his father did  and perhaps never returning. Her scene as she comes downstairs and sees Dr. Kessler for the first time is wonderful. Something about him startles and unnerves her immediately and it's apparent on her face. Two young actors who died too young  Richard Long and Natalie Wood  also appear in the Tomorrow is Forever. Handsome Long who would find success in television makes a good impression in his first film. Wood a blond here is absolutely adorable and very accomplished speaking German and then English with a German accent.Orson Welles is an actor whose magnificent presence acting technique and voice allowed him to basically phone in most roles  his whole purpose in movie acting was to make money for his film projects  but obviously Irving Pinchot didn't accept a phonein from him. Welles gives a very touching and believable performance as both young John and the older ill Dr. Kessler. Living in the past will not bring back what you had he tells Elizabeth only destroy what you have. A wonderful wonderful movie. Have a box of tissues nearby.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a deeply moving story with superb acting although I didn't reach for the Kleenex. I would call it a very difficult lesson in life to be learned about letting go of the past and thinking of present values and the future instead  reaching forward to the positive in life and releasing the past  something not everyone is prepared to do.It is of a young couple Elizabeth and John Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles who are abruptly parted by the duty of John's service in the First War. He is injured badly and while wrapped in facial bandages in hospital he makes the decision not to notify next of kin and drop out of his young wife's life because he feels he could never be the same man again at least to her. So he is presumed dead. Meanwhile back home she has been notified of this tragic news and manages to deal with it bravely even though she is going to have his child. Lawrence George Brent steps into her life to assist then eventually they marry and create a reasonably happy life together.A weakness in the film that challenges us is that John's features were not altered so very much in the movie after his war injuries and the required facial surgery. I think more could have been done on this point to give the film greater credibility. Basically a beard was added and graying hair to camouflage his appearance but ... I mean if you've known someone so well it's wellnigh impossible to mistake their tone of voice or expression of the eyes ... so I had trouble getting over this shortcoming.Twenty years later in the unfolding story it becomes indeed a razor's edge on which to tread when former wife Elizabeth again encounters John who is now known as Erik Kessler middle aged graying and has difficulty getting around. He has reentered her life as an Austrian chemist brought to America to advise the firm which her husband operates! Small world at times no? However that's the story.There is a great deal of reminiscing done by Elizabeth as she recalls touching moments from her time with John and shows us how easy it is to look back longingly at memories of the past. But now after nineteen years of their estrangement reality has set in for both Elizabeth has a family to care for a present obligation which takes precedence and John too has the responsibility of a young adopted daughter Margaret Natalie Wood.So while every ensuing meeting brings them closer to the truth of their former relationship it is a very thin line indeed that separates them from the possibility of true recognition of each other and the memories of bygone days. Each encounter seems to bring more remembrance that neither of them can fully accept but for different reasons.I found the dialog most intriguing on several levels. It reminded me of the scales of Justice which are finely weighed for both sides yet never truly balanced. John now known as the elderly Erik Kessler talked of the future's promise that lay ahead for Elizabeth of how she had a good life in the present and was needed by others. Here again he nobly steps aside so that she will have a more fulfilling life although he won't be part of it as he has so little to offer or so he reasons. He points out to her that the memories of the past she holds are really of the good times and can never be recreated in the present for life has changed them both. Interestingly it really does show us that living in the past is somehow a negative phase which never can be changed and that we must take hold of Life in the present and look to the future where there is promise  for tomorrow is forever the past is never.This film expresses some very fine sentiments. Have ordered the book and hope to gain more by giving it a serious reading as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Irving Pichel got so much out of Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert in this movie. Colbert's character is not only believable but strong yet vulnerable too. I never figured Orson Welles would do well in a part like this but he exceeded very convincingly by pulling off one of his better roles. This movie was the debut for Richard Long19 and he was the right person for the role as Claudette Colbert's son. Natalie Wood 8 plays a fine adopted daughter from Europe with an Austrian accent that is quite believable. Two things which really hold this movie together are Irving Pichel's excellent tight directing and Max Steiner's musical score. Pichel is an expert at timing drama and suspense. During the final scene there is no possible way you will leave the screen. Max Steiner always comes up with the right style for his movies and this movie is definitely a showcase for his sensitive score. His use of strings and wind instruments are so wellplaced at the right time and his music provides a thread which enhances the drama and keeps us on track.".

	schema:headline " Updating Enoch Arden";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Lord Tennyson is remembered by most people who like movies because he wrote as George Orwell once said the most stirring poem about warfare concerning a regiment of cavalry that charged the wrong guns. If you see Errol Flynn's THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE Lord Tennyson's lines appear at the conclusion of that film. However he wrote far more than that. On the Rumpole of the Bailey episodes Horace Rumpole Leo McKern would frequently recite Tennyson  he did a marvelous recitation of the magnificent conclusion of Tennyson's Ulysses in one episode. Others have quoted him. Angela Landsbury recites lines from The Lady of Shalott in THE MIRROR CRACKED. I might add that the title of the classiest of British black comedies KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is from Tennyson. One of Tennyson's poems was Enoch Arden which details how a young man goes to sea from his village leaving behind his girlfriend and family is believed to have died at sea and returns twenty years later physically changed but interested in seeing if he can pick up where he left off. He finds it impossible  and decides to die under his assumed name rather than reveal to his loved ones his real identity.This plot has been frequently used in films normally for comic purposes why if the poem is tragic this happened I cannot fathom. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne appeared in MY FAVORITE WIFE back in 1941 with Dunne reappearing with Randolph Scott after having been declared legally dead following a shipwreck. Marilyn Monroe's final film SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE was a remake of MY FAVORITE WIFE. Doris Day also did a similar film. To the best of my knowledge TOMORROW IS FOREVER is the only film based on this plot line that treats it tragically as it should be.As such it is not as successful a movie as MY FAVORITE WIFE was. To begin with Grant and Dunne had screen chemistry which one can tell by their frequent pairing together in WIFE THE AWFUL TRUTH and PENNY SERENADE. One could readily believe Cary and Irene could be a real item. That is not the case in TOMORROW IS FOREVER. Powerful performers that Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert are one cannot quite accept them as a couple. In the film there is an early sequence when we see the young Welles going off to World War I in his doughboy uniform. This is barely acceptable because Welles is in fact ten years of so younger than Colbert. The age difference is too much to accept and spoils receiving them as a genuine couple. This is not totally damaging to the picture as the other scenes they have together Welles is older and physically changed although Colbert keeps wondering if Welles is the young man she married bore a son of and has mourned since 1917. Since they don't have to relate intimately again one can try to forget this failure in casting. But it does make one have to work overtime to accept the rest of the plot.It does not help by the way that a few years before Colbert made a splendid little movie with John Payne called REMEMBER THE DAY wherein they are teachers at a small town high school who marry and who are permanently separated when he is called to World War I by the draft. But that film hid the tragedy of Payne's death until the end and left you with great admiration for Colbert's ability to pull herself together and carry on. Payne who blended in well with Colbert made himself into a reasonably acceptable marriage partner. Welles is just out of the ballpark here.The film is well acted by the cast even the leads although George Brent gives another of his patented drab performances. The young Natalie Wood appears as the daughter of the German doctor who saved Welles whom Welles in turn brings with him to America as war in Europe breaks out again. More interesting is Richard Long playing the grown up son of Welles determined to fight for the U.S. in the coming war despite Colbert's fears. This was his first film too and one suspects that his working with Welles may have been the reason that he was cast as Noah Longstreet Loretta Young's younger brother in THE STRANGER Welles' 1946 film noir about another more sinister European war refugee coming to America.".

What will happen next? This is a very very sentimental film. While some may call it a 'woman's film' I think it's very good all around because of the amazing acting and the nice original plot. Well worth seeing.By the way at one point in the film Richard Long says he's attending the University of Maryland and it used to be just a little medical college. I attended the school and actually it was originally an agricultural school.Also Natalie Wood plays a young German girl in the film. With her odd accent and blonde hair you might miss this.".

Sure this was a surfing documentary similar to Billabong Odyssey and Endless Summer but there were unique aspects I hadn't seen before Lake Michigan surfers riding the tiniest of waves and Texas surfers riding the waves made by huge oil and cargo ships. The film's premise was to show that surfers were everywhere and that the surfing lifestyle meant something more than just an attitude akin to a bad Keanu Reeves impersonation. Surfing means appreciating Mother Nature in her most awesome and dangerous aspect.Though I appreciated having a plot and point however sappy I must say that I missed watching the BIG waves and the BIG tumbles that make you groan out loud or suck in your breath. When it comes to surfing I am every bit the couch potato sportsman and like my fellow couch potatoes I enjoy the game most when the stakes are high. This film lacked the big wave scenes that I love and in the end I can't say I'd truly recommend the film over the others listed above.So instead of boring you with more details I'll make a pledge. I'm going underground to the world of poorly made surfing videos that I've heard so much about. The videos that show the BIG waves and BIGGER tumbles.

Dad had cool shots with good instrumental music and frequent light humor. A pleasant 1 12 hour interlude with no place it had to be that sort of wrapped up whenever. Step Into is a much more polished busier film  louder music with vocals tons of interviews much more a serious documentary about the surfing life. Problem is Dana brings some of dad's elements with him like the constant narration and I don't think it works as a whole. It doesn't take that much to make me happy with a surfing film I adore the recent pure and simple Thicker Than Water 2000. This one just has too much stuff I don't want. I tried watching it again and after a few minutes popped one of dad's old films in the VCR sorry. Because I can't completely knock a movie that lets Gerry Lopez talk and has Laird Hamilton doing 50 foot waves I give it an 8 out of 10.".

A great use of expressions via actual spoken word and cinematography to help people better understand the life of a surfer. You cannot go wrong with Dana Brown showing you the beauty of the world and mixing in a system of believes held by surfers around the globe. If you're like most of us than you probably cannot just get up off the couch and visit Maui but sitting back with drink and watching this film you will have the same experience as being there. Visit's to Australia Chile Maui Ireland and surprisingly Texas give a diverse look into surfing around the globe but the message remains the same. Your loyal Fan Angel".

It had energy and charm thanks mostly to the editor.This mostly misses. And that's because it focuses not on the surfing but the surfers. These guys and gals just aren't very interesting and their ordinariness takes away from the extraordinary potential of the motion adventure.Once we're locked into hearing about these guys we are forced into having to like them and that's a bad strategy for a movie. Only in one episode do we really go with the appeal when some Irish American boys go back to Ireland and teach surfing to kids of mixed backgrounds who naturally enough us all seem the same.I think with iMovie and better music someone could make a better shorter movie of this material. It should be all about the water. In spite of this starting out with the clear announcement no stereotypes it is precisely about stereotypes and the realization that the filmmaker can't see it is a profound weight.Precisely.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Step Into Liquid is one of those rare documentaries about a very specific topic that is able to have a strong effect on the viewer whether or not you can relate much to the topic at hand. That is in fact one mark of a good documentary. Touching the Void also does this very well. The original Endless Summer was before my time although I would have seen it if it wasn't so hard to find since I was so impressed by Endless Summer II which I saw when I was in high school. Many of the people that appeared in those movies also appear in Step Into Liquid enhancing the presentation of the camaraderie that develops between surfing friends.I grew up in southern California minutes away from the beach and I've also lived in England so needless to say I've heard plenty of surfing stereotypes even just from the fact that I come from California. I never got into surfing much mostly snorkeling and bodysurfing and skimboarding but have nevertheless been asked by plenty of Londoners if I make a habit of describing pleasing situations or events with phrases like 'Cowabunga dude' or 'Totally tubular' or if I surf to school. Yes. Of course I do. Everyone in California surfs to school.I didn't expect the movie to approach this topic but I was hugely impressed by the way it told the stories of so many surfers and then summed it all up by saying that 'real surfers don't say 'Dude.' It turns your attention away from the automatic surfer stereotypes which as is also explained were started in large part by movies like Gidget and Fast Times At Ridgemont High and shows you why those stereotypes are so shallow and misled.This never really bothered me because I was never the kind of surfer that you think of when you hear these stereotypes or even the word surfer I was more of a beach bum who was into just about everything else under the sun and on top of the sand except for surfing mainly because I couldn't afford a surfboard. Step Into Liquid however goes to great lengths to show what an intense and moving experience surfing can be regardless of what the waves are like.I think that the most important function of the documentary is that it shows how something like surfing can bring people together. We see professional surfers being towed into 50 and 60 foot waves and surfing at suicidal speed but we also see a man traveling to Vietnam with his teenage son surfing on everything from sand hills to waves less than a foot high while being followed and venerated by hoards of screeching Vietnamese kids. Then you have a group of guys who go surfing in Scotland of all places and bring together kids from northern Scotland with kids from southern Scotland which are separated almost to the point of being separate countries along religious lines with Catholics in the north and Protestants in the south unless it's the other way around.From a technical standpoint I was most impressed with the extent of the effect that they were able to achieve through the almost constant use of slow motion so much for 'no special effects' and the outstanding musical selection on the soundtrack. As a novice filmmaker myself I love to see such simple effects as blending slow motion with certain music because it has such a strong effect and is something that I've used myself dozens of times. This is the kind of movie that makes me want to be a documentary filmmaker.".

I am familiar with Endless Summer I and II but have never seen them. After I had watched the trailer several times I looked to find out when it would be released. Aug 21. In the only digital theater in Oregon to my knowledge. I marked the date on my calendar and waited. When the day arrived My girlfriend and I drove and hour and a half to Portland to see it. It was amazing. What you see on screen are people around the world surfing and enjoying themselves. Guys in the Gulf riding the wake off of super tankers people in Michigan surfing the great lakes. These people are having just as much fun as the pros on what most people wouldn't even consider waves. You hear a few touching stories some excellent music and see some amazing waves. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a soundtrack of any kind in the works. There is some really good music but some of which I can't even track down on CD. Hopefully they will put out a soundtrack. If you don't see this movie at least download the high definition trailer. It alone is gorgeous. I now want to learn how to surf I just may need a wetsuit.".

While all docs are meant to be educational or enlightening it's the rare one that amuses you as well and literally takes you somewhere else like on a mini vacation to exotic locales right from your living room. Dana Brown's narration is wry and informative without being too over the top or wordy never detracting from the drop dead gorgeous scenery the movie provides as we follow various surfers around the world. There's touches of humor here and there and while some of the said surfers are certifiably nuts you don't have to be a long or short boarder to enjoy this film. If you like good alternative tunes amazing locations such as Malibu Ireland Hawai'i etc. then check out this cool little jewel of a documentary.".

Step Into Liquid is fresh slick  exciting. The cinematography is amazing the interviews are engaging and the soundtrack is tight.

The next day Josh finds out that he couldn't reach Tiffany because of a family emergency and is immediately wracked with guilt. Things get more complicated when his knuckleheaded suitemate Barry mistakes the sex tape for a video message to Tiffany which Josh had asked him to drop in the mail.

His two best friendsresident prankster E.L. Sean W. Scott and stonerintellectual Rubin Paul Costanzooffer to come along and help Josh persuade meganerd Kyle D.J. Qualls to let them use his father's car in exchange for a chance to come along for the ride. From that point on 'Road Trip' follows the traditional teen exploitation comedy format though with greater wit and intelligence than should be expected from the genre. Director Todd Phillips manages to give us slapstick grossout comedy while simultaneously poking fun at stereotypes and experiences familiar to anyone who's gone to college psychosorority hazing TAs trying to make undergrad girls alcohol and potrelated shenanigans the nerd breaking bad a hilarious runin at an allblack fraternity houseetc.. Compensating for the adolescent hijinks is the surprisingly smart and thoughtful subplot for Kyle who transforms from nerdy object of derision into the film's most likable and memorable character.In the tradition of 'Animal House' 'Road Trip' is crass and juvenile but irresistibly funny. Not a movie for date night but a good choice for gathering around the tube with bongs brews and bros. An instant joe sixpack classic.".

This comedy pushes the envelope in every aspect and smiles proudly.  Tom Green who gets a pretty small role is the scenestealer. Fans of him will be very impressed.  One moment that had me almost on the floor was the French toast scene with SNL regular Horatio Sanz.  I don't want to give away any of the comedy because that would be a sin.  Just take my word  You will love this movie!  You will not stop laughing!  This is one trip worth taking!".

Big was my surprise when I saw that none of the actors that were in Eurotrip were in Road Trip. I might even say that the two movies have nothing to do with each other except for the fact that both are about students who are about to make a long trip. Did I care? Certainly not I loved this one as well! The story is told by Tom Greene who brings it as some kind of urban legend to future students and their parents who visit the university for the first time. He tells them that three guys went on a trip from Ithaca New York to Austin Texas because they had to retrieve a video cassette. On the tape was supposed to be a video message for the lifelong girlfriend of one of them but instead it features him in bed with another girl. Of course someone has send the tape to her by accident and now he'll have to get it back before she sees it...What you'll get to see is an hilarious movie that it has to be said isn't all too original. It follows the typical guidelines for teen comedies but does it all very well. Even though it is irresistibly funny I loved Eurotrip a little bit more. I gave that one an 8 and Road Trip a 7.510. Nevertheless this is still one of those movies to see if you are with some buddies.".

	schema:reviewBody "You have to thank Something About Mary and American Pie for doing what they did.  These are two movies that came along and were bold enough to try something different. Those films  included raunchy jokes crude humour nudity and they had the audacity to poke fun at everyone call them the Quentin Tarantino of comedies.  Before American Pie you had some ALMOST good films with Can't Hardly Wait and 10 Things I Hate About You.  They were good but not quite good enough to be mentioned in the same breath as Animal House and Porky's and such.  Then American Pie comes along and shows everyone that it is okay to have boobs again and to use the fword liberally with lines like  Sherman what the f are you doing here? and  Oz Fface I don't think he's coming back!  This was a film that didn't try to imitate closely the way teens and young adults talk it DID imitate the way teens and young adults talk.  Road Trip continues that trend.  Hollywood has to realize when it gives the green light to scripts that we are not as stupid as they think we are in most cases.  And what I mean by that is simply sure it can make money off almost any excuse for a teen film like Drive Me Crazy and Here On Earth and such but if you want to hit the jackpot if you want young people to feel the need to see the film more than once and recommend it to their friends you have to have a smart ear likable characters to laugh at and more than just a simple boy meets girl story.  Road Trip is that movie!When I went into the film I was shocked but pleasantly so to see Ivan Reitman and Dan Goldberg's name attached to the film as executive producers. These are guys that have brought us films like Animal House Ghostbusters Meatballs Stripes and even something like Kindergarten Cop.  These are all funny films with a great ear for dialogue.  So it immediately starts off on the right foot.The next thing it did right is the casting of Tom Greene and Sean William Scott.  Greene is quite sick and twisted by nature and Sean William Scott stole every scene in American Pie.  So to include them in your cast as the raunchiest guys of the bunch is great casting.  The next thing the film does right is it goes back to the roots of campus comedy and it has plenty of nudity.  Yes sure this may sound sexist and primitive but it also sells tickets.  And they can actually make a case for having it because the story is being told by Greene's character so as he puts it  it is my story there can be lots of nudity if I want there to be. Road Trip has plenty of beautiful women crude jokes a nerd that discovers who he is annebriation drugs mean sprited jokes and a script that is more convoluted and conventionally funny than any film save American Pie. Nothing is sacred here.  That includes the blind obesity women animals and of course nerds.  This is a fun film and although I am sure that it is garnered more towards males if you can go in with an open mind anyone can enjoy it.  I will bet that this film will go on to gross about 70 or 80 million dollars and I hope that more films are made in this kind of tradition.  We need more films inspired by Animal House.  We need more characters that are takeoffs of John Belushi and Tom Greene.  Maybe Ivan Reitman will have another script like this one on his shelf somewhere and he is ready to dust that one off as well.  Maybe.  All I know is that this film is fresh and it is worth your time.And of course most importantly it is one hell of a funny movie!8.5 out of 10".

To be honest it wasn't all bad just the parts that Tom Green had anything at all to do with.  Mr. Green is as funny as Will Ferrell doing his taxes while watching Ishtar in a burning orphanage on the Titanic.  He is to comedy what Stephen Hawking is to comedy.  His brand of humor is for those people that use phrases like booklurnin' and found Animal House and Police Academy far too cerebral and uppity.  His success can only be explained by way of speculation that he has made some sort of deal with Satan undoubtedly that Tom will be given fame and riches on the condition that he never set foot in Hell as I'm sure even Satan's standards for humor are higher than this. Sorry.  Was I ranting just then?  I feel so cleansed.On to the rest of the movie.  Predictable yes but not without a few laughs.  Many of these are provided at the expense of taste but anyone who watches this movie should be expecting that based on the familiar teen movie cast.  Check your standards at the door.Don't get me wrong I don't consider this movie to be a waste of time. It gave me a chance to work on my Tom Green effigy.".

Mr. Green is as funny as Will Ferrell doing his taxes while watching Ishtar in a burning orphanage on the Titanic.  He is to comedy what Stephen Hawking is to comedy.  His brand of humor is for those people that use phrases like booklurnin' and found Animal House and Police Academy far too cerebral and uppity.  His success can only be explained by way of speculation that he has made some sort of deal with Satan undoubtedly that Tom will be given fame and riches on the condition that he never set foot in Hell as I'm sure even Satan's standards for humor are higher than this. Sorry.  Was I ranting just then?  I feel so cleansed.On to the rest of the movie.  Predictable yes but not without a few laughs.  Many of these are provided at the expense of taste but anyone who watches this movie should be expecting that based on the familiar teen movie cast.  Check your standards at the door.Don't get me wrong I don't consider this movie to be a waste of time. It gave me a chance to work on my Tom Green effigy.";

If this movie had no vulgarity profanity and crude sexual implications to support it it would not have been a movie at all which shows just how hollow the story and production really are. Now I don't mind a film that would have any of these characteristics if it helps to supplement the realism of the story but if those three things are all that the movie has to rely on or if any of them are overused the film will end up becoming crapovision and this film qualifies as crap because it doesn't really have a story with any kind of depth only a way to satisfy perversion. This film is not art it is a repulsive waste.  If this film and Scary Movie are any indications of the kind of direction the American cinema is headed towards then we are producing ourselves to selfdestruction. Whatever happened to a presentation with intelligence or does Hollywood think the audience is too lazy and stupid to think intelligently? A two thumbs down accompanied with two middle fingers up.

Why do Americans keep spending their hardearned bacon to watch such trash? Are they so incapable of entertaining themselves that feel the need to watch this flotsam? I am sick and tired of popculture teenybopper films. We have seen a glut of these in the past couple years.Now back to my comments on the film. Ivan if you happen to read this one day what happened to you man? You go from directing what is possibly the best comedy film ever conceived Ghostbusters to a product of the Hollywood factory just the same and as unmemorable as everything else out there.I feel that I lost 1.5 hours of my life and I want them back. Sadly that will probably not happen. I got more laughs out of Battlefield Earth which was meant to be serious than this piece of celluloid that will hopefully fade into oblivion as so many other films of this type already have.

With it you have a few seconds in which a very beautiful blond California surfer girl is without a top. Without it you have a witless trip story.I won't even bother to describe the plot.

Somewhere between Ithaca New York and Austin Texas the gang of four stop at the house of one of their grandparents. The old man can hardly move but he watches stupid sex movies on TV takes Viagra has a constant boner and smokes dope. Ha ha.The musical score is built around rock. That's pretty depressing. I went to school in Ithaca too and during the midterms and finals the student radio station played nothing but uninterrupted classical music. Walking across the quad you could hear the same mellow Mozart sonata drifting out of every one of dozens of open windows. Now it's a cacophony reflecting the state of the union I guess.The movie is similar to some others  Animal House and the Porky's series  that I found only mildly amusing. Something About Mary was much better. But this one tries to get laughs out of truly stupid gags. A man is caught swallowing a mouse a fat waiter who is asked to remove the sugar from an order of French toast takes it in the back room licks off the sugar stuffs the bread inside his pants and serves it again  and the camera lingers on the dope who eats it with relish while the editor waits for the expected laughter to fade. In Casino a waiter expresses his contempt for the customers by spitting a ginder into a submarine sandwich and it disgusts but not as much as this scene which seems to go on and on long after the joke  if that's what it is  has been swallowed.I bought this on a DVD.

Unlike most other teenage comedy films out there this one actually has some heart and the characters whilst typical sex obsessed pot smokers have good personalities. The stand out apart from the cast is Tom Green as the creepy roommate who has a pet python. If you liked American Pie you'll enjoy Road trip. Not just because of the presence of Sean William stifler Scott but also nice campuses hot chicks and lot of beer and pot.";

	schema:reviewBody "Road Trip is a feelgood college comedy that is both hilarious and heartfelt. The humour keeps the movie interesting and the heart keeps it from being stupid. Well there are some stupid moments but none of which diminish the overall result. The stupidity mainly comes from Tom Green but who doesn't like preFreddy Got Fingered Tom Green?The movie starts out with Tom Green as an eighth year college student at Ithaca University giving a tour to potential students trying to sell them the idea of attending the school. He is not doing a good job until he tells a story of what happened the year before. This is the main part of the filmJosh Parker Breckin Meyer and Tiffany Henderson have been best friends forever and have been boyfriend and girlfriend since they started liking the opposite sex. Josh goes to school at Ithaca and Tiffany goes to school in Austin Texas. They try to make their longdistance relationship work with Josh even going so far as to mail her weekly video tapes like Skype. But Josh is tempted to get with fellowstudent Beth Amy Smart especially since he is somewhat of a rival for her with TA Jacob Anthony Rapp. After a party Josh gives in and sleeps with Beth recording it on tape. His roommate Rubin Paulo Costanzo accidentally mails the sex tape to Tiffany. This beginning of the film is hilarious even the scene when they find out the wrong tape was mailed. So Josh Rubin Josh's best friend E.L. Seann William Scott persuade their geeky neighbour Kyle DJ Qualls to take his car and retrieve the tape. The adventure portion is classic road material. They crash a party at a black fraternity donate sperm crash Kyle's car among other things. Meanwhile Tom Green awaits Rubin's snake eating a mouse and tells Beth that Tiffany is in Boston. Aside from the situations being hilarious the characters need to be awesome too. Josh is Meyer's usual geek that he always makes work. E.L. is exactly like Stifler from American Pie. I don't mind Stifler's awesome E.L. could be his cousin! Rubin is a cool dude and really smart. He is awesome with physics and helps Josh pass his Ancient philosophy exam. Kyle is an ugly wimp who learns to stand up for himself. Tom Green's character's name is Barry Manilow. His obsession with seeing the snake eat the mouse is priceless. The film ends well and funnily too. You can't really say that this movie achieves the status of excellence or anything. This is about enjoying college life. It is just a simple film to make people laugh without insulting their intelligence.".

The comedic action in the body of the film is related to the plot in only the most precarious degrees and throughout most of the middle action the equivalent of the original's female presence is absent  rendering the conclusion far less logical.Overnight Delivery was a comedy but it was a smart comedy and it had a very deep meaning for the outofstate college freshman. When you finish high school often you think you are so sure of what the world is going to be like and how your life is going to turn out  and whom you are going to spend it with. The main characters  both the nebbish fauxconservative male and the pseudorebellious strippeuse  end up learning that life isn't that predictable that impulses get in the way... and that there is so much left to discover in the world outside the childish confines of an insular suburbanstrip mall education.Road Trip on the other hand is nothing more than a sexraunch comedy. I'm not necessarily allergic to those Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Dumb and Dumber remain two of my favorite guilty pleasures but the problem is basically this. When you imitate a story that has meaning and you reduce it to vulgar toiletbowl humor without making an outright parody you leave those habituated to the original product feeling... empty cheated even.Story archetypes abound sure but Road Trip is both too unoriginal to bring forth anything meaningful from its source material and too selfunaware to become an overt caricature of the source. As is often the case the original is far more palatable by any standard.".

Done in 2000 right in the middle between American Pie and American Pie 2 this film carries on the traditions that the original Pie film introduces and whilst it lacks the coming of age meaning it is still worthy to be mentioned in the same breath as the Pie Trilogy.In Road Trip Josh Breckin Meyer.. soon to be seen as Jon Arbuckle in Garfield E.L. Seann William Scott in Stifler mode Rubin Paulo Costanzo and Kyle DJ Qualls embark on a road trip from Ithika University all the way to Austin University a total of 1800 miles away. On the way the guys have many crazy experiences happen to them and things then round themselves off nicely. Truth be told that's about the whole plot. As was shown in Master  Commander three years later however a simplistic plot is not necessarily a bad thing.Ok I admit it's not going to take much time to analyse this film but that is a good thing. Road Trip contains typical grossout humour standard acting by a young cast the inevitable scenes of brief nudity and ultimately everything to keep a teenage boy happy.Truthfully I can't really think of anything bad to say about this movie. I could insult Tom Green but for once the guy makes me laugh a lot and I'm grateful for his participation. The soundtrack is excellent scripting as you'd generally expect and even the limited special effects for example a car blowing up are done to acceptable levels.Whilst it may not have the originality of the very first American Pie film Road Trip is still something which people can watch over and over again. It doesn't stretch the brain at all and it wouldn't win any awards. However if you love the American Pie films then I can't think of any reason for you to hate this. Sit back relax shut your brain off and enjoy.".

The first time I rented it it got stuck in the VCR and busted the thing up and I had to dissect the machine to free the tape. Then I rented it again and found it was another movie called Body Count and had to go back in and get this one and finally I held my breath and watched this and saw that it was worth all the hassles. Including buying a new VCR!Daniel a young preppy is coming to his family's enormous mansion in the boonies with his girlfriend Susanne for Thanksgiving dinner. Their are family tensions and Daniel is excommunicated from the family. In hope for escape he heads down into the basement with Susanne and just as they are getting comfortable three art thieves break in and kill the whole family. The couple listens in terror and struggles to plan and figure out a way to escape. They soon realize they must kill these three men and they learn to fight back all up to the last fifteen minutes when everything suddenly takes a wild turn and soon more conflicts than ever before are introduced. And the body count is raised. This really was a great movie. It was very short so there is little filler and just a lot of excitement. The acting is surprisingly good with IceT in a typical role charming Thoreaux and showstealing Milano. She played a great role and is underrated. Despite some exploits during the two unrevealing sex scenes she is professional and impressive. During the first halfhour when things are calm she is obviously uncomfortable and trying to fit in with this hostile family. She uses voice tones and facial expressions quite well and when the horror starts she isn't gunho she's what you would expect terrified and forced to fight. I commend her on a great role. As for the twist that comes near the end yes I realize it was quite obvious but still it's good to anticipate. And it didn't deter from the suspense and the excitement and I held my breath to the very end. I definitely recommend this movie even if it does mean going through three video store trips and a broken VCR.   ".

Actually you're cool for liking the group but you're still an idiot for renting this.  I saw it on cable and for some reason sat through the whole thing.Alyssa Milano plays the girlfriend to a rich kid whom she accompanies to his rich ahole parents' mansion out in the boondocks.  Quickly we learn that her boyfriend is free from all the influences he grew up with. We know this because she keeps nagging him to go back to being a teacher.  She keeps doing this because well he makes cute artsy references to things that famous writers like Shaw said.  See all people that carry around cool quotes in their noggins to impress girls with are all smart and should definitely be guiding our youth today. Cuz its so much more damn fulfilling than making money and stuff.Anyway we don't get to know the family for very long cause Tommy Tiny Lister and Ice T and their token white boy break in and blow everyone away. Its too bad too the chief from the show Chips was playing the Dad or the Uncle and was drinking scotch and getting hammered.  I figured since he'd been working at McD's the past 20 years he would be glad to just be in a movie even this one.  But noooo he's just in there for Ice T to bust a cap in his highway patrollin' ass.It seems T and his crosseyed buddy Tiny are interested in the lame collection of art in the boyfriend's house.  That's right not only is T a cold blooded killa he also appreciates good art!  We also know he's more intellectual than your average killa because he wears glasses.So Alyssa and her hornyass boyfriend they have sex twice but you don't see jack because Alyssa was beyond that sorta crazy stuff at that point  besides who cares the hottest place to see her nude is in Bikini magazine before she got her implants and she still kinda looked like the 16 yr. old Sam from Who's the Boss? they decide to play John McClane and sneak and hide around the house avoiding Mr. Original Gangsta and Mr. Glazed Eyed Fatty.  Alyssa even hides in the AC shaft I kept expecting her to go Now I know what a TV dinner feels like!Eventually we find out a family member is involved in the whole scheme and then there is an even lamer twist at the end that I don't want to give away. Mostly because then imdb might not post this not because its thrilling or anything.  If there is anything positive about this flick I would say the film quality is good it doesn't have that grainy look of cheap movies. But I guess all they really needed to do was rent that one big house since the whole movie takes place there.  And of course Ms. Milano is a damn fine pleasure to watch.  Those have to be the sexiest lips I've seen.  And we do get to watch her wriggle into that AC shaft  from behind.  At least the director had some sense. And of course Ice T is always fun to watch as long as he's just playing himself not a stupid art thief.  Oh wait never mind.".

This movie however puts that one's shame to shame.The movie deviously draws the viewer in with a very sexy shot of Alyssa Milano making out with her fianc in a car and the movie goes downhill rather off the cliff from there. Her fianc is the black sheep of a wealthy family and there's tension at the holiday gathering but that becomes secondary when art thieves led by IceT invade the home and shoot the family or most of it dead except for Milano and her fianc who were in the basement having sex during the episode.The movie is billed as suspense but appears more to be the punchline to the old joke How do you keep an idiot in suspense? The ending is predictable as are the plot twists and IceT's character's swipe against racism by reminding the viewers that he has a masters in art history was nothing more than lame grandstanding.Anyone who has ever wondered if they should try to write movies can watch this one for inspiration and come away with the feeling that no matter how bad they might be if they attempted to write a movie it's doubtful they will ever sink to a low like this. If I were Milano I'd buy the rights to this film and burn it.The music by IceT over the closing credits was the best part but I'm not sure if I liked the music or simply liked that the movie was over.It doesn't get much worse than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sabotage is really what you could call a surprise package. On the one had it is an low budget action film starring martial arts star Mark Dacascos which may suggest the film will be hollow brainless and lacking in genuine class. However the film is a surprisingly entertaining and stylish piece of cinema that betters many thrillers released by big studios. The performances are first rate and the character interactions are good with some great dialogue.The plot is an intentionally convoluted one which unravels as the movie progresses. There are conspiracies dodgy agency folk and assassinations. The whole thing is regularly referred to as a metaphorical game of Chess In fact the two lead characters have the surnames Bishop and Castle!. We open with a flashback set in Bosnia 1993 during a failed mission to rescue political hostages when a third party comes in and kills allied troops including Michael Bishop Mark Dacascos. The third party was a former colleague of Bishops named Sherwood played superbly by Tony Todd. Bishop is left with 7 bullets holes in his chest thanks to Sherwood and left for dead. As it happens though a few years later he is still alive and now working as a bodyguard but his client is killed under his nose and he must track down who did it. Bishop could leave it alone but out of duty he wants to find the killer but as he unravels the plot he finds that the situation now is linked with his mission in Bosnia. The plot has depth and keeps you guessing while there are plenty of twists. The final twist is excellent you could call it Bishop takes Queen check mate!. It isn't merely the plot that has clever touches but the methodical way in which Bishops thinks. The film makers make darn sure this guy looks like someone who has intelligence training. He gets out of situations and solves situations using his head not just flying in there feet first as you'd expect a martial arts star in an action movie to do. Great parts include Bishop setting up a censor outside of his motel room using a lamp and his use of a fridge at the end is also very good. The film is littered with nice touches that give it a depth that you don't expect.The cast are excellent. Really and truly in the main roles there is not a weak link. Mark Dacascos is good here. He has always had more humanity and acting ability than a lot of his action man peers and he is good here playing the methodical Bishop. His relationship and chemistry with Carrie Ann Moss Castle is a big part of the movies success. They initially have friction as he is a chief suspect but as the plot unravels they work together and form a bond that doesn't go into the Bmovie clich of becoming immediately sexual for the sake of some TA. Carrie Ann Moss is also very good in her role balancing loving mother with ambitious FBI career woman very well before turning into a bad ass at the end. Then there is Tony Todd who is excellent as the villain. They managed to get someone in to play Sherwood with some charisma. If Sherwood wasn't menacing and wasn't played right this would have suffered. Similar to Bishop Sherwood is highly intelligent and is given the intellectual high ground over all his cohorts as he says 'fcking amateurs!. Finally the is good support from James Purcell and also some real class from John Neville and Oscar nominated Graham Greene two highly respected actors. There is a real classiness to the central cast that warrants this film more accolade than it has. This really had the quality to be released theatrically.The direction by Tibor Takacs is stylish and although he goes overboard at times he keeps proceedings moving along nicely and there are some good action scenes. The action is strong here but there is now big stand out scene obviously due to budgetary constraints. The film opens with two consecutive action sequences and the airport hit is very good. Really they needed an extended action scene in there somewhere rather than just short bursts. The rather blandish and cold cinematography actually works well for this film giving some atmosphere and that combines well with Guy Zefara's low key and ambient score. He knows the limitations of doing a Synthesizer score and doesn't try an recreate a full orchestra. Rather he create a subtle score that keeps the atmosphere going and uses an effective percussive style for the action. Overall this is an accomplished little film. Its not original by any means but gives some depth to its material and although it lacks a strong finish it is certainly a film that demands viewing. 12".

Based on that I would again like to express my annoyance that it was so unjustly rated R so other people may not have the opportunity to see it. The plot was better then most and the quality of the music and picture was excellent considering how old the movie was. I really enjoyed the solid performances of Mark Dacascos and CarrieAnne Moss who was great in one of her earlier preMatrix roles. Overall an enjoyable 99 minute movie with plenty to offer.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a neat little thriller which while made as a vehicle for the 'new' action star of the '90s Mark Dacascos rises above the origins and turns into an entertaining story. While the plot is nothing new  the trend of the '90s thriller is to include police corruption and conspiracy  there are some fresh twists on the tale enough to keep the viewer constantly intrigued. The story is bolstered by some above average acting from the cast with most of the actors and actresses being experienced. Even the female lead this time around is an interesting character and not just a cheap Scully as is the case with so many sidekicks in today's films. Mark Dacascos acquits himself well with the role of the bodyguard and he's quite charismatic too not to mention athletic in the action sequences. Playing the villain with sneering intensity is Tony Todd one of my favourite of today's actors. Todd is perfectly cast as the sinister villain a role which he fits like a glove and as always he's eminently watchable. Further down in the cast are Graham Greene excellent as a corrupt official and John Neville who enjoys his camp turn as a wheelchairbound homosexual.Surprisingly the film is quite low on action sequences specifically martial arts scenes considering other Dacascos films like DRIVE. However what scenes there are are interesting and well staged and there are some varied special effects to add to the role. Notable moments include the clever ending and a scene where Dacascos sets up a lamp to turn on when someone steps outside his door. This would be a pretty boring filler scene in other films but it's filmed in an interesting entertaining way as are the shootouts which serve as the main focus points for the action. SABOTAGE was never going to win any awards for brilliance but it's a solid little thriller and has more originality and thoughtfulness than many other films I could cite which we see on the video racks today. Catch it if there's nothing better on television.".

In practice however the movie manages to lift the plot above trash. The recurring theme is that of a game of chess where the main character whose surname happens to be Bishop is taking part in the conspiracy game.The acting by Mark and CarieAnne are average. The script written for them should take most of the blame for that as it can get shallow and cheesy at times which is to be expected for this type of movie.Nonetheless this movie has class which manages to keep it out of feeling too cheap. The action is well paced and is not too aggressive or overabundant so that there is a feeling that a figurative chess game is indeed happening and it is not just a sweaty guy throwing chess pieces around in anger which is what a lot of actions movies feel like. At the same time it has a few memorable action scenes which have stayed with me all the way from childhood.If you like action movies and have not seen this one I highly suggest adding it to your checklist although the only place I have been able to find it is on VHS and Youtube...a shame considering the kind of garbage they still show on TV sometimes.".

When the same assassin kills them both he is forced to investigate a possible conspiracy within the intelligence services eventually joining forces with FBI Agent Louise Castle to get to the head of the plot.I watched this film a few nights ago when I noticed the cast  I thought I hadn't seen it before and didn't realise that I had until the final ten minutes when one scene triggered my memory.  That is an indication of what I thought of this film  it is wholly unmemorable.  That is not to say it is awful merely that it isn't very good and you'll be unlikely to ever watch it again unless like me you forget you've ever seen it.  The plot is OK but not delivered as well as one would have hoped but still passes the time without doing anything too special.  It occasionally has moments of action but mostly it just putters along.  Certainly anyone looking to see martial arts action on the strength of Dacascos as I was will be mostly let down.The twists in the plot are good but not as shocking or as dramatic as they should have been  again due to the delivery. The climax is good on paper but somehow it simply doesn't come off  perhaps the complex plot was not developed and explained as well as it needed  thus making plot twists less dramatic.On paper the cast are good but in practice they are not.  Dacascos is someone I always enjoy but he is not a great actor.  Here his best moments come when action is called for.  Moss is interesting to watch postMatrix she is OK but I wonder why she wasn't credited on this film  after all she WAS credited on Lethal Tender around about the same time and it wasn't any better than this. Continuing the list of well known faces Todd Candyman was a good bad guy and lifted his scenes Graham Greene and John Neville were given little to do and did appear to be slumming it a bit esp Neville in a horrid camp role.Overall if you are looking for a way to pass 99 minutes and aren't too bothered about forgetting as soon as you stop the tape then this is OK otherwise you'd best leave this.  On paper it all looked good but the delivery is weak and the film suffers as a result.".
