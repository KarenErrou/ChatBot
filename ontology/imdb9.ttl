Manco introduces Ernesto to Federico Federico Luppi an also elegant but more astute  experienced methodical thief  the best in his class.Federico's only known weakness is Pilar Victoria Abril his former mistress and partner. She suddenly appears and proposes a fabulous ripoff scheme to her former lover a crime in grand scale which will eventually require the help of Ernesto Manco and Gitano among others.The script is full of twists and surprising reversals particularly towards the end of the film. One criticism about the film I've heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end but I disagree. The film captivates the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow. In fact these are what make the film outstanding. I highly recommend it.".

Incautos is his best film so far but still has a few gaps in the screenplay and its pacing. Three actors in a state of grace Ernesto Alterio Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi are great are involved in a plot that might remind the viewer of Stephen Frears' The Grifters. Although the film starts well the ending is somehow too twisted and some pivotal points in the plot are barely explained. Maybe all the events going on in the first hour could be cleared by a second viewing but the screenplay should explain everything by itself in a single viewing.Incautos is technically good specially cinematography and score and the cast is outstanding apart from the three leading actors Manuel Morn and Manuel Alexandre are a delight to watch. Therefore a better structured screenplay would have helped to make this film a really great one.Overall rating 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I was so offended by this film that I had to write SOMETHING about it so please humour me.Its only redeeming virtue outside of some good acting is that it doesn't go on past 107 minutes. Even that length is about 30 minutes too long.Comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark 'The Grifters' but I can't see it. They are two different films altogether. The closest 'Swindled' comes to an existing film is 'The Sting' made in 1973. It borrows sorry STEALS liberally from this splendid George Roy Hill 'entertainment' which is exactly what is was. I enjoyed it because it didn't pretend to be anything else.There are so many red herrings in 'Swindled' that I thought I was in a fish tank. It's very confusing but that's only one of its many problems. The principal one is this if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else where everyone is conning we have no 'anchor' to ground us. The inevitable result is a mishmash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks.Just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable. Surely a basic Film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to 'care' for someone. We can't 'care' for anyone here they're ALL swines. It might have worked as a rakish comedy but it plays it straight from beginning to end.IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM READ NO FURTHER. BIG 'SPOILER' COMING. SORRY BUT I HAVE TO DO IT.There's so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn't strain credulity  it destroys it. The ending is absolutely ridiculous  a 'murder' in a crowded airport that isn't really a 'murder' at all? And the 'murdered' guy bloodsoaked simply stands up brushes himself off and walks away fake blood dripping with the booty? All while the police and hordes of people are looking on and no one intercedes? The director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we're supposed to buy into this. Noirish Bmovies from the 1940s did better. I'm a great fan of European flicks but this confirms that schlock doesn't always come from Hollywood. As far as 'Swindled' is concerned my judgment lies with a famous line from the oftmisspoken producer Samuel Goldwyn who knew all about schlock 'Include me out'.".

This is not an action film by any means though the pacing is faster and there is most action than in most any other Bergman movie.  Nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism unlike most war movies.  In fact the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalties has a very contemporary feel.Skammen is a darkly lit movie that should be watched at night so as to let it work it's magic.  Many of the effects are conveyed indirectly but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a contemporary insanely huge budget film like Saving Private Ryan.  Of course the action in Skammen is on a much smaller scale but it is impressive nonetheless.While the filmmaking style feels contemporary the setting of the film feels timeless and placeless.  The wartorn countryside and even the yet intact provincial hamlet could be anywhere any time.  And this film is not so much about specific historical events with specific names and dates but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos.The acting in Skammen though typically impressive from Ullman and Sydow is not of primary importance in this film unlike most other Bergman movies. Through much of the film they are spectators much as we are.  Bergman has the war imposed on them and through them on the audience and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might be.Highly recommended.  1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Shame is rather unique as a war film or rather quite the antiwar film in that it not only doesn't focus on the soldiers or politics involved there is politics but not how you'd think it'd be shown it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal decaying society they inhabit. Ingmar Bergman in the midst of his prime and following two other heavily psychological films Persona and Hour of the Wolf is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings that it brings out the worst in them and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living. His two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman as the Rosenbergs oddly enough who are musicians living on a farm on an island not too dissimilar from 'Wolf' when one thinks about it.They see the tanks roll by and a couple of old friends already getting worn down but they try not to put it too much to heart there's a sweet scene where the couple just talk rather frankly but with heart all one shot as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked...Then comes the trouble including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the Rosenbergs the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war and the terror involved with a 'friend' in the military one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's most subtle works with Bergman. Needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of Bergman's filmography however for some it may be one of his more accessible works. His religious themes this time is kept very low key even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere. When there is war action it's shot in unconventional quick ways via great amigo Sven Nykvist.And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of warground where the lines are never too surely drawn. In a way this film shot right at the height of the worst times in Vietnam is even more relevant for today I couldn't help but see chilling uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and elsewhere with some of Jan and Eva's scenes with the fighters or those 'in charge'. The very last scene by the way is one of Bergman's very best all around acting directing lighting. It's not the kind of war picture or again antiwar I find little of the John Wayne spirit in this Svensk production that I would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into Saving Private Ryan it has a little more in kinship with Paths of Glory looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But in reality like any of Bergman's genre films it stands alone however one that packs a wallop for the arthouse crowd.".

His two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman as the Rosenbergs oddly enough who are musicians living on a farm on an island not too dissimilar from 'Wolf' when one thinks about it.They see the tanks roll by and a couple of old friends already getting worn down but they try not to put it too much to heart there's a sweet scene where the couple just talk rather frankly but with heart all one shot as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked...Then comes the trouble including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the Rosenbergs the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war and the terror involved with a 'friend' in the military one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's most subtle works with Bergman. Needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of Bergman's filmography however for some it may be one of his more accessible works. His religious themes this time is kept very low key even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere. When there is war action it's shot in unconventional quick ways via great amigo Sven Nykvist.And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of warground where the lines are never too surely drawn. In a way this film shot right at the height of the worst times in Vietnam is even more relevant for today I couldn't help but see chilling uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and elsewhere with some of Jan and Eva's scenes with the fighters or those 'in charge'. The very last scene by the way is one of Bergman's very best all around acting directing lighting. It's not the kind of war picture or again antiwar I find little of the John Wayne spirit in this Svensk production that I would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into Saving Private Ryan it has a little more in kinship with Paths of Glory looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But in reality like any of Bergman's genre films it stands alone however one that packs a wallop for the arthouse crowd.";

From frame one it's an unrelentingly downbeat and depressing film albeit one that lingers in the mind due to it's haunting images. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as the politically uninvolved couple who suffer the terrifying consequences of being caught up in the midst of a civil war. The issues behind the war are never defined and the two opposing sides are virtually indistinguishable in that they both practice indiscriminate torture and murder. The shame of the title applies on numerous levels throughout the film. The couple find themselves capable of acts that would have ordinarily been inconceivable as they struggle to survive the onslaught of catastrophes. They betray their souls their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day.If there's a lesson to any of this it may be that no one can afford to be ignorant of the issues and the world around them or else they will be illequipped to deal with them when they inevitably intrude on even the most isolated of lives. The black and white cinematography is stunning and the suspense is often unbearable especially when the couple finds themselves at the mercy of renegade soldiers who cannot be reasoned with. The downbeat and confusing ending however does not satisfy...it seems a bit pretentious and leaves the viewer feeling a bit cheated.

She henpecks him for this and that and emasculates him and cheats on him with Bjornstrand because he's in charge and thus more potent and only is repentant when he is ready to give up it's nuts she turns a gentle solicitous man into a madman who at the end when he puts on a scarf I was expecting him to tie on a headband.Yes the dehumanization of man is an overall theme as well at the beginning they stop their car to see if people are okay but by the end they are poling their way over dead soldiers not checking them for supplies by the way but it isn't really the war that does that to them it seems to be each other. And finally she cares if they ever speak to one another again when she has pushed him until he has snapped and shot her lover that finally gets him some respect. Who knows maybe that is the point that it is this alpha mindset that sets the stage for war to begin with.I understand that I missed the point.

We see the fog of war from the point of view of a comically passive couple who ignore the troops all around the long convoys the bombedout buildings the news reports c. They do not even bother to find a working radio. They are the ultimate in Not in my backyard. They talk of wine and lingonberries meanwhile friends are mysteriously conscripted and growing numbers of troops show up in the town. They show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years.The man Von Sydow is cultured sulky and a navelgazer the woman Ullman is somewhat more impulsive passionate and outwardlooking.

Although the war is shown mostly without epic battle scenes rather shown just by soldiers marching by and fighter jets flying over the sound of imminent doom is in every frame. 'Shame' is wonderful character study and what war does to a peoples' psychology. Max von Sydow's Jan is intelligent but somewhat cowardly man. Some can even call him weak while Liv Ullmann's Eva is strong and independent woman who really cares about her husband. The character descriptions seem simple at first  strong wife weak husband  but there's much more hidden in these people. Although Jan is not your typical macho guy his intelligence compensate lot of his cowardice. And Eva although strong woman is still in need of some support from her husband. While the war comes closer and closer we see their relationship starting to fall apart and then getting stronger again until they get right into the middle of war horrors with both sides riding over their farm. They both grow cold and stay together just for habit. Jan becomes cruel and violent while Eva becomes not exactly submissive but rather distant.Bergman has stated his dissatisfaction with the film in several occasions and never considered it his best work but 'Shame' is must see film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A dark and grim tale about the effects of war even on those not fighting the film manages to achieve a high level of realism in a number of different ways. The most obvious method is the frantic camerawork and editing plus the use of closeups to make it more intense and excellent sound mixing to add impact. Everything is also quite unclear throughout. The film gives very little background information about the setting time period or characters and this ambiguity is like what it is like to live in the middle of a war. It is also about the central characters themselves  a couple who cannot have children a husband who is unable but willing to fight  but having a bit more insight into these characters would have made them easier to relate to. The film itself is frustrating to watch with the lack of background detail and having unrelenting bleakness makes it difficult to appreciate. Hopelessness is not easy to convey and Bergman does not manage to fully succeed in making it tangible but he does succeeds in many other areas with a screenplay full of interesting ideas. The acting is also superb with Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow both in top form. If not a very likable film it is a wellmade film  and the beginning credits are great.".

The simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring but I could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points. He depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war. In the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long drawnout shots. When all of a sudden the war struck upon them they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots.

	schema:reviewBody "While deciding whether or not to make a film covering the Algerian War Francois Truffaut the French master of cinema eventually decided not to take on the task because he felt as though to show something is to ennoble it. Truffaut further claims in a publication in 1960 that an antiwar film is a contradiction in terms a sentiment which I tend to agree with. Shame directed by Ingmar Bergman in 1968 challenges that idea. Depicting a couple who attempt to shield themselves from the war being waged around them Shame is a powerful statement proving there is no winning on either side of a war. As a civil war has engulfed the area in which they live Jan Rosenberg Max von Sydow and Eva Rosenberg Liv Ullmann an apolitical couple who used to earn their living as musicians grasp at the remnants of what used to be their lives. The war has encroached upon their relationship as well as their livelihood. Jan is weepy and constantly dealing with the emotional disturbance over the chaos and killing the war has caused. Meanwhile Eva desperately wants to have children but her husband can't imagine bringing a child into the anxietyridden life they now share. When the war reaches their town rebels attack killing many of Jan and Eva's neighbors. The couple is continuously harassed and their home eventually destroyed when the two are arrested as collaborators. No matter how far they run there is no escaping the conflict that has taken over their lives.Shame shows two people who purposefully don't take either side in a war yet that very silence and unwillingness to take sides results in their being assumed collaborators. Bergman seems to go to great lengths through this film to not only show the necessity of remaining neutral in times of military conflict but also to expose how dangerous it is to hold such a position. Shame is powerful because it exposes the difficulty in actually living a situation where people are not shielded by the side they chose in a battle because they didn't choose a side at all. The couple only has each other and with a host of marital problems to deal with on their own their lives are further complicated when life or death problems penetrate their existence. We get a glimpse of the security the two used to share before the horrors of war tore them apart outwardly. Inwardly however the two were experiencing difficulties which left their own marriage clouded in as much uncertainty as the world around them. In my viewing of Shame the neutrality was the most interesting aspect as the audience is able to see clearly that the two had not chosen a dominant side for the future of their marriage just as they hadn't shown a side to adhere to in the war. Using his trademark humanism Bergman delves deep into a marriage and reveals that no matter how far we delve into the lives of others we may still be none the wiser to what will happen to them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Minghela's writerdirector Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war. It deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively  Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out and portrays changes among the nonslave owning common people wrought by the war. Almost uniquely Cold Mountain does not overgeneralize southerners northerners or anybody else.The film surfs through genres as needed  never presenting a dull moment. It is a romance a war story an actionadventure and historical fiction all nicely woven into one.The story centers on Inman Jude Law and Ada Monroe Nicole Kidman who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud Inman enlists in the confederate army taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words as she admits to Ruby Thewes Renee Zellweger she is a master of everything useless.Ada's father passes on and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort she struggles and survives by holding the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks and as they become inseparable business partners they grow to love one another as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada and most of those he meets die.The bulk of the film takes place during Inman's long walk following both of the protagonists as they live learn grow and change. An ongoing act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada it is very much the same thing but also a symbol and remnant of the old south  a world which is rapidly passing.The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong  emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast mostly rises to the occasion. My one criticism however relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and Law's characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.Very highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat. Once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil Warera Cold Mountain starring Jude Law Nicole Kidman and Rene Zellweger is such a film.Then again calling Cold Mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough the film opens with a quite literally quickanddirty battle sequence that puts Glory director Edward Zwick shame. However Cold Mountain is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman played by Jude Law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind Ada Monroe played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.Cold Mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile back at the farm Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course toughasnails Ruby Thewes played by Rene Zellweger who helps Ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.Within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the wartorn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by the war of Northern aggression mostly for the worse. The dark pervading antiwar message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.Make no mistake Cold Mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Mingheller's astounding film cleverly sweeps the audience into the horrors of war at its beginning.  He then introduces his two principle characters who would gradually move the audience into their world wrought by war and hardship. We watch as the characters begin to unravel their internal tortures and their need to subdue their isolation to face their regrets and hope for the future.  This is an absolutely fabulous movie that portrays the stunning performances of its stellar cast of actors and the overwhelming raw landscapes that are kept in sync with their events and moods.  Observe the stages of emotional changes in the characters. So amazingly and magnificently captured at different camera angles from scene to scene against the cold mountainous countryside!This film isn't throwing off longwinded dialogue and lengthy physical encounters between Jude Law's Inman and Nicole Kidman's Ada to reveal the meeting of two souls searching for a meaningful existence.  Yep it's that brief and silent stare of Inman as he confronts the graciously lowkeyed prim and proper Ada that explicitly puts their sensory awareness of each other so powerfully on screen.  As the events flow I was completely mesmerized by the Inman character watching him transcend to his sense of isolation and his developing disillusion with his world. On the other hand I couldn't take my eyes off the immaculately wellbred and gorgeous Ada as she succumbs into a scrawny hapless damsel in complete distress.  It's fascinating to watch the couple adapt to situations beyond their control and to study the emotional and behavioral attitudes of two human beings altering at such opposing magnitude as a result of one war.  Observe how the once popular Inman slips into desolation in the battlefield becoming even more tormented from his world as he meets up with some very strange characters. Will he ever find solace with these characters or with Ada at the end? Will Ada while feeling alienated from her new abode at the beginning of the film and with the death of her father be able to battle her insecurity to become spiritually enlightened and physically capable with the help of her new acquaintances?  Is she able to embraces what the farmland has to offer her? And will Inman be capable of escaping what the gruesome battlefield has come to mean to him?  This film lays out an enormous ground for the examination of the effects a war on different individuals.The film continues to remind the audience that Ada and Inman are bound together by their haunting memories of one another.  That indeed is beautifully captured by the expressions on Law and Kidman's faces. The symbolisms throughout the film are plentiful and brilliantly ascribed allowing the audience to join the dots to the destinies of the couple. Even crows clearly suggesting doom and destruction never fail to demonstrate the dark instincts that trouble a man's soul. And those women Inman meets in his journey seem to trigger the expectation of the audience to see him drawing closer to the woman he loves and to home.  Even these characters encountered by Inman provide a picture of how different people react to the war. But will war ultimately bring peace and safety to its protagonists? This film is a masterpiece that will provide much food for thought.Renee Zwellweger is phenomenal in her boisterously loud 'Ruby' role. She brings another aspect of the American woman that's so different in breeding from Kidman's Ada.  Both are educated in their different cultural way of life.  What can Ada learn from Ruby the frontier woman who sees the 'hands and knees' toiling as the only way of survival in her community? Zwellweger provides the comic relief that's much needed for this powerfully intense film.  She's superb in her role as the beacon of strength and hope for injecting a meaningful existence of living. Unlike the soldiers or the hypocritical Home Guard authorities that use guns to destroy their enemies Ruby uses her handson skills to beat the odds of survival. It's uncannily delightful to watch her interacting with Kidman's character. She Law and Kidman are definitely worthy of being recipients of the Oscar statuettes. They exhibit their superb nonstop performing talents in this film with their onscreen appearances. The QA session with Brendon Gleeson who plays Ruby's father has prompted me to want to go see this movie again  to watch closely how the strength of the film's womenfolk can make a difference to the human beings' survival instincts.  I want to study again how hellish wars are for destroying and crippling not only the physical but the mental aspects of the masculine race.  And Gleeson does drive home an interesting question When these mountain folks volunteer' to fight a war how come they should be penalized as deserters if they were to decide to opt out of it?This film is a MUSTSEE. It's beautifully crafted assembled and absolutely mesmerizing in all aspects of filmmaking techniques and style. The music score and soundtracks are so appropriate locked into the events and the moods of the characters. And the film's title? It does project its allegorical appeal.A".

	schema:headline " I imagine God is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument.";
	schema:reviewBody "Cold Mountain is directed by Anthony Minghella who also adapts to screenplay from Charles Frazier's novel of the same name. It stars Jude Law Nicole Kidman Rene Zellweger Eileen Atkins Kathy Baker Brendan Gleeson Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ray Winstone and Natalie Portman.Music is scored by Gabriel Yared and cinematography by John Seale. Plot finds Law as W.P. Inman a wounded deserter from the Confederate army who is trying to make his way back to North Carolina to rekindle a fledgling romance with Ada Monroe Kidman. This is Minghella's world and the American Civil War movie gets a double shot in the arm as Cold Mountain not only deals in the home front but also in the perilous life of the soldier. Add into the mix a fire cracker of an opening a central romance and an array of expertly drawn characters and it's safe to say that Minghella's film is not only epic in production but also in story telling. In essence the film is about love friendships and learning to cope under the most trying of circumstances but the director doesn't paint it with a sentimental brush. As the three strands of the narrative play out tone is often gritty intense sorrowful even with Minghella cribbing from the Anthony Mann Western book by having the stunning landscapes form part of the characters emotional world. Come back to me come back to me Story is strong even if the key romance is soft since it's told mostly in flash backs but those flash backs are threaded into the main seam of Ada's life on the home front and Inman's perilous odyssey. She befriended by hard working dirty handed Ruby Thewes Zellewegger excellent who also provides the only moments of levity within he meeting up with a number of interesting characters both good and bad. This of course makes the film episodic but in this instance it's a good thing mainly because characters are so utterly compelling. Hoffman as a less than honourable priest and Portman as a young woman out in a wood cabin alone with her sick baby they stand out. But there's also the Home Guard attached enforcers led by blood thirsty Teague Winstone and a potent thread involving Ruby's fiddle playing father Stobrod Gleeson as usual a considerable screen presence. On the technical front it's hard to find fault it's a tip top production. Romania's mountains rolling hills and forests form the backdrop to most of the action with John Seale's Academy Award nominated photography neatly passing for a rugged North Carolina.

	onyx:emotionText "Cold Mountain is directed by Anthony Minghella who also adapts to screenplay from Charles Frazier's novel of the same name. It stars Jude Law Nicole Kidman Rene Zellweger Eileen Atkins Kathy Baker Brendan Gleeson Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ray Winstone and Natalie Portman.Music is scored by Gabriel Yared and cinematography by John Seale. Plot finds Law as W.P. Inman a wounded deserter from the Confederate army who is trying to make his way back to North Carolina to rekindle a fledgling romance with Ada Monroe Kidman. This is Minghella's world and the American Civil War movie gets a double shot in the arm as Cold Mountain not only deals in the home front but also in the perilous life of the soldier. Add into the mix a fire cracker of an opening a central romance and an array of expertly drawn characters and it's safe to say that Minghella's film is not only epic in production but also in story telling. In essence the film is about love friendships and learning to cope under the most trying of circumstances but the director doesn't paint it with a sentimental brush. As the three strands of the narrative play out tone is often gritty intense sorrowful even with Minghella cribbing from the Anthony Mann Western book by having the stunning landscapes form part of the characters emotional world. Come back to me come back to me Story is strong even if the key romance is soft since it's told mostly in flash backs but those flash backs are threaded into the main seam of Ada's life on the home front and Inman's perilous odyssey. She befriended by hard working dirty handed Ruby Thewes Zellewegger excellent who also provides the only moments of levity within he meeting up with a number of interesting characters both good and bad. This of course makes the film episodic but in this instance it's a good thing mainly because characters are so utterly compelling. Hoffman as a less than honourable priest and Portman as a young woman out in a wood cabin alone with her sick baby they stand out. But there's also the Home Guard attached enforcers led by blood thirsty Teague Winstone and a potent thread involving Ruby's fiddle playing father Stobrod Gleeson as usual a considerable screen presence. On the technical front it's hard to find fault it's a tip top production.

	schema:reviewBody "There are a couple of things wrong with this episodic rather sweeping film but not enough to destroy it. Fortunately the good outweighs the bad enough to make it worthwhile viewing. Law plays a shy but thoughtful young man in Cold Mountain NC. When the local minister's daughter Kidman moves to town he is immediately taken with her and they share a few very brief very stifled moments including an impromptu kiss before he leaves to fight in the Civil War. An opening battle scene is so intense that the impact of it literally tears the clothes off one participant! As they each experience great change disappointment and destruction it is their longing for each other that keeps them going. He can't wait to get back to her and she can't wait for him to come back. As Law treks across the southeastern coast he comes upon a wide variety of opponents and allies. These are all played with great skill by a terrific gallery of solid seminame actors Hoffman Ribisi Portman Atkins etc...... Meanwhile Kidman faces the end of her gentle existence and almost existence itself until a scrappy brassy local girl steps in to rescue her. Zellweger plays this feisty mouthy girl using every ounce of her acting prowess. The pair must fend off an opportunistic home guardsman played by a slimy Winstone. The film lurches forward with the allimportant reunion moment dangling in front of the viewers like a carrot on a stick. It is solely due to the acting talent and intense chemistry of the stars and not the sketchy spotty script that this moment carries any dramatic weight at all. Somehow Law and Kidman manage the impossible which is to create a romance and desire for one another that is never properly developed on the screen. They are forced to create everything through their expressions and body language and do just that. As good as they are they are almost completely overtaken by the surprisingly wondrous and intriguing work of Zellweger. Her welcome dash of vinegar and bluntness is a perfect counterpoint for the dewy and sensitive lovers. Also of particular note is another surprise  the downright striking job that Portman does as a lonely widow and mother. She outdoes herself in this brief role. As a matter of fact nearly every performance in the film is excellent. The one exception is the horribly anachronistic and inexplicable presence of the peroxide blonde henchman to Winstone. His punkrock eyelinered look and shoppingmall line delivery remove the viewer from the already tenuous time period whenever he's on screen. And is it ever stated why someone his age isn't IN the war?? That's one other problem. There is very little period feel to this film. It always seems like the actors are playing with clothes they found at Western Costume with their make up done by Ben Nye. Kidman's hair while lovely is absolutely ridiculous. It distracts from and detracts from scenes very often. Ditto her make up. One key scene near the end is a close up and her heavy mascara and shadow greypurple eyeshadow masterfully applied by those Hollywood wizards turn what should have been an agonizing emotional moment into Barbie Does the Civil War. Zellweger does better in the makeup department though her chemicallywhitened teeth do not go very far in suggesting her character's background. Her deliberately tousled hair is also a problem at times but nowhere near the level of Kidman's. These are quibbles in light of the bigger problem which is an overriding predictability. Even to one who has never read the book there is no doubt as to the ending of the film. There is very little room for surprise and what there is of that is telegraphed again and again. So the audience is left watching a 212 hour film with a foregone conclusion. And this sometimes meandering work was originally FIVE hours long! The amount of footage left on the cutting room floor makes for some uncomfortable continuity such as when a character is tortured and watches 3 family members slaughtered and is next seen smilingly dancing a Christmas jig! Nevertheless the romance and beauty of the film still delivers and there is no doubt that Kidman is a MOVIE STAR. She glows and glistens and has every accommodation made to her. Even her old riding coat looks runway perfect. Law is achingly beautiful in the early scenes but delivers a sincere dedicated performance in spite of his physical features which are all but buried as it wears on.".

The film blends epic battles drama  a love story shootouts and a little bit of violence . The motion picture is pretty strong with crude scenes  the bloody battles rampages  rape  murders...it has many violent shots  for that reason the film is rated R as the violence is extreme with cruel killings  besides some sex scenes.In United States attained a moderated success in spite of nomination to various Oscars  though only obtained one award to support cast for Renee Zellweger . In Europe achieved much more success at the box office . The picture has spectacular sets and some wonderful snowy and natural landscapes. Many of the scenes were shot in the Carpathian mountains in Romania . The production design and set design by Dante Ferretti is breathtaking .Jude Law and Nicole Kidman interpretation is top notch likeness to Renee Zellweger rightly rewarded . The secondary actors are first rate  The hideous Ray Winstone  the renegade priest Philip Seymour Hoffman  the kind Bernard Gleeson  everybody are good. Gabriel Yared musical score is romantic and magnificent and John Seale cinematography is astounding and stunningly made . Anthony Mingella direction is accurately developed but there're some moments with slightly slow movement . The flick will appeal to emotion enthusiasts and romantic films fans . Rating Very good . Above average  well worth watching.".

The film blends epic battles drama  a love story shootouts and a little bit of violence . The motion picture is pretty strong with crude scenes  the bloody battles rampages  rape  murders...it has many violent shots  for that reason the film is rated R as the violence is extreme with cruel killings  besides some sex scenes.In United States attained a moderated success in spite of nomination to various Oscars  though only obtained one award to support cast for Renee Zellweger . In Europe achieved much more success at the box office . The picture has spectacular sets and some wonderful snowy and natural landscapes. Many of the scenes were shot in the Carpathian mountains in Romania . The production design and set design by Dante Ferretti is breathtaking .Jude Law and Nicole Kidman interpretation is top notch likeness to Renee Zellweger rightly rewarded . The secondary actors are first rate  The hideous Ray Winstone  the renegade priest Philip Seymour Hoffman  the kind Bernard Gleeson  everybody are good. Gabriel Yared musical score is romantic and magnificent and John Seale cinematography is astounding and stunningly made . Anthony Mingella direction is accurately developed but there're some moments with slightly slow movement . The flick will appeal to emotion enthusiasts and romantic films fans . Rating Very good . Above average  well worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kidman and Law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed poorly written romancemelodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts andpines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when he's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War and they've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be Look vacant and shellshocked but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script but she plays it way too broad and over the top like she was starring in Annie Get Your Gun.' Yeehah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch  the one from Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel.Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium which is frequently all the writers do is shout Cue the Simon Legreetype Villain!' and Teague Ray Winstone comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts like kill and torture innocent Godfearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fastfadingConfederacy. All other times he's missing in action which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as he does his Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines where he has deserted to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them or their lives. Each of these little minimovies has the same tired theme war is goldurn heck and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals.And the script is far too predictable too heavyhanded. Moreover the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure.I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent antiwar message here. The incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about 15 minutes of this 150minute dog.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie worked for me because I see this movie as an exact opposite of 'Gone With The Wind.' Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants Ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby Renee Zellweger shows up to save the day. Sort of in a round about way. Deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families the lists goes on and on. Even the love story was opposite. If this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. There are only two things I didn't like about the movie the rest I thought was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First I couldn't see the attraction between Inman Jude Law and Ada Nicole Kidman as being strong enough for Inman to desert to get back to her. Inman said he only had written to her a few times where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. I must say it was full of action because of that but after about the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like to be surprised by the next scene not know what is going to happen before it does.I thought all the acting was very well done with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. She must have done her homework on the part. Zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think that was true. Law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than I thought it was. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. Kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact I chose her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion I don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. She still did a good job I just thought the other two were better. I liked the scene with the Zellweger Kidman and the rooster even though it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the 'Home Guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. Even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.".

After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for Jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of neardeath experiences to reunite with his soulmate. Who cares?  Philip S. Hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a cornfed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day.  Rarely has a performance screamed of look at me I'm acting smugness.  Her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin.  Released by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe what a farce consideration the Weinsteins apparently own along with Dick Clark the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure. The resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small less powerful PRdriven films become obscure.  Cold Mountain is a concept film and an empty bitter waste of time. Cold indeed!!!".

I don't fit any any of those classification. The other classification that needs to be on the list is 5 people didn't like this movie because it was not good. I found the film to be booring and forced. My wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law.Speaking of Law it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent. I can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose so we would't have to hear that tortured accent so much.As far as the movie it took a long time for it to get interesting about 1 or 1.5 hours and then fell flat in it's ending. What was interesting is that I did not know that this film was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes into the movie I asked my wife this isn't going to be another English Patient is it? It absolutely was.As far as the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply dumb. It was forced it was unbelievable it was silly and it was dumb. After the battle I looked at my wife and asked was that just dumb? to which she vigorously nodded her head.The only bright point in the film was the performance of Zellweger. The role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role but it worked. From her speech pattern her walk her mannerisms and esp. her little quips my favorite If you want to get 3 feet up a bull's ass all you have to do is listen to sweethearts talk to each other she was able to create an almost cartoonlike character who did her job extremely well.I simply did not like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it or the English Patient for that matter. I suspect you could categorize them in one category 1 Soap opera fans".

Jude Law tried but again he along with the rest of the miscast never evoked any emotion in me. Rene Zelweiger's acting was convincing but reminiscent of Granny Clampett in the Beverly Hillbillies. The characters were one dimensional and even Natalie Portman's scene did little to arouse any emotion in me. Donald Sutherland was the best actor in the movie and he was gone during the first half hour!! The script was terrible and laden with clichs from the characters to the dialogue. Even when Inman and Ada meet again a scene that shouldn't leave a dry eye in the house it left me cold as did his death at the end. I just didn't care because these characters and actors never invited me into their world. If you want to see a movie with good acting and a realistic view of the Civil War stick to Glory or Gone with the Wind. Don't waste your time on this sterile tale.".

I could forgive the lack of true development of a villain or evil several were suggested the weakest of which was there for the finale.  I could forgive Phillip Seymore Hoffman's British southern fusion accent Not nearly as bad as Nichole Kidman's or Jude Law's sad attempts at southerners...sad and inconsistent or Rene Zellweger's comic book interpretation of her comic relief character she was occasionally amusing after all.  I could forgive the soundtrack for leading me by the nose though every pivotal scene like some kind of emotional laugh track not the bluegrass the bluegrass was great.  I could forgive Natalie Portman for anything because she is supremely attractive.  I could forgive a lot of things but I'm not gonna.  It was just bad.  The acting. The interpretation of the story.  Character development.  The sexual tension. The release of said tension.  This is Hollywood hubris at it's best.  To be fair everyone worked very hard and with a different script and a different director this cast could have made one of the greatest movies ever I have a deep respect for so many actors involved in this movie and Cold Mountain is a nice vehicle most of the nice parts of the movie were where Minghella left the book alone but it just didn't happen.  Donald Sutherland was very good along with James Gammon and Giovanni Ribisi.  Romania was pretty. Cold Mountain however was just plain bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really excited about seeing Cold Mountain. Alas like most movies I'm really excited about seeing it was a letdown! Were it not for that miraculous invention called a DVD I think I would've put my head through the monitor I was so bored!I closely watched Kidman and Law when they meet because their characters are supposedly destined for each other. Yet Law's face showed anything but dumbstruck love while Kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett as if we don't get it cornball banjos mark her every entrance and so over the top it was all I could do not to laugh! Ironically her performance serves to highlight just how stiffasaboard the leads are.Ada nearly starves because she freed her slaves we never learn why. More perplexing is why didn't any of them stay on as Ada and her father were unusually benevolent and as shown in one scene it was a very dangerous time for Negroes as they're politely called here. Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Heck why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And for all of Ruby's practicality when she dispatches Ada's evil rooster that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickens!By the time her beloved finally returns Ada doesn't need him or anyone else  which is the big joke! Indeed she may be physically intimate with Inman but her real intimacy is with Ruby who has turned Ada into an berBabe version of herself. Did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands happy as two peas in a pod as they left Inman behind?I doubt that Minghella recognized this as he was too busy making an antiBush movie. Inman tells us he is like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie and Ada's father says I imagine God is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument. These observations are historically inaccurate and insulting. While slavery was the basis of the South's economy the reasons for the War were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was a lie in fact most in the rankandfile were indifferent to it. For filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious.Structurally the film is choppy and episodic. Law and Kidman are miscast and have zero chemistry! The script is little more than halfbaked dialog and an egregious bunch of clichs and banalities. Small moments like a bag of diamonds? Ugh!".

Come on! How cliche is this? Not only was the end of the movie pathetic it was anti climatic. What a waste of an opportunity. You had all the makings of a good movie and all the necessary characters early on instead the script calls to kill everyone off slowly throughout the movie. The art of good script writing is dead. To many movies like this. Yes war is bad and people die why not show us the smart ones who live through it and how they did it.Now lets not get me wrong Jude Law does a good job trying to be southern but I can't get over he is from England! The producer of this movie needs his head examined filming a Civil War movie in Europe with an English lead actor. Nichole Kidman does a good job but she just remains way to clean compared to the supporting cast and it stands out she looks out of place even when they try to dirty her. Things like this and the completely depressing pathetic ending not to mention the overly long movie run time make this just not a very good film.Movies with bad endings are always easy to spot. They never get much public support. The reason is simple people DO NOT like to be depressed. That is why I was so hesitant about Cold Mountain. I kept hearing Oscar Nomination but no big push by the public for it. Some things never change. Maybe one day these producers and directors will learn that people really do enjoy good smart movies about redemption hope and happiness. Not sappy tragedies. There is a reason Shakespeare is only brought up in literature class and Cold Mountain was named Cold Mountain. Sometimes its obvious what a waste of time.".

However Earth loses contact with the shuttle and the Space Research Center sends another spacecraft to search the Churchill. They find the crew dead and the shuttle burnt and one rescue pod missing. They bring the humanoids to Earth and soon Dr. Hans Fallada and his team discover that the Space Girl is a sort of vampire and drains the life force from people transforming them into zombies. When the authorities find that Col. Tom Carlsen has survived they summon him to explain what happened in the Churchill. Carlsen tells an incredible story about the three aliens and he teams up with Col. Colin Caine trying to save mankind from the evil vampires from the space.";

	schema:reviewBody "Did director Tobe Hooper writers Dan O'Bannon Alien Return of the Living Dead and Don Jakoby Blue Thunder in addition to some uncredited writers who presumably did rewrites of the original script or any of the cast actually think they were making a good movie during the production of Lifeforce? The movie gets progressively wackier more disturbingly bizarre hilarious overthetop and greater by the minute. When you think that the movie couldn't possibly become more demented that it was already as nutty as anything could possibly be it outdoes itself. I really don't know if this was at any point supposed to be tongueincheek if anybody involved thought it was genuinely creepy or effective or if they were just too distracted by Mathilda May's exquisite breasts and rear end to care but the end result is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made.Here are some reasons why Lifeforce is perhaps humankind's greatest achievement to date and probably impossible to surpass Mathilda May is nude for the entirety of the film and she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence you will ever see. Yes that is a quote from the film. Steve Railsback gives one of the most gloriously hilariously overthetop performances in the history of film.It is to quote a fellow IMDb member 'the greatest naked space vampire zombies from Halley's Comet running amok in London endoftheworld movie ever made'.

No it is quite simply THE most audacious spectacular hilarious absurd insane riotous crazy deliriously demented science fiction film of all time.

The movie gets progressively wackier more disturbingly bizarre hilarious overthetop and greater by the minute. When you think that the movie couldn't possibly become more demented that it was already as nutty as anything could possibly be it outdoes itself. I really don't know if this was at any point supposed to be tongueincheek if anybody involved thought it was genuinely creepy or effective or if they were just too distracted by Mathilda May's exquisite breasts and rear end to care but the end result is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made.Here are some reasons why Lifeforce is perhaps humankind's greatest achievement to date and probably impossible to surpass Mathilda May is nude for the entirety of the film and she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence you will ever see. Yes that is a quote from the film. Steve Railsback gives one of the most gloriously hilariously overthetop performances in the history of film.It is to quote a fellow IMDb member 'the greatest naked space vampire zombies from Halley's Comet running amok in London endoftheworld movie ever made'.

With the help of the Churchill's sole survivor Carlsen they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late.Lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment.  It has all the elements one could look for in such a movie loads of nudity bloodgore and plenty of special effects.  This is certainly better than a similarly plotted film Species thanks in large part to a more riveting finale.The performances range from decent to terrible.  Faring the worst is easily Steve Railsback who overacts to no end.  Much better are Peter Firth who comes through and convincingly and the gorgeous Mathilda May she's as beautiful as French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner.  May does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive.  There are times when she can be quite creepy being simply seductive.  Most of the film manages to work because of her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though it hardly compares to other scifi film giants like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND LIFEFORCE does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements. Somehow despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same it manages to work because of a few highly different elements.Loosely based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires this film from director Tobe Hooper POLTERGEIST THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE focuses on a joint USBritish mission aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley's Comet.  Led by an American commander Steve Railsback they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma.  And when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft they find alien occupants that look like giant bats.  Later on the Churchill reaches Earth's orbit but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission's home base the Space Research Center in London.  Columbia is launched to rendezvous with Churchill but they find the entire ship gutted by fireall except for the alien beings encased in glass who far from being untouched by the fire look absolutely perfect.  The aliens are bought back to Earth...and that's where the incredible happens.These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center and instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds suck their victims' lifeforce totally out of them.  One of them is the Space Girl a thoroughly nude vampiress played by Mathilda May.  Railsback the only actual survivor from Churchill is bought in by the SRC's chief Frank Finlay and a British special agent Peter Firth to track May who is in telepathic contact with him.  Pretty soon however the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies and the threat by NATO to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large.  Railsback finally catches up with May and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre.Undoubtedly disjointed unquestionably uneven but nevertheless worth watching LIFEFORCE despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting benefits from some dropdead excellent special effects work by John Dykstra STAR WARS some of the best ever seen.  The other working element and a surprise one it is is the incredible orchestral score by Henry Mancini almost Wagnerian in the same way John Williams' score for STAR WARS wasand Mancini like Williams before him uses the London Symphony Orchestra to boot!Largely forgotten these days and a critical and box office disaster in 1985 LIFEFORCE if for no other reason should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre.  There had never been a film quite like it before and there will certainly not be anything like it again.".

Because it and 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in artdirection for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them.Rather than dismiss 'Lifeforce' outofhand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of British horror and sciencefiction  specifically Hammer and American International features like Quatermass specifically 'Quatermass and the Pit' 1967 Doctor Who and 'The Day of the Triffids' 1963 if not the works of Gerry Anderson 'UFO' 'Space1999' and 'Thunderbirds'. But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer O'Bannon's genrescholarly appreciation for 'Queen of Blood'1966 and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space'1958  the immediate sources for 'Alien' 1979.Granted this film has some 'legacy' elements but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers  1981's 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves' 1984  other 80's films that share a 'lookingback' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist. All three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same but substantially sexedup their themes because they could and at the same time they recognized the tongueincheek humorous aspects of their projects.Neil Jordan's 'Wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's while 'American Werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'comingofage' film. It's called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latterday dramedy inherent in the 'Scream' franchise 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Final Destination'. But these teentargeted films seem to be part of a boxoffice trend whereas the 80's films like 'Lifeforce' belong a canon of British scifi  even if this one was written by an American.In many ways this film holds up much better than latterday disaster and alieninvasion flicks 'Independence Day' 'Armageddon' 'Deep Impact' in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gunbattles weaponized payloads and testosterone. At the opposite end of the pole it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron didn't examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before they remade 'Solaris'...The goal of this film was fun not ponderousness or stupidity.710".

The film is after all ludicrously plotted but that actually adds to the unique charms this movie has which actually entertains for all the right reasons. Lifeforce is exciting thrilling suspenseful and always a lot of fun thanks to the intriguing story the firstrate special effects the competent action sequences and of course the gorgeous Mathilda May wandering around in the buff.A joint BritishAmerican crew aboard the shuttle Churchill are studying Halley's Comet when they discover a giant contraption hidden within the coma's comet. Knowing this will be their only chance to board this enigma they suit up and enter this contraption. Inside they discover thousands of frozen giant batlike creatures and just as interesting three humanoids one female the other two male encased in crystallike containers. They decide to take the humanoids and one bat back to the ship with them.Thirty days go by and London has lost complete contact with the crew. So another shuttle is sent and they discover the dessicated remains of the Churchill crew but all three humanoids are still intact. Bringing them back to London for examination the female one awakens displaying the ability to drain the lifeforce out of a human being and escapes out of the compound. Enter Steve Railsback and Peter Firth who star respectively as the sole survivor of the Churchill and an agent out to stop this space vampiress from taking over the planet.If you've read the plot summary above and find this story interesting then Lifeforce is most certainly the film for you. The first hour is probably the most engrossing plotwise. When you discover that whoever the vampiress kills will also rise to drain someone else's lifeforce that's when the stakes grow much higher as an epidemic becomes a possibility.The first half of the film resembles Species quite a bit since you've got a team that's searching for a nubile alien that's on the loose though without a doubt Ms. May is so much hotter than Natasha Henstridge. This same part of the plot adds another interesting aspect that makes the team's job more difficult the vampiress has the ability to enter another person's body. Thus they're no longer searching for a young darkhaired beauty. She could be in anyone which further raises the stakes.The engrossing storytelling sort of gives away to loads of special effects and action but I found it a good transition. The effects are often terrific and the action is really quite exciting surprising considering that director Tobe Hooper is usually incompetent at creating thrills and suspense. Judging from the allout chaos that occurs in the last halfhour burning buildings thousands of zombielike creatures stumbling around searching for nourishment I'd say the film had a pretty big budget to work with I've heard figures as high as 28M which would be higher than Aliens' 18M a year later.Acting's probably what you would expect with Peter Firth delivering a pretty good performance as Agent Caine. I like the guy's straightforward calm attitude toward the situation and how he handles it. Steve Railsback as his partner who's being seduced by the vampiress in his dreams is much less impressive sweating and overacting to amusing extents but never coming across as very convincing. Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame is here too in a role that he's probably a bit embarrassed by these days.But the most impressive of the cast is none other than Mathilda May. Watching May stand around calmly as she seduces a victim is an interesting transition from titillation to allout horror. She's actually frightening and that's impressive for a nude woman. Speaking of nudity most people must have noticed that's often the most mentioned aspect of the film. Indeed Mathilda May is one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. It's really perfect casting when you think about it. There's something exotic and alien about her looks maybe the fact she's a foreigner helps that adds a brilliant touch and her perfect body helps too of course. Because of that exotic alien look I can't see any other dropdead gorgeous actress who could pull this off quite as well and this includes superhotties like Chasey Lain Carmella DeCesare and Tracy Ryan.Henry Mancini's score is a pretty enjoyable listen though hardly as good as so many have claimed it to be. Even at 116 minutes Lifeforce actually feels rushed. Some material could have explored a little further but that's not too big a complaint. This is one wildly entertaining film I highly recommend.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people say the end did not make sense but it did. With the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off having picked up a lot of Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to reenergize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they do not have carnal sex like vampires of legend. vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer has to suspend disbelief even for scifi. The only problem is having to be a sword or stake not bullets. That puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with scifi. So that is a problem. The only major inconsistency I found is killing the male vampires with the sword but the soul of the girl and Carlsen go up to the ship. I assume the males souls also went up the ship but not shown. What about all the humans killed? Do their qui forces souls go up to the ship as discrete entities are does all the lifeforce get merged into one for use as ship sees fit? In other words all the human souls that went to the ship could be reincarnated as bat creatures. The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars Force or even reincarnation. This movie was over the top kitchen sink Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and end were ethereal. It both began what is happening to me and ended as a love story. Most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.So what? Bizarre is an art form. As far as being ludicrous it all fits. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the Aliens just killing people. Maybe they didn't need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl but it was a very far out surreal scene. Another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly with the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core. Its a lover storyfrom start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster and this movie did not end that way which is precisely why I love it. Instead it has a happy ending with the 2 of them going back to ship to be reborn. Way cooler than the hero kills monster end but that is exactly why it bombed. It was not a straightup horror or even scifihorror at all but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end. All those souls twinkling on the ship. And the crystal room pulsating with new life. Most people can't deal with a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.".

	schema:headline " S10 Reviews Lifeforce 1985";
	schema:reviewBody "Tobe Hooper fresh off mainstream success with 'Poltergeist' aims for the skies this time around. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script by 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby varies a bit I was told the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release so I've read.The story concerns a shuttle mission commander by Steve Railsback sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated batlike creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow.A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown.Soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well.Thankfully the Commander survives reentry in the pod crash lands in Texas no less and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls.Tobe Hooper of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' 1974 does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark fresh off 'The Bounty 1984' uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI Return of the Jedi' 1983 and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' 1977 manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this scifi  horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May vampire queen.

The only thing they didn't touch on was religion but I think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod.In short yeah right 800 words later 'Lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged at least at the time and horror and scifi fans engaged. 4 of 5.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tobe Hooper fresh off mainstream success with 'Poltergeist' aims for the skies this time around. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script by 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby varies a bit I was told the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release so I've read.The story concerns a shuttle mission commander by Steve Railsback sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated batlike creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow.A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown.Soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well.Thankfully the Commander survives reentry in the pod crash lands in Texas no less and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls.Tobe Hooper of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' 1974 does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark fresh off 'The Bounty 1984' uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI Return of the Jedi' 1983 and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' 1977 manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this scifi  horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May vampire queen. Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. That comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul.

	schema:reviewBody "I tend to revisit this one every halfdozen or so years and in the words of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band its always guaranteed to raise a smile. I think the first time I saw it was on TV when I was very young and with my parents. Although we only caught the last half hour of it so the nude walkabouts and the middle section where they are roughing up the woman at the asylum had already passed us by I don't think my parents would have allowed me to keep watching it if they hadn't and so my parents were spared any awkward child to parent questions like whats an extreme masochist and what did that man mean when he called himself as a natural voyeur.Watching it again I did pick up on there being an overlap in terms of content between it and Return of the Living Dead what with both films featuring fast moving zombies and sharing a scene where a skeletal female corpse returns to life on an operating table. Obviously the direct link there is Dan O'Bannon having been the screenwriter of both movies and Hooper having been pencilled in to direct Return of the Living Dead at one point. So I guess a couple of ideas they came up with for Return of the Living Dead also found their way into the Lifeforce script as well especially in light of the fact that there is no zombie apocalypse in the 'Space Vampires' source novel. Ironically Lifeforce puts you in mind of so many films that came before it Alien Night of the Living Dead Hammer's Quatermass films and variants like X The Unknown and yet one of the few significant horror films it isn't reminiscent of is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Not for a second does Lifeforce feel like a film from the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre whereas you do get a TCM vibe from Hooper's Death Trap and to a lesser extent Salem's Lot. I find it interesting that the film's trailer and original advertising hypes it as being from the director of Poltergeist rather than TCM and do suspect that had Lifeforce equalled the success of Poltergeist it would have led to a second stage in Tobe Hooper's career as a bankable director of big budget special effects driven blockbusters as would later happen with Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson. Whereas the boxoffice failure of the film and Hooper's retreat back to lowbudget horror soon after means that Lifeforce and especially Poltergeist now feel like career abnormalities as Hooper is still strongly defined by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a way that Raimi and Jackson no longer are by The Evil Dead or Bad Taste. I think time is being kind of Hooper's career though there seems to be allot more people fighting the corner for Lifeforce and TCM2 these days than back when those films first came out. It was once quite fashionable to knock Hooper I remember there was an especially damning career overview published in 'Deep Red' magazine in the late 1980s that portrayed him as being a talent that had gone astray and sold out to Hollywood. There is a tendency to look more generously on his films these days though if only because so many of his contemporaries have similarly suffered from career declines and fallen from grace with their fanbases. Latter day Hooper films like Spontaneous Combustion and Crocodile might never measure up to his earlier work but then again they're no worse than what Romero and Argento come up with these days.I was watching it recently mindful of there being growing rumours that a Lifeforce remake is in the works and whether or not remaking the film is really justified. So I was a little surprised as to how much the special effects in the film hold up. Admittedly the fake Patrick Stewart head and the burning model village doubling for London do cause you to wince but the early scenes onboard the spaceship and Halley's Comet which are the scenes I'd expected to date badly wouldn't look out of place on the big screen these days. For a Cannon film there is also a real absence of period trappings which you certainly can't say about the The Exterminator 2 or Ninja 3 The Domination with their aerobics and break dancing scenes. I do know that the original Space Vampires novel is set in the future and while the film drops that angle I suspect the fact that it is based on a futuristic source novel lends it a timeless feel. Of course the film does also manage to dodge the fashions of its day by virtue of the fact that the first twenty minutes or so features the majority of the cast in spacesuits and one cast member wearing nothing at all. I don't have a big downer on remakes though and am curious as to what they'll come up with should this Lifeforce remake come to fruition but to me there is nothing in the original that really cries out to be remade in order to bring it in line with the tastes of modern audiences. Whereas with say An American Werewolf In London you can imagine some Hollywood exec looking at that film nowadays and insisting it is in need of an update on account that there are aspects to it that aren't really relevant to the world of today no one for instance goes to a cinema to watch porn anymore and the gag about there only being three television channels in Britain is meaningless today. I can't see a great deal in Lifeforce though that overly ties it to the 1980s although it would have been hilarious if GolanGlobus has insisted that the zombies had to do a bit of break dancing at one point.".

	schema:headline " I very much prefer the DVD release and still wish they had included even more footage from the space sequence which was cut down tremendously.";
	schema:reviewBody "I disagree with a previous review that wishes the film were release as the version played in the U.S. in the 80s and put on video. This version was chopped up so much it was confusing and very disappointing. Of course one does not know this until one views the DVD release. In the U.S. version Hooper must have bowed to pressure that the movie was not scary enough so he had composer Henry Mancini change much of his music go back to London rerecord and even then the producers or Hooper wasn't happy. Mancini said enough! and Hooper used other composers. Then he cut the film to pieces and moved bits around. Once I viewed the DVD I realized the original release was a MESS. I much appreciated the campiness of the movie and do not see it as some scifi horror flick. Much of the acting is over the top I think the leads were miscast  I like Railsback but why he was chosen as the obsessive and tormented character I don't know and Firth was the campiest of all. The story goes from a space scifi movie to a vampire movie then concludes as a zombie movie. Way too much but fascinating all the same. I don't think all movies have to be Golden Palm winners at Cannes and should sometimes be silly but really fun. I think the original intention was to craft a film that was more adventure than horror. But after production they decided to go horror for whatever reason perhaps audience reaction to previews which always mucks things up and that actually made the film worse because of the lastminute amendments. I prefer the adventure version on DVD. My favorite aspect is of course Henry Mancini's score which played in full demonstrates the original intent of adventure. I also like that they restored the dialog and the original opening credits which actually is still not complete. I remember the U.S. video and when I saw the DVD I could not understand why they removed so much. The dumbest lines are the best! One of the grand things about DVDs especially for us film buffs is that they give us the opportunity to see the original vision  as if we were denied this in the theaters. Unlike other reviewers I would like to see even more footage added I have a CD of all the music and listening to so many cues it's evident that much was still cut even on the DVD. If I won the lottery I'd restore everything myself... the original space sequence was supposed to be free of most dialog with the astronauts taking a look at the alien ship. Zombies don't have to be running around and bombs don't have to be going off to make a film interesting. Be patient don't rush things.Another crappy thing about the U.S. video version is the horrid sound effects which I suppose were added to try to frighten the audience. The added miserable sound effects become quickly annoying such as when the bloodlady forms in the helicopter and the dead bodies are screeching. Thankfully this is toned down a lot in the DVD. When I watched the video a long time ago with some friends their only comment was God this movie is loud.So here's an idea. Put the completely restored version AND the U.S. released version on the DVD with commentary behind the scenes stuff etc. and that would satisfy all of us! Comparisons can be fun for us film buffs.".

This version was chopped up so much it was confusing and very disappointing. Of course one does not know this until one views the DVD release. In the U.S. version Hooper must have bowed to pressure that the movie was not scary enough so he had composer Henry Mancini change much of his music go back to London rerecord and even then the producers or Hooper wasn't happy.

Imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent scifi story but with completely over the top performances. I still enjoyed the movie tremendously as well as Mathilda May but it was a mixture of nostalgia comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended.Bottom line if you are a scifi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie. Oh and did I mention Mathilda May is young beautiful and naked?".

And talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history  its though it was written in chapters by several different people. Take for instance Carlson  he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered Brits and its this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film . And theres plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to London in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill theyre flying over it .I could go on at great length about these plot holes but LIFEFORCE is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you dont use your brain . Its good to see a scifi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldnt get their hands on them . The special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good  theres lots of action and stunts and LIFEFORCE features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl . When mentioning LIFEFORCE in conversation with males its always a race to say  Seen the alien in LIFEFORCE? She can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime  Hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females Dont worry . A naked girl cant escape from here  Cant she ? Pity".

	schema:reviewBody "I first watched this film as part of my big zombie kick started by DAWN OF THE DEAD when I was a teenager maybe 12 years ago and didn't much care for it. As a zombie film I found LIFEFORCE to be immensely disappointing with very little of what I considered real zombie action. Don't get me wrong there's lots of mayhem and chaos in the final reel but the zombies run around fast and are in the gray area where they're almost more vampires than zombies. It's just too bizarre and sloppy if you go in expecting a Romerostyle straightforward action horror romp.Seeing the film as an adult I can find a lot of new things to appreciate. For one the cast is fantastic with Steve Railsback in fullon goofball mode only hinted at in his earlier starring roles in STUNT MAN and TURKEY SHOOT. Solid British performers Patrick Stewart Peter Firth Frank Finlay and John Hallam all pop by in strong supporting roles with relative unknown Firth pretty much replacing Railsback as hero slowly but surely as the film progresses. The special effects are excellent beyond their years and should be in bold font on John Dykstra's CV. Add to that it's got a lot of imagination and energy which you just don't see in too many scifihorror movies... and there's just the right balance with gore and unpleasantness to keep it shocking yet not grating.LIFEFORCE is not necessarily a good film but at least it stays entertaining. What it fails to do is really present a narrative in a way that feels like it makes proper sense. For one thing the movie makes the odd decision about halfway through to send the two protagonists to an insane asylum where they inexplicably spend the next 20 minutes of movie. Suddenly out of nowhere we're plunged back into our main plot with London being overrun with zombies. It's like the movie just took a timeout to up the weirdness factor rather than sticking to its guns.Of the Cannon Group's many offerings this really sticks out like a sore thumb  a film of such ambition never to be attempted by them again.On a final note  LIFEFORCE is well worth watching if nothing else for the excellent use of late 70's  early 80's British Lightning Strike sound effects as heard in the pilot for Space 1999 and FLASH GORDON. ZZZZZZZakorr!!".

Based on the novel space vampireLifeforce made out as a success movie in the 80's. I was tend to watch this movie when i found out at the IMDb which was given an average rating of 5.8. This is actually an unknown movie for there are only about 5000 people who votes on Lifeforce so i'm giving it a chance. The main reason i watched this movie is likely because my friend want to watch a scifi movie. Then i search all around in IMDb and found this one. Tobe Hooper have created good movies recently especially Texas chainsaw massacre funhouse and some others..so i think i should try out Lifeforce.At first the movie is full of suspense not because of its special effect which i think quiet cool for the 80's but the acting the music and how the story lines goes. Actually it makes feel very confusing.. but i kept on watching till i found out what the hell is it all about. At the end i still not fully understand the whole matter of Lifeforce but it is already enough for me and my friend to conclude that this is a good movie. The only thing that i hate about this movie is the sex scenehuhu...overall the plot line is interesting the acting is not incredibly brilliant but still there are good performances from the actors surely not an Oscar material but still a good one.I think that this movie deserves a second chance find it and watch it. I'll rate this movie 10 out of 10..not because it was perfect but just giving it a chance. Honestly i don't think Lifeforce should be given rating of 5.8 out of 10. It should have been higher.".

The only reason why I watched it was that I bought this movie as part of a double feature DVD with the other movie being the excellent Dolph Lundgren actioner THE PEACEKEEPER.There are a few positive things I found in this movie. The movie has good production values a trademark of Millennium FilmsNu Image film companies. The cinematography is good and the movie doesn't look really cheap at any moment. And it was nice to see a movie from these guys that wasn't shot in Bulgaria. There is some nice gratuitous nudity and the story has multiple plot threads that get you curious as to how they will all be resolved at the end.But I didn't think that the movie worked overall for several reasons. There is a lack of sympathetic characters for one thing  you'll wish they will all end up dead. The script also moves very slowly after a while  there should have been more action or big plot turns throughout the narrative. You have to wait for the last twenty minutes before things start to seriously move and things start resolving themselves.Still it could have been worse. I've seen worse Van Dien movies and worse Van Dien performances. If you are pressed to watch a Van Dien movie that's not STARSHIP TROOPERS this is probably the one to watch.".

There are some fairly recognisable names but strictly BC grade actors at best.Casper Van Dien is the likable guy called Jake who happens to work in a bank as a security guard. He has some criminal history which is revealed in the poorly staged opening sequence. Camilla Overbye Roos whom I have never heard of before plays Kristen an attractive femme fatale who is part of a plot to trap Jake and coerce him into stealing money from the Bank.Australian actor Bryan Brown plays Barry he has been planning a bank job and coerced Kristen into ensnaring Jake. He is a violent man and believes he has control over Kristen and owns her but all is not as it seems.Then we have Daniel Baldwin as Ed the owner of the bank who deals with some shady characters and occasionally launders Money.We also have Jakes former partner in crime Sykes played by Bentley Mitchum also a new face to me. A psychotic redneck type who is not too bright and has come looking for payback.Then last but most definitely not least is Rosalita played by the incredibly well endowed Rochelle Swanson. A fiery Mexican Brunette who is so hot she positively sizzles. She is the wife of Ed the Bank Owner and is having an affair with Jake whilst also planning to rob the bank with him.This movie is styled along the lines of UTurn Red Rock West etc. Most of the Characters are in a situation they are looking for a way out of and deception and doublecrosses are never far from their minds.The acting from Casper Van dien was okay Rochelle Swanson was good. The rest of the cast ranged from passable to not so convincing. Still I found this movie to be a quite enjoyable and very watchable experience. For the price it was certainly worth it and past the time quite efficiently. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Casper Van Dien... what can I say? I enjoy the guy! His movies bring a certain flair to them that is actually not brought on by the director or producer but by him! Recycled plots... check. Ripoffs of better movies... check. Wooden acting... check. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor he has been effective in Hollywood gloss as Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow he just really has not been offered a script worthy of his talents and yes he does have acting talent other than being eyecandy. This movie offers a slight hint of what Van Dien can offer but is bogged down by the production of it all. The script can be better developed see Oliver Stone's UTurn. The directing can be better utilized see Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Til Dawn. The DP could've made the desert more exotic see Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat Faster Kill!. This script is weak because this is something we have seen before many other times so the doubletriplecrosses are expected. The direction is weak because it is not offering anything new and telegraphs many of the weak script moments. The cinematography at times paints a lovely autumn desert flavor to it but at other times it doesn't take advantage of the scorching light and the beginning sequence is horrible in cornflower blue.Now to the acting... Van Dien shows some grace and charisma to his Jake. He neither gets too methodical nor too campy in his role. A nice balance especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted as to how they should be acting in this film bad script or bad direction... you make your opinion. The only other person worth mentioning is Bryan Brown's villain as it provides the only real credit for acting in this film... aspiring actors forget trying to learn how to act in green screen try learning how to act in a horrendous script and take notes on Bryan Brown in this film. He adds extra depth to his role and is a nice counter part to Van Dien's character. Jake always seem to either be one step ahead or control of any situation whether if it is out of his control. The femme fatale is weak this is a desert noir after all and is another nail in this film's coffin you decide... script or direction. The Rosalita character should've been thrusted forward in the movie instead of being pushed into the back ground later on to make room for the real femme fatale. So watch the film for Van Dien and Brown and for fun try to skip a rock across the plot holes laced within the film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Casper Van Dien... what can I say? I enjoy the guy! His movies bring a certain flair to them that is actually not brought on by the director or producer but by him! Recycled plots... check. Ripoffs of better movies... check. Wooden acting... check. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor he has been effective in Hollywood gloss as Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow he just really has not been offered a script worthy of his talents and yes he does have acting talent other than being eyecandy. This movie offers a slight hint of what Van Dien can offer but is bogged down by the production of it all. The script can be better developed see Oliver Stone's UTurn. The directing can be better utilized see Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Til Dawn. The DP could've made the desert more exotic see Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat Faster Kill!. This script is weak because this is something we have seen before many other times so the doubletriplecrosses are expected. The direction is weak because it is not offering anything new and telegraphs many of the weak script moments. The cinematography at times paints a lovely autumn desert flavor to it but at other times it doesn't take advantage of the scorching light and the beginning sequence is horrible in cornflower blue.Now to the acting...

This actually happened to me when I was 10 and let me tell you there is no worse horror for a boy at that age. Eugene worries that his life was over as I did. I also remember my first time seeing a picture of a naked woman. A very tame pose by today's standards but like Eugene there was a sense of relief that the quest was finally over. No more was it just the occasional breast shot I too had seen The Golden Palace of the Himalayas. Jonathan Silverman's running narration is hilarious and really makes the movie for me.

	schema:reviewBody "BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS was the first of a trilogy of plays that Neil Simon wrote about his own life renaming himself Eugene Morris Jerome. This play was a Broadway smash and made a star and Tony Award winner out of Matthew Broderick. When it was time to bring the play to the screen Broderick was unavailable because he was back on Broadway in the second play of the trilogy BILOXI BLUES so Jonathan Silverman was pegged to star in the film version as Eugene the slightly neurotic teen going through puberty and other realities of being a Jewish teen during WWII with the help of his loving family. Silverman makes a suitable replacement for Broderick and seems quite at ease speaking directly to the camera. I'm one of the few who really liked Blythe Danner as his strong willed mother...maybe the accent was a bit much but Danner infuses the character with warmth and strength and Bob Dishy has one of his best roles as Eugene's father a quiet tower of strength whose world weariness never allows him to neglect his family. Judith Ivey plays Danner's sister a lonely woman whose lack of selfesteem seems to have stemmed from feeling she has lived in her sister's shadow her whole life and Brian Drillinger also scores as Stanley Eugene's older brother who loses his paycheck gambling and then loses his job and doesn't know how to tell Mom and Dad. Gene Saks directs with a loving if loose hand and the film could have been more tightly paced but the performances of Silverman Danner and Dishy made it worth my time.".

He gives a restrained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family.His sons played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are fabulous. There are certain scenes when Silverman is skating or hopping where I'm reminded of Jerry Lewis.As for Danner and Ivey they too are wonderful. Their mannerisms intonation and idealism of the Jewish culture are beautifully realized by them.The cinematography is just wonderful. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Even as the inevitability of war loomed the film is rich with many of the typical problems faced by families in that period. In a sense you don't have to be Jewish to experience what the family is going through.A must see for nostalgic buffs and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.".

The characters were funny the music was great and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters flaws and all. Jonathan Silverman has such good comedic timing and his lines especially are hilarious. I'm not going to give any spoilers it's just a nicely done funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle class family during WWII.

We therefore are asked to accept that this tale is a reasonable approximation of the attitudes and values of a firstgeneration workingclass Jewish family of the 1930s. Yet one of the key elements of the narrative presents a situation that is virtually unbelievable which is that the family accepts and even encourages the prospect of a serious relationship between one of its members and an alcoholic Irish Catholic. It's also doubtful that the suitor's mother would have viewed her son's interest in a Jewish widow with the equanimity her character displays but that just demonstrates Simon's cluelessness about a world beyond his own. But what's his excuse for such egregious ignorance of the one he purports to be representing?

Instead of leaving the theater with a smile on your face and a tear in your eye you leave moody and depressed. This is not how one is supposed to feel after seeing a comedy.This is the film version of one of Neil Simon's very best plays. On stage it is full of energy wit and spunk. On film or at least this film it's all very flat like day old cola.One major problem is the casting. Jonathan Silverman is all wrong as Eugene Jerome. He's too willing to play Eugene in Jerry Lewis style. There's nothing wrong with Jerry Lewis style I happen to love that style of comedy. But that approach just doesn't work for this play. A better choice would have been Matthew Broderick who played Eugene on stage and ironically was cast in Biloxi BluesAs Eugene's mother Blythe Danner is onedimensional. WHAT????? Blythe Danner onedimensional in a movie? God I wish I was joking. There is nothing sadder than to see an actress who is capable of bringing so much passion to a maternal role The Great Santini Man Woman and Child The Invisible Circusstruggling to find this character. The only one who more or less gets the job done is Judith Ivey as Blanche. She plays it exactly the way it should be subtle yet passionate. She goes all out in her performance. It's all for naught.Do I blame Neil Simon? Not at all. The material was there to begin with and it's one of the best plays I've ever read and performed in my acting class. Do I blame Gene Saks? Not completely. Saks is a very capable director with some good films behind his belt Mame The Odd Couple Barefoot in the Park the latter two being two of the best Neil Simon adaptations made so far. But here his direction is lackluster I don't know what happened but he fails to make this material work as well as it did on Couple and Barefoot. Maybe studio interference? Just asking.The photography is murky and dark. I know they were trying to recreate a long gone era but sheesh this isn't film noir. A little brightness can go a long way.Forget about Brighton Beach Memoirs. You'd be much better off watching a high school or community revival than seeing this cinematic travesty.  out of 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Not! But for the young Jewish Eugene Jonathan Silverman taking over the role he played on Broadway originated by Matthew Broderick he's living in a much more innocent time where his biggest challenges include making it across the street with the glass milk bottle in his hand that his mother made him return for the deposit keeping his drawings of the female anatomy out of the hands of his older brother and trying to control his lust for his sexy cousin Lisa Waltz and even his own widowed aunt Judith Ivey. If this makes Eugene sound a bit sick or at least majorly weird it gives him various characteristics and confirms his heterosexuality.The semiautobiographical series of plays by Neil Simon seem stagy to some but in an era of blockbusters Hamlet on screen with Laurence Olivier would be stagy! Silverman's Eugene is surrounded by a wonderfully eccentric Jewish family much like Woody Allen's clan in Radio Days just miles away at Far Rockaway. The wonderful Blythe Danner allows her beautiful face to be dowdied as the hard working mother with a hidden bitterness towards her sister Bob Dishy as the quietly understanding father whom everybody goes to for sage advice Stacey Glick as the precocious sister watch Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt and see if you don't see a similarity with that family's youngest daughter Anne and Brian Drillinger is the troubled older brother who is faced with humiliation for standing up to his tyrannical boss. Ivey one of the gems of stage screen and television totally reminds me of the lovable Dianne Wiest's character in Radio Days with her ever optimistic attitude that never fades even though romances come and go. Dishy who played a couple of eccentric characters on Golden Girls Mr. Terrific for example is totally recognizable but the usually sophisticated Danner Will Truman's mother on Will and Grace DeNiro's wife in Meet the Parents etc. bravely lets herself go and gives a performance of massive strength and understatement.While Radio Days took place throughout World War II this is set in the late 1930's with mentions of Europe at War on the radio that Dishy demands that nobody touch. This is more of a linear plot line than Woody Allen's sketchy but hysterically funny film. The sweetness and less in your face crudeness of today's films helps make this stand out in a nostalgic yet not cloying manner of We had a better life than you do today way that some film makers remind us of. Ivey and Danner would ironically be reunited 15 years later for the first Broadway revival of Follies. Teenagers and adolescents of the 30's and 40's in my opinion did have it better with the Masked Avenger Ring and Jitterbugging a great predecessor to today's IPads Cellphones and Crap Music.".

These suggested dialogs make the movie inappropriate for children under 13 It's rated PG13 I would probably wait until my kids were 15 before letting them see this movie for the suggestive sex dialogs. Note that some are strong especially in many of the conversations with Johnathon and his brother Stanly.

	schema:reviewBody "Stinger is a real bythenumbers creature feature affair.SPOILERSFollowing the reappearance of a thoughtlost submarine containing topsecret material a rescue team Dr. Carly Ryan Michelle Meadows Dom Paterno Richard Froelich and Miss Winters Daniella Vesterlund with a squad of Marines are sent to the submerged sub. Upon finding the submarine crew in pieces they decide to get the ship's cargo before anything happens to it. As they venture further and further into the sub they are attacked and killed onebyone by a swarm of scorpions. Revealing them to be genetically mutated scorpions Dr. Ryan helps the Marines to get off the ship safely.The Good News There's some rather nice stuff here. The best part is it's undeniable charm and cheesy feel. There's not a whole lot more going on other than those two and the five the movie a nice little feel that will surely affect the more cheesefriendly fans out there. It's all in there for them to enjoy and it supplies it quite nicely. The setting gives the film a great claustrophobic setting that has a great feel to it. The circumstances around it make it all the better as we know that they're trapped and that adds a lot to the suspense involved. The film does have some rather nice action sequences later on and they're not quite that bad. The initial sweep of the submarine features lots of good gunplay and a couple of chases later on aren't that bad either. The rest isn't all that bad.The Bad News There are several things in here that weren't spectacular. The fact the film offers so few shots of the creatures is a good thing as they look so bad and unrealistic that it's almost impossible to really be frightened of them. It's not so much that they're fake but the fact that they're so obviously fake is what's distracting. Whatever is used to depict them in whatever scenario they're used as either the CGI ones that get the most screentime or the robotic versions that are around less the creatures are uniformly fake no matter what and shouldn't cause much of a scare. They are also seen so late in the film that the first half is mostly an inconsequential bore. Nothing happens other than getting them onboard and looking around. There's no way it should've taken up that much screen time as other films have done it before with the same storyline and their's isn't anywhere this long. To say that this doesn't have any real originality at all would be useless as it's one large clich after another and really shouldn't have been brought up.

	onyx:emotionText "Stinger is a real bythenumbers creature feature affair.SPOILERSFollowing the reappearance of a thoughtlost submarine containing topsecret material a rescue team Dr. Carly Ryan Michelle Meadows Dom Paterno Richard Froelich and Miss Winters Daniella Vesterlund with a squad of Marines are sent to the submerged sub. Upon finding the submarine crew in pieces they decide to get the ship's cargo before anything happens to it. As they venture further and further into the sub they are attacked and killed onebyone by a swarm of scorpions. Revealing them to be genetically mutated scorpions Dr. Ryan helps the Marines to get off the ship safely.The Good News There's some rather nice stuff here. The best part is it's undeniable charm and cheesy feel. There's not a whole lot more going on other than those two and the five the movie a nice little feel that will surely affect the more cheesefriendly fans out there. It's all in there for them to enjoy and it supplies it quite nicely. The setting gives the film a great claustrophobic setting that has a great feel to it. The circumstances around it make it all the better as we know that they're trapped and that adds a lot to the suspense involved. The film does have some rather nice action sequences later on and they're not quite that bad. The initial sweep of the submarine features lots of good gunplay and a couple of chases later on aren't that bad either. The rest isn't all that bad.The Bad News There are several things in here that weren't spectacular. The fact the film offers so few shots of the creatures is a good thing as they look so bad and unrealistic that it's almost impossible to really be frightened of them. It's not so much that they're fake but the fact that they're so obviously fake is what's distracting. Whatever is used to depict them in whatever scenario they're used as either the CGI ones that get the most screentime or the robotic versions that are around less the creatures are uniformly fake no matter what and shouldn't cause much of a scare. They are also seen so late in the film that the first half is mostly an inconsequential bore. Nothing happens other than getting them onboard and looking around. There's no way it should've taken up that much screen time as other films have done it before with the same storyline and their's isn't anywhere this long. To say that this doesn't have any real originality at all would be useless as it's one large clich after another and really shouldn't have been brought up.

It's not long before the scorpions attack first to fall is Lt.

It's early into the new year  Stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monstercreatureinsect type film I've seen in 2007 hopefully things can only get better... The script by Mat Nastos is incredibly clichd  gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably Aliens 1986 lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine there's the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film there's the scientists including a blonde Sweedish one to try  explain it all  the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life  the final ingredient being the monsteralieninsect or whatever in this case there's loads of large scorpions running around but they're not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers. Yeah it's all here unfortunately Stinger isn't an Aliens if you get what I mean. It's a touch long at over 100 minutes  it's throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace  as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the IMDb...Director Munthe doesn't distinguish himself it's not scary there's a lack of atmosphere  the action scenes are dull  unexciting. There's not many scorpion attacks  it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but I have seen worse that's for sure. I mean that's not to say the effects in Stinger are good but I've seen worse. There isn't much blood or gore there's some mutilated bodies some decapitated heads  someone is ripped in half. The only clever  amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked Sweedish female scientist ask's her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions... However there was a moment which had me groaning  tearing my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarine's circuitry  get the lights working by hitting the power supplycomputer boards with a hammer  it works as well...Technically Stinger is average at best  there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweeden if your interested. The acting was poor  there's nothing else to say.Stinger isn't a great film  it isn't a great horror film either I can't recommend it at all but I've seen worse. If you liked Stinger unlikely you might like the similarly themed 'giant scorpions on the loose' films Tail Sting 2001 or Scorpius Gigantus 2006 just as unlikely.".

The filler dialouge had excellent camp value. In fact I really hated for the plot to progress because the necessary plot dialouge was boring by comparison. There were a lot of dark scenes as in lack of lighting and plot continuity issues. At one point they decided not to bring back the deadly giant radioactive scorpions. The Navy doesn't want to salvage the sub so what do they do? a leave the hatch open when they leave and flood the boat. b seal the sub and let the scorpions expire from an eventual lack of food and air. c Decide to risk life and limb on a search and destroy mission in a submarine.

I can only conclude the military simply didn't have enough in its budget to send out search and rescue. Two months is a long time to allow scorpions to run amok on a submarine. The dialogue is ridiculous often boarding on idiotic at points. If you like watching soldiers waste bullets on nonexisting targets this is a movie to watch. I spent most of the movie hoping the scorpions would win. None of the characters are likable except Lazlo Hollyfield an autistic science team member who doesn't live very long. Dom Paterno is one of those idiots for hire who is willing to risk multiple lives to obtain millions to return a living scorpion and an egg to the research company. His companion Ellie is only there to supply unnecessary TA. Dr. Carly Ryan spends too much time on the Top Secret BS line companies like to give civilians and military put in danger because of company stupidity. The obvious solution to ensure the scorpions never reach the surface is to blow up the submarine. Dr. Carly and her buddy Mike who is seriously suffering from PTSD among other things are the only two who reach the rescue submersible the group had taken to the submarine. When the submarine explodes there's no shock waves. There should be shock waves which would send the submersible careening across the screen. The submersible simply glides as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. The worst CGI appears when Mike reveals PTSD isn't his only issue. I give this a 4 because people worked hard on an obviously low budget to do the best the could.".

Director Martin Munthe does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience. The movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all qualities of a Bfilm horror movie. It is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It is great to see that movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films.".

It is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It is great to see that movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films.";

	schema:reviewBody "With Green Butchers aka De Grnne Slagtere we are in the territory previously marked out by Sweeney Todd Eating Raoul Delicatessen and the like art house cannibalism. The peculiar flavour of writerdirector Anders Thomas Jensen's film is partly explained by this choice of subject as well as his involvement in the Dogme film movement having contributed scripts for Mifune 1999 The King is Alive 2000 as well as Open Hearts 2002. The Dogme movement has made a virtue of making films to a strictly naturalistic series of rules the severity of which whether entirely serious or not was intended to force the truth out of characters and settings. Green Butchers is not a Dogme film but some of its characteristics owe themselves to an artistic manifesto which instructed its adherents to make films by all means available even at the cost of good taste if necessary.It's Jensen's second feature film after the wellreceived Flickering Lights aka Blinkende Lygter 2000  a film which also starred Mikkelsen and Kaas another comedydrama. Jensen's sly dry humour is much in evidence here too as we follow the business of his two misfit butchers 'Sweaty' Svend and pot smoking Bjarne into the path of making meals out of unwanted humans. As critics have observed this is a film with two intertwined threads with much overt and grisly dark comedy revolving around Sven a man who has never been loved. He's apparently unable to show anyone the inside of his freezer without adding them to the chilled cabinet for the customers next morning prepared as his speciality dish 'Chicky Wicky'. Bjarne's story brings to the narrative more in the way of pathos and sweetness as while struggling with the predations of his increasingly erratic partner in butchery he also has to come to terms with the sudden revival of his brain damaged twin brother as well as burgeoning relationship with the slightly nave Astrid.Playing both Bjarne and twin Eigil Nikolaj Lie Kaas is remarkable in giving entirely separate performances throughout so much so that I was going to make him a name to watch but a quick look at his filmography reveals that he has already made 28 including one related to his portrayal here the notorious Dogme film Idiots of 1998 of which no fewer than 20 will have appeared in the last five years! The Walkenesque Mikkelsen who is perhaps most familiar to British and American viewers as Tristan in the recent version of King Arthur is also memorable offering up Svend's characteristic sweaty culpability whilst sporting an unnaturally high damp forehead an onscreen effect gained we learn by a watering unit ingeniously devised by the special effects department.In the interviews which accompany the film on disc Jensen mentions how keen he was to make something better than farce out of his subject matter and if it has a fault it is that his film occasional teeters too far in the opposite direction refusing some obvious opportunities to show the comedy of panic or grim humour. Instead Dogme's metier means that Green Butchers unfolds slowly with more natural pauses and silences and an unforced lunacy all of its own. Such deadpan absurdity frequently pays dividends one especially relishes Svend's quiet words to the newly returned Eigel soft toy under his arm that he should point the giraffe somewhere else so that we can talk calmly again although there have been complaints from some that a sharper edge to the bloody proceedings other than those demonstrated by Bjarne and Svend's knives would have been welcome. To be sure some cannibalistic movies such as Romero's Dawn Of The Dead bring an apt comment on consumerism. Instead Jensen's film relates slaughter back to interior matters such as Svend's compulsive murderous need to be loved and successful  a result he eventually achieves through his marinade  or even by placing the act of butchery in a entirely different context outside of society altogether. For instance the comment by Holger famous for his deer sausages that It's mythological to kill an animal and then mock it by sticking it in its own intestine. Outraged by the role that nature played in provoking the death of his parents Bjarne sees his work as specifically an act of revenge on animals not people a logic that places him apart from such characters as Sweeney Todd. While the eager consumers of Chicky Wickys queue up outside the shop eager for their next portion obvious satire is played down. In interview the cast and writer see the film's focus elsewhere on coming to terms with one's fate or learning to live at peace with oneself.Of course interior states are always subjective rather than objective. And if the Dogme creed values strict naturalism then Green Butchers is a film which although related to the movement by eschewing overt dramatics it never the less inhabits a separate almost fantasy world of its own  another point acknowledged on the DVD's accompanying interviews. It's a place not unaopposed to the fertile and dark imaginations of Caro and Jeunet to whose successful Delicatessen it has sometimes been compared if without their Gallic flamboyance and whose odd elements gradually fit into a weird whole. Indeed the last scene of the film makes the point succinctly drawing together the principal characters in a moment that is both playful absurd and unifying at the same time. Given the unique nature of Green Butchers how often does one see a Danish cannibalism movie? as well as uniformly excellent performances it can be recommended.".

THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and wickedly funny comedy in many ways the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN but it has more on offer than just laughs or parody. The film brings us the duo of chronic pothead Bjarne Nikolaj Lie Kaas and chronic perspirer Svend Mads Mikkelsen. Sick of their evil boss the two pals decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town but initially business is slow and customers stay away. When an electrician is accidentally locked up and freezes in their meat locker Svend decides to turn the man's thigh into fillets he promptly nicknames chickiewickies. This special dish suddenly has everyone in town flocking to their counter and Svend  unable to resist this sudden leap into popularity  turns into a serial killer with Bjarne acting as his reluctant accomplice. But soon led by their exboss many people in town are starting to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using.Without the extraordinary performances by Kaas and Mikkelsen the film might not have risen above the level of the average black comedy. On paper the character of Svend might border on caricature but Mads Mikkelsen portrait is that of an earnest insecure and deeply twisted man but Mikkelsen manages to make him frightening funny and moving at the same time. Kaas actually plays a double role also playing his comatose twin brother Eigil. When watching the film I never even realized it was the same actor. The other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town refreshingly offthehook with some truly wonderful vignettes.The subject material is  naturally  a bit morbid and the material might not be completely fresh considering quite a few predecessors that handled the same kind of material but director Jensen gives it a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo of Svend and Bjarne with this wonderfully bizarre tale of two social misfits.Camera Obscura  910".

The chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and won't appeal to everyone but personally I found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd. You pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murder.This is in my judgment definitely the best Danish movie of the last few years.9 out of 10.".

The character depth derived in this film is AMAZING. The way Svend and Eigel sorry if those are spelled wrong feed off each other's contrasting personas is downright spectacular! The actors were wellcast and I'm very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration...it needs very little of Bjorne and what'sherface...just give me Svend and Eigel on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue! To the author of this fine screenplay I say Write more! The story itself is rather twisted but you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow...with no remorse. PLEASE check this movie out!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama about two guys who worked in a Butcher's shop and wanted to build up their own. When they finally fulfilled that dream they faced a new problem there were no clients! One day by accident one guy dies in the refrigerator room and a new kind of butcher's business begins They start selling human flesh saying to the clients it's just chicken and their business starts to improve Human flesh sells good! Oh! I forgot to say something These guys aren't normal! There's really something missing in their brains! The movie has some nice dark humour scenes but it is in my opinion mostly a drama. One that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does. I must confess I was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because I never expected they could make it without been discovered but that's probably because I see too many Hollywood movies What I mean by this is that in Hollywood's cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things. There's always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesn't happen this way too many times And I liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake moralities and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality It just happens in independent cinema especially in the European! Besides there're excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen especially the first one in the roles of the disturbed guys Very nice Danish film!".

One that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does. I must confess I was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because I never expected they could make it without been discovered but that's probably because I see too many Hollywood movies What I mean by this is that in Hollywood's cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things. There's always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesn't happen this way too many times And I liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake moralities and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality It just happens in independent cinema especially in the European! Besides there're excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen especially the first one in the roles of the disturbed guys Very nice Danish film!";

And if you do this comparison sadly The Green Butchers will fall short.It lacks the visual gags of the French classic its characters are underdeveloped and kind of distant and the story has its bumps too. As far as the humor goes there are a couple of good lines but altogether I didn't find the film particularly funny. And it's not me against black comedy because I like the genre but I think a film like this in order to be really amusing needs characters that are genuinely funny in their quirkiness. Unfortunately in Green Butchers there weren't any and on top of that the scenes involving the twin brother were more embarrassing than comic. I also felt that the two Danish stars were not as comfortable in their roles as they should have been to be able to portray them effectively.So the Danish Delicatessen was a bit of a letdown for me considering the high standard movies from Denmark have set lately. Maybe if you see it without having Delicatessen in your mind the experience would be better it won't be an easy job because the filmmakers were obviously aware of the French movie and included various hints at it throughout.".

These are of course the main driving force in the movie but they are well accompanied and supported by people such as Ole Thestrup playing Holger.The movie is set in a small town in Denmark and it actually depicts such a community quite well well aside from the murdering and turning corpses into food of course. The movie does have a cannibalistic topic to it but it addresses this with a great sense of humor and that ghastly topic is not really the main issue for the storyline.

Even Michele Bauer's appearance at the very beginning can't save it. Usually in these kinds of films you expect violence suspense and a little gore and some TA. The violence was poorly executed the suspense was laughable there was NO gore and the TA is plentiful IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES then NOTHING. At least one of these things properly done would have at least made it watchable. To say at least one nice thing about it Buck Flower is great he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly hams it up. If everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun no pun intended.".

Usually in these movies the actresses aren't really acting they give very natural performances and they're quite sympathetic fun and likable. Not here. They don't have much of any personality and I didn't care for them much.Some of the girls go on a camping trip for school. On the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang. The biker gang should really have been left out of the movie  it was cheesy before but now it's just plain stupid. The head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them.I don't really know what the heck happens after that. There's a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it's the end of the millennium then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious Indian dude who keeps disappearing. Somebody gets eaten by a cheesy Lock Ness Monster thing as he's swimming across a lake. Some guy in silly makeup is apparently a Druid and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world. Or maybe cause the end of the world I'm afraid I wasn't paying much attention. First he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie.It could have been a really fun cheesy movie but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn't even live up to my grade Z schlock expectations. They really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things. Instead it's all over the place. Overall if you're looking for late '80 schlock I imagine you could do worse. If you tried really hard. There's plenty of nudity at the beginning but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.".

For a long time there were rumors of a Cheerleader Camp 2 existing featuring a young Uma Thurman but being basically impossible to find. I even own a movie review book that came out about 5 years ago that has a synopsis of the alleged Cheeleader Camp 2. I don't have any idea how that review came to be because there is no sequel. The fact of the matter is is that this film began shooting as Cheerleader Camp 2 but when a different production company took over filming the title and story was changed. The finished product now stand as it's own film and was actually originally released as The Millennium Countdown. That whole story is more interesting than anything the finished product has to offer. The movie starts out right with featuring plenty of T and A hinting at a possibly good B horror movie. The story is about college girls who go with their professor to a remote lake to search for Indian artifacts. They find themselves terrorized by a biker gang a giant demon and a monster in a lake. The lowrank production is hampered with bad dialog wooden acting and a lack of terror and violence something that usually makes a lowbudget horror film work. The film's big finale is hokey and inane and there are no real special effects to even mention. The steady pace is the only thing to keep the undemanding viewer watching but in the end they will probably be disappointed. The movie moves along fine with all it's flaws there just isn't anything else in this to recommend. For some reason this movie reminded me of Sorority Girls And The Creature From Hell. Very average Bmovie viewing. Two Stars.".

I was drunk at the time and that might explain why.Camp Fear has very little nudity and almost no blood. What it does have is a surprisingly well written script being performed by actors who have no idea that what they are reading is a comedy. Yes this movie is a comedy. The director and the actors play it totally straight and guess what it's even funnier because of it. Now this is a so bad it's good funny.Spoilers from here on out Let us go through the highlights off this movie. You have two random shower scenes one with Michelle Bauer and one with porn star Savanna. Both girls have a total of about five lines show their breasts and then vanish. Next you have a random song and dance number. I'm not joking. For a good five minutes this movie goes musical with a full lambada. It's hilarious. The song is terrible. The dancing is decent. Well except for Tiffany who looks like she's having a seizure. After this you get a half decent women in danger movie. This part actually worked. The bikers that attack the girls are silly but there are a few scenes where they are actually menacing. It stays like this for a while until... a giant rubber looking lake monster well... a sea monster in the lake eats one of the bikers. You see this head float towards the guy open it's mouth and then the guy goes under water. You never see the monster again. Right after that we are introduced to his servant the Giant Druid. This guy had me laughing the entire movie. It's all so random that I just kind of stopped caring about the plot and enjoyed the silliness. So apparently the thing in the lake needs four female virgin sacrifices. Well... the thing in the lake eats two bikers and a homeless man and then Tiffany is sacrificed more on this later. So I guess they all were secretly young female virgins. Oh well...Oh and why do they have to be sacrificed? To stop the end of the world of course. Well kind of. You see the movie takes place in 1990 and the end of the world happens at the end of the second millennium. So... the druid and lakesea monster thingy are getting a head start.Now did I mention there is no blood in this movie? There really isn't. The most extreme violence is during Tiffany's death. This is the reason I have th spoiler warning people. She gets her throat cut. When she does this huge geyser of red paint floods out of her neck... kind of. It more or less comes out next to her neck and then runs over her face. And the entire time... Tiffany is laughing. Yes she is laughing. Oh what acting.So is Camp Fear a good movie? NO! It's terrible. It's from RetroMedia people. They put out bad movies on purpose. This is a classic midnight movie. Camp Fear is a funny movie. Get a few beers a few friends and pop this baby in. You'll have a blast. Trust me.".

	schema:headline " It Has Been Proved! God Does Exist!";
	schema:reviewBody "Why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty? Well its deductive logic my friends you see I know God exists because Satan does how else would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrendous film? Yes there is no doubt about it on a cold Friday in the year 2006 Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film. He what? You wonder the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb ceilings why would he waste his time in making you watch this film? My only conclusion to that query is that Satan believes watching Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment not gouging out your eyes or making you speak in tongues instead making you sit mindlessly through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever. Can this film be as terrible as he says? Yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times maybe more. But maybe I am being too harsh this film does have a few moments in it the beginning for example starts in a sorority house with a lot of topless girls now never being in a sorority I am unsure if girls really do this but hey one can always pray. Now after the five minutes of boobs and butt cheeks has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college the girls themselves about eight in all are in an archaeological class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. Flash forward the professor of the class who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently takes a handful of his nubile students plus girlfriend to a remote lake in the mountains their quests to find ancient Indian artifacts yeah right professor we know what angle your pitching. Now this is where the movie gets going the group of five four girls one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and harasses the girls only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways. Moving on they get to a campsite consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong. First the prof. and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them only to be captured by some unknown force. Continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the bikers plus one drunk guy come looking for them their plan to rape the girls and do horrible things to them. The movie goes on with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand but their is a hitch to this plan Mr. Druid one of the girls is devirginized right before us so away goes that plan. Now since I said there would be spoilers I'll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you the four girls get taken drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed after one of them is killed the two remaining bikers and the prof. come to save them they stand upon a ledge where the not lead biker says I think I can make it down there! only to leap down and break his leg. The prof. runs at the guy and gets subdued only leaving the once rapemindednowheroic biker left to fend off the 6'3 giant druid. First he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife the knife reflects some lazer beam within a gold snakes mouth and lights the druid on fire instantaneously. Afterwords they carry the wounded away via emergency stick stretchers and ponder if everything is really over only to have the lake bubble showing the monster within it still lives. In a nutshell that is the film and this is my review which unfortunately will go unread by most eyes since this is only the fifth posted review for a film that has been out for fifteen years. Thankfully Satan can only get to some of us and not all.

	onyx:emotionText "Why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty? Well its deductive logic my friends you see I know God exists because Satan does how else would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrendous film? Yes there is no doubt about it on a cold Friday in the year 2006 Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film. He what? You wonder the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb ceilings why would he waste his time in making you watch this film? My only conclusion to that query is that Satan believes watching Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment not gouging out your eyes or making you speak in tongues instead making you sit mindlessly through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever. Can this film be as terrible as he says? Yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times maybe more. But maybe I am being too harsh this film does have a few moments in it the beginning for example starts in a sorority house with a lot of topless girls now never being in a sorority I am unsure if girls really do this but hey one can always pray. Now after the five minutes of boobs and butt cheeks has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college the girls themselves about eight in all are in an archaeological class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. Flash forward the professor of the class who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently takes a handful of his nubile students plus girlfriend to a remote lake in the mountains their quests to find ancient Indian artifacts yeah right professor we know what angle your pitching. Now this is where the movie gets going the group of five four girls one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and harasses the girls only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways. Moving on they get to a campsite consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong. First the prof. and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them only to be captured by some unknown force. Continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the bikers plus one drunk guy come looking for them their plan to rape the girls and do horrible things to them. The movie goes on with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand but their is a hitch to this plan Mr. Druid one of the girls is devirginized right before us so away goes that plan. Now since I said there would be spoilers I'll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you the four girls get taken drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed after one of them is killed the two remaining bikers and the prof. come to save them they stand upon a ledge where the not lead biker says I think I can make it down there! only to leap down and break his leg.

Secondguessing them every step of the way is Taggart Scheider an FBI higherup. But Travis has just too much integrity to bend to his ways. While the deranged Dacy is putting his team of psychopathic yokels into high gear Travis and McCord must race against time to prevent any new victims before becoming victims themselves. Not just of the killers but of federal bureaucracy and corruption. Will their relationship survive against all odds?In terms of technical qualities this DTV effort stands above some of its contemporaries. It has a fairly glossy highquality look and feel that is just a hair away from being theaterready. The cinematography is quite good and the picturesque locales in Utah help that along nicely. The score is also big and booming. Lamas puts in a personable performance as the FBI agent on the edge not to be confused with his roles as a CIA agent on the edge in the CIA films. He has as many cool oneliners as he does snappy ties in his wardrobe. Cloke as his partner puts in a good amount of effort and you've got to love those bedroom eyes.

We think the filmmakers renamed the film from Word of Honor to The Rage in honor of Busey and his performance. There are plenty of classic Buseyisms on display as he rants and raves with wild abandon.Also David Carradine is literally wasted in a nothing role that's almost as senseless as Klaus Kinski's in The Soldier 1982.Director Furie has had a long and accomplished career so that probably accounts for why this film is wellmade. There are some good stunts and chases despite the fact that the plot is pretty bythenumbers. But it paved the way for TV shows like Criminal Minds which are just hourlong plots very very similar to The Rage. Too bad Lamas in the TV world is known for Renegade  he should have been a Criminal Minds cast member. But Wings Hauser was on an episode recently.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Outragous movie about a gang of psycho Vietnam Vets who are at war with not only the US government whom they feel betrayed them back in Nam but the entire country as well for not giving them the moral and political support that they needed when they came back home.Led by a Rambolike Art Dacy Gary Buseythese angry and unstable individuals have taken their rage and hatred back to the states by waging a guerrilla war of their own against the people and law enforcement personnel of Wasatch County.Assigned to finding out who's responsible for over sixty murders in and around Wasatch county is both FBI man and women Nick Travis  Kelly McCord Lerenzo Lamas  Kristen Cloke. We learn early in the movie that the man in charge of this FBI operation agent John Taggert Roy Scheider is actually more interested in doing in his agents on the case Travis and later McCord then catching the gang of psychos who turned the entire northwest into a free fire zone. Taggert has it in especially for Travis since an unfortunate shooting incident at a place called Quantico where because of his screwing things up caused a number of FBI agents and white separatists to be killed in a Ruby Ridgelike assault by the FBI. This foulup on Agent Taggert's not Travis'part cost him the chance of being promoted director of the FBI and he's held Travis responsible for that ever since.Meanwhile crazy Dacy and his and his gang of loonies are planing to wipe out the entire bunch of US government representatives who are about to have a big get together between themselves and the North Vietnamese at an exclusive compound outside of Bear Lake called the Bountiful Society.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Outragous movie about a gang of psycho Vietnam Vets who are at war with not only the US government whom they feel betrayed them back in Nam but the entire country as well for not giving them the moral and political support that they needed when they came back home.Led by a Rambolike Art Dacy Gary Buseythese angry and unstable individuals have taken their rage and hatred back to the states by waging a guerrilla war of their own against the people and law enforcement personnel of Wasatch County.Assigned to finding out who's responsible for over sixty murders in and around Wasatch county is both FBI man and women Nick Travis  Kelly McCord Lerenzo Lamas  Kristen Cloke. We learn early in the movie that the man in charge of this FBI operation agent John Taggert Roy Scheider is actually more interested in doing in his agents on the case Travis and later McCord then catching the gang of psychos who turned the entire northwest into a free fire zone. Taggert has it in especially for Travis since an unfortunate shooting incident at a place called Quantico where because of his screwing things up caused a number of FBI agents and white separatists to be killed in a Ruby Ridgelike assault by the FBI. This foulup on Agent Taggert's not Travis'part cost him the chance of being promoted director of the FBI and he's held Travis responsible for that ever since.Meanwhile crazy Dacy and his and his gang of loonies are planing to wipe out the entire bunch of US government representatives who are about to have a big get together between themselves and the North Vietnamese at an exclusive compound outside of Bear Lake called the Bountiful Society.

The story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. There was adequate suspense and I believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer.At the end of the film I was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in Utah. Furthermore Lorenzo and his leading lady were portraying actual FBI agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the ring. I believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first and as far as I can tell the only completed production of Heart of Darkness ever released. Prior to starting on Citizen Kane Orson Welles shot some test footage for a version of Heart of Darkness that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called POV where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character Charlie Marlow he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors windows water etc. The film was never made. The POV technique was used not too successfully in 1947 in The Lady in the Lake with Robert Montgomery starring as Philip Marlowe. Presumably the coincidence of the two Marlowe characters is just that. Of course Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now was based on Heart of Darkness.The short novel Heart of Darkness by the Polishborn British writer Joseph Conrad first serialized in a British literary magazine in 1899 features one of his favorite alter egos ship captain Charlie Marlow who also narrates the short story Youth and indirectly tells the story of Lord Jim. Marlow temporarily out of work decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of King Leopold II's personal fiefdom the cruelly misnamed Congo Free State. Marlow travels from London to Brussels signs on with the company and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the Congo River to a far inland station headed by one of the company's most productive agents in the colony a German named Kurtz. Shipments of ivory latex for the production of rubber and other products from Kurtz's station have ceased and no word has come downriver from Kurtz for some time. There are rumors that he has gone native. Marlow is to investigate take any necessary action and make a report on his return. He takes passage down the West African coast to the mouth of the Congo is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast and finally sets out upriver to find Kurtz's station. The river the heat the vegetation the wildlife the insects the people all take their toll on his endurance his imagination and his mental resources. He finds Kurtz ill halfmad and close to death. The final encounter and the death of Kurtz are almost an anticlimax especially since Conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves. This is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics.This Heart of Darkness was filmed with Guyana in Central America standing in for West Africa. It is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage Actually showing us First World urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like. But the rest of the film was forgettable. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow but so much about the plot characterizations and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered. If the aim was to make Conrad's story for the screen why didn't they leave it alone? It's unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers. Most disappointing of all was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely miscast and simply flubs the role. Everything about him is wrong His looks his acting style his voice his accent everything. A vastly better choice would have been someone like Bruno Ganz unlike Malkovich an actual German like the character.This is a very disappointing production and I would recommend it only after you've read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the Congo River circa 1900.".

Prior to starting on Citizen Kane Orson Welles shot some test footage for a version of Heart of Darkness that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called POV where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character Charlie Marlow he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors windows water etc. The film was never made. The POV technique was used not too successfully in 1947 in The Lady in the Lake with Robert Montgomery starring as Philip Marlowe.

But also in the movie it says that Kurtz hasn't been sending any ivory in to the central station letting people in the central station to wonder has Kurtz gone crazy?' But the book states that Kurtz is sending in more ivory than everyone else combined. Marlow is determined to meet Kurtz and witness what is so amazing about him that everyone else sees. He travels down the Congo River on a steamboat with his helmsman Mfumu. All Marlow could think about was the flash backs of the darkness of Africa that e had witnessed throughout the movie. I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't. The Russian harlequin that Marlow meets at the inner station seems to have lost him mind and his tone of voice is really creepy to me. He was always laughing like a maniac! But Marlow does meet Kurtz's African mistress and catches glimpses of Kurtz's Intended that he had painted and each one had significance. The movie was okay but it would have been hard to understand had I not read the book first and even then the book and the movie were different in many ways. If you choose to watch this movie I suggest you read the book first so that you can grasp the movie and its characters.".

Despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless. The book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie. You'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example when the character of Kurtz's fiance is nonchalant to the fact that Kurtz has died it completely modifies the ending the book had given. Not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. It sincerely feels as if Roeg was filming another story with references from Heart Of Darkness embedded in it. If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like Joseph Conrad's tale you may find it good. Though I thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting it is a captivating story all the same. However if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story don't look for it in Roeg's film.".

The movie completely shames the book to the highest level possible. Though the book was not the best I have read after watching the movie I seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more. Nicolas Roeg the director of the movie did a horrible job portraying Joseph Conrad's novella into a movie. I give Roeg some credit for trying to attempt the impossible by making the book into a movie but this may not have been the job for him. The movie was unsuccessful to express any part of the novella other than the basics of the plot. The set and scenery also lacked the beauty Conrad portrayed of Africa in the book. In the book Marlow had seen so many great wonders but in the movie you did not get that same experience. No I'm not blaming everything on the director the acting in the film was just terrible. All of the actors were dull and uninteresting. Throughout the whole movie I felt as if the actors were not putting forth any emotions as if they were reading from the script the entire time. Tim Roth who plays Marlow did not portray Marlow's sense of adventure for his journey into the Congo well. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz was supposed to venturesome but I didn't experience that in the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie especially if you have read the book already. It does not come close to doing justice for Joseph Conrad's novella. Conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the journey with Marlow on his quest to find Mr. Kurtz where as the film did not. A great novella but a very poor film.

It seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle. I couldn't imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating Heart of Darkness. The immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret. Conrad's story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretation.First capturing the details of the story is unattainable. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film. Marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie. If you have taken on the enormous task of tackling Conrad's work then you know as well as I that Conrad only wrote half the story. The additional half is a series of connections made by the reader. You as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting Joseph Conrad's ideas. As a result several crucial details are absent in the movie.Also although the movie was an adequate length the film seemed short. It seemed that Conrad was able to pack many more details into 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half. The speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters. Marlow was much more of a stranger. The viewpoint of the book puts you into Marlow's shoes. However in the movie you're almost watching Marlow from a distance. I began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same read between the lines method as Conrad did. However the connections were weak. I know that if I had not read the book then I would in no way be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters.Finally Kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly. His role was short and the details weren't all included. It was impossible to comprehend the true Kurtz in the length of time he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz had become a god to the Africans. I didn't think that significant detail was defined. Also in the book Kurtz represented a soulless being. He had died inside long ago. I believe the director comprehended this detail. However instead of recreating it he just had Kurtz mope around and mumble everything. Moreover it seemed like the director attempted to make Kurtz seem mysterious however instead he seemed entirely unidentified.Altogether this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project due the next day. It appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time. The characters were alienated crucial details were left out and overall the central plot was lost in translation.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading the book Heart of Darkness the movie did not do it justice. The movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie. In the film the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie. The director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made.Of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word. The movie doesn't even start to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out like how Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Also when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtz's intended she reacted differently in the movie rather than the book. Another major difference was that Marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie not at the beginning like the book. This was influential on how the audience perceived Marlow and the movie totally messed that up.The book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like but the scenery in the movie was a let down. There was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment a bunch of bad actors to go along with it. There was one exception to the awful actors and that would be Isaach De Bankol who played Mfumu. His character was depicted the best. Though the movie wasn't that great I still would recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. That way you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them. If you have not read the book I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring lifeless mess. I loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.".

The director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made.Of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word. The movie doesn't even start to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out like how Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Also when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtz's intended she reacted differently in the movie rather than the book. Another major difference was that Marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie not at the beginning like the book. This was influential on how the audience perceived Marlow and the movie totally messed that up.The book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like but the scenery in the movie was a let down. There was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment a bunch of bad actors to go along with it. There was one exception to the awful actors and that would be Isaach De Bankol who played Mfumu. His character was depicted the best. Though the movie wasn't that great I still would recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. That way you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them. If you have not read the book I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring lifeless mess. I loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.";

	schema:headline " Good made for T.V. movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Heart of Darkness directed by Nicolas Roeg is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's tale of ivory hunting in the African jungle.  Heart of Darkness was a made for T.V. film airing on March 13 1994 on TNT Turner Network Television.  Auteur theorists analyzing previous Roeg films may agree that this T.V. adaptation does not hold the same attributes.  One may argue that it was made for television which would place guidelines on how much Roeg could express his autuerist style.  Others may believe that Roeg' style is still at work within Heart of Darkness even though it follows the Hollywood narrative.  This film analysis will argue the Roeg elements are still at work. The film begins with extreme close ups of an elephants body.  Next we see Marlow Tim Roth explaining his expedition of the African Jungle to a group of rich British men.  From there the film cuts to a large library or museum where we see two women in black almost identical sitting in the front entrance of an office.  Marlow in a voice over begins to become uneasy with the women's presence.  He makes comments to himself regarding a conspiracy and the women were warning him of something.  If one has seen Don't Look Now 1973 they can make a predisposition toward the two women in black and the psychic sisters.  Marlow had ambiguities toward the two women just as John Donald Sutherland had toward the sisters which predicted his outcome death.  Marlow on the other hand assumed danger from the two women and danger is exactly what he found in the Congo. As the film continues we see an aborigine standing outside of a window looking in at Marlow.  We later find out that he committed suicide or was speared in the chest by an unruly army headed by Kurtz John Malkovich. In Walkabout 1971 we see the young aborigine looking into the house at the white girl.  In both films the aborigine's are looking into the white man's world.  Unfortunately they find the white man's world can be destructive and greedy as seen in the Kurtz controlled outlandish army.  They steal young boys and barter them for supplies.  Three young boys are abducted from the camp site one boy is killed and the others are returned for supplies.Previous to the abduction we see random shots of a boy with an ivory necklace.  We later see the necklace lying near where the boy had been sleeping.  Immediately following the abduction is a dream sequence which Marlow sees a dead elephant stripped of its' tusks lying alongside a trail.  Maggots are seen as the camera moves in for a close up. Juxtaposed with the elephant are the identical women and finally a claw tool.  This sequence expresses the dangers associated with the Congo not only on the explorers but aborigines and animals. These sequences are Roegian for its' underlying themes.  What do two women an elephant and a claw have to do with a journey in the Congo?  The elephant is clearly associated with ivory and greed.  The women mean a clear and present danger in the Congo.  The claw depicts violence and is later seen sitting in Kurtz's hut.  In one shot we see Mfumu looking into the water where it appears blood is floating on the surface foreshadowing his own death.  After he is speared Marlow throws his body overboard and blood floats atop the surface again. Roeg does not hold back on the grotesqueness within Heart of Darkness.  In one scene we see another explorer repeatedly kicking and striking a black man.  After Mfumu is speared Marlow pulls on the spear and blood explodes from the chest. Surprisingly T.V. allowed this scene as well as a few others.  Moments later Marlow and his guides enter Kurtz's village where there is a young boy covered in blood and tied to a tree.  There are also boys' heads on stakes and on branches in trees.  More boys are taken from the crew and traded and one is killed. Kurtz's makes his appearance in the final 20 minutes of the film.  He appears to be a god to the aborigine army.  He is quite crazy and slowly dies away in a most unusual and unauthentic way.  He is buried in an upright position and is draped in white cloth.  There appears to be some sort of metal attachments from his upper body to his arms to keep them out in front of him.  I am not sure what Roeg was getting at with this but it may have to do with Kurtz being crazy and having instilled his own ideologies to the army. There is one theme in which is unusual.  There is an aborigine woman that closely resembles Kurtz's white wife.  The black beauty is framed with Kurtz's wife's painting.  The black beauty appears to have some sort of skin ailment or body paint.  Maybe Kurtz has put her up to painting or brandishing herself to slightly resemble his wife back in Britain.  At the end of the film Marlow approaches the widow and tells her of Kurtz's last moments.  This scene seems so out of place.  The black and white woman reflecting each other in some sort of weird African fantasy makes sense but Marlow actually going to see the widow has no real premise.  It does appear Roeg intentionally mirrored Kurtz's loves but the widow scene seemed so hurried.  That did not at all seem Roegish. Finally the end montage near Kurtz's death is the most Roegistic style in the whole film.  Roeg compiles every theme into about one minute of juxtaposed images containing Mfumu's death and the spear exiting his chest in slow motion.  The elephant's rotting carcass the two women being seen again the ivory necklace and young boys are also shown again.  Random shots of Kurtz's masked army are installed.  The black and white women are repeated.  Heart of Darkness is much so a Roeg film only with a T.V. limit.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Heart of Darkness is a movie for those of us who can watch a movie with an open mind. You can't think about any other movie you have seen or you will miss the wonderful experience gained by watching this movie. The movie follows the basic story line of the novel written by Joseph Conrad except a few added scenes that help to add insight to the meaning and life of each character. This is a movie about the tragic journey by Marlow played by Tim Roth. Marlow travels down the Congo River to visit a wellknown ivory trader in Africa Kurtz played by John Malkovich who has stopped sending his ivory loads. Marlow encounters many tragic casualties and ends up losing his newly gained friend. Kurtz is on the verge of death and won't let anyone help him out. Kurtz is a very selfabsorbed man who refuses to see what is right in front of him instead turns to the jungle for a life of murder and betrayal. Kurtz uses the men of the jungle to attack Marlow in attempt to prevent his arrival. His attempt fails and Marlow soon arrives. Upon arrival Marlow begins to understand the life lived by Kurtz and unlocks a deep mystery to the deep mindchanging jungle that overwhelms Kurtz and drives him mad. Everywhere Marlow would travel he would hear of Kurtz and his ivory but nothing would prepare Marlow for the cold truth that has come to be Kurtz's life. Kurtz finally allows Marlow to return with half of his ivory however along with Kurtz's death Marlow realizes that nothing could make him take that ivory back. In the short time that Marlow accompanied Kurtz at his home Marlow developed a deep hatred for Kurtz and would not have any part of Kurtz with him nor would he send it to anyone else. When the journey concludes Marlow is changed.  Africa changes people' and for Marlow it changed him in a way no one could explain. This is a magnificent movie that grabs the viewer and keeps them interested. Once you see the movie you will understand just how amazing of a job the director has done. I give this movie a rating on 110 an 8 for its twists and thrills.".

We discussed each paragraph in great detail so I grasped the concept pretty quickly. I couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie. This may be because there were no discussions held in class but I suppose it is also because I couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel.

	schema:reviewBody "Heart of Darkness Movie Review As the saying goes the film is never as good as the book. This most certainly applies to the movie Heart of Darkness. It is however understandable since the cast and crew attempted to represent one of the greatest novels in the English language in a movie. Heart of Darkness the book was a masterpiece in itself and that set expectations high for the movie from the very beginning. But after watching the movie it's safe to say that the movie failed to live up to those great expectations.The movie had a habit of doing strange screen flashes to random characters and objects. It was most likely an attempt at foreshadowing however it just seemed out of place. There is an instance in which the movie flashed forward from a scene to a later one in which when Marlow sees a pair of claws in Kurtz's hut. However all it does is disrupt the continuity of the current scene and leave the audience confused by the out of place image that was shown. It seems that the director Nicholas Roeg tried to bring onto the big screen some of Conrad's exceptional foreshadowing from the novel. However this was not the end result. Another problem with the movie was the way in which elements from the book were brought into the movie. It was almost like Roeg tried to use the book as a script. While it is important to stick to the book when trying to adapt it to the movie format it's also important to realize the book is just that a book. Things that make books great don't necessarily make movies great. Fancy and indepth dialogue are perfect for novels but often lose their value in movies. It felt as if Roeg tried to force lines onto some of the characters and this made what they had to say less interesting and less convincing. Along with dialogue Conrad's phenomenal verbal irony from the book was also lost in the film adaptation. One of the cornerstones of the book came off in the movie as just another piece of boring dialogue. These failed attempts on bringing forth some of Conrad's prized jewels from the book all led the movie on a confusing path. It was possible to tell from the weird jungle noises and swaying camera that Roeg was trying to portray the eerie jungle from the book however it wasn't convincing. And that is a common theme with this film. Everything Roeg takes right out of the book wasn't convincing it all felt forced.Everything previously stated was bad however they pale in comparison to this problem in the movie the Russian. Once he said his first lines the movie immediately went from a decent attempt to a failed attempt. The Russian was crazy in the book but he still provided useful information to Marlow and made a contribution to the story. The Russian in the movie only met the standard of being crazy. The audience wanted to do exactly what Marlow did which was ignore him. There were two or three times in the movie when the Russian would say something to Marlow and he would just totally ignore him. And if the audience had ignored him it wouldn't have made any difference. He contributed minimally to the story failing to give the extensive exposition that the book version did. All of that aside he just felt fake overall. Following the movies common theme he failed to convince the audience he was real.The movie wasn't 100 a failure one element it did pull off rather well was the setting. The jungle and the out posts did actually prove to be convincing. The setting and many of the props like the boat outposts and ivory did a good job at making the story seem real. Overall the movie is unwatchable without having read the book first. That being said it is possible to swallow the hour and a half long imitation if you had read the book first. It proves to be semi entertaining to draw parallels between the movie and novel and the props and set do help give a clearer image of parts of the story in some cases.".

	schema:headline " Heart of Darkness film just doesn't live up to its namesake";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Nicolas Roeg undertakes a major project when filming Heart of Darkness his version of the story from Joseph Conrad. The film is an accurate rendition of its namesake novel for the most part but with a few differences. Although short in length Conrad's work is considered one of the most complex books ever written with flowing language and advanced vocabulary.. Conrad's version leaves the reader with a greater feeling of suspense and has a more haunting atmosphere overall compared to the film. The Heart of Darkness film felt to me like it was lacking emotion. For example in one of the final scenes Kurtz's intended or fiance displays no anguish towards Kurtz's death and no excitement when hearing the German man's final words that Marlow makes up but rather the actress portraying the woman behaves calmly and the ending of the story is completely changed. Marlow is a character that loathes lying and the film does not express this therefore making the fact that he lies to Kurtz's intended much less significant. Foreshadowing is evident in Conrad's novel indicated subtly by the author's diction. Roeg's account seems to completely skip over any attempt of hinting at future events other than having an air of mystery on occasion. While the film does have a small degree of a haunting atmosphere to it the novel leaves the viewer with a lot more to take away from it. I recommend reading the novel with excruciating detail to read between the lines and skipping the film completely to invest those one hundred minutes in a more worthwhile activity. However if you truly wish to see it pick up a copy of Conrad's original first.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fitzgerald's adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book Heart of Darkness would be rated a 410 on my scale. My bias because of the fact that I read the book made me both hate and love the movie. The reasons I loved it is because in its own crooked way it tried to reenact the plot of the book .It did have some good material like the sound guy for the movie really did a great job On the other hand there were a lot of reasons why I hated it though. . In essence it was pretty horrible movie and would be a great movie for anyone who likes bad acting and finding huge accent mistakes.Bad acting was a component that I found to be a little peculiar. The reason it is peculiar is because Nicolas Reigthe director was able to get John Malkovich to play Kurz. The movie should have been a hit just because it had John Malkovich in it but some how they found a way to cast a bunch of horrible actors to offset how great of an actor Malkovich is. Malkovich did make some mistakes. Instead of him playing Kurz as a man with wisdom I felt that Malkovich was a man drugged out on some trippy African plant.Please do not misunderstand me I think Tim Roth was great. In Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. For Fitzgerald's Heart of Darkness I just found myself questioning why Roth was chosen to play Marlow. He does not have a very interesting voice. I understand completely that Marlow went through these traumatic event that could make a person monotone when telling his story but if Marlow is going to be the narrator do not cast a man that makes me want to fall asleep during the movieI actually did fall asleep and had to watch a part over again. The thing I found most confusing is the issue of Kurz not having an accent. I cannot believe that the director allowed Malkovich to switch in and out of his accent. Kurz was supposed to be European but spoke in an American accent almost the whole movie. I completely understand that Malkovich is an American but he is an actor and actors are supposed to maintain the role of the character they are playing. Kurz not having an accent did annoy me but I will give credit where it is needed and admit that the African native characters were played by great actor. The native characters had good accents and wore thingsaccepts a few that fit my perception of a real African native. The only confusing part of the movie was the end when the natives scoured every where but that was a director fault and not the actors fault.The movie was bad but it was hard to watch it and think it was good when the book it is an adaptation of is such a great piece of literature. It has to be compared to a literary classic and most literary classics' movie adaptations including this one are never a greator even close to being as good as the book it is an adaptation of. I feel that maybe if I had not read the book then I could have like the movie a little bit better but I did. Therefore in my conclusion the movie was not that great.".

	schema:reviewBody "While the book Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad in comparison to the movie was like comparing the mental capacity of a child and a grown adult the movie followed along with the main themes of the book very well. It is very difficult to put together a movie to describe such a complex book but director Nicolas Roeg and actors John Malkovich and Tim Roth did an excellent job. Symbolism was a huge component within the film and the book. For example Kurtz a main character was symbolized as a God to the people within the station where he collected ivory. One man said You don't talk to that man you listen to him. Another said They savages don't want him to go They adore him. The cannibals that lived within this Heart of Darkness and the people working for him highly adored and exalted Kurtz. Another example of symbolism is the painting of Kurtz Intended or his fianc back in Europe. This isn't something that would have a lot of meaning to someone who didn't read the book. The painting was of this woman but her eyes were covered by a cloth. This represents the idea described in the book about women being shielded from the craziness of our world. Conrad says It's queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world of their own and there has never been anything like it and never can be. It's too beautiful altogether. Page 28 I like that I was able to have more insight into the movie because I had previously read the book. Another rhetorical device used is allegory. While one could interpret the story of Marlow's adventure down the Congo River very literally there's also an underlying meaning. For example The Heart of Darkness can be referred to as the inner most ivory stations along the Congo River because of danger due to the native cannibals. But it can also describe the atmosphere of the river. Kurtz who was previously had very good intentions with going down the river eventually turned for the worse becoming obsessed with the natives and even obsessed with his persona. Everything changed when he entered the Heart of Darkness. I would recommend this movie but I would recommend reading the book in depth first. That's the order my English class did it in and I found it very beneficial because I was introduced to many rhetorical devices and difficult topics within the book but then I saw them come to life in the movie and I began to understand it a lot better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heart of Darkness by Conrad was a fantastic story which was painfully depicted within a film. It's doubtful that the director even attempted to read the book. Symbolism in the book was not there. The woman who was symbolic to Mother Nature did not show any of her symbolism in the film. The tirelessly described characters within the story were lost and replaced with a pitifully castes group of actors. Key characters like Kurtz lost their nature and Kurtz became more grumpy than anything. The Russian as well was totally miscasted. His portrayal was dramatically different than how Conrad described him. In the movie the Russian lost his nature and became more of a laughing lunatic then an enigmatic bipolar. Pathetic dramatic effect poor casting and the portrayal of a completely different story is all that is present in the film rendition of Heart of Darkness and no one should waste their time watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Heart of Darkness was a faithful and respectful version of Joseph Conrad's classic novel but certainly not one that was memorable. The movie was boring poorly made and had terrible acting. It is impossible for actors to recreate such complex metaphors and analogies like in the book. It was difficult to keep my eyes open while watching the film whereas while I read the book I was compelled by Conrad's syntax. The main problem is that Conrad's prose is powerfully verbose and simply cannot be adapted to a movie. Marlow's narration in the novel captivates you from the first sentence to the end of the book and you only imagine what Conrad writes about. In this movie it is different because you can actually see the story but the description and reflection that really makes the novel is frightfully missing. But as far as an unadaptable book has been adapted it is of mediocre standards. There are certain scenes like when Marlow throws his friend overboard after he has been speared which are pinpointed quite genius but they never have the same effect as in the novel. The plot in the movie has been enhanced but it was still very uninteresting. The references to Ancient Egypt were thoughtfully inserted. My advice read the book and keep it that way. There are better movies out there.".

I have seem few films that have made me seriously contemplate suicide violent suicide rather than watch the film for a second time. Roeg's cast choice was disappointing. Casting John Malkovich as Kurtz a man who works for the company as a manager running a successful outpost in the Congo was a huge slap to Conrad's vision and mine. He failed to capture the true essence of Kurtz. Although Malkovich was a poor choice Roeg did not completely disappoint with casting Tim Roth as Marlow an ambitious sailor and employee of the British trading company. Roth delivered a captivating performance. He was relatable but not overly dramatic as Kurtz was in the movie. For example Roeg added the scene where Kurtz mercilessly murdered a monkey which was not in Conrad's work. That scene was indeed shocking and unnecessary. Conrad's novel conveyed a clear picture of his vision of Kurtz an authoritative villain. In addition Conrad's overall meaning to Heart of Darkness was overshadowed by Roeg's miserable interpretation. Kurtz was a character noted for his development as a monster driven to madness by disease and his hunger for power. Roeg conveyed Kurtz as a power hungry man but made no connection with the movieviewers nor did he provide enough insight to understand Kurtz's struggle. I strongly recommend not watching this film. Don't waster 100 minutes of your life. Pick up the book instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "For many of you that have seen the movie you may agree with me that this film is very slow paced and may leave you unconscious for the better part of the film. The director had his own way of trying to weave in the intricate parts of the novel which he was not very successful in doing. The book in itself was already difficult to understand but there are noticeably vast differences between the book and the movie. An example being that the novel described a beautiful oasis whereas the film depicted a foggy swamp with natives pondering on how they might attack the seamen. Reading the novel was as if you were solving a Rubik's Cube very hard to interpret but once you were finished you feel very accomplished. Watching the movie did not leave that sort of feeling it seemed carelessly directed and very strung out. Some scenes felt out of order which effected the entire plot. Kurtz was only shown towards the very end of the film which made it difficult for the viewer to completely understand his character and made him seem mysterious.Conrad's mastery of the English language was accurately shown in his novel none of which was depicted in the movie. The director attempted to recreate all the intricate pieces that held the novel together but simply couldn't get a grip on Conrad's detail and how he intended the novel to be interpreted. Overall this film is not one that could be watched without reading the novel first and be understood. If you are already having trouble grasping the novel I would not recommend you watch the film as it would leave you in utter confusion.".

The Beginning of the End put everything in place for the rest of the season and Confirmed Dead had the goal of pushing the story even further really introducing us to the world of season four and introducing us to the 'freighter four' if you will and accomplished its goal very well.The episode flashes back to the freighter four Daniel Faraday Miles Charlotte and Frank Lapidus all around the time the wreck of Flight 815 was 'discovered'. Daniel's is still the most interesting and enigmatic flashback Miles' is just confusing and bewildering simply because I just don't know who that woman is don't understand why he was crying and am also connected to him emotionally more than any of the other freighters. Charlotte's dig in the Tunisian desert was definitely a 'what the hell?' moment and is still a lot of fun. I like my polar bears to be skeletons in a desert a billion miles from where they're supposed to be they're more interesting that way. Frank Lapidus was supposed to fly 815 eh? Interesting. I don't think there's more to him as a character but we will probably see a Daniel flashback and a Charlotte flashback in season 5.Naturally there is not much depth to the proceedings but the actionadventure stuff on the island is pure adrenaline Miles' awful couple of lines of exposition excluded and it's just a bravura piece of storytelling in just about every way and genuinely suspenseful at times. I'm kind of surprised that this episode holds up on repeat viewings but it really does. It may not be up there with the show at its absolute peak but it's definitely a great episode in its own way.".

Remember first watching it found it remarkably easy to get into was hooked from the start and was on Season 3 by the end of one week. The general consensus is that the final season is a disappointment and cannot disagree.Season 3 was for me a solid if uneven season with many brilliant episodes but a few slightly underwhelming ones an inconsistent first part of the season and containing one of 'Lost's' low points Stranger in a Strange Land. Season 4 had a good amount to live up and its first episode The Beginning of the End was a brilliant start. This following episode Confirmed Dead is very nearly as great and already there are signs of a season that settled much quicker than the previous one.The episode has pretty much everything that 'Lost' is all about. It's taut and thoughtprovoking with utterly gripping onisland events. It may be primarily setting up and putting into place what is to come but does that extremely well.On top of all that it introduces with enormous potential new characters keeps the existing characters interesting shows plot progression rather than repeating itself or being filler. The four rescue team members introduced add a lot of intrigue with their stories on the most part being compelling and interesting Daniel's being the one that one learns from and remembers most and Lapidus being the most interesting. Miles has great potential as a character and has a lot of presence would have liked though for his story to have more clarity and care my only real complaint of the episode.Also found Confirmed Dead to be a nonstop thrill ride of insane entertainment value edge of your seat tension and very emotional moments. Not to mention some shocking revelations and twists.Can't fault the performances Jeff Fahey being exceptional.Nor the stylishness and atmosphere of the visuals nor the effectively understated and chilling use of music taut writing and the tightly controlled direction one of the best of the season and perhaps of the show.In conclusion great episode. 910 Bethany Cox".

The most blame has to do with the director of that episode Stephen Williams. I always hated Stephen Williams's directing. If Jack Bender continues with this episode from the season premiere he would have kept it in a good pace and keep things float to keep things interesting. I'm glad Jack Bender is directing next week's episode and it'll be much better and I'm glad he got first Syaid episode to direct and I'm curious what he will pull off this time since Stephen Williams had directed too many Syaid episodes before.I always keep thinking that Stephen Williams needs to be thrown off from the show. He doesn't even do anything interesting with the show.Why does the opening have to be done with a target thing while being in the helicopter? IT was so BORING! Bad perspective of camera work too!".

	schema:reviewBody "Here we have a thoroughly satisfactory crime caper of the film noir variety. The plot has the usual ingredients  greed sex betrayal and revenge  but nicely blended and all proceeding at a reasonably fast pace. The casting of two serious British actors Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman as a couple of downatheel Southern cops is a bit weird but it works. There's Coco a gorgeous young femme fatale Carla Gugino and three other offbeat young crims a steamy authentic New Orleans setting a kidnap gone wrong a bystander is shot hints of police corruption and a tense finale.The kidnap victim played by Greg Wise Emma's reallife partner apparently is a Bill Gateslike computer billionaire though a lot betterlooking who is totally at a loss away from his keyboard  he spends most of his captivity quivering in a corner. I thought it was quite a neat trick to set his ransom at the level of his company's kidnap insurance cover  if you don't have to bear the loss you will be more likely to agree to the kidnapper's demand. The shot bystander turns out to have been the wife of a US senator played by Hal Holbrook. Hal can do nasty political types in his sleep but he puts plenty of effort into this portrayal.Our own Aussie Simon BakerDenny as Coco's boyfriend and criminal associate brings plenty of cool to the role a long way from the innocent young cop in E Street but Coco is the real standout. She's so hot you could fry eggs on her tummy yet she has a certain sense of innate decency that engenders sympathy. I don't really care if the film was directed by some hot young Venezuelan novelist Sebastian Gutierrez who is a fan of Almovodar whose influence seems to have been limited to the primary colours used in the credits. We've seen the story and the characters all before  this is a Hollywood formula movie freshly prepared and presented with lots of silly bits and there's never a dull moment. Heck Jamaicans can do bobsledding  why shouldn't foreigners take over Hollywood? Yet the movie went straight to cable in the US. Silly Yanks.".

Alan was great as a Columbo type detective and almost consistently got the Southern accent right  he just can't seem to avoid spitting out those final consonants which no Southerner in their right mind would do.The  dance with the 'bad guy' after Miss Hot Pants interviews him was exquisite.  Quirky funny touching I agree.  Why can'twasn't this brought to the screen?  And at least when do we get it on video?

The four kidnappers work well together on screen.  The best part of the movie for me would have to be when Coco is talking about the time her and Junior had met trapped in a meat freezer.  A song by The Cure is playing that has just like a dream in the chorus don't know the actual name but it is very romantic.  When Junior is giving her oral sex while she is holding herself up in the air by a meat hook it is so romantic.  She says I can't even look at a steak now without getting wet.  On to Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson who as two law enforcement employees have some innocent romantic moments of their own.  Hal Holbrook gives a good performance as the revenge minded senator.  Anyway this movie has a lot going for it.  I am surprised with so many good actors this movie doesn't have a bigger following.  I am a big Carla Gugino fan and she is hot is this one even though maybe only a nanosecond of her fabulous breasts.  Enjoy  610".

Let's hope Sbastian Gutierrez continues with such flair  he looks like a talent to watch out for. The mismatched bunch of smalltime crooks in the film are outshadowed by the investigative partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman the humour of whose scenes is much needed in making the movie what it is. The pair pull off their obligatory southern drawls just as well as the Yanks and it's a delight to hear these two stalwarts of British cinema yapping away to each other with LethalWeaponstyle fluidity...just a pity that the only scenes they have the opportunity to steal are exclusively theirs. Anyway with a bit less politics and authoritarianism ! the film would be nearperfect so I'll give it a healthy 810 and hope that a few people remember it a bit better than the boxoffice did.".

The camera's been used to give you a kind of stressed feeling and I think I got a little stressed with the characters. This movie left me staring blankly at the screen first time I watched it and I wasn't sure what I'd just seen. Now that I've seen it a couple of time though I think it's a great film. I couldn't help but notice how much Rickman's character David Friedman resembles John Rebus books by Ian Rankin. The same sarcastic dry humor. Old battered car. Divorced one daughter. Likes to do things his own way and doesn't let a beating stop him. The only thing I slightly disliked about this movie was that you felt like you were thrown into the last episode of a tv show not knowing what had been going on before. I felt there should have been more both before and after. But in the end that's the charm of the film. You're thrown into it and before you know it it's over and you're left wondering what the hell just happened. I recomend this one. Really recomend it!".

Well if anyone else had been in this movie other than Lana I probably wouldn't have watched it. While it may not win any awards it's not terribly bad either in fact it's the kind of film you'd remember fondly. I could see someone watching this late at night or on vacation and enjoying its simplicity. It's very charming and also stars a young Debbie Reynolds and Marjorie Main Ma Kettleand Ezio Pinza does have a great voice. But having said all that I get the feeling watching it that this project must have come to Lana at a career low. Watching such a big guy as Ezio Pinza in certain scenes you'd have to see it to know what I mean was just too much becoming either unintentionally funny or just plain silly. It might would have been more effective had they picked a younger male lead with more appeal. But upon seeing this again recently I couldn't get over how much I liked its unpretentiousness and somewhat carefree attitude despite the serious ending with the letter the son wrote that Ezio read over the phone. It all worked to make a straightforward film not trying to be anything but what it is.If I had to pick the four of Lana's films that I think are the weakest they would be Bittersweet Love The Prodigal Love Has Many Faces and maybe this one. But this is much better than the others. Finally though I would have to say that a movie's ending makes you either satisfied or dissatisfied with it. Usually short movies wrap things up with a pat or forced resolution and too quickly. This ending flowed and allowed you to feel your way out...In other words only Lana fans would watch this and only they will be rewarded in small ways. While no Lana classic this is very enjoyable and deserves to get more attention for being another example of good clean family entertainment like they used to make.".

Does it really matter all? There only are a handful of MGM musicals that have gained the classic status. About 80 of their musical productions are nothing more than simple lighthearted movies that are pleasant to watch but at the same time also extremely forgettable. These sort of movies are good to kill some time with of course especially if you're a fan of the genre.Granted that the lovestory is not the most believable or compelling one. I don't know but having a 60 year old playboy prince falling for a 30 years younger blond beauty by todays standards feels more dirty than romantic. Guess in the '40's'50's this was Hollywoods idea of a romantic story and every young girl dreamed of marrying an older rich playboy prince. Who knows. Yet the story still works out alright enough which is thanks to the actors Lana Turner and Ezio Pinza who also have some good chemistry together.Further more the movie is filled with all of the formulaic genre ingredients and most things also don't really come as a surprise. The movie is not as musical filled as perhaps other MGM productions which might disappoint certain people.The movie is pretty good looking with some nice sets costumes and setting although it's all obvious fake at times. It helps to give the movie a pretty good light feeling and atmosphere which helps to make this movie a pleasant one to watch.The movie features some good other actors such as Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds in an early role. Yet most of the other characters are underused in the story which provide the movie with some missed opportunities. The movie overall as a whole has perhaps a tad bit more misses than hits in it which does make the movie an uneven one to watch at times.More of the same all but I'm not complaining about it and so most certainly wouldn't the genre fans. The movie deserves a better reputation for sure.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Here we have another example of it on film though with Lana Turner who is barely 30 in this movie and the old fart she falls madly in love with Ezio Pinza being 60! Ugh hard to watch makes the movie a joke. There is even a line in the movie where a 19 year old Debbie Reynolds says He is good looking. Right like Isn't my Grampa dreamy??? Yuck enough to make your skin crawl. Unfortunately the pairing of young women with old men is still the norm in Hollywood we need MORE women producers to make movies that can offer a bit of a balance...like let's say a Ryan Reynolds falling madly in love with Candice Bergen?".

As his first film he has a lovely voice going for him but he also is rather old to be wooing a significantly younger woman. He also could have used captions as occasionally I couldn't understand what he was saying...as his accent was quite thick. MGM thought his debut was a bomb and they shelved the film for a year...not a good sign at all. But is it in spite of this any good? Yes...and no. I think the film works reasonably well DESPITE him. Pinza might have been a lovely leading man back in the 30s...but by 1951 he simply looked old...which he was for his film debut in his mid50s. As for Miss Turner she's pretty much her usual self in this one though it's sad MGM didn't cast someone who could sing in this role. Overall a mildly entertaining film and not the bomb I expected...though this is hardly a glowing endorsement.By the way if you do see the picture look for a young Debbie Reynold about midway through the story.".

But the plot is obvious and boring. The Student Prince warmed over and not very warm at that.And for whatever reason there is no real chemistry between Plnza and Turner. He doesn't deliver his lines well in part because despite decades of singing at New York's Metropolitan Opera his English was still very poor. In part perhaps because he just wasn't a very good actor without music to sing. I don't know what he was like in South Pacific in which he opened in 1949 after he retired from the Metropolitan Opera.I watched all of this because I have loved Pinza's singing for decades. Unless you share the same love of great singing I don't know that this movie will hold you. It just isn't a very good picture.".

Other than that bit of humour this is a classy film meaning there's no down and dirty complicated anything... other than the relationship itself being complicated. The costumes and sets are really superb as well. This is such a simple film that I think it's fine for children to watch it. Although the ending is sad because life forces them to part ways again. Cedric Hardwicke showed everybody up with his sublime evil as the Prime Minister intent on keeping the Prince on track. SPOILER The ending is noticeably badly edited as it's said briefly that there's a bomb threat against the King if he returns to the throne and this is why he chooses to go to spare his son's life. So I can only conclude that there was a scene edited out in reference to the bomb threat. Too bad that was edited out as it would have added much more emotional depth to the lovers parting again.Read more of my movie reviews at httppdmoviereview.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering how badly it bombed on release making a huge loss and with indifferent to negative reviews was honestly expecting a worse film than 'Mr Imperium' turned out to me. It is a long way from great struggling to muster average but from what was heard you'd think it was one of the worst films there was which it isn't.There are positives here. 'Mr Imperium' does look very pleasing it's beautifully photographed with sumptuous costumes for Lana Turner and with serenely idyllic locations. The music is elegant and with enough energy and charm and the few songs while most not exactly timeless are pleasant You Belong to My Heart faring particularly well.Ezio Pinza was my main reason for seeing 'Mr Imperium' being a fan of his beautiful noble bass voice one of the most naturally beautiful of any operatic bass along with Nicolai Ghiaurov and he sings sublimely despite being retired from opera and shifting to Broadway his voice is one that you can listen to for hours and never tire of. The best performance of 'Mr Imperium' however comes from Debbie Reynolds in sprightly and charmingly perky charm as always.However while Pinza sounds sublime and really tries hard with the acting he actually was a good actor on the operatic stage but he doesn't always look comfortable and it was like he was trying too hard. This may have been because a luminous but painfully miscast Lana Turner was so bland like she was completely bored and didn't want to be there. Their chemistry is nonexistent and a gross mismatch sometimes bordering on unintentional creepiness not because of the age difference but because Pinza is really trying to be animated and engage with Turner but she makes it very clear that she disliked Pinza and wanted to be elsewhere.Reynolds aside the rest of the supporting cast struggle. Not because they are bad can never accuse Cedric Hardwicke and Marjorie Main of being bad actors or anything but because they have so little to do and are so underused. Barry Sullivan is so badly wasted here that his presence felt pointless. The direction is very routine and the pace often plods.On top of that the script is at best insipid with not a memorable funny or emotional line in the entire film. The story was so overfamiliar and cardboard even in 1951 and fails to inject much spark apart from Reynolds and Pinza's singing. Lastly the ending is confused and due to the unanswered questions feel it has incomplete feeling.In summary not disastrous as expected but barely average. 410 Bethany Cox".

'Mr Imperium' does look very pleasing it's beautifully photographed with sumptuous costumes for Lana Turner and with serenely idyllic locations. The music is elegant and with enough energy and charm and the few songs while most not exactly timeless are pleasant You Belong to My Heart faring particularly well.Ezio Pinza was my main reason for seeing 'Mr Imperium' being a fan of his beautiful noble bass voice one of the most naturally beautiful of any operatic bass along with Nicolai Ghiaurov and he sings sublimely despite being retired from opera and shifting to Broadway his voice is one that you can listen to for hours and never tire of. The best performance of 'Mr Imperium' however comes from Debbie Reynolds in sprightly and charmingly perky charm as always.However while Pinza sounds sublime and really tries hard with the acting he actually was a good actor on the operatic stage but he doesn't always look comfortable and it was like he was trying too hard. This may have been because a luminous but painfully miscast Lana Turner was so bland like she was completely bored and didn't want to be there. Their chemistry is nonexistent and a gross mismatch sometimes bordering on unintentional creepiness not because of the age difference but because Pinza is really trying to be animated and engage with Turner but she makes it very clear that she disliked Pinza and wanted to be elsewhere.Reynolds aside the rest of the supporting cast struggle. Not because they are bad can never accuse Cedric Hardwicke and Marjorie Main of being bad actors or anything but because they have so little to do and are so underused. Barry Sullivan is so badly wasted here that his presence felt pointless. The direction is very routine and the pace often plods.On top of that the script is at best insipid with not a memorable funny or emotional line in the entire film. The story was so overfamiliar and cardboard even in 1951 and fails to inject much spark apart from Reynolds and Pinza's singing. Lastly the ending is confused and due to the unanswered questions feel it has incomplete feeling.In summary not disastrous as expected but barely average. 410 Bethany Cox";

	schema:headline " Intense enjoyable thriller IF VIEWED IN ORIGINAL GERMAN LANGUAGE!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was very curious about Anatomy aka Anatomie and if I was going to see it I was going to have to buy it since no video stores in my area carried the film.  Since it was not a lowpriced DVD I did take a chance and thought I'd take a peek at other comments on IMDb.  Many of the comments didn't give me enough hope of forking out lots of bucks for a film I had never seen nor had any clues about.  I basically got the idea it was a sexy youthoriented romp being compared to many cookiecutter teen thrillers. Well something in the back of my mind told me to ignore those types of comments and buy it!  I did and was I pleasantly surprised!If it is going to be compared to any other films I would say it's a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures.  I couldn't see any comparison to films like Scream Urban Legends et al.  Yes the cast is young that's because they're med students! At least they aren't the increasingly boring high school type characters and yes some are lusty basically the character played by Anna Loos is and it is handled quite tastefully in the German language version but Anatomy is well constructed there is a tense mood throughout the sets are amazing the makeup effects are a wow and Franka Potente is very credible in her role.  I found myself enjoying all of it despite a few gaping holes in the plot!  The story of a student discovering a sortof secret society doing autopsies on stillliving patients is a rather creepy scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite clever.  Sure you could ask why didn't she just GET OUT OF THAT TOWN?  Okay but then the film would be over within a half hour.This was the first effort from the German part of Columbia Pictures and it's actually quite an impressive one.  There was a bit of care in the production and to actually offer some genuine thrills is an accomplishment. It is a bit mature in mind as it doesn't resort to constant opportunities for sexual encountersa breast fest or juvenile drug jokes.  Anna Loos' character while often making sexual remarks and looking for some fun was actually a nice touchhaving a character that was a woman more intelligent than any of the men in the school.  She found that sex was really just a distraction for her and the men rather lacking.THE IMPORTANT STUFF  Watching this film in the original German language with English or French subtitles is the BEST way to enjoy it.  I saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in English and was disgusted by the change it made in the film's tone.  I have never seen a properly dubbed film in my lifethey never can find voices that suit the film's actors or characters. Sure enough I tried to watch some of Anatomy dubbed in English and the intelligence level of it dropped severely making it seem more like a comedy. A good example is when one guy was freaked out at being cut open and screamed to be sewn back uphearing it in German he sounded frantic but dubbed in English he sounded like a comedian. Frankly I'm sick of hearing people say they can't handle reading subtitles or watch a letterboxed film.  Anatomy comes off as silly with dubbed voices that seem octaves too high for any of the people you see in the film and Anna Loos' sexual comments then just sound like awful remarks right out of Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comments about Anatomy are from people who watched it dubbed it just doesn't seem like the same film at all!  This is not a cheap horror film and deserves to be viewed as it was created.  Interesting to note that some of the English subtitles are different in scenes in the feature and the making of supplement.As it turns out I gambled and won with Anatomy.  It's a competent thriller with likeable characters and doesn't try to go for cheap thrills.".

Meeting with other students Gretchen Anna Loos and Caspar Sebastian Blomberg in the class she wonders if her family reputation will affect her chances. When she gets back to her classes she starts to wonder about the selection of corpses used and begins to suspect that something isn't right. Investigating the situation she finds evidence that an illegal practice of outlaw doctors performing unethical experiments is linked to several professors on the campus and she soon finds herself targeted to keep the secrets hidden and she races to stop them from doing so.The Good News There wasn't a whole lot to this one. One of the best parts to this is the mystery angle that's played up about what the practice is really doing and who's involved generating some tension to this one later on. The fact that it does this is actually a fun idea as there's plenty to be crept out at by the rather large amount of time spent among cadavers which is enough on it's own but here using the practice is where it really scores a lot of great scenes where she's investigating them. That the look to them is really creepy is another big plus as the look where they remain intact but are displayed so that the inner workings and organs are visible oftentimes while the skin is still attached to the rest of the body producing a cool and creepy visual. The film does include a little sleaze with it's really fun striptease in the morgue. It works nicely and really gets those elements into the film. The last good plus is the fact that the last half of the film is a fullon traditional slasher movie sequence complete with a creepy stalking through the library and out into the rest of the campus and is done with a lot of fun times and come really good moments to come along with it. It's one of the better scenes in the film and they're all quite well done leaving these as the highlights of the film.The Bad News There was a couple of really big flaws noticeable for this one. One of the main ones is the complete lack of true horror atmosphere for the film. The idea behind it isn't exactly the greatest one to provide some horror elements seemingly setup like a thriller instead with the inclusion of the evil cult and the very way it's handled in here. The fact that it's introduced into the film so very late as it is does account for some flaws as we're left with the utter dullness of the first half's focus on the special classes and the behavior surrounding them that not a lot of horrorspecific elements are presented into the film but also because it does this we don't really know a whole lot about the cult to begin. Seemingly it relies on the notion of being practitioners of illegal experiments to create it's fear of them since we know nothing about the other than how they work which can work if they only went into action more often as they don't really do that much anyway. That manages to make the cult hardly involved in the film about them and completely nonthreatening due to their absolute nonappearance and complete cluelessness over what they are actually doing effectively reducing their fear. The last flaw here is the fact that this one is really dull as it doesn't have a whole lot of stuff that manages to stick out as being worthwhile for the longest time due to the inclusion of all the other elements mentioned so far make it all the more boring. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict Not entirely worthless but not all that enjoyable either unless you happen to be a fan of these films or like the concept. If either of these apply to you then this will be highly recommended viewing otherwise this will most likely be a severe disappointment and should be viewed with caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Nudity and a mild sex scene".

The idea of ethical ignorance in the medical science world is one that pushes the viewer towards discomfort and the realism of the institutions 'Heidelberg' and the special effects make it a notentirely easy film to watch.However the characters the script and the gloss of the film all seem too familiar with the Scream movies that repopularised this sort of genre. Sadly then whilst the subject is one to care about the viewer is presented with another movie full of college student characters that we don't really get a chance to care about unresolved subplots and hammy stagekillings that have been reinventing themselves since the memorable Drew Barrymore opening scene in Scream several years back.Steven Ruzowillzky makes a fair effort of the script and the direction but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme.  Whilst we are presented with an entertaining film with some reasonable performances we are unfortunately left with the old feeling nothing is wrong with this film but nothing is extraordinary either.An entertaining film and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers have been influenced by the postscream 'horror' culture.  6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I had reasonably high expectations for this. The controversial subject matter was a good concept. As a horror fan I admit I was fascinated and very excited about this.It turns out they had a great idea but it was terribly executed. Let's see. This movie seems to run in 3 modes Happy Sex and Dark. The problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be. The Happy parts I believe were meant to contrast with the Dark parts but it doesn't work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons.The movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly I can't even begin to say how much the directing and editing suck. There's sex in the most unappealing and unerotic way. I'm not complaining but even for Horror standards they were unnecessary and filler.The characters are all unlikeable with the exception of Paula Potente. Her friend from Munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies I've come across recently.There's a bit of plot which I won't go into detail... It's not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. There's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on. Don't try to understand everything because there are giant plot holes here.It's all so shoddily done that you don't care for the victims the perpetrators anyone. And to think this could have been great. I can say ONE good thing about it which is the movie shed some light on today's unethical medical procedures. With genetics and controversial sciences advancing this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions. But you won't find that here just a series of scenes loosely pasted together with people and things that you don't care about.Skip this and go watch Flatliners instead you're welcome.310".

This German thrillerhorror film is nowhere near perfect or even 'great' yet it's a lot more refreshing original and imaginative than what we've seen from Hollywood lately! Unlike the tedious and uninspired USslashers Anatomie brings forward quite a lot of suspense gruesome violence and a couple of interesting ideas and settings. The wholesome of this interesting mixture still is somewhat flawed but at least the attempt is there and you have to respect that. The story of Anatomie handles about a superintelligent group of students who're selected to enjoy a special education at Heindelberg University! One of them Paula Franka Potenta soon discovers that a traditional foundation of surgeons is still active in Heindelberg. They perform unethical experiments on dead bodies...Now within this organization there are even bigger weirdos who suffer from some sort of strange fetish for human intestines! It's up to Paula to put a stop to this unorthodox manners but who else can she trust?!? Indeed this basic plot is a little farfetched and therefore Anatomie goes over the top multiple times. Also some of the characters are really difficult to take serious...They're supposed to be the most intelligent young medicinestudents in all Germany and all they ever talk about is sex and...more sex! Franka Potenta the overtalented girl from the culthit 'Lola Rennt'does succeed in making herself believable though! There also is a good use of music scenery and  very important  medical slang!! Your head will start to spin when hearing all those Latin names for diseases and drugs...Nevertheless I hardly think it was necessary to try and make this film look even more intelligent than it is. It remains entertainment in the first place! Anatomie was a huge success in Germany and the neighboring countries. It also found its way to the American cultcircuit and a sequel was released in 2003. Especially recommended if you need a break from the overblown Hollywood screamers!".

It's an interesting story but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what's going on and then it's kind of a horror movie with the heroine fighting off the bad boy of the group that's taking things to the next psychotic level. Although this movie was made in Europe it plays to a young American audience with it's focus on gore sex and the horror film premisewhich is really it's big downfall and explains why it probably made good money and spawned a sequel but doesn't necessarily make for a good movie.".

The whole teenflick horror genre usually goes in a very simple predictable way.  Lots of 'tense' moments creepy guys who are insane and the big question of all is the boyfriend the murderer?  This movie fits into the category of Scream and countless others which have spawned over the 90s.  Well I won't spoil it for you but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer.  We find out who it is half way through... and from there on the movie drudges on trying to fill in some time... rather boringly to say the least.  I was looking at the clock a bit on this movie.The lead actress is great as usual but the carboard acting box she is placed into makes one groan in pain... the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane but she is the one who really knows whats going on.

Likable characters genuine mystery suspense graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack.This stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years. German cinema is going from strength to strength just lately. Its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out. It is easily available on DVD so even if you hate subtitles I think you should see it. It will be one of the best horror films you will see all year.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had such a good premise to start with. Suspense slashers a secret society and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie.But it contained so many dumb clichs from the worst of the old American slasherhorror movies. Now I love slasherhorror movies but there are all the old clichs that have long disappeared from American cinema. For example the old I hear noises in the basement and I'm home all alone and the basement light doesn't work so I'll go down to investigate clich.Three examples of these clichs just really irked me to no end 1 When Potente finds out that there may be a secret society at work at the medical school carving up live bodies she proceeds to ask questions and tell EVERYONE  very publicly. In essence she is saying I found you out. Come kill me because I am telling everyone your secret. And then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over her bed and is brought her roommate's severed finger in a towel.2 Even after one guy she met two weeks ago ends up on the dissection table and she finds out about this secret society disemboweling live people she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are stored 23 more times BY HERSELF AT NIGHT to investigate.3 Her roommate gets killed. She gets chased by the killer whom she knows doesn't report him to the university or the police then leaves the school to go home to visit her parents. Then she returns to school apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let bygones be bygones and not try to kill her even though she knows his secret. She was of course wrong.For someone who was supposed to be so smart she was studying to be a doctor in the best school in Germany she acted like the clich bimbo in a horror movie.These things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating and made me wish the ending would come even sooner. Halfway through the movie I stopped routing for her and wished that she would end up on the dissection table too.".

Therefore there is some enjoyable gore and violence and some that is disturbing at the same time.Our villains are actually revealed sooner than one might think so what follows is a little the end always justifies the means speechifying but not too too much of it from these determined individuals. Of course some of them are committed to their cause and there are others that are simply psychotic.There's a little bit of sex as well as some nudity so Anatomie delivers on a visceral level. It's very slick from a technical viewpoint with some wonderful widescreen photography especially outdoors.The clinical approach of our villains is contrasted with the understandably reviled emotional reactions of our heroine Paula convincingly portrayed by Ms. Potente.

	schema:reviewBody "This is Anatomy a German psychological thriller film from 15 years ago. It is actually one of the more known German movies abroad and it features Franka Potente playing the lead character briefly after her breakthrough in Lola rennt. Looking at how long ago this was made it is a bit surprising that so many actors in this film are actually still very popular today. This includes Benno Frmann Oliver Wnuk Sebastian Blomberg Anna Loos and maybe Rdiger Vogler who already worked in the 1970s with Wim Wenders. The writer and director is Stefan Ruzowitzky from Austria. He won an Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Feature category for Die Flscher a while ago but Anatomie or maybe also Die Siebtelbauern were his breakthrough films.Here we follow a young medicine student who gets accepted at a prestigious university but quickly finds out that there are dark forces performing unethical experiments on a regular basis. The most interesting fact however is that these are not the real antagonists in this movie. It is more the radical wing of this group I just mentioned who are not scared of killing whenever and whomever they like. Now my general perception of this film is a doubleedged sword. I liked parts of it and felt is was a decent thriller but other parts I was not too fond of at all. This already starts with my perception that Frmann Loos and Wnuk are simply no talented actors in my opinion. Especially Loos did nothing for me here. Literally the only reason why I felt she was in this film was to show her in the end when she was dead. Apart from that Holger Speckhahn is not an actor by any means. Not even a good television show host but even worse as an actor. Blomberg who has more range has been given a stupid role of a love interest to the main character that adds almost nothing to the film where he cannot put his talent on show at all. The only somewhat good thing was that you could wonder about basically every character in this film if he was good or bad and keep changing your opinion throughout the entire film repeatedly. For example I was fairly certain that Loos' character would be actually evil and her friendship with Potente's character was just facade.Talking about Potente she looks stunning in here and she is also maybe the best actor in this movie. Sad to see her career has gone south a lot since then. The ending credits include a nice German song names Alles Everything and the refrain says something like do you believe this was already everything?. This does not really make sense in terms of the story in this film but it makes sense looking at the fact that Ruzowitzky made a sequel a couple years later. About this one here I recommend it to fans of horror thrillers or fans of scalpel action but everybody else can do without it. It's not half as good as it's famous.".

Granted Anatomie was made in 2000 but even more recent German films and TV shows always have a 90s feel to them due to various reasons the most prominent being the typically allwhite cast. German films are very 'Disney' in the sense that there seems to be this 'ideal' vision of what Germany looks like or rather what the German audience looks like but the reality is that times have changed and even Disney is finally updating its thinking. German films need to diversify stop portraying women as simple stereotypes and stop promoting smoking in films. I am sick to the back teeth of seeing the main protagonists light up in every single German film I watch. Not just because 'morals' but also because it's distracting. As soon as someone takes that first drag you know their breath absolutely stinks so if this is happening right before a love scene it's completely offputting.Another thing I've noticed is that German films will often have a fascinating premise and will start off strong but will then falter towards the middle like they don't know how to properly pace a film or write an engaging story from start to finish. I sometimes wish people would send me their scripts for review before selling them to studios! I did feel that the film was very predictable but luckily Anatomie doesn't try to be a 'true' mystery. The bad guys is revealed fairly early on but there was at least one twist which I didn't figure out until near the end.A special mention for Benno Frmann a powerful actor who simply terrifies in every scene. He also worked with Franka Potente in the superb Der Krieger und die Kaiserin 2000 where he put those tremendous eyes of his to good use too.After the opening and an initial genuinely gruesome and terrifying scene the horror of which Hostel 2005 later replicated Anatomie loses momentum and meanders down an irrelevant path instead of focusing on the daily duties of the students at the medical school. That was a huge missed opportunity and like so many other German films I've watched it felt like a case of 'the audience is invested now we can switch to autopilot'.I only watched this a few hours ago and already I can't remember the ending. There was another ending during the credits so maybe that's interfering. No I've got it it was an extremely predictable although fitting ending.If you have time to kill this is definitely worth a watch. It will however be almost instantly forgotten.610".

Real human bodies injected with a plastic like substance leaving their muscles and vital organs on display in amazing detail. Medical horror movies seem hit a nerve so to speak as they prey on primal fears that everyone can relate to. All the way back to the original Frankenstein medical horrors have been a staple of the genre. The environments are cold and sterile with lots of stainless steel instruments from scalpels saws and drills. Putting you life in the hands of a possibly insane stranger is their anything else more scary? Yes there is being operated on while still awake! Ahhhhh! Paula is a bright med student who gets accepted to the prestigious Heidelberg Medical School who discovers the existence of a secret society. Heidelberg opens its new state of the art anatomy wing where the students have access to all the corpses they can handle. But when Paula recognizes a guy who ends up on her table she starts to investigate his death. She finds a mysterious tattoo on his ankle and a very unusual blood sample. It is found to have a sort of plastic polymer in it. Paula's investigations lead to a ancient secret society called the Antihippocratics. All doctors take a Hippocratic oath to help patients but not this group. Their research is paramount as they use live people to practice on and learn from. Putting aside medical ethics for the greater good.Although this movie is pretty dark and disturbing their are several moments of dark humor that lighten the mood a bit. The effects used are pretty awesome and the highlight of the movie. It does however suffer from a poor script and doesn't hold up to a reality check. Anatomy is and intense and graphic ride that is worth at least one watch. The Body Worlds exhibits that continue to travel around the world did originate in Germany but thankfully use willing donors.".

Anna was hilarious with her naughty comments throughout. As an aside she is supposedly the lead singer of or a member of a band called Leck mich am Arsch which is also the name of a Mozart composition. You can have a lot of fun googling that bit of German. She does do a song in the movie soundtrack.She is a doctor doing some research and stumbles on an old German medical society that does autopsies on people while they are still alive using some sort of paralyzing drug. Lots of suspense as they discover she knows who they are and come after her  sort of like Extreme Measures.Also stars Benno Frmann who was in the superb Joyeux Nol and who I am sure many will see in next year's Speed racer. Yes it's not just Frake and Anna there are plenty of German hunks for the ladies.".

True to his word the dreams that Wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin' hot schoolgirls  but the dreams come with a price that's more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost blackmails Wong out of his cash and business kills his family and eventually kills Wong himself...Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on and eventually finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil sorcerer  but as it turns out  Wong's brother is a pretty dopeass sorcerer himself and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife  turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes...EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more enjoyable CATIII films I've seen in a while. Absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other CATIII entries like RED TO KILL THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP  EROTIC NIGHTMARE though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter is more fun then some of the more serious films of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA  a more carefree CATIII entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore without being overly comedic either.

She decided she wanted to watch Closer which seemed like such a repellant idea that I had to rent another film for once she'd gone to bed. Looking around I didn't see much that interested me but saw The Doll Master in the new releases section. Just based on the cover sleeve A woman with a dolllike face crying tears of blood I thought this would be interesting enough to rent.As for the film itself watching it in an almost empty house with all the lights turned off it was pretty scary. I must admit I've always had a bit of a phobia of dolls since I was a kid and watched an awful film called Asylum one of the stories in it involved a mental patient creating a doll which killed people. Lame but scary at the time and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me. The first half hour in particular was awesome. The creepy foreboding atmosphere really set the scene well and without moving the dolls seemed genuinely threatening. But unfortunately as soon as they did start to move it all got a bit cheesy I was a bit disappointed when moments that could have been genuinely frightening made me laugh because of the way they were filmed.As for the characters it's a horror film you're not really expecting anything memorable. I found I remembered names and faces better than most Asian horror films I've seen which suggests there must have been some hidden character development that I didn't consciously notice. The typical stereotypes are out in force in this movie each one having some kind of character quirk that sets them apart from the others from shy and quiet Yeongha and her doll Damien to the outgoing bimbo Seonyeong.The plot itself was fairly cool even though the ending which bought together many of the loose strands of plot seemed a bit confused and didn't really do anything for me although it did have a couple of really cool plottwists that I won't ruin here. The basic plot is a bunch of kids are invited to be modelled as dolls by a famous reclusive old doll maker they have to stay in the creepy house adorned with scary dolls some big some small and things start to happen as our heroine Haemi starts to explore areas of the house and things start happening to the other inhabitants.Overall I would definitely recommend the film not to watch with too many people as some of the moments would probably make you laugh if surrounded by friends but as something too watch on your own in the dark with the windows and doors open just a bit just in case any dolls feel like watching with you. It really does leave you guessing for most of the film allowing you to go off on wild conspiracy theories only to completely destroy them later on. If you really get into it and ignore it's cheesiness in places I can guarantee you'll check under your bed before you go to sleep and maybe even leave the lights on.Or maybe that's just me P As for Closer it was OK but I preferred this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Doll Master is the directorial debut of South Korean director Yong ki Jeong. It is a story in the House on Haunted Hill 1959 format whereby a wealthy eccentric invites a group of unwitting outsides to their manor for twisted reasons that they're less than upfront about.In this case the eccentric rich person is some sort of doll maker who adorns her house with creepy lifesized dolls. Every room has some sort of doll in an unsettling pose. Of course it isn't long before people start dying and you can guess the rest.This film was not entirely thrilling as it was a hackneyed clich premise and the acting and filming weren't entirely impressive either. Worth a watch if you're in for some light entertainment a la Steve Beck's remake Thir13en Ghosts 2001 but hardly an earthshattering experience.This review originally appeared at httpparanoidcinephilia.blogspot.com".

The tension is extreme throughout the movie and it constantly changes your perception of the horrors that the characters encounter. What I mean by this is that once you think you've figured out how the horrors can take place the movie throws something different at you to make you think different.It's a little reminiscent of The Grudge and adds a new twist to the evil dollgenre. All the actors did a great job but the once who really stand out are the guy who invites everyone to the mansion and YuMi. Especially HaeMi as YuMi delivers a stunning performance.The story is very strong with a lot and I mean A LOT of twists as well as impressive writing. The plot throws something different at you every 10 minutes or so never leaving you bored or making you take your eyes off the screen.Only watch this if you want to enjoy a rich story get freaked out scared out of your mind and love dolls!1010".

Rather all hinges on whether you are ready to go along with the main supernatural premise of the film  if you cannot then you will find it difficult to enjoy. If you can then there is much to savour in a decent cast of characters a literate script especially the first half great visuals and a true sense of foreboding generated by the inherently spooky rural setting and clever lighting. I let myself go with the flow and found the whole experience truly disturbing. Admittedly the ending is a bit drawn out and melodramatic but contains a really effective twist.

So much could have been done with this premise. There were a lot of scenes where there was room for tension and suspense. And I really was expecting creepy things to happen. But never did the movie managed to be scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. I actually thought that they did this on purpose in order to surprise us with some wonderful twist. Sadly this doesn't happen. Well at least not in the way that I hoped for. The cast also failed to make it all believable. It would have been nice if more background was given on the characters. In the beginning when we get introduced to the main character. It seems that she and other characters are invited by some sort of artist. But it also is apparent that they don't have an idea themselves what they are invited for. Of course this is part of the mystery. But it does seem unlikely. If I got an invitation without having a clue what the deal is I simply would not go. Furthermore most characters aren't real likable with the end result that you never actually care for them. Another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise which is scary enough and brings up new elements that never get explained and aren't even relevant to the Doll Master mystery. Overall this movie has been a big disappointment to me. If you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls go see Dead Silence!".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of horror movies in particular and also being a big fan of Asian cinema I bought this movie from Amazon and was sort of excited to watch it because it had gotten fairly good reviews and the cover of the DVD looked appealing. And the cover also said Exciting... An atmospheric terror story... A welcome addition to the genre of Asian horror.  So with those words and the movie's first impression I popped it into the DVD player.The story was easy enough to follow it just didn't really make any particular sense. There were a couple of glitches and holes here and there in the plot which really made the movie come off less believable than intended. The overall plot is basically discarded dolls returning to life by some spirits and seeking vengeance on those who threw them away and needed them no more. Yeah alright not really much of a solid plot right there.As far as The Doll Master goes for scares then there was none for me. But I am sure Asian people sitting down with the movie will be in for the odd shock here and there because of the thing they have with the hair covering the face lots of that trick being used in the movie. That never was scary to me though.The acting in the movie was adequate enough though the main actress did put me off. She wandered around with a constant look of grand surprise and shock on her face that really didn't work. It was like watching a female Asian version of Nicholas Cage here  one facial expression for every scene no matter if it was a sad scene scary scene funny scene etc. That didn't' work well and I think had they opted with another actress that would have made it a tad more enjoyable. Don't get me wrong her acting was fine enough it was just her lack of facial expressions aside from the one that was glued on there.One of the best things about The Doll Master was the attention to detail. There was a lot of really nice touches to the house and the dolls in particular in this movie. So that at least was working in favor of the movie. And the scene that worked out the best for me in the entire movie was the toilet scene. I will not spoil anything here and give away anything just watch it.If you enjoy Asian horror movies and have nothing better to do you can give The Doll Master a go though you will not be in for anything extraordinary or spectacular. And there are far better Asian horror movies available out there both new and old movies. I wasn't impressed with this movie one bit though I did sit through it from start till end.".

	onyx:emotionText "Being a fan of horror movies in particular and also being a big fan of Asian cinema I bought this movie from Amazon and was sort of excited to watch it because it had gotten fairly good reviews and the cover of the DVD looked appealing. And the cover also said Exciting... An atmospheric terror story... A welcome addition to the genre of Asian horror.  So with those words and the movie's first impression I popped it into the DVD player.The story was easy enough to follow it just didn't really make any particular sense. There were a couple of glitches and holes here and there in the plot which really made the movie come off less believable than intended. The overall plot is basically discarded dolls returning to life by some spirits and seeking vengeance on those who threw them away and needed them no more. Yeah alright not really much of a solid plot right there.As far as The Doll Master goes for scares then there was none for me. But I am sure Asian people sitting down with the movie will be in for the odd shock here and there because of the thing they have with the hair covering the face lots of that trick being used in the movie. That never was scary to me though.The acting in the movie was adequate enough though the main actress did put me off.

The closest comparison to the scenes between the two leads Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan is the character interaction seen in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses the Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise.The acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm lift the movie above many of the others on view in Sitges.Overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face.".

I was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very accurate to the time really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time. This movie works just as well as a periodpiece as it does a horrorcomedy.The interaction between the two leads was very fluid. They played off each others acting with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written with Glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations.The story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start. I'd compare it to a visual page turner always wondering just what will happen next. The characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself.All in all I recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour with a bit of horror mixed in.910".

While he sits in his cell awaiting his execution a priest named Father Duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave robber. He then proceeds to give Father Duffy a quasi biography of his more interesting exploits.The plot pretty much consists of several incidents only tied together by chronology. This prevents the viewer from ever getting bored but it also makes the events less significant as you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it much. Though flawed I thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining. Most of the various stories are good specifically the alien the Murphy's and the vampire but others weren't so great.The acting isn't amazing but I didn't find it bad at any point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it mattered and also play very well into the comedic parts of the film.The characters were not extremely indepth but they were all interesting. I also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in a overthetop almost comic book manner. The part with the back story of the Murphy's and their gang is priceless.So overall I Sell the Dead very successfully combines horror comedy and scifi into a mish mash of fun and excitement.

You won't be laughing out loud hysterically with this one but you'll be smiling the whole way through. The humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn't hurt. I really watched this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it.

If you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off then this isn't the one for you.For the budget that this movie was filmed on the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget!The story was truly well done and the director is to be commended. There is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! The acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which I am definitely holding out for! I have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic.In a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a graverobber. It tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the robber duo encounters. Vampires to Zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as simple graverobbers stealing for jewellery but quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor Angus Scrim who requires bodies for his medical practise. When the duo find a way to have a vampire dispatch their cruel employer the graverobbers discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing regular dead bodies. The only problem is that there is another gang called the house of Murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses and thats where both graverobbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences.This movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that I have seen in years and reminds me of the Evil Dead. Don't miss this one you will regret it!".

If you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off then this isn't the one for you.For the budget that this movie was filmed on the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget!The story was truly well done and the director is to be commended.

Ron Perlman turns in a fantastic performance as usual as a lessthansympathetic jailhouse priest. Bonus Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always he balances menace and humor perfectly.This is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since Vincent Price did Comedy of Terrors The Raven and Theater of Blood. The movie is genuinely scary in places then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode keeping you totally off balance. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time.I can only afford to see three movies at SIFF this year but even if the other two are awful I Sell The Dead was worth the price of all three. I'm going to be looking for more movies from Larry Fessenden's Glass Eye Pix. He's giving the horror genre a muchneeded kick in the butt.".

They soon come into contact with a rival graveplundering gang led by the vicious corpsegrinder Cornelius Murphy. Several twists and turns are contained within peppered by obvious comedic elements. Unfortunately I've seen better attempts at black comedy on BET. As I mentioned earlier rating this film is not an easy task. Part of me thoroughly enjoyed the artistic approach and silly premise. On the other hand I had a difficult time interpreting the pace. Several scenes felt disjointed and outofplace leaving me to ponder whether or not it was intentional. The acting is solid of course.

There's an amusing twist involving Duffy's real motives behind interrogating Blake and I Sell the Dead is rife with all sorts of gallows humor. I think this movie's success is in the perfect casting Monaghan to me has never been better and his storytelling is handled with jolly good flair. Perlman as his ears to the endless series of strange vignettes and Fessenden as Blake's grimy but loyal partnerincrime add substantial support. The score is quite reminiscent to Danny Elfman and fits the movie's tone suitably well. A Burke and Hare comedy featuring the undead how could I not like this? My only gripe is some rather blah computer graphics although I love the hell out of a good talking decapitated head gag. Some minor cannibalism with a spattering of gore from time to time. I just adore the way Blake describes the House of Murphy and how the director presents them. I also liked how the director evokes the period with plenty of Gothic touches here and there. I do wish the movie had more of Scrimm. The movie's most bonker highlight regards a certain frozen corpse Blake and Grimes are hired to collect which introduces us to Cornelius Murphy. There's some magnificent lighting on display in this film such as how Cornelius is shadowed. Cleverly edited as well. A real treat for fans of black humor.".

	schema:headline " Big Sloppy Horror Comedy is Funny but Lacks Ambition";
	schema:reviewBody "I Sell the Dead is a big sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. This has advantages and drawbacks. The 85 minutes of the film breeze by and the film is full of bits sometimes funny sometimes scary sometimes gory occasionally all three at once but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the film's parts.The story such as it is follows professional grave robber Arthur Blake played by Dominic Monaghan. Arthur's partnerincrime Willie Grimes Larry Fessenden has just had his head chopped off for murder and Arthur has one night left before his own head is forfeit for the same crime. Arthur insists that he is innocent of murder but there are plenty of other crimes that he is willing to confess to when bribed with Irish Whisky by a Catholic priest played by Ron Perlman.Since the movie is a series of graverobbing anecdotes confessed by Arthur it becomes a sort of horror anthology  a series of disjointed tales all linked by a similar cast Arthur and Willie and a similar theme grave robbing. Like most horror anthologies there is no consistent mythology because all mythologies are true and happening simultaneously even when they contradict one another.It probably didn't help that I saw this film the same night as Trick 'r Treat a horror anthology that avoids all of the traps that I Sell The Dead falls into. In fact Trick 'r Treat designed as an anthology tells a more unified consistent story than I Sell The Dead which is intended to be a united narrative.The other problem with the film and I recognize that this is insane nitpicking is the way the film plays fast and loose with history. Grimes is killed with a Guillotine. We might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a Scottish Maiden a precursor to the French Guillotine but the Scottish Maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set a good hundred years later since Burke and Hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in 1829. Grave robbing as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832 so the film must take place before then.I know that bringing this up is the ultimate in historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all sorts of dead undead and legendary dead are possible but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy to convince the audience to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy off of. And it's not like the history of grave robbers or body snatchers or resurrectionists call it what you like is a boring story.The most frustrating thing is that writer.director Glenn McQuaid clearly does know the history especially the good bits. As an example when Grimes first takes on Arthur as his apprentice he correctly explains to Arthur that as resurrectionists they don't steal the clothes from the dead because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor punishable by a small fine while stealing clothes is a felony punishable by deportation or possibly even death. So you would expect Wille and Arthur to strip the corpse at this point and for the rest of the film but of course they don't. You could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script but not when the writer and the director are the same person.My point isn't that there should have been a lot of bucknaked corpses in the film my point is that if you are going to bring up this quirk in the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law no matter how silly it is than you do have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion even if that means that Willie and Arthur wind up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip his or her clothes off and stuffing them back in the empty coffin so that they don't get deported for stealing the walking corpse's clothes otherwise don't bring up the matter at all.Historical nerdiness aside I Sell The Dead is worth a rental as a slight but funny horror film that could have been much more.".

Anyway our hero such as he is relates his tale to a monk Ron Perlman the only real name in the film. He recalls how he was recruited into the bodystealing trade by Willie Grimes and how they toiled under the insatiable demands of a wicked doctor  until that is they discovered a sort of submarket in the bodies of the undead which means the film should really be called I Sell the Undead but no matter.Now as you can imagine it's around about this point in the movie that all discerning viewers will probably raise their eyes skyward and either reach for the remote or like me settle down behind folded arms in the hope that things will somehow improve. The story however meanders along wandering up a few dead ends scratching its head ambling back the way it came. Our heroes discover a baby alien in one of the graves they desecrate. They look at it with slight puzzlement for a moment before it is snatched from them by Cornelius Murphy one of a rival gang of bodysnatchers and never spoken of again. Nobody seems inclined to explain why the ghoulish undead are being transported hither and yon or by whom the audience are just expected to accept this traffic without question.I'm not quite sure what market the film is trying to attract. It seems to be aiming for irreverent black humour but it misses most of the time. The ghouls are imaginatively designed but there's little sense of period or setting due presumably to the meagre budget. When a film is deprived of such a vital component it's writing needs to be of a high enough standard to absorb the viewer and make them at least capable of overlooking its other shortcomings. I Sell the Dead fails to do this and suffers badly as a consequence".

	schema:reviewBody "While awaiting the guillotine a man recounts the story of him and his partner's quest to dig up the bodies of the dead to deliver to a doctor for medical study and how one such encounter lead to them encountering the dead walking the Earth.On the whole this one was an enjoyable if flawed effort. The biggest effort holding this one back is that hardly anything at all happens in here as the action scenes here are so infrequent that it really stumbles around with its pacing. Concentrating on how they're going about graverobbing as successfully as they are for as long as this one does really affects this one at rather large segments of time without offering a lot of interesting scenes here and that also manages to expose other flaws here. by forgoing the horror action there's other scenes here that need to take up that time which comes in the form of several lame subplots that don't impart much action on the action as the involvement of the girlfriend serves nothing here with their relationship not really providing the obstacle it's supposed to be for them to keep their business secret. There's never anything about her discovering them and the scenes weren't all that integral to what's going on for the pace while the constant scenes interrupting the plot going back to the jail cell aren't all that welldone either as it goes back to simply see what's already been given in the plot so there just eat up time needlessly. As well the comedy here is a little goofy and not up to many individual's tastes here with the sound and music gags for many not really being funny which does come up as a potential problem. Overall all of these combine together into long stretches of problematic scenes here that hold it down yet still offers some rather fun times here when it was doing something that these here are fun enough. The main fun comes from the second half as that's where the zombie action is mostly centered around as it mostly starts with the eerie journey to the island with the nighttime setting and heavy fog masking the source of the growls coming off incredibly atmosphere before the chaos and panic once they find the box containing the captive zombie and how he gets loose providing some stellar action in the escapes and encounters as well as giving off some solid gore. Likewise despite not really offering a lot of action the opening does have some stellar atmospheric shots of the two out and about graverobbing which is full of creepy and rather chilling scenes throughout here. Along with the creepy makeup these here make up the films' best parts here with these hold it up though as a zombie film this is lowered due to their lack of screentime.Rated UnratedR Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.".

Concentrating on how they're going about graverobbing as successfully as they are for as long as this one does really affects this one at rather large segments of time without offering a lot of interesting scenes here and that also manages to expose other flaws here. by forgoing the horror action there's other scenes here that need to take up that time which comes in the form of several lame subplots that don't impart much action on the action as the involvement of the girlfriend serves nothing here with their relationship not really providing the obstacle it's supposed to be for them to keep their business secret. There's never anything about her discovering them and the scenes weren't all that integral to what's going on for the pace while the constant scenes interrupting the plot going back to the jail cell aren't all that welldone either as it goes back to simply see what's already been given in the plot so there just eat up time needlessly. As well the comedy here is a little goofy and not up to many individual's tastes here with the sound and music gags for many not really being funny which does come up as a potential problem. Overall all of these combine together into long stretches of problematic scenes here that hold it down yet still offers some rather fun times here when it was doing something that these here are fun enough. The main fun comes from the second half as that's where the zombie action is mostly centered around as it mostly starts with the eerie journey to the island with the nighttime setting and heavy fog masking the source of the growls coming off incredibly atmosphere before the chaos and panic once they find the box containing the captive zombie and how he gets loose providing some stellar action in the escapes and encounters as well as giving off some solid gore. Likewise despite not really offering a lot of action the opening does have some stellar atmospheric shots of the two out and about graverobbing which is full of creepy and rather chilling scenes throughout here. Along with the creepy makeup these here make up the films' best parts here with these hold it up though as a zombie film this is lowered due to their lack of screentime.Rated UnratedR Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.";

	schema:reviewBody "I thought Rachel York was fantastic as Lucy. I have seen her in Kiss Me Kate and VictorVictoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations. She is a chameleon who can play and sing anything!I am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding Rachel's performance in Lucy. Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel doesn't really look like Lucy. My response to that is So what? I wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of Lucy. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel certainly gave us that in great depth. I also didn't want to see someone simply doing classic Lucy routines. Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have Rachel portray Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits  Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. It seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits. This approach I thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. I also thought Rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated  the Professor and the Grape Stomping in particular. There was one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember Lucy having. I couldn't believe she was able to capture that  and so naturally.I wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the Lucille Ball of I Love Lucy throughout the entire movie. After all those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what Lucy was really like in her early movie years. I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. She planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances. Lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.I believe that Rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon. And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. Lucy was a star turn for Rachel York. I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. I also hope it brings her an Emmy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dramatic license  some hate it though it is necessary in retelling any life story. In the case of Lucy the main points of Lucille Ball's teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to Desi Arnaz are all included albeit in a truncated and reworked way.The main emotional points of Lucy's life are made clear Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend her turbulent romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to Desi Arnaz Lucy  Desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as TV's most memorable sitcom couple.As Lucille Ball Rachel York does a commendable job. Do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one Judy Davis made when playing Judy Garland but York makes Ball strongwilled yet likable and is very funny in her own right. Even though her comedictiming is different than Lucy's she is still believable. The film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of Vivian Vance during the early I Love Lucy years but watching York portray Lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion.Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with Desi's accent especially in the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent if not overly memorable as the teenaged Lucy.Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not featured much thankfully since Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles. Not that they aren't good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing. Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland and the repressed accents are detectable at times.Although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact there are many deviations some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. Jess Oppenheimer the head writer of Lucy's radio show My Favourite Husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with I Love Lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! This movie also depicts Marc Daniels as being the main I Love Lucy director for its entire run completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! Also though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints the Ricardo's are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and offscale from the original as well. The Connecticut home looks pretty close to the original except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. There's also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953 during Lucy's redscare incident even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher two vital figures in I Love Lucy history? The biggest gaff comes in the I Love Lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them. It's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made. The scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! The We're Having A Baby number was shortened as well but other than that it was practically dead on. By far the best was the grapestomping scene with Rachel York really nailing Lucy's mannerisms. The producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the Vitametavegamin and candy factory bits instead showing the actors rehearse them. These scenes proved effective because of that approach.The film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about Lucy's life since much is skimmed over or omitted at all. Overall though it gives a decent portrait of Lucy  Desi's marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very welldone TV movie. The production values are high the acting is usually excellent and the story is factual for the most part. Honestly I have seen few movie biographies that were as factual as this. Some details are incorrect and events that did happen are sometimes in the wrong order but to me these are minor issues. I have seen biopics that captured most of the right details but they were presented in a way that was not true to the spirit of what happened. While not 100 accurate the spirit of the reallife personalities and events was usually captured. The most inconsistent thing in the movie is that virtually no one in the movie seems to age significantly especially Danny Pino as Desi Arnaz. He looks like he ages five years at the most from 1940 to 1960. His performance is ten times better than the actor who played him in Lucy and Desi Before the Laughter though. Pino plays Arnaz in a way that is slightly exaggerated and feels like an impersonation at times but it is an effective performance. Rachel York does an excellent job playing Lucille Ball although she is written to be a little more like Lucy Ricardo than the real Lucille Ball ever was. York has a zany or ditsy quality that Ball never had in real life. I enjoyed how the love and fun of Lucy and Desi's relationship came through as well as the tragedy. This movie had a nice balance of the fun times and the hard times. It also moves along at a quick pace never really dragging. If you were to watch this movie and Lucy and Desi a Home Movie the definitive documentary on Lucy and Desi back to back you would find that most of the facts about their lives are accurately reproduced in this movie. Some casting could have been better such as the actress who played Vivian Vance she did not look act or sound at all like Vance and in some cases the facts could have been better represented but overall a wellproduced accurate and entertaining movie.".

Boy was I surprised! I thought it was excellent and Rachel York was excellent IN it. Her voice sounded almost exactly like Lucy. She was a little prettier but once her hair was red she was a GREAT Lucy. I loved the way she did Lucy's most famous scenes and stunts. They didn't look any different than when Lucy did them from the first one on stage to the famous wine vat. She had all the right movements and I thought she was just perfect.I LIKED that they didn't spend a lot of time on Fred and Ethel they showed that they were cast and she and Ethel had their scenes together but it was all about Lucy as it should have been.Danny Pino was a great Desi. I'm really used to seeing him on SVU so it was a little hard to disconnect them but he did all his iconic scenes very well and if he did his own singing he was great.I recommend this movie. I was not familiar with Rachel York clearly this must have been toward the beginning of her career and now she's a Broadway star but I can't say enough what a great Lucy she played. To be able to get Lucy's nuances and quirks so well she was top notch.I'm pulling my review out for editing because after reading OTHER reviews I realize that it was a 3 hour movie but what I saw was cut into a twohour movie. I didn't see any of her early years that was my fault I started 20 minutes late my first view was when she drove into the driveway in California with her family. I couldn't understand why Buster Keaton was introduced and I clearly saw nothing of the RED scandal. The movie seemed complete as far as I saw it but I realize now I sure would have liked to have seen the whole three hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts with the filming of the final episode of 'The LucyDesi Comedy Hour' a continuation of the very successful 'I Love Lucy' TV series in 1960.  Lucy and Desi are privately calling each other names some of which we could never have imagined them saying to each other in an era when such words were not used on TV.  In fact this movie has quite a bit of cursing.  Meanwhile the personas they show to the public appear to tell a different story about the legendary relationship.Then we switch to the 1920s.  Young Lucille Ball helps her Uncle George sells hamburgers and she dates a boy who supposedly smuggles alcohol from Canada.  We see the ups and downs of Lucy's early life as she attempts to start an acting career including an acting class with a young Bette Davis who already appears to show promise.Forward to 1931.  Lucy is goodlooking and not afraid to take a pie in the face.  These qualities give her enough success in movies that she is able to move her mother brother and grandfather west to live with her.  Then she meets Desi Arnaz and falls in love knowing that he has many women after him and that his father thought nothing of being married with a mistress. Despite Desi's reputation the two end up getting married and moving to a nice ranch and becoming friends with the likes of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard.  Desi's mother does not approve of Lucy while Desi does not care for being considered 'Mr. Ball' since his wife is more famous than he is. World War II contributes to the strain in the relationship as Desi serves in the military as a musician working for the campaign for War Bonds. Later however when the marriage appears headed for an end a tragedy brings Lucy and Desi together.Television is the future and Lucy and Desi take advantage of the chance to further their careers.  First they do a Vaudeville act in front of a live audience proving that they have what it takes to make people laugh.  A radio series follows and then the TV series that ranks as one of the alltime favorites of many.  But despite the faces they show to the world Lucy and Desi still have their problems.Madeline Zima does a fine job as young Lucy.  But Rachel York is absolutely wonderful showing the spark immediately after taking over the role in 1931. She is beautiful betterlooking than the real Lucy actually confident and determined and she has that wonderful personality.  And Daniel Pino captures Desi perfectly.  The accent and the voice make it sound as if the real Desi is actually speaking to us. In the Vaudeville routine they are perfect.  I wish I could say the same for York's performances in reenactments of the TV series.  She was good but no one could play Lucy Ricardo like Lucille Ball.  Pino however does a fine job as Ricky.  Unfortunately the actress playing Vivian Vance falls flat as Ethel.  We never do see the actor who played William Frawley in the role of Fred and he didn't stand out much as Frawley.  I did enjoy the scenes where the producers and writers tried to solve various problems the series was having even before production began.I enjoyed one scene where Lucy trained in silentmovie acting with Buster Keaton who was considerably older and fatter than he was when he was popular though the man playing him made him likeable. Other good acting performances  Lucy's AfricanAmerican maid who wanted to be in show business but experienced discrimination Desi's mother classy but not on screen very long Carole Lombard one of Lucy's closest friends and Jess Oppenheimer one of the driving forces behind the TV series.I was afraid this movie would focus too much on the negative sordid side of the LucyDesi romance.  This was true during the third hour but enough of the positives were shown to provide a balance.This movie was based on fact but certain details were changed.  In the famous chocolate factory scene with Lucy and Ethel Lucy spoke a line delivered by a third actress in reality.  After Lucy celebrated her company's purchase of RKO in 1958 according to an onscreen graphic filming on 'I Love Lucy' continued even though that series had ended production in 1957 succeeded by the hourlong show set in Connecticut. Another gaffe  an early 1960s Cadillac was shown in a scene from the early 1950s.The following might be SPOILERS  Some of Pino's best scenes came during the third hour of the movie.  In one Pino tearfully explains to the studio audience for the TV show how Lucy is not a Communist and how much he hates Communism.  As good as the performance is the Communists had yet to take over Cuba and they were in fact enemies of Batista the dictator who ran the affluent Arnaz family out of Cuba and took away everything they had. Another wonderful scene had Desi and Lucy explaining to their children what divorce meant.  The young actress playing Lucie did a fine job there.I enjoyed this movie in spite of the negatives in the lives of these two wonderful stars.".

Though we read stories of the tensions between Ball and her husbandTV costar Desi Arnez none of it seemed very real. This drama drives it home. It is a true tragicomedy. Neither of these two enormously talented personalities come across as villains.It is in the end simply a tragic clash of cultures.All performers in this production are top notch.".

There are some notbad impersonations of some legends like Eddie Cantor and young Bette Davis. A standout is the young woman portraying Carole Lombard and the 20s period stuff looks good. I wish they would have gone more into Desi's background as his early life was filled with at least as much drama as Lucy's. The woman who plays DeDe Ball really looks exactly like the real thing. The recreations of Lucy's best routines are pretty good. It must be hard to nearimpossible to try an imitate a comic genius credibly but Rachel York does a very good job. I've read nearly everything ever written about Lucy and Desi and while this film is not perfect it is generally pretty accurate.".

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent.  If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin nothing is similar in any wayher expression voice or movement.To top it all off Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.Overall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball I suggest watching AE Biography of Lucy and Desi read the book from Lucille Ball herself or PBS' American Masters Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama Before the Laughter would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in Before the Laughter is much better compared to this.  At least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.".

There have been a number of documentaries on Lucy covering all this material and watching the real people and archival footage is a lot more interesting than this play acting.   It came across as a rote dramatization of events rather than an involving drama.The script is not at all good and the recreations served only to illustrate why the real Lucy et al. were comic geniuses and these actors are not.Rachel York as Lucy fails to capture Lucy's essence. She definitely does not have her edge especially as an older woman. As Ball approached middle age she came across as very tough and coarse with a very raspy voice.  Though in fairness I would think playing someone like Lucille Ball convincingly would be near impossible. Fred and Ethel are pathetic. And Bette Davis??!!Danny Pinto as Desi fares the best. He really got the accent down and had some of Desi's swagger if not his hard edge as well.  Needless to say Desi was no where near as thin handsome and young as Pinto. Not that was really a problem  staring at him was the main reason to watch this!Anyone expcecing something along the lines of the Judy Garland bio of a few years back will be sorely disappointed.

The story revolves around two objects a rare set of 18thcentury Limoges china and a 19th century aristocratic portrait. As these items are passed sold or stolen from one character to another a giddy round dance of excess begins to take shape one which suggests that if history doesn't repeat itself it certainly rhymes. Together with cowriter Grard Brach whose other cowriting credits include Repulsion and Tess Otar Iosseliani uses a featherlight touch to expose the futility of class and social order making a bagatelle of the concerns of rich and poor alike.";

RIGHT? It has a decent portrayal of the 80ies so if you are feeling nostalgic it might do the trick. And it has an unorthodox approach of not having a conventional story per se but rather mixes up a bunch of different characters tying them up a little as time goes on.Other than that this film is a disaster. Most of the characters are terribly miscast. Most of the time they are walking around or talking with pretty much zero emotions. There is no character introduction or development whatsoever. Some scenes are so cheesy they are painful to look at ie the scene of a bomb selling gone wrong.Trying to figure out any sense in this mess is a lost cause but I'm sure there are people who will find it anywhere given enough time and motivation.

	schema:reviewBody "I won't say it's an underrated movie but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other popular Nolan movies. With this movie Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie along with Memento 2000. Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of Memento with the actual experience we had while watching the movie we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies he dwells in a single theme  here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full interchange between the antagonist and the protagonist as the movie progresses the protagonist feels more wrong than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most complex characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of Prisoners 2013 and Logan 2017. He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all in this movie. But the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed  simply excellent. It gets a special 1010 and an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "What The Prestige does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true such as the allconsuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman and audacious Alfred Borden Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lowerclass Brit each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story though adapted from a novel feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a backandforth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's Memento. As the game grows increasingly deadly and threatens to consume all they love the film becomes a fascinating study in singlemindedness.The work is epic in sweep beautifully filmed and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla he looks nothing like the actual Tesla if you care about these sort of things and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle and even Andy Serkis Gollum! in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist as the film shifts from realbutpossible stage illusion to steampunkish scifi. This transition is a hard note to pull off since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms the narrative rewards you with thoughtprovoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie and an original unusual dark ride  well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Prestige adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest is an intricate tale of passion intrigue deceit and obsession about two illusionists whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden Christian Bale and Robert Angier Hugh Jackman at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet The Great Danton with Cutter Michael Caine as his illusion engineer while Borden with the stage name The Professor with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary Borden is highly skillful but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle owing to their bitterly intertwined past and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible sabotage abduction incrimination and even killings. Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of The Transported Man and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla David Bowie in order to cajole him into building a machine for him a machine that could help him outperform Borden. Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison ruthless advocator of Direct Current and his men who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine Angier introduces his own version of The Transported Man which becomes an instant success but in lieu of a terrible selfsacrifice that Angier has to make every night while performing. As the story culminates the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge the Turn and the Prestige are performed. Similarly for a movie to be a success its three main aspects i.e. screenplay direction and acting are ought to be topnotch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie tenfold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his lowkey portrayal of Cutter an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis Gollum of LOTR as Alley Tesla's assistant are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour Olivia.The movie is a rollercoaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture which forays the realms of Mystery Thrill Scifi and Fantasy is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is Are you watching closely? A must watch for anyone who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography from script to presentation Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line playing out like a magic act itself the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first  played by Christian Bale  is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick but lacks showmanship. The second  played by Hugh Jackman  is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery drama suspense and fantasy. In that the story becomes a neverending stream of wonder for the mind one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters each adding their own viewpoint to the events and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction winter suddenly becomes springsummer and back again and a strange choice of music for the closing credits a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky. However neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.".

Add Andy Serkis to the mix and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery drama suspense and fantasy. In that the story becomes a neverending stream of wonder for the mind one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters each adding their own viewpoint to the events and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction winter suddenly becomes springsummer and back again and a strange choice of music for the closing credits a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky. However neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.";

I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing and with the impact of the human message about obsession competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other at the expense of their women and children  something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning emotional performances. Rebecca Hall who played Sarah to Bale's Alfred Borden turned in a highly charged performance as well making Scarlett Johansson's Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging while not being so complex as to lose you. If you can't follow this one you've been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isn't that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime there's a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.It asks you what is one willing to sacrifice for the prestige?I think this one's an Oscar definite.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Prestige";
	schema:reviewBody "I've said it before but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine and joined with the Scoop team consisting of XMen's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson the stellar eye candy  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out it's like a huge  magic trick with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds getting  the suspicion on how it's done but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals plod down the slow path of jealous obsession  revenge and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas to go one up against the other a fight in romance life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how magic actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge things like having pretty  assistants to distract and having planted staff amongst the audience  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier Hugh Jackman with loyalty and conviction  that they could as a team beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice arrogance and ultimately redemption especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do and for Alfred Borden I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders or flashback sequences colours etc here time is so  fluid but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in  without being explicitly told or working too much of the noodle. You  just know and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie one quote popped into mind Misdirection   what the eyes see and the ears hear the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie or to describe in  general Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?".

	schema:headline " Webby meshwork of magic and mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives Memento and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleightofhand direction he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorianera London creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long miseenscene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behindthestage intrigue.The final payoff of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence and preluding it is the pledge followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters magicians Alfred Borden Christian Bale and Robert Angier Hugh Jackman in turnofthecentury London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fullyfledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the oneupmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of loveinterests and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped I scratched my head I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which for example the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects intertwines intercuts fastforwards rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie and I agree know that this is not a gotchakind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap payoff but a tightlywritten evershifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectlycast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy slick ambitiondriven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's techniquedriven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that Borden has more layers to his complex contradictory keyword persona than the flashy greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions and indeed they are given almost the exact same screentime and voiceover narration throughout a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen Match Point  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress and resorts to boobshots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paintjob twists by the bucketload and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done and superbly so by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friendsturnedrivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder bankruptcy deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level while Angier wants the public's recognition and widespread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch as would underpinning some humour at one or two points it is VERY gloomy but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoein for my top 10 of 1006 and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleightofhand direction and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight 2008.9 out of 10".

We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie. This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation.

Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest even with two viewings because that ending has some mindboggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers let me just say the story is extremely interesting the acting very good the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it too without language or sex concerns.Basically it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!".

You want to know why keep reading.Magic is present in everybody's childhood but it is something we lose as we get older in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about how it is possible or what's the trick lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.Both movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre dramamystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.Although there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is without a doubt a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is indeed more actionpacked but no less moving than The Illusionist.These two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist.".

Hugh Jackman's closing speech is perfectly typical of this film.

He actually traveled thousands of miles spent countless amounts of money How did he have this by the way? shot stalked kidnapped and did his very best to destroy his opponent's life but he actually did it for the look on their the audience faces. Please.And plot twists? No no no my friends. There is precisely one plot twist and it is given away by the tease at the beginning of the film. As soon as you see that the hat doesn't leave you know the rest of the movie. Okay it clones things. He makes new and kills one of himself every time. It's not a huge leap in logic but the filmmakers see fit to treat the audience like a bunch of Neanderthal second graders.Finally we are supposed to like the magiciantwin that makes it back to his daughter in the end. Forgetting of course the fact that he broke Hugh Jackman's legs killed his wife crushed that innocent woman's hand and oh yes shot and killed his rival. But he was justified right? WRONG. Once again Hollywood comes out with the kind of ambiguous almostmoral movie that makes you just cringe with the pansybutt quality of their statements.Please do both me and yourself a favor and skip this tripe.".

That is just where it is confirmed to those who were in disbelief that such a great film could be utterly ruined.Plot lines are elsewhere I am just going to explain why you should skip this movie. First I will admit that except for this truly fatal flaw it is an excellent movie. And that's why this was so incredibly disappointing. The movie takes place in the 19th century. Here on earth. And there is a central mystery that is woven throughout the film and you wrack your brain trying to figure it out. You follow every twist and turn scrutinize every detail develop and evaluate theories on what the answer could be and eagerly anticipate the revealing. And then all of a sudden its science fiction. They had a cloning machine. How completely cowardly a solution that was. If you are watching Star Trek or something you know that you are in the world of science fiction where anything goes. A cloning machine is a formal possibility and if that ends up to be the explanation you fully accept it because it makes sense in that reference frame. But it is entirely out of place when you are supposedly in a period piece. Turns out it was never a period piece it was science fiction pretending to be a period piece. That's dumb. You can't develop some clever puzzle and then wimp out and never solve it but instead just invoke science fiction. Extremely lazy and irresponsible.This reminds me of another terrible move The Forgotten. Same exact fatal flaw except the rest of the movie wasn't that great either. There's a mystery with clues and evidence that are seemingly impossible to reconcile and you can't wait to find out how its being done. And then they tell you its aliens from outer space. Gee thanks. Stupid stupid stupid. Its more angering with The Prestige because it was so much the better movie and they ruined it for no reason. A cloning machine over 100 years ago? How freaking stupid.".

It is definitely an entry into the oeuvre of movies that are so obsessed by how clever its twists are that it forgets to worry about things such as sympathetic characterisation naturalistic expositional dialogue and most crucially the effective execution of said ohsoclever twists.First a few points about the script. The script is dreadful in parts with exposition that may as well be spoken directly to camera. The characters Hugh Jackman's in particular seem unrounded and without any kind of back story  seemingly plopped into the middle of an obsessive pursuit without any explanation as to where said obsessions may have originated. As happens in so many Hollywood movies the female roles are perfunctory up to the point of pastiche  did anyone else groan with anticipation of how banal and runofthemill Scarlett Johansson would be? I'd like to see a studio movie that in the absence of an integral love story crowbars in some halfassed romance entirely for the sake of some demograph of dubious existence who are believed to not want to see a movie without some histrionic sexual politics.Now on to those twists of which there are two major ones. The first whose set up is established very early on is glaringly obvious. I spent most of the film seething with frustration as lines that in what i guess the makers hoped would be in hindsight are massively irritating 'clues' to the audience. All this is abrogated by the fact that it was all clear to me from the off and i wasn't aware there was a twist to the film so i wasn't looking out for one all due to the fact that essential production values fail to adequately disguise the twist. The second twist which acts not only as plot but supposedly as a thematic comparison to the first is what left me wanting my money back. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten that suspension of disbelief must be eared through establishing what can an cannot happen in the world they have created. For example in The Matrix when we shown that it is Trinity's love for Neo that brings him back from the dead the audience is able to accept this because the reality that has been established is one of scifi machinesruletheworld type. We have been prepared to be asked to go along with the possible. The Prestige a film that throughout its running time shows and tells us that the magic in the film is one rooted in realistic trickery and that the rivalry between the two main characters is based on which can come up with the cleverest ruse believes that it does not need to ask the audience to suspend its disbelief before laying down the biggest of deus ex machina macguffins seen in recent cinema. We are expected to believe that within this realistic turn of the century world that a machine is invented that through science not magic can do what remains impossible in the present. This 'twist' represents lazy lazy storytelling  it is like the writers could not come up with an actual clever ending so just used their get out of jail free card instead.On the side there are some very pretty things to look at with impressive period detail and some imaginative compositions from Nolan. Michael Caine and Andy Serkis are both excellent and its always nice to see David Bowie on screen but thats where the acting plaudits stop. Bale and Jackman give in uncharismatic and unlikeable performances and Johanssen floats along on a wave of arbitrariness.I would say to avoid this film unless you enjoy the energy that truly hating a film can give you as it has to me.".

Yes it is an adaptation from a book but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine as printed on the DVD cover said it best You want to see it again the second it is over. Christopher Nolan who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations in Batman Begins does it again with The Prestige. The Prestige is based on a book of the same title that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick or how to upstage that trick could turn into something that would kill one another.First things first this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie The Illusionist. What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot which will make you say How did I not catch that? There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently Are you watching closely? You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.Besides all of the various twists the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.Overall there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. The Prestige is recommended!".

Robert is the illusionist and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman Robert's wife to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage like one of Houdini's escape tricks it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden Bale who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman  who was Angier's wife  drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.Now Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie losing two of his fingers. Now they are fighting at each other not physically just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE! Oh and for those who pay attention to music in movies you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a BOOM of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.Sorry if I gave too much away just PLEASE agree with my comment.

She spends the day observing other lovers' behaviors and considering whether she is ready to jump. Her age notwithstanding this movie is more about coming of age than about improper or illegal romantic relationships.If Catherine Spaak beautiful and innocent acts with brio the quality of the supporting cast makes the movie. From a fiftyyearold indebted socialite who is having too much fun for her daughter's taste to a jaunty gigolo who turns out to be eaten by unreciprocated love the minor characters entertain delight and subtly teach valuable lessons to both Francesca and the audience.This film's unpredictability is refreshing. Whether written or filmed comingofage stories often fail to surprise or intrigue the audience. In I Dolci Inganni most characters seem at first to be crazily entertaining walking clichs but they later astonish the audience by revealing their depth and their inner struggles. If love is widely accepted as a common human need it can be expressed in mysterious unsettling incomprehensible ways. The variety of its forms in the movie gives the spectator an opportunity to reflect on his or her own endeavors and dreams.This movie will seem slow paced to GenXers but anybody interested in human nature should see it.".

There's mass destruction and tons of carnage as everything onscreen is blown to bits...plus it's got Emilio Estevez. What's better than that? The movie does require major suspension of disbelief as some of the story elements don't work for example the honeymooner's car works just fine but every other machine on earth from lawnmowers electric knives trucks and even steamrollers go haywire. But then again this movie is all about fun. The best part of the movie besides Emilio is that no one is shown any sympathy...not even kids in one standout scene a steamroller comes out of nowhere and completely squashes this innocent kid. Maximum Overdrive is a cool and outrageous cult classic that Stephen King should be proud of. Sadly I feel that King will never direct again.Note for genre buffs C.H.U.D. alumni Frankie Faison and J.C. Quinn star in the movie. King himself also cameos as the ATM guy.".

The 'Who made Who' theme song conducts the beginning of the movie excellent when a traffic bridge is starting to open beyond human control. The same goes for the other songs in the movie  they really add. Secondly I like the movie for the humor in it. It's not a comedy but some scenes made me laugh  like the bible sales man who gets mad when his car is hit by a truck and he runs outside the roadhouse  cursing like hell the truck hits him into a sewer and his shoes stay behind. Or the beginning of the movie in which you see a guy withdrawing money from an ATM and on the screen the message appears 'you're an sshole'. 'Sugar buns this thing is calling me an sshole !' If you watch closely you might also notice just before this scene a digital clock on the building on which the time changes into FCK YOU. Maybe I'm just simple but I like the movie. Better than some not understandable romantic drama if you'd ask me.".

If you watch closely you might also notice just before this scene a digital clock on the building on which the time changes into FCK YOU. Maybe I'm just simple but I like the movie. Better than some not understandable romantic drama if you'd ask me.";

	schema:headline " Bmovie laugh riot";
	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King's infamously bad film of one of his own short stories certainly lives up to expectations it's pretty dire. Still there are plenty of things to laugh at and if you keep your expectations low then you can't be disappointed. The main problem with the film is that the premise of machinery coming to life isn't scary but in fact it's funny. The film doesn't know whether to make us scared or make us laugh so it tries to do both which is something very difficult. The result is that it's neither funny in an intentional way or scary. It's just weird.The best bits have to be at the beginning where we get a varied selection of killer machinery from a lawnmower to a coke machine which shoots cans at a group of kids playing baseball in one hilarious scene which you won't believe has been filmed. It's so stupid that all you can do is laugh especially when one guy is brained by a can. Death by flying coke! Well at least the film was partly original. There are other funny bits too such as a lawnmower trying to be threatening people who've been killed by electric car windows I find it hard to believe that some people were so stupid that they sat with their heads through the car windows plus the expected Stephen King cameo in which a bank machine swears at him.Sadly though from then on it's all downhill as we get trapped in a boring location with a boring group of bad actors and a boring threat i.e. a group of trucks. The trouble is that while a short film may have worked there really is nowhere to go with the truck story they run people over but that's about all they're capable of. They even put a big green goblin face to try and make one of the trucks scary but it jut didn't work. Maybe the producers interfered when they saw how bad the filming was going I don't know but some bright spark had the idea to add some action sequences i.e. gratuitous gunfire into the film to perhaps make it more exciting. They failed but at least it added to the bloodshed. The funniest moments have to be when the proud Americans attack the trucks with a rocket launcher and blast them apart cheering wildly while they do so. Although the machines do retaliate by using a machine gun to wipe out about half of the survivors in a bloody massacre.The acting as I mentioned above is pretty bad. Emilio Estevez sleepwalks through the film on autopilot he obviously thought he was the next best thing at this period in his life but oh no just look at his career in the '90s. Pat Hingle is about the only good actor in it as the obnoxious diner owner but any enjoyment of the cast's acting is destroyed by the presence of one Yeardley Smith whose snotty whiny screaming and yelling is definitely the worst point of the entire film and difficult to sit through without cringing in embarrassment. To add insult to injury she doesn't even die! Still despite all the faults the unintentional comedy makes this one easier to sit through than it might have been. Where else could you see an electric knife 'attack' a woman a kid run over by a steamroller played for laughs amazingly killer coke cans and people getting splattered by trucks left right and centre?".

The trucks led by one with a huge Green Goblin face on the front wait for the humans to leave the truck stop so they can kill them one by one.This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures from the '80s. It's a ludicrous popcorn movie with an awesome soundtrack by ACDC and a cast that includes Emilio Estevez Pat Hingle Frankie Faison Laura Harrington and Yeardley Smith. Stephen King appears in a funny cameo at the beginning. This movie was HATED at the time and remains hated today at least by stuffy film snob types. It's a fun movie!

Written rewritten and directed by King this movie is a surprisingly wonderful adaptation of his work. To date his adaptations have been rather puerile and mellow compared to his original literary publications. This will be a very pleasant surprise following the absolutely horrid Made For TV Version of The Shining 1997.While Emilio Estevez is not among my favorite top 500 actors he carries this film rather well but it's Yeardley Smith who makes the movie. Her wonderfully comedic little voice screaming out Curtis!! Are you DAYYED??!! She is what makes Maximum Overdrive fun. ACDC and killer trucks take a back seat to her performance. Loved it.

Maybe I was taking off by how campy the movie is A true celebration of the Bmovie.The concept was cool. An alien ship flying inside a strange cloud causes the machines on the planet to go haywire and the story focus on a small band of misfits trying to survive.Heading up this band is Emilio Estevez who at the time was a bigger star than his little brother Charlie Sheen. the movie is perfect for him as it's similar to other Bmovies he toke the lead on during his hey day like Repo man and Men at Work which he did with his brother. This seems to be Emilio's thing and he shines as a bad boy force to do the right thing.I'm use to being more frighten by a Stephen king story but I really was not. I don't really think it was the campy just might not have stood the test of time in this factor.What did stand out was the development of the characters. it's on the level of a good Zombie movie where everyone tries to figure out a way to keep alive while dealing with an unstoppable horror. It also reminded me of Tremors as the people were trapped in a gas station by the machines Slightly different from what I was expecting from King's work from the 80's but that might be the point. If you've seen all the other Stephen King movies than watch this one.".

An alien ship flying inside a strange cloud causes the machines on the planet to go haywire and the story focus on a small band of misfits trying to survive.Heading up this band is Emilio Estevez who at the time was a bigger star than his little brother Charlie Sheen. the movie is perfect for him as it's similar to other Bmovies he toke the lead on during his hey day like Repo man and Men at Work which he did with his brother. This seems to be Emilio's thing and he shines as a bad boy force to do the right thing.I'm use to being more frighten by a Stephen king story but I really was not. I don't really think it was the campy just might not have stood the test of time in this factor.What did stand out was the development of the characters. it's on the level of a good Zombie movie where everyone tries to figure out a way to keep alive while dealing with an unstoppable horror. It also reminded me of Tremors as the people were trapped in a gas station by the machines Slightly different from what I was expecting from King's work from the 80's but that might be the point. If you've seen all the other Stephen King movies than watch this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are several reasons why I put it upon myself to award this film the 6 out of 10 average rating. For one its' total ineptitude has an effect of unintentional laughter and lets face it thats entertainment. Another reason is that this 'Salem's Lot' and 'Creepshow' are a few of the first horror films that I have ever seen. at the tender age of 10 years old. So I must admit Stephen King has been with me for quite a long time. If you have seen every King film or read every King novel then you are like one of the heroic characters portrayed within them. You have survived! Now with all the banter aside heres the facts. This movie is a perfect example of a complete ludicrous effort by an outstanding author being talked into directing a film. and rushed into it as well There are no words to explain how many plot holes are in this thing. The premise is A rogue comet passes over earth causing machines except cars??? to turn against mankind. A group of people are stranded in a truck stop by an army of trucks that circle the gas station continuously. The audience is bombarded with some of the most ridiculous sequences imaginable. Lawnmowers drive themselves electric knives move about by themselves a rear axle literally spins off of a truck!!!? people are strangled to death by Walkmans people are mowed down by giant tractor trailers without seeing them coming!!?? and so on and so forth. Not an ounce of logic or reasoning is attempted during the whole 98 minutes of this film.Now for the good stuff. King purposely designed this to be excessive and vulgar and that he did! Fans of senseless violence will approve and it seems like its all done for laughs. Emilio Estevez makes for a good hero type. Vulnerable when he should be a man of action when its needed. Unsavory and annoying characters get their just desserts. a mobile military firearm extinguishes half the cast in one scene! and the ACDC full soundtrack makes it worthwhile. This is definitely a favorite film among adolescents. A true juvenile delinquent's fantasy. So who cares how bad it really is. Besides Stephen King himself realizes it since this is the first and last film he will ever direct!! No apologies needed Steve You're still the man!".

	schema:headline " Depp for Emperor?";
	schema:reviewBody "I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still these are after all just children's movies. In another life I would never have seen them. And really one can't take such movies too seriously can one?And so this summer after the ritual badgering I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney adventure movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really how much can you expect?And then it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen Pirates four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask with a note of concern in their voices Dad you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot don't you?And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent coverboy for magazines published to hook thirteen yearold girls on makeup and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hairgoo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly so seductive so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heartthrob?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And in a time when many bigbudget movies are little more than a hodgepodge of loosely connected money shots this movie puts all the pieces together with a sense of fun and lightheartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out You'd best be believing in ghost stories Miss Turner you're in one! and the grinning skeletons come into view with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deckswabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirateghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking overproduced by credit on the coverliner. Bombastic. Overdone. Absurdly Stupendous.Well perhaps it is for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a workout on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again the children were wondering What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?Perhaps I am just losing my grip having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says Now bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties yo ho and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end and bid goodbye to the little monkey once more wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another entry in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness a true classic on the order of The Wizard of Oz. I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards but a place in the pantheon something we old fogies  and our gently fogeying children decades hence  will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.".

Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance IMO that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well mind you just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden but other than that the acting was good.Basically it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view.This movie made me laugh and it really pulled me in.At first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway as I've always loved the legends of pirates and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy that deserves an Oscar in my view.Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential and I loved the way how he manipulated people.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth and take her hostage while William teams up with a Rogue pirate Jack Sparrow who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book.".

The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better buying  I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them. The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original.

	schema:headline " Finally a real swashbuckling film to make me laugh";
	schema:reviewBody "Even I love Johnny Depp and I'm male a previous reviewer declares tongue in cheek. Well I wouldn't go quite that far but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event  after endless failures Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.With hindsight I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point  given a modern production environment  was to separate the roles of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costnertype juvenile lead as required who has to Come To Terms with his Past although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...  but you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue of course he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears but that's no hardship!The moonlight special effects were overdone in my opinion  not that they aren't believable but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic highly satisfactory not computerised and on occasion even carried out by the stars The other saving grace of the production is its humour  not that there aren't a few overarch knowing references but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene with total aplomb aboard a steadilysinking boat is a prime example as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...The basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated  she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well... However it is the pirates themselves who really make the film simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review we have been waiting 50 years for a modern pirate film featuring someone who in all seriousness actually says the words or perhaps the twosyllable single word 'Ahharrrrr!'Jack Sparrow as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue of course totally honest in his own way... ahem is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend  outrageous and unpredictable there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as the worst pirate I've ever seen as in the worst at it only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful.This character saves the hero in more ways than one  without him the film would be another Mask of Zorro a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modernday sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier swordfighting swashbuckling is not about fighting! It comes into it yes but it's not the point. But together the pair work off one another beautifully  reliability and inspired lunacy selfdoubt and cocky flamboyance dogged devotion and shameless selfinterest. The only question is which precisely is the sidekick...There are two beginnings to this film neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costumedramabynumbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move it could scarcely be less subtle is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape when he seizes the rope and swings up up and out in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.The film is far from perfect  characters like Captain Norrington please  'Commodore' like 'Prime Minister' is a job description not a form of address! and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in  it's okay I was rooting for you  most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film was it my imagination or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache? but alas any resemblance ends there.But then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp not Bloom who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination  and since I'm extremely impressionable also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say that..! ".

However it is the pirates themselves who really make the film simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review we have been waiting 50 years for a modern pirate film featuring someone who in all seriousness actually says the words or perhaps the twosyllable single word 'Ahharrrrr!'Jack Sparrow as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue of course totally honest in his own way... ahem is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend  outrageous and unpredictable there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as the worst pirate I've ever seen as in the worst at it only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful.This character saves the hero in more ways than one  without him the film would be another Mask of Zorro a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modernday sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier swordfighting swashbuckling is not about fighting! It comes into it yes but it's not the point. But together the pair work off one another beautifully  reliability and inspired lunacy selfdoubt and cocky flamboyance dogged devotion and shameless selfinterest. The only question is which precisely is the sidekick...There are two beginnings to this film neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costumedramabynumbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move it could scarcely be less subtle is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape when he seizes the rope and swings up up and out in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.The film is far from perfect  characters like Captain Norrington please  'Commodore' like 'Prime Minister' is a job description not a form of address! and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in  it's okay I was rooting for you  most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film was it my imagination or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache? but alas any resemblance ends there.But then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp not Bloom who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination  and since I'm extremely impressionable also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say that..! ";

I'm not a huge fan of Depp but here he excels. Knightly and Bloom make an engaging couple and I enjoyed the fact that the characters of Governor Swann and Norrington were taken in a different direction from that which might be expected by Hollywood. The former could have easily become the stereotypical You'll marry who I say you'll marry girl! while Norrington could have been the standard English navy bully and nasty piece of work. Instead both were engaging good guys and Norrington's graceful dealings with Will and Elizabeth brought a core of humanity to the movie.And to the previous reviewer who thought they'd spotted a plot holeSPOILERwhile theres a serious plot hole at the end where its revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ?Actually you just weren't watching the movie properly. Jack wasn't in a skeletal state all along. Shortly before the swordfight in the caves with Barbossa and being shown to be skeletal Jack stole one of the cursed coins from the chest. When he was stabbed by Barbossa he became skeletal because he was cursed from that moment on. This was made clear at the time when Jack's response to finding out he was suddenly skeletal was to declare That's interesting! flip the stolen coin between his fingers and tell Barbossa I couldn't resist. Indicating that he was aware that it was his stealing the coin that had turned him skeletal once he was stabbed.".

The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.The film may not be the most historically accurate pirate film of all times but all that is forgotten as you enjoy the brilliance of this marvelous movie. Did I also catch a subtle omage to the 1953 swashbuckler 'The Crimson Pirate' when Will and Jack walk underwater in an upturned rowing boat? Sneaky!The only negative thing I have to say and believe me I don't want to say it is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner Senior and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however Pirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws of parents children and grandparents alike. I'm definitely buying it when it come out on DVD!".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history Disney's first nonPG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninetyminute film.Other than Johnny Depp who fashioned his character's personality and eye makeup? after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones the cast of 'Pirates' reads like a Who's Who of English film actors including Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early '90s Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney empire. Universal Studios have been combining actionadventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades E.T. Jurassic Park Jaws and Back to the Future to name a few only in reverse orderfirst the film then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God  and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood you will enjoy 'Pirates'.That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft unconscious wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth Kiera Knightly now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates save Elizabeth and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight swordfight swordfight and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.A few predictions may be in order however. Look for an Oscar nomination for Depp's efforts. Look for nominations as well for sound set design makeup and cinematography. As far as best picture? Next to Lord of the Rings Return of the King? Not likely.Director Gore Verbinski who used to play in a punk rock band and is best known for creating the Budweiser frogs does an outstanding job keeping track of the myriad details required of a director given his limited experience. True 'Pirates' has countless errors in continuity but those occur in any film of such scope. Mr. Verbinski has only four other films to his name a short entitled The Ritual 1996 and then three very different but effectively made films Mouse Hunt 1997 The Mexican 2001 and the very creepy thriller The Ring 2002. Again it makes one wonder just who is at the helm of the USS Disney to put a 125 million movie in the hands of a neophyte. Well it worked with Lord of the Rings and a very inexperienced Peter Jackson and it worked here for Disney as well.'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a fun movie for most of the family. It may be rather scary for children ten and under and somewhat boring for many over twentyfive. I enjoyed it immensely for exactly what it was... an amusing ride.".

I had a knot in my stomach when I heard this I mean oh my god I hated being trapped in a boring routine everyday. Being a pirate meant adventures risks excitement. And that really attached me to the movie. Whenever I read books or watch TV shows or movies about high adventures or fantasy I almost cry because I'm not the main character it's not me who's having all the fun and reading these books or shows or movies might be the closest thing I will ever be to having the adventure of a lifetime.Watch this movie.

	schema:headline " Gentlemen ladies .... You will forever remember the day when you first saw the incomparable Captain Jack Sparrow!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film impressed me right after the first viewing in August 2003 after which the following followed and so quietly peacefully imperceptibly I probably approached the mark of ten views. In principle it's worth it this film can already be called a legend and it's a pleasure to watch such films.And now also compare with the sequel but in fact someone seriously believes that the sequel came out better than the first episode. I of course do not agree with this but I will not argue everyone has an opinion and there will be euphoria from viewing views of the Deadlock Chest and people will soberly look at the Curse of the Black Pearl and realize that the second part is not even nearby worth but it is also a product of the highest class.The first film is better maybe not all but in humor and the plot exactly and even such a banal sign as novelty in the second part we saw only a sequel a slightly different story with the same characters and in the first film it was all new  and moments are brilliant. When I speak genius with regard to this film then of course I have the look of Jack Sparrow in the incredible performance of Johnny Depp.This is one of his best roles from the very beginning he was performed in a genuinely brilliant way from the first appearance on the screen to the eighth when he sailed on a small boat flowing through all the cracks to excellent music  completely capturing the episode one of the best in all movie. And his first step to Port Royal an English colony in the Caribbean. And after it began ...The whole genius of Jack Sparrow's image can not be conveyed in words that's why we watch this film and review it time after time and expect the continuation. Especially the second part is the benefit of Jack and in the first and except for Jack there was a lot of interesting things.About humor plot music I already said. And also this is the Captain of the Black Pearl Barbossa some minor characters among the Barbosa pirates and among Jack's team. In addition you can add to the appearance of Jack in the city of Torturra a meeting with old friends and friends. Or repeated scenes when Barbossa and Sparrow are in one frame. All these and other episodes can only be admired for they do not bother and remain in the memory.The plot of the first part is much more interesting than the plot of continuation besides the ship full of skeletons under the moonlight where it surpasses the ship from the team in the form of sea monstersyudisch. Special effects are here and there at a level at a high level.Pirate films now go to the screens of the world a little and no one can surpass the Pirates of the Caribbean Sea here in fact there is even a romantic story between Elizabeth and William the only problem for them is that it moves back to the second or third plan  thanks to the excellent performance of pirates of their roles.Young Bloom and Knightley could not support the level of their older colleagues I would say that it's forgivable for them if they were not so important to the director and producers and in the eyes of ordinary fans of this film they are not visible they swam far beyond the horizon only unfortunately sometimes appear on the screen saying important phrases for me these characters are superfluous.About Bloom you can talk separately his goal is to play a simpleton spinning around the main character sometimes trying to throw out an incredible and very daring trick in the first part he still copes with the role of a simpleton but when he tries to play the guy everything fails he does not go and should run all career in a skirt of Paris. And in the second part of it they are already trying to make a serious man give a chance to steer at the head of the film but time to think because Jack can not block him and he does not want to be funny but could try maybe an idiot with the protagonist  his role ?The screen time for the KnightleyBloom duo is very little allocated I mean when they are together and for this it is necessary to say a special thanks to the creators of the film this does not allow to turn the film into a love story of two childhood friends but damn it from time to time they turn out to be in one frame and these frames can easily be called not the most interesting for the whole film in the sense of an acting game because these young actors do not show anything superordinary.Ditch the ocean shoot cannons even with forks rob ships and ports here is the destiny of pirates and after they also appear on the screen under the magnificent setting of Verbinsky  that's the real movie. The spark from the sensations is getting stronger the film practically does not allow him to tear himself away for two and a half hours of viewing except for the episodes of KnightleyBloom but this does not prevent the movie from watching when Jack Sparrow appears from the second to the second.The film really deserves only flattering reviews. The ending of the film although romantic but much better than in the second part when I did not see the ending it was simply not invented  it's the main and very big minus of the second part but now the conversation is not about it because the first part ended very much in rating  I do not mean the MPAA rating but the main thing is that it's a cobblestone in the sequel garden.This movie you will remember as the best one in which Captain Jack Sparrow was almost hanged.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of I saw the movie in the hoopla of all the hype when most people I knew were proclaiming this one of the summer's best films. Not unexpectedly I walked into this one with high expectations hoping for perhaps another Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even The Mummy. Walking out of the theater a very long twoandahalf hours later actually more like 2 hours 50 minutes given the previews and the final scene after the credits this movie has way too many double crosses and false climaxes I'm not even sure if this is better than The Mummy Returns.Based off an amusement park theme ride a lack of solid plot isn't a surprise. Orlando Bloom stars as Will Turner a dashing blacksmith who's in madly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann Keira Knightley a Natalie Portman lookalike except she's much prettier and appears to be a better actress. But when she's kidnapped by a group of ghostly pirates led by Geoffrey Rush Turner enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow Johnny Depp who appears a few cards short of a complete deck. Dark secrets are unearthed and it is revealed the undead pirates need to make a blood sacrifice to become human again.It's not that Pirates' premise doesn't hold any potential the movie does after all give us the prospect of an oceanbound adventure the kind of movies you don't see too often. But Indiana Jones on water this is not for it lacks all of that trilogy's infectious sense of fun and thrilling ventures into the unknown not to mention the smart dialogue and rousing John Williams' score. If not for Johnny Depp's performance and Keira Knightley's beauty and strong screen presence Pirates might very well have lulled me into sleep.The movie's biggest problem is its generic action sequences. Most of the swordfights are routine directed without much flair or energy and their bloodless presentation is just too juvenileoriented for me. In fact they all start to look the same after a while so a little variety would have been appreciated. The film's one semicreative fight between Turner and Sparrow is ineffective since you realize neither are in danger and the climactic battle pitting dozens of the undead pirates against the living doesn't work since the fighting is done by characters I didn't give a damn about.I like the actual concept of fighting undead pirates but most of the villains are so goofy especially the one keeps that fake eye it's hard to see them as an actual menace. And when they are played for laughs they're not very funny either how many times can we see an eye pop out before it stops being funny?. Also making them former mates of Sparrow's sort of demystifies them as if their goofy behavior didn't do so already.As a pure adventure Pirates is fraught with a lot of problems. It's repetitive the characters keep going back and forth between the same islands and boats sneaking in and out. The most successful adventures usually get the characters going from A to B to C rather than A to C then B and then back to C then B and then back to C and in this case even back to A!. I got sick of seeing that island cavern over and over in ten minutes.But Pirates is not without merit. Its singular savior is Johnny Depp whose introductory scene is so hilarious I was afraid I'd choke on my laughter. Sure some of his scenes don't work so well like when he tries to get those two guards to distract themselves but he's more often a blast to watch than not and most of the scenes he's in are pretty enjoyable. I also liked Keira Knightley almost easily the movie's best piece of eye candy when you compare her good looks with some of the goofy visual effects who displays genuine fire and feistiness even when she's mostly played as a damsel in distress. Both performers make the best of their parts elevating the material quite significantly if Depp and Knightley weren't present the movie would have gone from middling to bad in a heartbeat.Klaus Badelt's score sounds almost exactly like Hans Zimmer's work in The Rock given a period flavor. It's distracting I spent too much time wondering in what ways Badelt would ripoff scores from Jerry Bruckheimer films. But at least it gave me an excuse to pay attention to something inbetween th e scenes featuring Depp and Knightley.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching Pirates of the Caribbean last night I was very surprised to see that it had an IMDB rating of 8.0! Could THIS MOVIE really be one of the best 250 movies ever made?!? Then I looked at the voter breakdown noticed that females gave it an average rating of 8.7 and the 1041 females under 18 gave it a 9.5! Suddenly things started to make sense. A little sense.POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW Basically what we've got here is a pretty typical story. The rich governor's daughter loves the poor blacksmith boy and he with her but she's supposed to marry the military man. The blacksmith boy is amazingly handsome makes the most beautiful swords that you've ever seen and is an amazing sword fighter since he practices in his free time apparently against no one. The military man takes a role that's been popular in romantic comedies lately. He's not a horrible slimy jerk. He's just not the type of guy that women want to marry. He's stuffy always follows the rules and there's nothing the least bit entertaining about him. Of course she ends up with the blacksmith. Yawn.The story was incredibly predictable. The evil vile pirates don't seem that evil and vile perhaps because they were given too many comedic gags. Additionally their fighting scenes looked like some sort of a cheesy video game. They never really seemed as real or threatening as they should have.Bloom and the girl turn in average performances as does Geoffrey Rush. I was really disappointed with that as I expected him to really blow me away. Unfortunately he either wasn't feeling it or he didn't get adequate screentime.Johnny Depp was quite good. He really brought some fun to an otherwise drab movie. Had it not been for Depp's performance I don't think that this movie would have made half of the money that it did. If you DO watch Pirates of the Caribbean watch it for Depp.6.5 of 10 rounded down to hopefully drag this thing out of the top 250. ".

After the daughter of the governor of an island in the Caribbean is captured by mysterious pirates only two people are able to save the beloved Elizabeth Swann Keira Knightley. These two men are Will Turner Orlando Bloom and Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow Johnny Depp. Some how they are able to comender a British super vessel able to navigate it across the ocean. The movie just went way to long topping two hours and twenty minutes way to long for a Disney film. Jerry Bruckheimer adds tons of corny lines and supposed battle scenes between undead pirates and British Soldiers . Johnny Deep and Geoffery Rush do what they can with the roles they're given. Their are some beautiful filmed scenes of the ocean but their really isn't a story. I guess you could call this entertaining for a nine year old but for anyone else it's just a yawn fest.

Let me explain myself...Firstly Johnny Depp who everyone thinks has given some careerdefining performance simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes physical and verbal walking indifferently around the set... one is left halfasleep. I know the action comes later but this dull empty screentime is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film so far is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag thieving bunch that pirates were there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because according to 'the code' she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destinationquality craziness.Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great.".

Maybe I just don't like pirate films but I think there's more to it than that.This film has some major problemsit's way too long half an hour could have been cut out easily the story is needlessly convoluted and very badly done I'm blaming the screenwriters and director NOT the actors despite all the explosions and fights the action scenes are surprisingly dull there's loads of casual violence leading lady Knightley is constantly being hit in the face and the admittedly great special effects just didn't grab me.  There is a spectacular sword fight at the end with the men going in and out of moonlight and going from skeleton to man and back againbut it's too little too late.  The direction is WAY off toohe seems unsure of how to frame scenes and it makes things very confusing.I can't fault the actorsOrlando Bloom very handsome with beautiful black eyes is very good in a badly written role. Keira Knightly's role is even worseshe's just the girl in the movie and no one could be good in it. Geoffrey Rush is OK as the pirate chief.  Johnny Depp is the one reason to watch this movie.  His performance is so offbeat and funny he keeps the film afloat.  Just his mannerisms and facial expressions give an unexpected kick to lines.So...this handsome production sinks because of bad direction ridiculous length and many many boring stretches.

Orlando bloom is flat and monotonous and keira is just the eye candy. Plus the movie does'nt seem to end EVER!!!! It just goes on and on being smug and thinking it's funny. I guarantee people will look back on this film in a few years saying what the hell was i thinking? If you are over the age of 21 than there are good odds that you will not i repeat WILL NOT enjoy this film.When i heard of POTC i was expecting something witty adventurous surprising romantic exciting and full of great characters. Something along the lines of The Princess Bride but with a huge budget. But instead we got this twaddle. A film that did well in America but comparative poorly everywhere else. I've learnt my lesson now. I'm not going to watch a film if it is doing well in America and just okay everywhere else. Don't get me wrong i love America but sometimes i have to wonder at the intellect of it's youth! meet the fockers made 277m in America and only 113 in the rest of the world. Need i say more? Another thing i will do before i go and see a film is look it up on IMDb and see who the writers are and who the directors are. If you don't like their previous work you probably won't like their new film.What has happened to Hollywood. It seems to me that 1999 was the last great year of Hollywood with original ground breaking movies like The Matrix The Sixth Sense The Green Mile Toy Story 2 etc.But i guess now with dvds Hollywood producers know that if a movie sucks at the box office it will find an audience on DVD and eventually make it's money back. I guess thats why they'll give the go ahead with any movie idea these days. I just heard that they wanted to make POTC back in the 1990's but the script was rejected. 95 of the movies i've seen in the last five years i hate. I officially hate Hollywood!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Am I the only nonIndian teenage boy who actually enjoyed this film? If not that's fine with me. That's right I watched Roadside Romeo a wordplay on an Indian term for 'flirt' on DVD with English subtitles and liked it. It's probably the 2nd in a full lineup of movies about dogs from October 2008 to February 2009 Chihuahua Romeo Bolt Marley Hotel and Vomit. Sure it may be campy at some parts but hey this is India's first wellanimated film so I'll cut them some slack. This film is kinda like a CGI Bollywood version of Lady and the Tramp meets All Dogs Go To Heaven but there's nothing wrong with that. You'll need to watch some Bollywood films in order to understand the film itself. Myself I haven't even watched any ordinary Bollywood film but I've watched some clips and heard of Yash Raj's other hits so I understand.Ever since the giant Hindi studio Yash Raj Films included a clip from 'Cars' in 'Dhoom 2' and used the Disney Store and a song provided by Disney nonpop in Ta Ra Rum Pum Disney had decided to join forces with the studio to create Roadside Romeo. Before the film was developed Indian animation looked pretty cheesy. But Tata Elxsi a VFX studio responsible for doing VFX for plenty of Bollywood films and two of Marvel's films did a pretty impressive job on making it almost Pixar quality. I've heard in the commentary that someone from Pixar came over to visit the creators and teach them how to do furAnyway the film is about a spoiled cutelooking rich dog dude named Romeo Saif Ali Khan who gets abandoned on the streets of Mumbai where he gets bullied and then befriended by a pack of strays with unique personalities. Guru is the leader of the pack. His name speaks everything about him. Hero English is a dog with a funny hairstyle buckteeth and a bowtie who wishes to actually speak full English though a lot of the characters speak broken English and Hindi at the same time. His eyes and his buckteeth might make you think of Sid the Sloth from Ice Age. Interval is a big fan of YRF who copies many lines of the actors who have starred in their films. Mini is believe it or not a pretty aggressive alley cat just about the only one in the movie who thinks she is a stray dog and refuses to disbelieve it. Oh and there's also a mouse who is kind of the Jerry type when it comes to enemies.Together Romeo and the strays start a salon after Romeo shows his haircutting skills just so they can get some business. One night Romeo falls in love with a pretty female pooch named Laila Kareena Kapoor after hearing her sing and watching her dance. The next day Romeo meets a ferocious disgusting biglipped bulldog with a bit of an accent named Charlie Anna Jaaved Jaffery his sidekick Chhainu who gets beaten up all the time and looks like Wile E. Coyote's long lost father and his female ninja dogs Charlie's Angels. Which set of girls do the Angels parody? Well duh! Romeo and Charlie rival over Laila much to the dismay of Romeo's friends. Who will win? Everyone knows the answer...I've listened to one of the songs from the film everyday surprisingly. They're just so catchy! My most favourite song has to be Choo Le Na. The songs are better than the cheap pop songs Disney has to spew out today!  A few song sequences in this movie act like Indian music videos. You might see a character appearing in some random place while singing and dancing. The biggest example is in Cool Cool.The creators acted quite like Pixar when doing this movie. Not only did they do impressive animationmotion capture inspired by that of Ratatouille they also released teaser trailers without actual footage one year before the film was released. In the film itself they managed to slip in some injokes of the Pixar tradition including the name Tata some posters of other Yash Raj films photographs of YRF's actorsactresses and some Mickey Mouse references. Heck. they even added some bloopers in the credits! If only Pixar used them more often... Maybe on their DVDs.Though it ain't the best animated film of 2008 Roadside Romeo has plenty of charm and feel including some tension beautiful romantic moments especially  and clever humour. It does have grossout humour including flatulence but there's one bit of it that actually made me laugh. At Charlie is the most appropriate victim! My big problem with the film was  did Yash Raj care about the audience of theirs that loves Disney and is not familiar with Bollywood? Still there are some parts that kids would enjoy Hindu kids even such as the little mouse's moments and the Looney Tunes style gags. But not all of it is kiddy. Poor Romeo gets strangled several times for instance. Kids might not even be interested to tell you the truth. rolleyes And yes Indian cinema still has intermissions. I highly recommend this film if you're a freak for animation Bollywood dogs or anthropomorphic animals.".

Romeo falls for Laila Kareena Kapoor who also happens to be the crush of bad dog Charlie Anna Javed Jaffrey and predictable mayhem follows. Jugal Hansraj's direction relies too much on borrowing from Bollywood lore Yash Raj film scenes and dialogs are copied galore and too little on character study. It is an earnest effort perhaps but if anyone thought animation didn't need a story they should ask the studio that made the animation movie event of the year WallE. The film hardly has any genuinely funny moments and the background sets though well detailed lack punch. The redeemer is eventually Javed Jaffrey who is the only one who seems to know how to voice an animation character. He brings out the quirks of Charlie Anna superbly to life and provides the few laughs there are in the film. The tepid songs and a basic background score do nothing to add to the appeal. Ultimately the gag reel during the end credits turns out to be funnier than the movie itself. And that's saying a lot.".

The film has lovers a villain and great humor  the ultimate essentials for a Bollywood caper. But then being animated and convincing is what whisks this film away from clutches of the inane Bollywood film monster.Romeo Saif Ali Khan the quintessential lover dog is thrown onto the streets where he meets newly found best mutts.

Besides falling in love the biggest mistake Romeo commits is having rubbed Charlie Anna Javed Jaffrey the wrong way.

It's not perfect but nonetheless still great. Had the movie been made into a live Acton one perhaps it would not have worked. Even storywise the film is extremely light.

Javed Jaffery has given the best vocal performance of the comic villain Charlie Anna who is a bulldog. The animation was really great although it can't match with Pixar animation but still it's good for a Bollywood movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Roadside Romeo does indeed start in a very captivating way. I liked the idea and the film does start very strongly with quite a stirring opening scene. But overall it just didn't do it for me just too bland and hackneyed. Granted the animation is pretty good not outstanding but the backgrounds and sceneries were at least striking. Also Javed Jaffrey is a lot of fun here. However the writing is sadly awful on the whole while the story is too hackneyed and predictable. Then there is the music it was the same with the singing it got too much and became distracting. Jaffrey aside the remainder of the voice work is inconsistent ranging from soso to barely adequate. I'm sorry to say I didn't really feel anything for the characters they were dull mostly or annoying. The pacing started off great almost riveting but when the story meandered just before the halfway mark the pace dragged until the final result was as limp as a bad hair day. In conclusion started off promisingly but lost its momentum making it forgettable and altogether very unexceptional film. 410 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of the movie is very simple it kind of reminds me of The Lady and the Tramp parts one and two. It's not because Romeo came from a rich family but it was the gangs and the dog catcher. The music was pretty good just hearing it gives you the feeling that it's made for kids.There were two things that was a huge turn off for me in the movie one was the way they moved the characters and second was the script. There was something that bothered me with how they made the dogs move sometimes the arms would look weird and sometimes the facial expressions doesn't really match with the emotion their suppose to do. Like when Romeo's going to howl he looks like he's just opening his mouth and looking up. There are also moments when the characters are suppose to touch each other a pat on the head hug etc. they look like they have force fields surrounding them making it look like the characters are in an invisible ball. Some of the characters look nude for example Charlie Anna he reminds me of a naked Peter Griffin. And sometimes Romeo eye's would look infected.And the script! I think this is the biggest thing that ruined the film kids these days don't use the word dude anymore. In the movie Romeo uses a lot of slang's from the 80's I think it would be better if bollywood animators would lay off the cool factor e.g. shades motorcycles high shirt collar and the Elvis hair do.The thing that impressed me the most about the movie was the details the fur the lighting and everything in between. The way they made the characters unite with their background like the shadows on their fur and the shine in their eyes. The details on the fur makes me want to buy a Romeo stuffed toy he's so FLUFFY!!! They fur is the biggest thing that impresses me about the movie. Compared to Sully from Monsters Inc. I would rate Romeo somewhere above Sully in my Fluffometer. I also watched the special features of the DVD where they showed how they modeled Romeo from the inside out. I like the details of their teeth when they smile of talk they don't just show a tongue and the nose look so dog like the way they made the wetness of it shine from the light.... httpminiganesha.blogspot.com".

It really is not worth the effort to take time out drive to the cinemas and dedicate a part of your evening for Roadside Romeo  it will be too much of a disappointment.The bad  Animation might be a big step for audiences used to only Bollywood movies but it's not really much for international audiences even when compared to a decade older Pixar.  Too many songs!! What in the world was the director after we have no idea. Possibly nothing else to fill in the gaping holes of the narrative.  The painfully overused and redone masala story that now every Indian is born with the knowledge of.  Bad or mediocre voice work by most of the cast incl. Saif  Kareena.The good  Javed Jaffery. Actually he can do a lot better than he has done here but it still is very good. The guy is hilarious as the Madrasiaccented topdog Charlie Anna accompanied by three bitches he calls Yangels  Charlie's Yangels  and he names them.... Silk Sunitha Nylon Nandai  Polyester Padmini!!  Sanjay Mishra as Chhainu Charlie Anna's sidekick. This is a gifted comedian and possibly the strongest character in the movie. Even in his relatively smaller role he does such a great job with his Taporiishtyle quips.  Kiku Sharda as Hero English. Again a small character but with such great humor in him. He has a tendency to repeat everything he says in a literal wordbyword English translation. For example he announces Charlie Anna aa gaya!! Charlie Anna come go!! or the hilarious Wo tumko Jaan se maar dega! He will hit you with life!Apart from this there is one good idea of the dogworld in the movie that explains why dogs love to howl so much in the middle of the night it's a game they play!Allinall an easy one to forego. But equally easy to sit through if you have to wait for 93 minutes.My rating  2 of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess the number of dogs in Disney's repertoire isn't enough and this year they're looking to grow the kernel which houses the likes of the 101 Dalmations Goofy Pluto Lady and the Tramp with Bolt Beverly Hills Chihuahua and of course Roadside Romeo and his pooch friends hailing from India.Touted as the first Indian full length CGanimated film the end credits reveal just how much Disney's participation here likely amounted to being primarily consultants to what was mostly work done by Tata Exlsi Visual Computing Lab. And it's a pretty fine job those guys there are doing because if you were to strip away the Hindi language and end credit roll so as not to cue in on production details you're more than likely to think that this was made by Disney themselves. So it's absolutely not a bad effort at all for a first film.Animation aside this is as Bollywood a movie as it can get with distinct song and dance sequences rooted in Bollywood spirit. Storywise it's kept really simple with one main plot running and no sub plots trying to complicate matters. The characters too seem to leap out of a typical Bollywood film with over the top villains and their slimy incompetent henchmen err dogs coupled with the propensity to switch to English with constant plurality and grammatic errors in efforts to impress everyone.Saif Ali Khan voices the titular character of Romeo once a dog living the life of luxury before given the boot onto the streets when his owners take off to settle overseas. Left to fend for himself he relies on his street smarts suave ways quick wit and smooth talking to garner himself a posse of abandoned dogs and one cat putting into use his fashionable skills with the scissors to open a salon for the neighbourhood hounds.Adversary comes in the form of a Don Corleone Godfather type bulldog named Charlie Anna Javed Jaffrey who has three angels for protection and to fuel plenty of tired Charlie Angels jokes and references and to dish out torture running a protection racket which Romeo and gang run afoul of given their new enterprise and on a personal level the rivalry for the affections of Laila Kareena Kapoor which becomes the centerpiece in the second half of the film. The first half did seem a bit of a drag though especially with the expanded introduction of Charlie Anna and subsequent scenes just to demonstrate what he's capable of together with some repetitive threats of torture that definitely tested patience.Otherwise once the seeds of romantic rivalry has been sown with Laila being marked as Charlie Anna's romantic target it led to a number of hilarious playful crossexchanges between Charlie Romeo and his gang Guru Vrajesh Hirjee Interval Suresh Menon Hero English Kiku Sharda and cat Mini Tanaz Irani which the victim given its focus on these characters was Laila being reduced to an unfortunate supporting presence.For some strange reason Roadside Romeo needed some getting used to as the dogs prance around on two hind legs most of the time which brought back some memories of The Barnyard. But once you come to terms with it just like how the Barnyard's bulls all have udders it's quite an enjoyable and light piece of animation that should do well with its intended demographic though to an international audience some nuances because of one pooch's frequent impersonation of Bollywood legends might be woefully lost in translation.".

After getting to watch it all the way I think that it's decent for a Hindi animated film distributed by Disney even if I can't understand half of what they're saying.I understand that it's intended to be a comedy film but some of it was either confusing because of the Hindi dialogue or wasn't funny at all. The songs because it's also a musical and in contrast to the comedy are fantastic. The first and second songs on the soundtrack have been stuck in my head for a couple days now The soundtrack is simply that fantastic.I would want to recommend the film but somewhat terrible comedy predictable story and confusing dialogue makes such a decent film slightly not worth it to watch but the great soundtrack makes for a great time with Romeo and his friends.".

After getting to watch it all the way I think that it's decent for a Hindi animated film distributed by Disney even if I can't understand half of what they're saying.I understand that it's intended to be a comedy film but some of it was either confusing because of the Hindi dialogue or wasn't funny at all. The songs because it's also a musical and in contrast to the comedy are fantastic. The first and second songs on the soundtrack have been stuck in my head for a couple days now The soundtrack is simply that fantastic.I would want to recommend the film but somewhat terrible comedy predictable story and confusing dialogue makes such a decent film slightly not worth it to watch but the great soundtrack makes for a great time with Romeo and his friends.";

	schema:reviewBody "Roadside Romeo I loved the movie and Charlie Anna rocks in the movie. More so as he says in the movie easta westa Charlie Anna besta. Javed Jafrey being such a versatile actor completes himself by giving voice to animated character specially as a voice over artist. He was down right hilarious from his semiabusive baskets to giving the autograph. His style of calling Romeaoo Romeo Romeo has a gang of three plus one Guru voiced by Vrajesh Hirjee whose always ready to give advice like the Munna bhai style. Mini Tannaz Irani who is actually a cat and thinks and wants to be a dog. Interval Suresh Menon who has all the Yash Raj Films and other films lines enacted in their dialogues. Hero English who has the best lines where he is actually translates the Hindi lines into English like Bal bal Bache hair hair saved. Hilarious!! Sanjai Mishra as Chhainu's character who is the right hand man and the most beaten character in the movie.Of course there was Saif Ali khan playing Romeo and Kareena playing Laila. I was so excited to hear and see Javed Jaffrey doing his antics and mimicking Shatrugan Sinha or just being Charlie Anna or introducing the Angels that as Charlie's Angels that was so cool Romeo was overshadowed. Laila as Kareena Kapoor didn't have much to speak just look pretty even in the animation not much to talk about her other than her fluttering her eyes and specially looking at Romeo with dreamy eyes.Animation and the story of the movie actually reminded of The Lady and Tramp and All dogs go to heaven. Both the movies again are Walt Disney. Surely will try and watch these movies again. The best about this animation was that it was too the detail unlike the Hanuman and My friend Ganesha types from the Indian Animation companies it was as good as Finding Nemo Cars.Coming Back to Charlie Anna where he is being introduced and there is the dog licking his paw that clearly reminds you of Godfather plus you have DDLJ rip off scene in the movie. As an Indian you actually feel connected in the movie because you can see Maruti 800 Yellow Black Taxis torn old movie posters on the wall  in the movie most evident one being Dhoom and you have Yash Raj being mentioned in throughout the movie talk about Brand placement. Tata Motors logo being flashed with the municipality van dog catcher's  that's OK since Tata Elxsi was part creation team to create the movie.Even sat till the last credits that were flowing where they actually make the animated characters goof up that was pretty nice only thought Jackie Chan movies would that. The shooting of the voice over where all the actors were being highlighted making some or the other different noises also flowed with the credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film starts with a vain and spoiled male dog the title Romeo singing and dancing in a very sexist performance with bitches kissing him like he was a king. The horrible pop song lasts much longer than it should and when it's over we find out that it was a tale of said dog about how his life was before he was kicked out by his owners. After such a nasty presentation of the character it's absolutely impossible to sympathise with him. Instead of been kicked out he should've been put to sleep...The rest of the plot is just dumb. Romeo is attacked by a gang of stray dogs plus a cat and a rat which start fighting each other for no good reason instead of beating the hell out of Romeo. Romeo becomes an EddieScissorhandslike and trims the dogs for no reason making them his friends I wondered where he kept those scissors hidden. They decide to start a business of dog hair cut when Romeo discovers they have to pay with bones the currency for protection to a mobster. Romeo refuses to pay fights the mob member and... nothing really happens clearly the kingpin is not a Corleone. Romeo meets a bitch on a roof top yes those dogs climb up house roofs like cats and sing horrible pop songs harasses her and is obviously ditched. More nonsense follows until an animal control team shows up and tries to arrest all the strays. For no clear reason Romeo decides to save the kingpin from being captured what eventually leads him to become the rooftopsinging bitch's dogfriend. The end more or less keep reading.The plot makes little sense with lots happening for weak or no reason and worse going to absurd andor stupid directions. It is about an hour and a half long with about half of that filled with horrible musical performances awful pop songs with ridiculous choreography.And when you think the musical acts are the worst part of the film you just find out that it's also a comedy! The visual jokes are all kitschy forced and embarrassing like when the kingpin screams to Romeo the camera zooms out to show the planet Earth and everything is distorted by the boom wave of his voice yeah sound waves in space... pure comedy...Technically the film is also a disaster. The animation is awkward like in the ReBoot computer animated television series but that was in 1994 one year before Toy Story. To simplify the animation I guess there is a lot of closeups of the characters so there is a lot less to animate and render. Actually the fourth wall is put down a lot with Romeo talking to the camera annoyingly. Movements disregard gravity mass momentum like the Velociraptors of the first Jurassic Park they also didn't know the meaning of mass or gravity and friction so it's not seldom to see characters sliding on the landscape. And when it reaches The End and you think nothing else could make it worse the credits roll and you are presented with deleted footage like in the credits of a Jackie Chan film except that they manage to be even less funny than the original scenes! They are like bad jokes that someone that didn't get them makes worse by trying to explain them with more unfunny jokes...It's absolutely unbelievable that this is a Disney production. I mean after rising from the dead by the end of the 20th century Disney became one of the biggest producers of cinematographic content of the beginning of the 21st century eventually engulfing Pixar and acquiring the Star Wars franchise. When I saw the 3D CGI castle and heard Disney's theme song I thought it was some kind of joke I really expected some character would jump up screaming gotcha! but no one did it is indeed a Disney production! This film is as embarrassing as those antiNazi propaganda films Disney produced during WWII except this one has no war to blame for its failure. I simply cannot understand how this has an IMDb score above 5 as it is as bad or maybe even worse as other computer animated disaster like Plumiferos 2010.".

	schema:headline " Exceed to Excess";
	schema:reviewBody "Every great gangster movie has undercurrents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt retribution and despair from Scarface. This is a tale of ferocious greed corruption and power. The darker side of the fabled American Dream.Anybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and wellhandled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time. The themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent seesawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many standout lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.The cast help make it what it is as well but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally overthetop form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.Powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial. Scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you. An essential and accessible gangster flick and a popculture landmark. 910".

	schema:headline " You wanna play rough?? OKAY!";
	schema:reviewBody "Scarface has a major cult following even now 22 years after its release.It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined overthetop and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc. Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather'.But it is also true that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake! Al Pacino has been criticized to be overthetop and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the filmmakers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana a very tacky uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time!There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs including 'Gina and Elvira's theme' 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental.There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the Rebenga hit the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother's.About the performances Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what Scarface would be like without Pacino. I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities the film wouldn't be as effective without him!Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny.Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham as Omar in a small role.Then there is some eyecandy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.Scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!".

	onyx:emotionText "Scarface has a major cult following even now 22 years after its release.It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined overthetop and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc. Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather'.But it is also true that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake! Al Pacino has been criticized to be overthetop and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the filmmakers wanted Tony Montana's character to be!

	schema:reviewBody "A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read. Mark Twain'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe Scarface Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics and rappers for that matter deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.First off the film is about a Cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius and the great story written by Oliver Stone yes I know he actually wrote a real good one here play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage it's violence it's dialog totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans.Next on the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point. It's not like Aliens an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. This being said the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score in true Giorgio Moroder style which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino  enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in Grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and Shenar portrays him as so and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. This reviewer learned one main thing when watching Scarface for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma like I do can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real Scarface.".

When I looked at this film on VHS when I was 20 I thought it was ultaviolent and gritty as well. But I didn't get 'it'.A few decades go by and man how I know how much I didn't get in this film!! This is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30's40's. How can you improve upon a classic? Ya don't. But you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the new immigrants during the most greed ridden decade the over indulgent 80's. DePalma Stone and the gang present an ambitious disturbing and darn right good film.Yes....Disco was dying and New WavePunk were taking over but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn't tell the difference. It was exciting it was what they wanted but how to get it???? To these immigrants there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were..by having lots of money and to get the money you had to take over running a drug empire.Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana the little train that could. What an amazing way to have your lead character look at America to fight kill steal. lie cheat all to get  the money the women and the power.That's what Tony saw as the American dream.He wanted it he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the f word but what did you expect Emily Post's finishing school for him and his cohorts? Look at how they CAME to America what they knew what they were exposed to. This is the way Tony and his crew chose to be all they can be in America. It was all about the power. Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it..it all its violent lying stealing crooked thieving glory.The part of the film that personified the 1980's to me is the money laundering. Tony's crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank. Did those around Tony and his crew care? At the clubs where he spent and drank? Nope. Money was money and with money you get the power. Tony was living high off the hog. He and his pretty blond American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer.After Tony Montana's rise to power he finds out its really crappy up there. He's riddled with doubt he's drug addicted he's paranoid he's surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody takeover his trophy 80's American blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore he needs to keep atop of his empire because...he's going down. And down he goes in a horrific violent fashion but again I ask what do you expect?This is the quintessential 1980's film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the American Dream...to obsession. It's violent bloody overly so..but it drives the point disturbingly home. Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in Florida in the 80's were anything like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the showing of how miserable the 1980's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the USA to be somebody and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in America.Makes you wonder  has anything from then  been learned today?".

	schema:headline " A Potpourri of Vestiges Review Pacino gives a heartwrenching performance as the modernday Macbeth";
	schema:reviewBody "Brian De Palma's Scarface depicts cinema at its most macabre and not for a second does Stone's cutthroat screenplay go awry in its unforgiving attempt to limn the naked reality associated with drug mafia and the kingpins who govern it. Brian De Palma's unquenchable thirst to mimic the gore reality on the celluloid didn't go well with the MPAA which rated even the highly censored third cut of the movie as 'X'. Brian De Palma and the producer Martin Bergman arranged a hearing with the MPAA and roped in a panel of experts including some narcotics officers who testified the movie's verisimilitude to the conditions prevalent in the drug underworld. Their testimonies greatly convinced the members of the rating board who eventually condescended to give an 'R' rating to the aforesaid third cut of the movie. Brian De Palma used the pervasive kerfuffle as a subterfuge to release the unedited original version of the movie instead of the curtailed one and kept this fact surreptitious for months until the movie was released on videocassettes. A remake of a 1932 classic of the same name Scarface portrays the life of a young tempestuous Cuban migr named Tony Montana highlighting his sanguinary journey from being a thug to becoming a kingpin of drug mafia. Montana's story is one of rise and fall trust and deceit love and hatred greed and lust but most importantly life and death. He is a hapless victim of the vicissitudes of his time a product of his tainted conscience and naked ambition. As the modernday Macbeth Montana is the quintessential antihero of American cinema he adores his friends and folks and is unforgiving to his foes. Brian De Palma took yet another calculated risk by choosing Al Pacino who was then going through a lean patch in his career to play Montana's part. Pacino took few months off to prepare himself for the role and to perfect his Cuban accent. Chagrin driven Pacino uses all his talent and guile to give Montana an ineffable charm and an element of frenzy which not only brings Montana to life but also makes the portrayal singularly remarkable. Pacino's breathtaking performance which is arguably his best manages to hold the viewer in a transfixion right from the inception to the finale. In fact it's clear from the very first scene itself the first scene in which Pacino is interrogated by the police for being a Cuban emigrant that Pacino is on an inexorable mission to outperform not only his contemporaries but also himself. He punctiliously takes care of the nuances and the subtleties in mannerisms needed for an exorbitant portrayal such as Montana's. As Tony Montana Pacino not only substantiates his acting prowess and answers his critics once and for all but also establishes Montana as a cult figure in American cinema. The entire cast has given a thorough performance with a special mention of Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer.

	onyx:emotionText "Brian De Palma's Scarface depicts cinema at its most macabre and not for a second does Stone's cutthroat screenplay go awry in its unforgiving attempt to limn the naked reality associated with drug mafia and the kingpins who govern it. Brian De Palma's unquenchable thirst to mimic the gore reality on the celluloid didn't go well with the MPAA which rated even the highly censored third cut of the movie as 'X'. Brian De Palma and the producer Martin Bergman arranged a hearing with the MPAA and roped in a panel of experts including some narcotics officers who testified the movie's verisimilitude to the conditions prevalent in the drug underworld. Their testimonies greatly convinced the members of the rating board who eventually condescended to give an 'R' rating to the aforesaid third cut of the movie. Brian De Palma used the pervasive kerfuffle as a subterfuge to release the unedited original version of the movie instead of the curtailed one and kept this fact surreptitious for months until the movie was released on videocassettes. A remake of a 1932 classic of the same name Scarface portrays the life of a young tempestuous Cuban migr named Tony Montana highlighting his sanguinary journey from being a thug to becoming a kingpin of drug mafia. Montana's story is one of rise and fall trust and deceit love and hatred greed and lust but most importantly life and death. He is a hapless victim of the vicissitudes of his time a product of his tainted conscience and naked ambition. As the modernday Macbeth Montana is the quintessential antihero of American cinema he adores his friends and folks and is unforgiving to his foes. Brian De Palma took yet another calculated risk by choosing Al Pacino who was then going through a lean patch in his career to play Montana's part. Pacino took few months off to prepare himself for the role and to perfect his Cuban accent. Chagrin driven Pacino uses all his talent and guile to give Montana an ineffable charm and an element of frenzy which not only brings Montana to life but also makes the portrayal singularly remarkable. Pacino's breathtaking performance which is arguably his best manages to hold the viewer in a transfixion right from the inception to the finale. In fact it's clear from the very first scene itself the first scene in which Pacino is interrogated by the police for being a Cuban emigrant that Pacino is on an inexorable mission to outperform not only his contemporaries but also himself. He punctiliously takes care of the nuances and the subtleties in mannerisms needed for an exorbitant portrayal such as Montana's. As Tony Montana Pacino not only substantiates his acting prowess and answers his critics once and for all but also establishes Montana as a cult figure in American cinema. The entire cast has given a thorough performance with a special mention of Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer. Pfeiffer is absolutely ravishing in her intense portrayal of the quintessential ubersexy mobster's moll. The chemistry between Pfeiffer and Pacino is scintillating and at times aweinspiring.The movie is a highlight reel of some of the most graphic and grotesque sequences ever caricatured in cinema. The scene in which Tony Montana asseverates his innocence and loyalty to the drug kingpin Frank Lopez elevates cinema to a new zenith while the Macbeth like climax gives the movie an operatic feel that is seldom associated with cinema.Scarface marked the upsurge of a new force in cinema the triumvirate of De Palma Stone and Pacino.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1983 Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was Scarface' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.  The story begins in May of 1980 when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel Cuba to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.  125000 left Cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in America and most were honest hardworking people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted.  But not all.  Among the Marielitos' who streamed into Florida approximately 25000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails criminals considered beyond redemption who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of.  And they too saw America as a land of opportunity even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier.  And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana Pacino known to his associates as Caracortada.' Scarface.Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida he was determined to have it all.  Wealth and power that was Montana's dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez Robert Loggia.  Lopez it seems had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro's goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to Castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in Little Havana' along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives.  And in short order Montana sees to it that Lopez's brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.Lopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend Manny Steven Bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work.  In his day Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but Lopez has the modern day equivalent and it's even more lucrative Cocaine.  Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it Montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be  At the top.'  With a coldblooded iron will Montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost.  but before it's over he will realize the price for his dream and he'll pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what it's like to be The Man.  And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.In step with De Palma's vision Pacino plays Montana largerthanlife and he does it beautifully.  From the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude he's got it all and it makes Montana convincing and very real.  What he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors De Niro would be one can.  This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but Pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him.  It's quite simply a dynamic memorable performance.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom.  As Elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream Pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance.  She like Pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanor.The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Gina Miriam Colon Mama Montana F. Murray Abraham Omar Paul Shenar Sosa and Harris Yulin Bernstein.  An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed Traffic' and Blow' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch' De Palma's Scarface' originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga.  Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing.  But if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end.  And like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time.  But the reward is always worth it and that's the way it is with this film.  I rate this one 810.".

He plays Tony Montana A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world his balls and his word and he doesn't break'em for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer Frank Lopez Robert Loggia and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny Steven Bauer. Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira Michelle Pfeiffer. After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's Brightest points in his long ups and downs career you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes The one at the fancy restaurant Say goodnight to the bad guy. the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it's a mustsee. For the rest of you it's highly recommended. 1010".

	schema:headline " Loved But For The Wrong Reasons";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people like this movie and many more love it but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons. Scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is.Many people say the acting was overthetop but who better to do an overthetop character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino went overthetop in here would be an understatement. Yet he does it so well he just brings the inner devil out of you so well. His character Tony Montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level an inhumane level. Sure at times Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all. The supporting cast served its job very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played. On the other hand Steven Bauer was at his best still he is Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and like Michelle Pfeiffer fit her role very well. Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell. Other than Pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances. Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there. They did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough.Brian De Palma did a very good job directing this movie. Whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and I will certainly give De Palma that. Brian De Palma though not given the respect is a very versatile director by my count. He knows how to direct movies according to their genres but that at times has not turned out well. In here it does this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of De Palma.The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was not the least bit surprised. That is a testament to him though. I have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with Scarface. Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone.The music was good but not that great. It is certainly not my favorite from Giorgio Moroder. The music was a little bit too 80sish for me but it didn't annoy me. The cinematography was good not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this.This has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons. People should realize that the character of Tony Montana is no hero he is a monster. He is not inspiring in anyway. He is greedy bloodthirsty uneducated and self consumed. Yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster. A vigilante would be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface.The good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the Tony Montanas' are not the real problem. If we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't. In a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society. He is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it. The Tony Montanas' of this world are the scapegoats of our society. This in no way excuses people like him. Instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer. I love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect.".

Well perhaps enjoying is a bit of an odd verb when you think of the storyline its characters the amount of violence and of course the fbomb being dropped about 15000 times. I like Pacino in this film. He shows us the violent anger we didn't see in Michael Corleone. We're Michael would say Never hate your enemies it clouds your judgement Tony Montana's out killing everybody. Now granted there are moments in his performance...or in the script where you have to laugh. The questioning scene in the beginning of the film is a fine example of this. When asked where he got that scar on his cheek...well I can't write what he says in the regular version but I will tell you that on edited version on TNT it from was eating pine apple. There is a great performance from Robert Loggia. He's the only character I truly believed in the film. Frank was a businessman not a killer. All he wanted was the money. Greed killed him as it has killed so many people. I enjoyed the direction Loggia went with Frank. It has carried over his recent work and has made Loggia one of Hollywood's must durable supporting actors. Brian DePalma adds his usual blend of violence but it seemed that for once he was trying to make his own film. Not borrowed. No guessing games on who he stole from this time. Although he's blasted for the film's content it is a new beginning to his career which took off but it was really The Untouchables that made me consider him a serious director.".

And this is just exactly what Pacino does best come down on a part like a sledgehammer  not acting so much as pounding. I find both of these guys boorish. But watch what dePalma does with them.Pacino's excess maps directly to Montana's excess  both acting out the same role. dePalma keeps his distance from Pacino holding the camera outside his space never sharing his perspective. This is the first time that his camera's swoops and pans start to emote to add substance to the narrative to actually paint. This is where he gets his legs leading up to what I think is a high point in cinematic painting Snake Eyes.' No one can do better without stealing from him.Excess  so it matters that the substance of the film are the three American excesses the Latin manner of selfsatisfaction the gangster ethic of gimme and the church of drugs all of which underlie the peculiar religion of the US. Stone does a good job with the tension among these three. Latin sex versus unsexing coke American opportunity versus the destruction of success violence versus humor well before Tarantino. dePalma uses each excess in his style sometimes with great effect. The sets are so theatrical they approach fantasy the moves of the camera are greater when the architecture has grand features. The moves are duller when Montana is. The cutting jumps when he does as in the first interrogation and when he argues with his mother over the sister.The best sequence cinematically to my mind is the attack in the Babylon with the pans and mirrors but there are other fine visual treats here. Credit the director. Most films are about other films  this one is largely original sofar as the visuals and is the root of many that followed including some of dePalma's own.Pfeiffer should be great but she's merely pretty. Her thinness of presence is just right for the trophy girl who wasn't there and she only gets by because the character is perpetually stoned. Wonder if she ever suspected she was being used that way? Mastrantonio has much more fire  central to making the final sequence nearly work. But I guess it is hard to build a career on that. She pretty much faded after Scorsese's Color of Money' used that fire the best.".

Later on  Tony reunites with his mother and sister Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.This exciting film packs thrills  chills  noisy action violence and results to be pretty entertaining  in spite of its long runtime  as it runs nearly three hours . It's one of the most violent  gruesome  thrilling intriguing gangster move ever made . Al Pacino  in the title role  is firsrate as the Cuban gangster and receives magnificent support from Steven Bauer  Robert Loggia Mark Margolis  Harris Yulin and early deceased Paul Shenar gives a bravura performance as a Colombian kingpin . Interesting screenplay by Oliver Stone who wrote this film while fighting a cocaine addiction . The original idea was to make this film a remake of Scarface which took place in Chicago but this proved to be impossible due to budget constraints. There was a huge controversy in the city of Miami during the making of the film over whether the producers should be allowed to shoot in the city. The Miami Tourist Board decided not to allow filming as they were afraid the movie would discourage tourism to Miami particularly as it showed Miami's latest Cuban immigrants as gangsters and drug dealers. A majority of the film was shot in Los Angeles California standing in for Miami Florida. This was done because production would have been endangered by protest from angry CubanAmericans over the film's reported subject matter. Streets and buildings used for shooting were redressed by the art directors to have the 'feel' of Miami. The movie displays a colorful cinematography by excellent and veteran cameraman John A Alonzo . Furthermore  it has a commercial musical score composed by synthesizer by usual of the 8os  Giorgo Moroder. The motion picture was very well directed by Brian De Palma who liked the script so much that he dropped out of directing Flashdance to direct this film. Ranked 10 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre Gangster. Scarface the version starring Paul Muni was ranked 6 in June 2008".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people criticize Brian De Palma's 1983 cult classic Scarface for being a very campy and unrealistic version of The Godfather and similar crimegangster films. I am going to be completely honest and say those who say that are clearly missing the point.Scarface is a great film and one I revisit often because if you take away the reputation it's received since it was releasedwith rappers and just the related it truly is a well made movie with some of the best acting in the genre. But I do believe it is necessary to address the aforementioned most common criticism. First of all the violence in the filmand indeed the three main shootouts are some of the finest in the decade is not completely over the top and unreal as some believe because though it is exaggerated slightly you got to remember gangsters kill people. And people who try to get them are killed often. The movie is gratuitously violent because the characters and their personalities are gratuitously violent. What do you want them to do pretend this doesn't happen? This is a movie like The Godfather that is honest about who and what it is discussing. But while The Godfather was about a family and how a family in the wrong business can affect the sensibilities and lives of both the family members and the people who are victims of their bloody business Scarface is about what happens to a person when nothing matters to them anymore except immediate satisfaction of their deepest and often darkest desires. Al Pacino's performance in the film is over the top yes but the character he is portraying can be nothing but over the top because he has no substance in him to be subtle or even fairly human for that matter and because of that the film contains a classic Pacino performance.The film also hints that perhaps Tony Montana himself isn't totally happy or engaged in what he is doing. The famous scene when he inhales the cocaine face first in the prelude to the finale shows in a strange way just how he realizes he ruined his life up to that point. There is nothing left for him at that point. There are scenes when elements of humanity come through though but it's coming through a man who is a complete and utter louse at this point and so everything is more extreme than a normal person would have dealt with it.For example his attempts to protect his sister from losing her virginity by beating any man who makes the attempt shows how he wants her to be with a good person and be happy but coming through the disgruntled mind of Tony Montana he deals with it in the only way he knows how through violence.He also still has certain reservations about himself. He won't kill children for example when a certain kind of mission is presented to him in the film and he attempts to heal the wounds of his mother after all these years of him being a gangster even if in the way he does comes across as crass and perhaps desperateeven though the visage he adopts is of carelessness. But again that's the only way he knows how to act at this point. You see Pacino's performance is so good that even though a fair amount of this is only hinted atthough some of it is pretty direct I think you can see it in his face and hear it in his voice which is so extravagant it's almost as if he's trying to prove something.The other characters in the film are all there to support Montana but they are all quite memorable. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Gina Montana is chilling in the role of a normal young woman being abused mentally by her over protective brother and starts to lose it herself later on. Steven Bauer who plays Manny isn't a particularly well developed character but that's because he exists more to help develop the other characters and in that regard Bauer does a fine job. And of course who could forget the beautiful and talented Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira who in her own way is just as flawed and miserable as Montana but rather then exploding into drug dealing and violence she implodes in a sense to where nothing she says is exactly what she thinks and almost seems to feel there's no point to her existence. But it's not only the actors that are important to Scarface. Brian De Palma's fantastic directing showcases each character in memorable fashion and all the faster paced sections are handled well too. And of course Oliver Stone's 4 letter word laden script is vulgar and foul but memorable and effective providing many classic lines but I do also want to point out the great soundtrack put together and composedpartially by Giorgio Moroder. Sure it's full on 80's synthesized new wave esquire music but it fits the mood surprisingly well and is fun to listen to with the movie. And the haunting melody at the very end of the movie sums it all up perfectly.I have probably gone on too long but I wanted to wash away any misconceptions people who perhaps are not sure they want to see the movie either because of it's obnoxious pop culture references and relations or because of common criticisms. I won't say it's the best in the genrein fact there are many that are better and a tad more focused on story but certainly manages to blend entertainmentbecause the story itself is intriguing and the film is just fun to watch and message together effectively without over doing either. If you like your mafia movie dark gritty realistic honest and meaningful then you could do a lot worse than choose Scarface. Check it out.".

	schema:headline " Tony The BlowMan";
	schema:reviewBody "Scarface is a useful movie to have around. If you walk into someone's house for the first time and he quotes Scarface twice in the first 15 minutes you know it's time to leave.After escaping his native Cuba during 1980's Mariel boatlift former jailbird Tony Montana Al Pacino gets a second life in the land of opportunity which he takes full advantage of as one of Miami's leading cocaine cowboys. Tony wants it all including his boss's wife his sister's devotion and a mountain of blow to call his own but once he gets it he starts on a downhill trajectory with fatal consequences.The fact so many people like Scarface is testament to the intensity of Pacino's performance more than the intelligence behind it. In the DVD documentary Pacino readily admits to the character being twodimensional. For some that's great. He's not too complicated that way. But for me Tony Montana is worth maybe 20 minutes in a movie about someone else. He blows too hot.Pacino isn't great here. He has some good scenes like at the beginning when he's being questioned by some cops but mostly he just yells a lot. The supporting performances are uniformly weak including F. Murray Abraham who gave one of the great screen performances in the following year's Amadeus. Michelle Pfeiffer does the best work for 10 minutes but then the script seems to lose interest in her character and she ends up throwing out some random histrionics before exiting stage left.The storyline is simplistic and uninvolving. The score is one of the lamest especially during the opening sequence showing news footage from the Mariel boatlift. The motivations of everyone from Tony's early benefactor Frank Lopez to Hector the Colombian are at best opaque and at worst cry plot convenience. There's a silly bit of business involving Tony's sister and mother which is dragged out too long. And with Pacino's central character so unlikable this is all too much to deal with.Is it director Brian De Palma? De Palma makes interesting movies just not always good ones. He made some very good movies around the early '80s and Scarface would seem like a prime candidate to be another. But it's like when he has a great actor to work with like Pacino or Sean Penn in Casualties Of War he loses the ability to rein them in and just lets them bolt through the fences. At the same time De Palma often gets great performances from lessheralded actors like John Travolta in Blow Out Craig Wasson in Body Double and Michael J. Fox in Casualties Of War. He's not untalented just maddening inconsistent.The film does have passion and some momentum and excitement that carries into the final crescendo. There's a terrific sequence involving Montana and an assassination target that generates some real concern with the audience because you are actually meant to care a little about the people involved and Tony for once is not acting according to type.But mostly Scarface is an '80s TV movie with marathon swearing and bloodletting and a performance from Pacino that hopefully got it out of his system for a while. It's cathartic maybe but so's running someone off the road after they cut you off. Not exactly reasonable therapy.".

	onyx:emotionText "Scarface is a useful movie to have around. If you walk into someone's house for the first time and he quotes Scarface twice in the first 15 minutes you know it's time to leave.After escaping his native Cuba during 1980's Mariel boatlift former jailbird Tony Montana Al Pacino gets a second life in the land of opportunity which he takes full advantage of as one of Miami's leading cocaine cowboys. Tony wants it all including his boss's wife his sister's devotion and a mountain of blow to call his own but once he gets it he starts on a downhill trajectory with fatal consequences.The fact so many people like Scarface is testament to the intensity of Pacino's performance more than the intelligence behind it. In the DVD documentary Pacino readily admits to the character being twodimensional. For some that's great. He's not too complicated that way. But for me Tony Montana is worth maybe 20 minutes in a movie about someone else. He blows too hot.Pacino isn't great here. He has some good scenes like at the beginning when he's being questioned by some cops but mostly he just yells a lot. The supporting performances are uniformly weak including F. Murray Abraham who gave one of the great screen performances in the following year's Amadeus. Michelle Pfeiffer does the best work for 10 minutes but then the script seems to lose interest in her character and she ends up throwing out some random histrionics before exiting stage left.The storyline is simplistic and uninvolving. The score is one of the lamest especially during the opening sequence showing news footage from the Mariel boatlift. The motivations of everyone from Tony's early benefactor Frank Lopez to Hector the Colombian are at best opaque and at worst cry plot convenience. There's a silly bit of business involving Tony's sister and mother which is dragged out too long. And with Pacino's central character so unlikable this is all too much to deal with.Is it director Brian De Palma? De Palma makes interesting movies just not always good ones. He made some very good movies around the early '80s and Scarface would seem like a prime candidate to be another. But it's like when he has a great actor to work with like Pacino or Sean Penn in Casualties Of War he loses the ability to rein them in and just lets them bolt through the fences.

Michelle Pfiefer is horrible in this movie probably her worst performance ever. As for most of the other actors who did not make it big it is very much because they're not good actors. Al Pacino's brother in the movie seems totally scripted.Anyway as for the plot it is boring and overused. Man gets rich and the people he stepped on to get there come after him. It's boring and predictable because of this. If I were doing this movie I would cut so much. We don't need the restaurant scenes which do not advance the movie. We do not need a scene with Al pacino in a hot tub having the same argument he had around 5 other times in the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone Brian DePalma Al Pacino and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of filmmaking of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood.What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly the acting is terrible.Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.So I am going to ask Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. Whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap.".

It still would be difficult to sit through because the performances are so bad this has to be Pacino's worst ever but at least it would not waste as much of your time.

You just get vivid desperate to be iconic scene followed by trite small talk then next big scene so it's bang bang drivel bang bang drivel bang bang with no meaningful narrative linking them.

The result is a deliberate assault on the sensibilities by using the fword again and again as well as using extreme and pointless violence throughout. It's easy to say f and the like and it's easy to have millions spent for special effects explosions and gunfire but these alone do not constitute a good film as the writing was almost absent in the film and it was just a giant overthetop parody of gangster films. It's as if DePalma's mantra for the film is when in doubt have Pacino say the fword or have him kill some people. Also while some have praised Al Pacino's performance to me it seemed like ridiculous selfparodylike a dirty version of the guy he played in DICK TRACywhich at least was SUPPOSED to be a cartoon. None of his brilliance from THE GODFATHER is present as he plays a buffoon. There is absolutely no subtlety no finesse and nothing of value in the film.

As he suffers from insomnia he spends his time working as a taxi driver at night watching porn movies at seedy cinemas during the day or thinking about how the world New York in particular has deteriorated into a cesspool. He's a loner who has strong opinions about what is right and wrong with mankind. For him the one bright spot in New York humanity is Betsy a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine. He becomes obsessed with her. After an incident with her he believes he has to do whatever he needs to make the world a better place in his opinion.

	schema:reviewBody "A towering classic of American cinematic power.  Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.He is alone with his thoughts and his thoughts are dark ones.  The film fools you on a first viewing.  Is Travis an endearing eccentric?  Sure he's odd but he's so polite and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing.  But on a second view you see it for what it is.  The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giulianifacelift.  This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  To be sure it takes the stimulus to provoke the response but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially.  Shepard's character Betsy is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society but she is still impeccably portrayed.  With only two scenes that don't center on Travis it is unavoidably De Niro's show.  The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character Tom?  Nothing at all.  He makes almost no impact on Travis's life which is where the plot lives.  But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.As a piece of American cinema history this film will live forever.  But far more important than that this film will survive as a universal everrelevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind.  The story doesn't end when the credits roll.  We know Travis will snap again.  But the story doesn't end with Travis either.  It continues today in the cities and in the schools.  The film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind.This film didn't cause the incidents in Colombine or Hawaii or Seattle or wherever you care to look even with all of its disturbing images of violence.  It didn't cause those things.  It predicted them.".

	schema:reviewBody "The script of Taxi Driver is built like a diary the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam because he can't sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation but can't while violence accumulates inside him. One of those unnoticed people with dark things on their mind one of those who break up the news one day with some extraordinary outburst of rage to fall back immediately into anonymity.The gradual transformation of man into beast in this movie is chilling. It's still funny and pathetic when the hero threatens himself in front of the mirror you're talking to me? but when he comes out with a mohawk hairdo and dark glasses it is obvious that nasty stuff is going to take place. As in A Clockwork Orange violence is recuperated by society depending on what purpose it is used for. Whereas he was about to murder the candidate for presidency god's lonely man fails and instead kills a vicious pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. The potential criminal becomes a hero for a day.Such stories happen everywhere of course but it seems that the bewildering atmosphere of New York City's summer night was the best choice. Taxi Driver gives us a very realistic approach of New York in a way that is not seen on screen so often at least not anymore whilst that city is probably the one in the world that has been filmed the biggest number of times.Most of the movie takes place at night. The credits open on the blazing lights of the yellow taxi cab moving slowly in the dark rainy streets. A kaleidoscope of neonlight appears through the dripping windows as the driver's eyes blink in the front mirror. The night is the hero's universe it's the time when all the animals come out as he says. By contrast the few daylight scenes look somewhat offkey but this was definitely intentional.The final scene still appears today as extremely violent but at least it shows murder for what it is. Brutal ugly crude. It is something one tends to forget about after seeing so many police series where people get shot so often that it gets casual. Real violence is not casual when you face it and here is a film that makes you face it.The directing is first class and deservedly made path for Scorsese as a world renowned artist. Some techniques he used here are unusual for American cinema like focusing on details for a few seconds. The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer Bernard Herrman who died before the picture was even released.Two of the actors also deservedly made it to stardom. Robert de Niro plays a very unglamorous character but his presence on screen is so intense that it's no wonder it made such an impression. As for Jodie Foster she already appeared in films as a child but playing a teenage prostitute was certainly not an easy challenge and probably it was that role that really turned her into a major actress.Taxi Driver was a big hit when it came out both for the public and the critics. It won the Palme d'Or in Cannes and served as a trend setter for many later films like for instance Quentin Tarantino's and Abel Ferrara's. But even today the original model seems difficult to emulate probably because achieving a masterpiece is a rare thing by definition.".

	schema:headline " A wonderfully engaging and convincing slide into a modern madness from a director and actor showing some of their best form";
	schema:reviewBody "Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night and just ends up travelling around. To try and use the time effectively he becomes a taxi driver. Things start to look up for him as he works nights and slowly starts to live a little bit. He meets a girl Betsy and arranges to see her a few times despite the fact that he is a little bit out of the ordinary  a quality that seems to interest her. His connection to the night allows him to see young prostitute Iris being bullied by her pimp Matthew and he begins to see his role to perhaps save her  him playing his part in cleaning up the sewer that he feels New York has become. However when his view of normal life puts Betsy off him he starts to retreat more and more into the night looking for meaning in his life and growing more and more outraged by the world he is part of.Hardly the most uplifting of films it is engaging and impressive and truly deserves the reputation it has. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have produced a film that convincingly portrays a man cut out of society who has the slightest connection to normality before finding it eroded away. The script is brilliant because the detail is engaging but it is this descent into a very modern type of madness that drives the film forward. Travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy to go along with the rest of his madness. A major part of this is getting the feeling right about living in a cesspit a city that seems to have forgotten its way morally  New York is the strongest example but elements of it could be parts of any city I suspect. In painting this world in such a real way Scorsese has made Travis all the more convincing and to a point all the easier to follow in his fall. Like I said it is not a film to morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair. There is no redemption in this modern world and although it appears that the violence at the end somehow redeems Travis in reality by showing society accepting his action it drags the rest of us down nearer the world that he hates and has become part of. I love King of Comedy for the same reason albeit in a different world.Scorsese injects a real understanding of the place and a real sense of foreboding into even the earliest scenes. He inserts clever and meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight and his choice of scene and shot compliments the script is depicting Travis descending into madness. What makes the film even better is De Niro showing the type of form that makes his recent form such a major disappointment. He is outstanding as he moves Travis from being relatively normal to being eaten up from the inside out. His eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as the gradual slide he depicts over the course of the film. Although he dominates it others impress as well. Foster stands out in a small role while Keitel makes a good impression as the pimp. Shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as the others so it isn't all down to her. Regardless the film belongs to De Niro and although the quotable scenes are the ones that are remembered it is in the quieter moments where he excels and shows genuine talent and understanding.Overall an impressive and morally depressing film that deserves its place in cinematic history. The portrayal of a city and a man slipping into moral insanity is convincing and engaging and it shows how well to do modern madness and the effects of the moral void of parts of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like modern classic because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label.".

Taxi Driver is just all together a great film that is absolutely perfection. Martin Scorcesse who also was just really starting out made this movie that brought us back to the film noir genre. He made this great classic and I don't even think he realized how much it would stand against the test of time to this day we still know this film and even if you don't know it you know the infamous speech You talking' to me?. This is a film about isolation loneliness and self destruction at it's worst.Travis Bickle who claims to be an honorably discharged Marine it is implied that he is a Vietnam veteran is a lonely and depressed young man of 26. He settles in Manhattan where he becomes a night time taxi driver due to chronic insomnia. Bickle spends his restless days in seedy porn theaters and works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Bickle becomes interested in Betsy a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine. She is initially intrigued by Bickle and agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. On their date however Bickle is clueless about how to treat a woman and thinks it would be a good idea to take her to a sex film. Offended she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy phoning her and sending her flowers but all of his attempts are in vain. Rejected and depressed Bickle's thoughts begin to turn violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime that he witnesses while driving through the city he now finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training. He buys a number of pistols from an illegal dealer and practices a menacing speech in the mirror while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a homemade sliding action holster on his right arm You talking' to me?. Bickle is revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift Iris a 12yearold child prostitute gets in his cab attempting to escape her pimp.

It's personally one of my favorites and made me fall in love with Robert DeNiro all over again. The script to Taxi Driver is just so incredibly powerful and the performances were just perfect. Jodie Foster this little girl at the time was such a presence on screen she pulls in what was a very tricky performance and was hauntingly beautiful. Cybill Sheppard was also very beautiful and I was absolutely in love with her character and felt so bad for her. Everything about Taxi Driver is just great I don't know how much I could go on about the love I have for this film. It's a film that you will never forget and trust me if you haven't seen it go out and rent it immediately you won't regret it. It's bloody it's twisted it's crazy but it's one of the best films of all time.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors a good director an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.This film is about loneliness about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city the night environment full of whores junkies pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says 'loneliness has followed me all my life everywhere' but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy Cybill Shepherd to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam and he behaves like this because of his loneliness his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film which is composed by Bernard Herrmann inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis to know what he is thinking about.In general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an oldfashioned movie because the essence of the story the reality that is shown on it can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking' to me? You talking' to me?' which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece.".

This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors a good director an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.This film is about loneliness about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets.

	schema:reviewBody "If a picture is worth a thousand words then this movie moving picture is worth a million words which is why it has probably generated at least a million words.What can one say. The obvious that Taxi Driver is great it is. That it is a masterpiece it is. What sets this film apart from so many other films including great films is that it is an enigma. Every time I watch this film I see something else I notice something else I feel something else I wonder something else. And I am clearly not the only one who reacts to the film this way that is why it lends itself to endless speculation and discussion.Since so many positive reviews have been made rather than add my own red hot glowing review I thought I would address those people who have written that they don't like Taxi Driver because they say they find it dull and boring hard to follow etc. These people miss some important points about the film.ONE Taxi Driver is NOT an action film. If you want an action film watch Die Hard and its numerous sequels or Lethal Weapon and its sequels not to mention Rambo and thousands of other action flicks.  Nothing wrong with them per se. Nothing wrong with liking them either. But is wrong to put down Taxi Driver because of what it is not.TWO Taxi Driver is about loneliness and loneliness is characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness and Travis Bickle's character reflects that. His life is dull and boring hardly anything happens to him and that is what Taxi Driver shows  Bickle's pathetic life.THREE some people say that they don't understand the plot Bickle's attitudes and behaviour etc. But that is because Taxi Driver is about a man who is profoundly emotionally disturbed although he and his buddies don't seem to know it. His actions aren't rational because he isn't rational. His actions make no sense because he makes no sense. Offhand I can't think of any other film that has depicted mental illness as well as Taxi Driver and no film that attempts to show the world as seen by someone like Travis Bickle.There you go three reasons to address the most common criticisms of the film with one notable exception its controversial ending but THAT is a whole topic in itself which is just more proof of why Taxi Driver is so worthwhile  when viewers aren't sure what actually happens in the end Is Travis hallucinating as he is dying? Is that what the slow moving overhead tracking shot suggests? Or does he really become a hero in the media and get realeased back into the world with his buddies? Etc etc. The questions and issues raised by Taxi Driver just go one and on.Now if after reading the above you still don't think Taxi Driver is a great film I can't help you. I am NOT saying you have to like or love Taxi Driver just appreciate it or at least acknowledge its greatness even if it isn't your cup of tea. Actually I don't love Taxi Driver because it doesn't lend itself to love. It is too disturbing a picture precisely because it is way too close to reality it cuts too close to the bone for my comfort or rather discomfort. It is not comfortable to watch because it isn't supposed to be. So if Taxi Driver makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy it should because real life is uncomfortable and uneasy unless you are born rich or something.Finally after watching it again for the nth time I have begun to notice and feel just how smooth Taxi Driver is. The overall feel and flow of the film is incredibly smooth in which not only each scene but each and every movement and gesture flows into the other imperceptibly. Sometimes I play back scences and sequences over and over to catch how it happens. In fact I see it happening and still can't quite figure out how it is done but I have a hunch  DeNiro. DeNiro is just amazing in this film. If you haven't done it already watch it with the remote in your hand and play some of the scenes in slow motion and you will SEE what I am talking about. Only DeNiro could do what he does. The sheer minimalism of his performance is just stunning. How he gets so much from so little never ceases to amaze me. DeNiro's performance in Taxi Driver only reminds me of what sports announcer Curt Gowdy exclaimed after one of Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson's incredible plays in the 1970 World SeriesThis guy is another world!".

	schema:reviewBody "A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference. This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best Goodfellas being my fave. An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman Cybill Shepherd Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis's mind causing violent instincts and paranoia. This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle 'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout as if your seeing the harsh  gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. 55".

	schema:reviewBody "Taxi Driver starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer Bernard Hermann as we see the blurred city of New York as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion. Taxi Driver is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle De Niro is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris is 12 years old and for a 14 year old actress at the time Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance recognition and notice. The editing is very good the direction is great but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro's second best work to Raging Bull and among the finest acting performances of all time. Travis Bickle is the self proclaimed God's lonely man. Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes he goes unnoticed like a ghost meandering through life's morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don't see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He's ready for war and the table is set. The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dreamlike state as we watch with a long running overhead shot possibly signifying Bickle's departure from the world? of the carnage left in Bickle's wake. Then there's the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes degenerates and the scum of the earth. He's treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause Kill 5 scumbags save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she's no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He's quiet reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After Travis drops Betsy off he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple So long. As Travis drives off he menacingly looks back into the mirror representing a problem still exists then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle's brooding boiling rage within symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn't cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn't make it any better. He's still ready for war.".

	schema:reviewBody "So much has been written and talked about 'Taxi Driver' that it seems almost redundant to add anything more. But watching it again the other night for the nth time I was as I have been every single time I've seen it struck by just how perfect this movie is. It is as powerful and disturbing now as it was twentyfive years ago. It has not only NOT aged it gets better and more relevant every year. This is without doubt a modern classic and one of the handful of truly great timeless movies.Scorsese and Schrader went on to make other great movies after this both separately 'The King Of Comedy' 'Light Sleeper' and together 'Raging Bull' 'The Last Temptation Of Christ' but this is easily the best movie of their careers. And Robert De Niro's too. He has yet to top his stunning performance here as the deeply disturbed and alienated Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle cabbie and would be assassin. This character has not surprisingly entered movie legend. Scorsese surrounds De Niro with a first rate supporting cast including small but effective roles from Harvey Keitel 'Reservoir Dogs' Peter Boyle 'Hardcore' the underrated Victor Argo 'The King Of New York' and Joe Spinell 'Maniac'. Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster are also very good and even Cybil Shepherd the butt of many jokes is fine as Bickle's obsession.When you combine these actors Schrader's outstanding script and Scorsese's brilliant direction with the stunning cinematography Michael Chapman and haunting score Hitchcock fave Bernard Herrmann's final effort you have yourself a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' I urge you to do so immediately. It is a masterpiece pure and simple.".

	schema:reviewBody " SPOILERS How would anyone be able to relate to Travis Bickle ? Hes a freak show  a fantasist and a loner who watches porn films in cinemas with a cola in one hand and a candy bar in another and to all intents and purposes is an assassin and a stalker  but he also strikes a cord with any man whos been angry and young and rejected . Hes an outsider that society has turned its back on   Why wont you talk to me  is the heartbreaking question every young angry man screams at the world when hes very aloneScorsese directs Paul Schraders low concept script on a shoestring budget  Thats not a criticism  quite the reverse because this leads to a hyperrealism and itd be impossible to think that a major Hollywood studio would produce something like this nowadays where everything is about making money while playing it safe  A character study of a disturbed loner ? 12 year old prostitutes ? Vigilante executions ? Too controversial  not enough explosions  not enough CGI . If theres a flaw in the screenplay its at the end where Travis wipes out the pimp business and becomes a hero which left me confused . Doesnt society punish murderers even if they kill scum that use 12 year olds as prostitutes ? Even if he was cleared by the jury surely Travis would still have stood trial for murder ? but this is never referred to in the closing scenes  but I guess this is a comment on how society can quickly make a hero out of a villain and how a nobody can become the talk of the town  but still it seems to go against the grain of the script where we  Or at least the young males in the audience  recognise that an uncaring society is the villain where as Travis is the hero all along Despite the flawed ending of the screenplay  Which is superb untill the last ten minutes  this is still a movie masterpiece with Scorsese getting an acting tour de force from his cast . Jodie Foster as a child who sells her body on the streets of New York  a totally disturbing  brilliant performance  and DeNiro and Keitel in the same movie ! Ive no idea if this is just hype but I heard all the stage schools in the USA were swamped at the time by applications from applicants in Compton  Hells Kitchen  South Central and The Bronx whod seen DeNiro and Keitel in the  Im hip  scene  A scene that was totally adlibbed by the actors  and decided that acting could be cool and macho after all . As I said I dont know how true this is but the performances of these two actors has given a massive amount of credibility to the acting profession and it really is sad to see the DeNiro of today churn out so much garbage . This his greatest performance . I also rate it as Scorseses best movie As a footnote may I recommend to all the angry young men reading this review to track down the albums of Matt Johnson aka The The especially the mid 80s albums SOUL MINING  and INFECTED which have lyrics that could have been written by Travis himself . Matt is a great fan of Scorsese and it shows".

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere in the shadows of the night hidden within the restraints of his taxicab a lonely man watches with disgust. His eyes survey the streets with all the malice and passion of a burning fire his large pupils an open doorway leading into his soul. The demons haunt him voices in his head convince him that the world is closing in and the only way out is through some form of moral redemption a physical and emotional catharsis.The stranger's name is Travis Bickle and he is God's Lonely Man a discharged Vietnam veteran who wanders the streets at night in a permanent state of confusion and selfloathing.Travis takes a job as a cab driver to keep out of the porn theaters that have been occupying his time  deciding he might as well get paid for roaming since he does it anyway.But Travis' filtered input and odd output seems to suggest something is dreadfully wrong. The mild insanity of our protagonist begins to escalate. He approaches an attractive political campaign adviser Betsy Cybill Shepherd and asks her out to dinner. She agrees but the date is cut short when Travis takes her to an Xrated film.Travis soon meets a young underage prostitute named Iris a fourteenyearold Jodie Foster whom he feels a desire  nay a need  to rescue from slavery. Iris' pimp Sport Harvey Keitel becomes another of Travis' demons.Taxi Driver was released in 1976 to split praise. Some critics hailed it as a masterpiece whilst others were a great deal more reserved in their accolade. In Newsweek Jack Kroll wrote  in their eagerness to establish rich and moral ambiguities the Catholic Scorsese and the Calvinist Schrader have flubbed their ending. It's meant to slay you with irony but it's simply incredible. Some critics just hated the film in general and felt the entire runtime was a mess of pretentious storytelling and depressing gritty themes.Depressing? Yes. Gritty? Yes. Brilliant? Most definitely. Scorsese does not merely address Travis as a character he puts us inside his head. And even so there are instances of abnormality in Scorsese's camera work that suggest paranoia and schizophrenia moments of displaced subjectivity in which we are neither looking quite through the eyes of Travis nor through those around him but more at length to his sideyet it seems that his body primarily his hands are below us at the side of the frame indicating an altered version of the traditional P.O.V.Scorsese's movie is structured using diverse narrative elements  one of the most prominent being dramatic irony rooted in Greek tragedy in this case many setup and payoff moments. When Travis exits the brothel for the first time a Mafioso figure says Come back any time. Travis responds I will. We know he will too and when he does that's the payoff.Above all else the film is rooted in the basic existentialism philosophies of Berdyaev Heidegger and Nietzsche. Scorsese later admitted this his toying of genres and philosophy was entirely incidental It just felt right but one can't help but imagine Schrader may have been influenced by Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground in which our narrator begins I am a sick manI am a spiteful man. This brings to mind the scene in which Bickle dictates his journal entries to us and delivers an ultimatum to the filth on the streets preceded by senseless introspective rambling.Moving on the ultimate puzzle of the film Does our hero live or die? After Travis is shot in the climactic battle he lies on a sofa presumably dying and makes a gesture with his fingers pretending to shoot himself in the head. The camera pulls up overhead and exits the brothel. It then pulls back across the street and up into the heavens surveying the crowd below.In the next scene Travis is alive and well presented to the world as a hero through the media. Yet as Travis pulls away from the curb at the end of the film Herrman's familiar four notes the same ones as used for the final shot of Psycho implemented when Norman Bates' lack of absolute sanity is finally revealed come into play. A bell rings. Travis looks in his rearview mirror as if maybe something caught his eye And then suddenly the movie ends.Taxi Driver's ending cannot be resolved further more than conjecture and opinion. Scorsese himself says on the DVD makingof documentary that he believes the ending is open for analysis. Did Travis live? Did he die? Are the demons on the street still haunting him? Are we meant to sympathize with him and believe he is a hero or are we meant to refuse him as one? Or is this our natural reaction against Scorsese's own wishes  which would explain the negative reviews in '76? But it is ultimately the haunting image of Bickle drifting through the endless hordes of nameless people on the streets of Manhattan that lingers with us after the film has ended and remains the most prescient today. How effortlessly this man can disappear into the multitudes  God's Lonely Man once again alone alienated and betrayed by the world he has come to loathe. That above all else is the most poignant aspect of Taxi Driver.".

	schema:reviewBody "Travis Bickle has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film and this has to still rank as one of the best postfilm noir era noirs ever made.Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver Bickle played by Robert De Niro and his obsessions with cleaning up New York City.In addition to De Niro's stunning performance we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very very young 12 years old Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12yearold daughter to play a role like this but that's another subject. Albert Brooks Harvey Keitel with shoulderlength hair! and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help.Bickle's transformation from a disturbed cabbie to a fullyderanged assassin is fantastic to watch and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question You talking' to me? That scene and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes I'll never forget.The more times I've watched this the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rainslicked streets. Also Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film. Director Martin Scorcese has made a number of wellknown but not particularly boxoffice successful films and I still think this early effort of his was his best. He's never equaled it although I think he and De Niro almost pulled it off five years later with another whackedout character Rupert Pupkin In The King Of Comedy. In any case there is no debate that Scorcese and De Niro are a great team and that Taxi Driver is one of the most memorable movies of the Seventies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taxi Driver is a beautiful portrayed of an individual who tries to do things his way in the hectic and dangerous New York of the '70's. He already isn't a stable person to begin with he's a Vietnam veteran but through his loneliness and due to his own personal views and idea's of society and the world he gets more and more consumed by the rotten society until he feels it is enough and decides to take matters into his own hands.Beauty of the movie is that it gets interpreted by everyone in his or hers own way. Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind while making this movie. The story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life.The movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance such as a very young Jodie Foster Albert Brooks Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel.The entire movie is sensational and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann his last also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences of which the famous 'You talking' to me?' sequence is the best known. But also the violent ending leaves a lasting impression.It's still a movie that applies today after 30 years now. Because lets face it what exactly has been changed in society compared to 30 years ago and now? The subject and meaning of the movie could still apply to present day. It makes Taxi Driver a timeless and important movie that is a perfect reflection of society and already is worthy of the 'classic'status. Yet another essential '70's viewing.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " A movie that remains as relevant as it was in 1976. Maybe even more so.";
	schema:reviewBody "On the cloudy hazy streets of New York City a single yellow beacon stands out. A lonely insomniac mentally unstable cab driver does his job. All while plotting to cleanse the city of human trash. Welcome to a reallife nightmare Taxi Driver.With an omniscient feeling of loneliness symbolized by a taxi present in Travis Bickle Robert De Niro our antihero protagonist has his one element that anybody who has ever experienced loneliness in their life can relate to. However anyone who shoots up a brothel and attempts to assassinate a senator is by no means a role model. Travis Bickle despite his one trait that an audience can relate to is such an emotionally disturbed person that he sees very irrational actions as perfectly sane making him a danger to himself and to other people. The phenomenal score by Bernard Herrmann known for composing scores for Alfred Hitchcock from 19561964 reflects everything about Travis. His insanity loneliness bigotry and instability are all represented in a way that hypnotizes the listener in a cocktail of sound.Travis is a man that has nothing to live for in life. His infatuation with Betsy is doomed to go nowhere. He feels the need to lie to his parents in the form of a letter to make his life look better than the boring reality. Travis cannot discern rationally what deeds are right or wrong and quite frankly I doubt that he cares.The climactic final shootout which threatened to give this movie a X rating is an intense scene that has not lost an ounce of power today. As a kid born in the mid90's I can only imagine what effect images like a man having his hand blown apart by Travis's Magnum .45 had on 1976 audiences. The scene also drives home the extent of Travis's fragile mental state.Overall this is a masterwork from Martin Scorsese. Possibly even THE masterwork GoodFellas and Raging Bull create tough company of his entire career. A disturbing wonder more so for me as I am a high functioning autistic of the cinema that is telling of our society and of the human psyche. There are few classics in cinema that have withstood the test of time in terms of multiple decades in a way in which they have only become more relevant than when they were initially released. Taxi Driver is certainly one such movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a calculated exercise I watched Raging Bull and Taxi Driver back to back today. Two classics and two films generally recognized by critics and fans to be among the best of all time. Personally I think Bull was the better showcase for both De Niro and director Scorsese as the four years between films allowed both to improve on their respective crafts. In terms of favorites that might be a moot point as both are darkly disturbing and violent films with main characters that aren't particularly honorable much less likable.Indeed both characters the fictional Travis Bickle and the real life Jake La Motta were haunted by personal demons that manifested as forms of mental illness. La Motta's brand of violence was legal inside the ring what he carried into his personal life resulted in a lifetime of unintended consequences. The outcomes of fictional characters can be manipulated to suit the priority of the writer or director so in the case of Taxi Driver the protagonist winds up as sort of a hero at least to the parents of twelve year old hooker Iris. I'm not sure if the point of the film had anything to do with showing how one's life can turn on a second's notice or not. However when Bickle's assassination attempt on Palantine Leonard Harris was foiled the succeeding events could have led to his own demise. Instead he's reborn sort of. One could sequel the story after Betsy Cybil Shepherd gets a cab ride from Travis at the end of the picture but it's probably better left to the viewer's imagination.A tiny detail caught my eye in both pictures today which I'm sure I would never have considered had I seen them days or weeks apart. In the carnage of the shootout scene when the cops make their presence in the doorway of the rented room Bickle puts a bloody finger to his head simulating a gunshot and two drops of blood drip from his finger. Scorsese used the same device again in Raging Bull when Jake La Motta is badly bloodied in his final fight against Sugar Ray Robinson. As the boxer sags against the ring ropes the camera focuses on the top rope a few inches away from La Motta's outstretched arm. Two drops of blood fall from the rope to the canvas to further intensify La Motta's defeat. At the time I couldn't say why I found that to be so fascinating but now I do.".

	schema:headline " So open to interpretation that the plot falls out...";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts off with a mystery man walking into a dingy cab company and applying for a job. Something's off about him he's friendly on the surface but underneath it there's something stiff and cold. He mentioned the Marine Corp did something in Vietnam break him? Has he seen too many tragedies and this waxen face is the most he can muster? Does he see the hookers and pimps the human slime wandering the streets and question what he was fighting for? And what about those pills he keeps taking  is there some underlying mental condition? Then driving around in his cab he sees a woman. He stalks her to her job at a Senator's campaign office and at first we think there's going to be some sort of conflict here but then the camera pulls in to focus on her  and she's just as waxen and artificial as he is. Both of them speak with bizarre dialogue just two degrees off of normal. Eventually he walks in and they start dating.Then another twist  Senator Palpatine ahem Palantine gets into his cab one night. When the Senator asks what he cares about he tries to explain the human vermin wandering the streets. You see fear in the Senator's eyes... but he responds with a greasy quote about working hard and changing the system.At this point I was intrigued by the movie. I wanted to see how these characters would interact conflict with each other I wanted to know why the Taxi Driver was slightly off and why this woman seemed to mimic him. Was the violence eventually going to be about some political or moral principle? Or will it be an emotional shattering break down like some sort of Shakespearean tragedy? Unfortunately none of this came to pass. For some reason he takes the woman on a date to a... porno theatre? In between orgy scenes and Dutch dialogue there's a microscopic view of sperm fertilizing an egg. Whatever. The girl is initially hesitant but accedes to watch the film only to storm out in disgust five minutes later. She then disappears until the ending of the film.When he gives up on calling her he starts stalking a 12 year old prostitute. They go for coffee and he tries to convince her to quit. She calls him a square.Then he buys a whole bunch of guns and builds a nifty springmounted holster for his arm.Then he talks to a Secret Service agent then wanders off.There's a long winded conversation between him and another cab driver  okay I missed this part because I was busy talking about how many unnecessary scenes there were in this 115 minute long movie  but the bits I did catch didn't seem that critical.Then we watch a love scene between the 12 year old prostitute and her pimp. It's romantic and it goes on forever. We have no idea who his character is  he's just 'the pimp.' Then the Taxi Driver shows up planning to shoot Senator Palpatine screws up and runs away. After that he goes and shoots the pimp the hotel owner and a Mafioso. He then tries to commit suicide never giving the 12 year old the money he'd set aside for her in an earlier scene but he's out of bullets. For five long long minutes we watch the camera pan over the bloody scene.Then we find out that he survived he's a hero and the girl went back to his parents. He's back to driving a cab hanging out with his old cabdriving buddies who were never fleshed out then the girlfriend from earlier in the movie asks for a ride. He drives her home they don't talk and he doesn't charge her for the fare. Now the movies over.This movie fills me with rage and confusion. None of the characters are fleshed out most of them are unnecessary to what little story there is it's completely unrealistic  not in an artistic 'suspension of disbelief' way just a stupid way  and I can't discern any point to this movie. Why does he call the street people scum yet go to watch porn movies every night? What's his fundamental problem? Is he fixed at the end of the movie and if so what's fixed about him? All of this build up of him becoming Rambo only to shoot three guys  and even then screw that up badly? What about the love scene between the pimp and the 12 year old? Why the politician? And for god's sake why were there so many dragged out unnecessary scenes where absolutely nothing happened? 'Open to Interpretation' means that you can use a filmnovelsong as a platform to discuss feminism politics racism violence human nature and anything else  but the art itself has a distinct strand to it. This movie does not. It's sort of like the lateera Beatles' songs where they just slapped together random words... only those were at least entertaining and contained emotion. This movie had none of that. The only emotion it successfully conveyed was alienation  because I'm sure as hell feeling alienated right now.Deep existential questions are troubling my soul  if such ugliness as this can exist than does beauty even matter anymore? This film is so ugly sad and broken that compared to it the most vigorous celebration of youth love and beauty is nothing but whistling in the dark as the universe dissolves into entropy a featureless roomtemperature void...I don't know if I'll ever feel joy again. Even the blue soulful depths of melancholy are a sweet fruit which will forever be gone from my life. It's with my last act of will and human charity that I beseech you  if you love yourself then please  Don't watch Taxi Driver!".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Scorsese is one of those directors whose work I just don't seem to get. His films are not totally inaccessible like most of the work of Stanley Kubrick but sitting through a Scorsese production is often an exercise that pendulums back and forth between crashing boredom and utter incomprehensibility.Of course everyone knows by now that TAXI DRIVER is about isolation. Specifically the isolation of one man in the midst of a bustling city. Travis Bickle Robert De Niro a Viet Nam veteran applies for a job driving a taxi in New York on the graveyard shift the reason he gives for wanting the job is that he does not sleep at night. That anyone would hire him to actually drive a vehicle under those conditions seems odd but then everything about Bickle is odd. Clearly he suffers from a profound sense of isolation but most of that is of his own making since when it comes to social interaction this guy is so clueless that he makes burnout Reverend Jim from the television show Taxi seem like Albert Einstein by comparison.Travis finds himself attracted to Betsy a woman working on the presidential campaign of a politician Cybill Shepherd proving yet again that she cannot act her way out of a cream puff factory and he has sufficient social skills to get her to agree to a movie date. Then he takes her to a XXX porn film. Of course she cannot get out of there fast enough and he is totally bewildered in his mind it was a perfect date movie.A good deal of the story is told via Travis's inner thoughts spoken by De Niro on the soundtrack. This device was old even in 1976 and there is too much of it the audience is already alienated from this man and having his thoughts overdubbed places him even farther from anything remotely approaching understanding.Possibly the best scenes in the movie are the ones with Jodie Foster as Iris a twelveyearold prostitute whom Travis attempts to rescue from what he sees as a sordid life. Iris is possibly the most interesting person in the film Foster plays her as a girl walking a tightrope between what she has to do to survive and the necessity to avoid danger she is receptive to Travis at first but even a twelveyearold can see that this guy is not playing with a full deck. And at least she breathes some life into an unbearably tedious movie.Which brings us to De Niro. He's good here but he's much better elsewhere watching him I had the impression that Scorsese went to one of two extremes either he gave the actor no direction at all and let him do as he pleased or he micromanaged every nuance of the character and in the process sucked the life out of it. Whatever the result is a stilted and peculiar bit of acting that seems beneath a major talent like De Niro. Yes we get Travis's isolation but we never know what caused it or why he is just so damn WEIRD.And of course as is Scorsese's habit all of this is presented under the guise of gritty reality think GOODFELLAS and RAGING BULL both of which ram gritty reality down the viewer's throat until the urge to run screaming from the theater is almost overwhelming.I am a native of New York City I was born there and lived there until I was fortytwo. Martin Scorsese is also a native of the City but I do not recognize the picture of NYC he paints in this film at all. The simple answer is that we are seeing the City through Travis Bickle's eyes but while he describes what he sees we never find out WHY he sees things the way he does it is perhaps the most frustrating aspect of a very frustrating film.Great film? Depends on which critic you ask. The late Roger Ebert loved it. Leonard Maltin thinks it's awful. I suspect that like most of Scorsese's oeuvre this is one of those movies you either love or you hate. Well I didn't exactly HATE it but most of it is insufferably boring. De Niro presents us with a wacko character but fails to provide a provenance for his behavior. About the only good thing I can say about Cybill Shepherd is that her role is brief she's absolutely PAINFUL to watch. It is only Jodie Foster all of twelve years old yet wearing an ancient expression in her eyes that tells the story of where this girl has been that draws and holds the audience's attention honestly without Foster the film would have no life at all.And possibly the worst of it is that Bickle's increasing descent into violence is left totally unexplained. It would be easy to assume that it was his Viet Nam service that unhinged him but the movie does not play that way and at any rate if that were the case it would have been an easy matter to communicate it. To put it in five short words this film is a mess.".

His portrayal and character are completely fascinating from start to finish. He creates a character that somehow transcends out of the screen and glues the audience into believing sympathizing and experiencing with his character. The same can be said for Scorsese. Up until this point I always had Raging Bull as his finest but something about his work here is completely mesmerizing.

	schema:headline " Gets a bad rap";
	schema:reviewBody "This film gets a bad rap because it was not a suspenseful blockbuster in the vein of Psycho and The Birds. The fact is is that after Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedrin did battle with seagulls in 1963 Hitchcock never again approached the heights of a major director and he dramatically slowed down his film output.Still this movie along with 1964's Marnie and '72's Frenzy represent a decent effort by Hitchcock to stay current and hip with modern audiences. That he was still directing films at all in the 1960s and 1970s is quite remarkable for a man whose film work began in the silent era.Family Plot is a fun neat little comedythriller much akin to the NBC Mystery Movies of that era... i.e. Columbo McMillen and Wife. Blanche is a phony psychic who along with her reluctant boyfriend Frank played hilariously by the underrated Bruce Dern run afoul of big time crooks Karen Black and William Devane.The plot does get a bit convoluted but Hitchcock was smart enough to lay off the heavyhanded dictatorial directorship that categorized his earlier work and let the actors and their characters move the plot along. Unlike Cary Grant's Thornhill in North By Northwest we care about Blanche and Frank because they really are like us the viewer. As much as we all adored the women in Hitch's films... Grace Kelly Tippi Hedren Kim Novak and wanted to be like the menCary Grant Jimmy Stewert Ray Milland Rod Taylor Farley Granger etc. none of these characters were remotely like US and in his dotage Hitchcock was still keen enough to realize that Cary Grant in 1956 was an admirable figure walking down the street... in 1976 he was apt to be pointed at and laughed about. Hitch knew INSTINCTIVELY that the gray suit and slicked back hair era was gone forever. In this film it doesn't even look like Dern showers.That's part of the charm and why it was so refreshing at this late date to go into the movie theater and enjoy an Alfred Hitchcock film without having to sigh that it was all about nostalgia. This film in his humorous approach has much in common with The Trouble With Harry than Psycho or Shadow of a Doubt. Hitch didn't go out with a classic that's for sure but he went out with a modern film that showed he could still produce an entertaining flick. That was all he was ever about anyway. No higher praise is needed.".

The fact is is that after Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedrin did battle with seagulls in 1963 Hitchcock never again approached the heights of a major director and he dramatically slowed down his film output.Still this movie along with 1964's Marnie and '72's Frenzy represent a decent effort by Hitchcock to stay current and hip with modern audiences. That he was still directing films at all in the 1960s and 1970s is quite remarkable for a man whose film work began in the silent era.Family Plot is a fun neat little comedythriller much akin to the NBC Mystery Movies of that era... i.e. Columbo McMillen and Wife. Blanche is a phony psychic who along with her reluctant boyfriend Frank played hilariously by the underrated Bruce Dern run afoul of big time crooks Karen Black and William Devane.The plot does get a bit convoluted but Hitchcock was smart enough to lay off the heavyhanded dictatorial directorship that categorized his earlier work and let the actors and their characters move the plot along. Unlike Cary Grant's Thornhill in North By Northwest we care about Blanche and Frank because they really are like us the viewer. As much as we all adored the women in Hitch's films... Grace Kelly Tippi Hedren Kim Novak and wanted to be like the menCary Grant Jimmy Stewert Ray Milland Rod Taylor Farley Granger etc. none of these characters were remotely like US and in his dotage Hitchcock was still keen enough to realize that Cary Grant in 1956 was an admirable figure walking down the street... in 1976 he was apt to be pointed at and laughed about. Hitch knew INSTINCTIVELY that the gray suit and slicked back hair era was gone forever. In this film it doesn't even look like Dern showers.That's part of the charm and why it was so refreshing at this late date to go into the movie theater and enjoy an Alfred Hitchcock film without having to sigh that it was all about nostalgia. This film in his humorous approach has much in common with The Trouble With Harry than Psycho or Shadow of a Doubt. Hitch didn't go out with a classic that's for sure but he went out with a modern film that showed he could still produce an entertaining flick. That was all he was ever about anyway. No higher praise is needed.";

Barbara Harris looks just like Hitchcock's daughter as you'll see from the interview just a younger version. A extra lesson You will never get a facelift once you see the interviews with Karen Black. If she had allowed herself to age naturally she would have been so much more attractive than the gargoyle you'll wince at seeing.Here's a treat the winding mountain road and no brakes scenario as never you've seen it. I loved the comic touches and the risqu language. It is indeed a unique film. If you happen to love the mountain of California and San Francisco you'll also love the cinematography. The stills are mostly of Hitchcock in the graveyard which makes you wonder if he wasn't a little clairvoyant himself. The whole movie centers around a phony psychic and her attempt to cheat an old woman out of her money.In our cynical world of today you'll expect them just to dress Dern up as the missing heir but nope they play it straight. Having read of Hitchcock's misogyny you'll appreciate the cuts and slices between the lovers. Both pairs of grifters have their own love thing going. Rather touching to see the fidelity among the crooks. Inspired writing indeed.Hitchcock did have a pacemaker installed while this movie was being made so you have to wonder if his own thoughts of his impending death might have caused as much concentration on the graveyard scenes. Buy the DVD the added features will make the movies itself 3 times more interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Family Plot differs from all the other Hitchcock films. It lacks suspense for the most part and it is not as funny as many of his films. Instead it is just an amusing little yarn.  I like the way the film starts with two separate plot lines which gradually merge. Even if it is not the most original thing in the world especially since two of Family Plot's stars were main players in Robert Altman's Nashville it still makes the film interesting. If anyone else had made this film it probably would be more fondly received by the public although I doubt anyone would still be watching it today.The two characters with whom we begin the film whom we would consider the heroes are the best and are played lovingly by Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern. She's a hack psychic milking old ladies out of pensions and he's a cabbie who cannot find enough time both to drive his cab and participate in Harris' schemes. Although the characters aren't as well developed as those in numerous other Hitchcock ventures they're entertaining.The other couple Karen Black and William Devane fare less well. They're more crafty in their crimes perpetrating largescale kidnappings for enormous ransoms. Karen Black's character is very underdeveloped hardly showing any depth. What character she does have  is not entirely believable since Karen Black seems too nice to play a hardcore criminal. William Devane is decent as the sinister mastermind but the history provided to his character is far more brutal than is believable he locked his adopted parents in their bedroom and set fire to their house.I liked the idea of the small time crooks clashing with the professionals and I liked the outcome of the film. All in all it is decent and worth watching. It does not feel anything like a Hitchcock film so I wouldn't expect anything like Vertigo or Rear Window when approaching this his swan song. 710".

I know that some of them were not first choices in the casting process but what you end up with here are two teams of schemers who collide in splendid ways all because one man's horrid past starts to intrude on his equally despicable present. You can hide but you can't run.I love the strong element of coincidence in the film normally the mark of a tacky film. And how many of these serpentine machinations on display really do stem from coincidence? The first coincidence is a real one Bruce Dern almost hits strolling stranger Karen Black with his carand of course these two are destined to cross paths several times throughout the film. But Dern and Harris as this wonderful contrast to the other sneaky pair of the film Devane and Black appear as ditherers scatterbrains goofs even. We have the precise cleanly executed supercalm approach of Devane and Black versus what looks like a losing side in the bumbling obliviousness of the admittedly lovable Dern  Harris dysfunctional combo.Or not dysfunctional after all! Under all the histrionics bickering and clowning around Dern and Harris manage to function as plodding yet determined detectivesand they have an advantage over Devane's superior intellect they are coming at him slowly from an angle he does not expect...his past. The few scenes with copswonderful scenes playful scenes just indicate that if George Bruce Dern and Blanche Barbara Harris don't succeed in tracking a criminal and his reluctant female accomplice to his lair the hard way no one will. The kidnappingforswag will go on and on because the villains are too perfect. Enter successful dysfunction in just the most wonderful way shown in any movie.I love all the intertwining and I love Ed Lauter coming in from the sidelines and being that cool fifthguyinand I love a last Hitchcock movie that has of all things selfabsorbed faceless teenagers in a car whoafter accidentally forcing an oncoming car off a cliff just sort of drive off to continue their partying. After all who cares? Whimsy in death. And I do cherish the little wink at the endas if it's Hitchcock himself taking the first brick out of the Fourth Wall and saying 'I'm just about done pretending.

I think it's a pretty good mystery and all the characters are quite believable. I think the choice of actors for each part was good. I give this movie an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. I'd rate it higher but it's got some mild swearing and a bit of sexual innuendo. But all in all it's worth seeing next time you find it on TV.".

All of the comedylight movies that Hitchcock made are underrated see the example of The trouble with Harry1955 and I can't understand why.This has some scenes that demonstrate the mastery of Alfred Hitchcock notably the car scene where one couple is inside a moving car with the brakes sabotaged.That scene is so well constructed that you actually can feel like you are in the car... Amazing!I watched in the Making of this picture someone saying that at that time people knew this would be the last Hitchcock movie it would have been received way better by the audience. I give it 8 of 10 because it's a joyful and great movie.".

You can't just insinuate the act anymore and cut to the seashore.Into this environment comes Family Plot. It is basically two sets of crimes one minor and one major hitting an intersection with one group of criminals having no idea what the other group is up to.Blanche Tyler Barbara Harris is a fake psychic. She has her cabbie boyfriend get information for her based on the hints she gets from the sances. In this case a wealthy woman Julia Rainbird claims her sister's spirit and her own conscience torment her because in 1933 she made her sister put her illegitimate child up for adoption because of the scandal that would have occurred given the conventions of the times. Nobody knows what happened to him since the adoption was closed. Now Julia Rainbird in her old age wants to accept her nephew into the family and leave the entire estate to him. There is 10K in it for Blanche if she can find him.What Blanche and cabbie lover George Bruce Dern don't know is that the long lost heir is basically Lex Luther with hair  William Devane as Arthur Adamson a true sociopath who loves thumbing his nose at conventions and loves crime. Together he and his girlfriend Fran Karen Black kidnap wealthy people in exchange for jewels. Adamson has a legitimate business as a jeweler as a front.The misunderstandings come in when Adamson discovers that somebody is digging into his past specifically his faked death which was a cover for the murder of his adoptive parents back in 1950. Blanche and George can't figure out why they would be getting attempts on their life. Adamson has no idea of his true identity and has no idea why these two amateurs are trying to find him figuring it has either to do with his current kidnappings or the past murder of his parents.It all comes together in a suspenseful and comical way. I'll let you watch and find out how.Blanche and George are a hilarious couple just perfect for 1975. In one scene at the end of the day she is basically ordering him to come inside the house and sexually service her. George replies she is wearing him out and he has to work tomorrow. She asks what are you saving it for?. This is a long way from the stolen glances passionate kisses and hand holding in Dial M For Murder but this is a different time and they are just right for it.Even at the end Hitchcock did know how to change with the times.

	schema:headline " Family Plot a plot to satisfy Hitch fans' family the fitting conclusion to one of the greatest cinematic oeuvres...";
	schema:reviewBody "Murder can be fun said Hitchcock to the thenrising composer John Williams unsure about the use of playful theme for ominous situations. Well after watching Family Plot again I would say that anything handled by Hitchcock can be fun. And it is not surprising that the original novel titled The Rainbird Pattern saw its dark material turned into a lighthearted comedy by Ernest Lehman's inspired writing and Hitchcock's wicked sense of humor in the same vein than To Catch a Thief and The Trouble With Harry. And I think this says a lot about a fascinating mix of selfconfidence and humility that I guess only experienced directors can demonstrate at the twilight of their career. And I'm convinced that it took the two 60's misfires Torn Curtain and Topaz to put Hitchcock on the right track again and allow him to make movies that would be more fitting swan songs. So Hitchcock was back to his roots in every meaning of the word with the wonderful Frenzy a thriller certainly not devoid of macabre humor. Indeed who can ever forget the villain's struggle to get his pin off the hand of his last victim hidden in a bag of potatoes and the whole action set in a moving truck? Frenzy was a legitimate thriller but its darkly comedic undertones worked as the perfect transition to a more relaxed and upbeat Family Plot definitely a comedy with a good balance of thrills and suspense.The film starts in a wealthy elderly woman's house Blanche Tyler a psychic in trance tries to communicate with the woman's sister using different voices howling screaming giving such an overthetop performance we suspect she belongs to the fraudulent side of the business but it takes some great acting to perform the bad one and Barbara Harris whenever she's in that state is a delight to watch she'd be even funnier in a similar scene later with her boyfriend. The comedy is integral to the film's appeal because the opening is extremely talkative and provides a vital flow of information and Harris' lively and funny performance catches our eyes and inevitably our ears and our mind.So it all comes down to the woman asking Blanche to find her sister's illegitimate son given for adoption so she can clear her conscience and allow him to inherit her fortune in exchange Blanche will receive ten thousand dollars and I just love Harris' cute response when she tries to pretend that money doesn't matter. Blanche is a smalltime fraud and her boyfriend George is a cabdriver and wannabe actor so the reward means a lot. But what an unlikely nonglamorous goofy yet charming couple to lead a Hitchcock film! Still the chemistry between them with all the talks about the 'plot' sex and their job feels genuine and real.There is another couple though in the film more inline with the classy and icy correctness we're used to deal with Hitch. A jeweler David Levane and his girlfriend Fran Karen Black specialized in kidnapping dignitaries and rich figures leaving them up in exchange of precious gemstones. They hide their victims in a cellar and are so professional they make impossible any identification. The first transition from Blanche and George to Arthur and Fran is abrupt and disconcerting although creatively done but once we get it that the film centers on the two couples the pros and the smalltime crooks we know where the story is going two plots coming across each other in other words a confrontation.The thrill in Family Plot is to see these couples getting closer to each other and even play a sprinkledsprinkler game when George's lousy attempt to pass a lawyer raises the suspicion of Adamson's former accomplice he's obviously the lost heir the only way the two plots would converge. So the cat and mouse's role are reversed and Fran and Arthur spy on George and Blanche thinking they want the reward for their capture. Which would lead to the first lifethreatening sequence with a highspeed descent in a mountain road and as much I enjoyed it I can't get over the hilariously distorted face of George crushed under Blanche's shoe while she tries to climb her way out of the vehicle.Just like the plot swings back and forth between two couples that couldn't have been more different it does the same thing with thrills and comedy and the result is savorous and entertaining. Hitchcock also provide some pretty memorable moments Adamson delicately taking a lint off a cop's suit Fran putting parsley in the hostage's plate a dazzling aerial view on a cemetery and a great kidnapping scene in a church where a bishop is taken away without any of the people reacting. Adamson knew that churchpeople are so polite and inhibited they wouldn't react and we believe him. This level of confidence echoes Hitchcock's he doesn't go to intricate and lengthy extremes to get a specific job done. And only Hitch can get away with it.This is a film for the fans his cameo doesn't bother to show his face and yet everyone immediately recognizes him this is why his last cameo is one of his most inspired. Hitchcock have built so much confidence that only he could conclude such a film with a climax relying on something that a child could have done but knowing the childish Blanche and her slowwitted boyfriend it could work. And although the film wasn't intended to be the last it couldn't have had a better final shot than a wink at the camera. Hitchcock always did movies with the audience in mind it's all natural to end with a friendly farewell to those whose emotions he toyed with for half a century.".

As an aging widow Lillian Gish wanted to test for the role of Julia Rainbird but had been promised to Cathleen Nesbitt to find her nephew who was given away for adoption many years earlier following a family scandal . Meanwhile an extremely clever couple an astute jeweler Roy Thinnes was originally hired to play Arthur Adamson but Hitchcock's first choice William Devane became available so Hitchcock fired Thinnes without a reason and hired Devane and his enticing girlfriend are behind a series of kidnappings of various VIPs in the San Francisco area .Entertaining mystery movie packs thrills  humor  suspense and ordinary Hitch touches . This agreeable picture has some 'screwball comedy nature' that evokes Alfred Hitchcock's earlier flick Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Alfred Hitchcock's films have become famous for a number of elements and iconography  vertiginous heights innocent men wrongfully accused blonde bombshells dressed in white voyeurism long nondialogue sequences etc. In this his final film one last iconographic element was added to the canon the woman in black . Karen Black plays a villainous character whose outfit is the antithesis of the blonde dressed in white  her costume comprises black hat black dress large black sunglasses obscuring the face and a long blonde wig . This menacing character image was notable in this movie and its image dominated in the film's printed promotional material and movie posters. The malevolent characterimage has since been reused in such famous movies as for character Bobbi in 'Brian De Palma''s Dressed to kill' and in Italian movies  the Giallo genre . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks such as Mount Rushmore in North by Northwest and the Statue of Liberty in Sabotage. Hitch apparently decided to leave this movie location unspecific and without recognizable landmarks and filmed it in the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco . Spectacular runaway car ride  although the famous car chase in this movie isn't technically really a car chase as the downhill car sequence only involves one car. The final shot in the movie a wink by the Barbara Harris character was a jokey reference that was not planned but Alfred Hitchcock decided to leave in  this was arguably a fitting coda to his career exemplifying the black humor that was prevalent in his movies . Alfred Hitchcock once said of this film It's a melodrama treated with a bit of levity and sophistication  I wanted the feeling of the famous director Ernst Lubitsch making a mystery thriller. .The motion picture was well directed by Alfred Hitchcock  he was famous for making his actors follow the script to the word but in this movie he let the characters improvise and use their own dialogue . After this movie was completed Alfred Hitchcock worked on the film script for the spy thriller 'The Short Night'. Alfred Hitchcock was seriously in illhealth during the production of this movie  this lead to this picture being his final ever film. He never got to direct it due to his ailing health and it was not made. It would have been his fiftyfourth film. 'The Short Night' still has never been filmed to this day.".

The final shot in the movie a wink by the Barbara Harris character was a jokey reference that was not planned but Alfred Hitchcock decided to leave in  this was arguably a fitting coda to his career exemplifying the black humor that was prevalent in his movies . Alfred Hitchcock once said of this film It's a melodrama treated with a bit of levity and sophistication  I wanted the feeling of the famous director Ernst Lubitsch making a mystery thriller. .The motion picture was well directed by Alfred Hitchcock  he was famous for making his actors follow the script to the word but in this movie he let the characters improvise and use their own dialogue . After this movie was completed Alfred Hitchcock worked on the film script for the spy thriller 'The Short Night'. Alfred Hitchcock was seriously in illhealth during the production of this movie  this lead to this picture being his final ever film. He never got to direct it due to his ailing health and it was not made. It would have been his fiftyfourth film. 'The Short Night' still has never been filmed to this day.";

	schema:reviewBody "FAMILY PLOT has earned a permanent footnote in cinematic history simply because it turned out to be Alfred Hitchcock's last production. Unfortunately it did not do very well on its initial release because many found it too comic and lighthearted in tone and not suspenseful enough. Even Stephen King described it as a turkey in his book DANSE MACABRE! I think the real problem with this underrated delight is that this is one of Hitch's most complex denselywritten stories  Ernest Lehman's script is aweinspiring almost novelistic and chockfull of double meanings and implications which may not strike you on a single viewing. Like all the characters in the movie FAMILY PLOT is not what it seems to be. On the surface we have a light comic thriller involving a psychic BlancheBarbara Harris and her actor boyfriend Lumley Bruce Dern who have been hired by a rich old woman to find her missing nephew the heir to a huge fortune. The missing nephew turns out to be the thoroughly repellent Arthur Adamson William Devane in a role originally intended for Jack Nicholson  who would have been PERFECT in the part but who wanted too much money! a sociopath who with the help of his girlfriend Fran Karen Black kidnaps important people and holds them for ransom. But Adamson is not just a thief  he is also a killer. When he realizes Blanche and Lumley are trying to find out information about him he assumes  incorrectly and ironically  that they are undercover agents looking to arrest and expose him as a kidnapper. Of course Blanche and Lumley know nothing of Adamson's crimes and thus put themselves in great danger without realizing it. In a way I consider FAMILY PLOT to be Hitchcock's most perfect work of sheer suspense  after the first 10 minutes the audience always knows more than any of the characters and all we can do is wait for them to come together which makes for some very anxious moments! FAMILY PLOT'S comic tone is belied by some dark moral undercurrents rife with unsettling implications. The dominant characters Blanche and Adamson are in fact very similar people although in dramatic terms one is the heroine and the other the villain. Adamson is a liar a thief and a con artist. Blanche a fake psychic who bilks lonely old women out of their money is also a liar a thief she essentially steals from her clients by faking her powers and a con artist motivated by greed. Both heroine and villain also dominate their lovers  Blanche uses her sexual hold over the rather naive but smart and loving Lumley to get him to adopt all sorts of identities to further THEIR plot and Adamson does the exact same thing to Fran forcing her to assume false appearances in the course of furthering HIS plots. Although one couple is labeled as good and the other as bad morally they are not so far apart from one another. Indeed everyone in the film manipulates and lies to others to achieve nonetoopleasant ends. Even old Julia Rainbird whose guilt over ostracizing her dead sister and the girl's illegitimate child sets the story in motion has used and deceived others for her own selfish goals. The vision of humanity in this film is essentially dark  people are monsters of greed and deceit willing to use anyone and everyone for money and even risking the lives of those they love in the process. This makes the film's undeniable humor even more disturbing  what are we really laughing at when we laugh at these sad and confused people? The performances by the four principals are topnotch especially by Harris as the ditzy psychic who isn't the dumb blonde she appears to be and by Devane as the evil killer who presents himself as a respectable businessman. The movie also contains two truly spectacular Hitchcockian setpieces  the justly famous scene where Blanche and Lumley are trapped in a speeding car has me on the edge of my seat every time! and a brilliant sequence which begins with the dropoff of a kidnapping victim and ends with the longawaited meeting of Blanche and Adamson. Hitchcock always gave us what we didn't expect and FAMILY PLOT is no exception. This movie was way ahead of its time and deserves a better reputation than it has. My favorite bit of dialogue You're a Capricorn aren't you? No I'm a Leo. That's what I thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Family Plot 1976It all is a playful gag by the endnot the end of the movie but of the career the long cat and mouse moviemaking career of Alfred Hitchcock. This his last film is both cute and clever and a tiny bit suspenseful. It reuses some of the same kinds of tricks we've seen from him before with a twist here or there the innocent protagonists for example are themselves up to a little bit of a scam. And in Hitchcock fashion the antagonists a parallel couple are lighthearted in their murderousness. Their angst over crime is theatrical.There are usually moments in his movies that are vividly disturbing and he contrasts these with either lightly comic scenes downright silliness or charming everyday life. Think of the family in Shadow of a Doubt or Cary Grant in North by Northwest for starters. In this movie beginning even with the pun of the title the family plot is a cemetery plot everything is chipper. The hairraising runaway car scene is so scary and absurdly silly at the same time I think a lot of people will give up on the movie as just plain stupid. Part of me agrees but I laughed out loud through the whole scene in appreciation and not because of comic timing or original sight gags or whatnot but because I could imagine the director laughing. Movies are supposed to entertain he would insist supposedly saying to the impassioned Ingrid Bergman once Ingrid it's just a movie. Hitchcock wants it to be carefully silly and disarming at the same time. I mean he's winking at us just as we are supposed to be scared.The evildoers are really not very evil here though the man does propose some pretty ruthless behavior and the people out to do good eventually anyway with dollar signs in their eyes all the same are truly fun and natural as a couple. The plots of the two couples are separate at first and once they join it gets complicated but never confusing. The Mustang is already eleven years old for this filma sign of how far into our current era Hitchcock has come and perhaps a reminder that his style of making movies is starting to look like just that a style something artificial and quaint when hard edged elegant realism has stormed back into Hollywood from Chinatown to the Godfather to in 1976 uh Rocky. If Hitch is out of touch with the times he's completely in touch with his own approach. This is a Hitchcock film through and through and if you are tired of me saying that it's because I think you might hate it without knowing how much it depends on knowing liking and understanding that kind of movie. It's totally enjoyable. Not his best but enjoyable and well made and almost heartwarming of all things.".

Had he used the exact same script and made a dark thriller with an able cast it would have worked much better. Instead it's played for laughs and it's just not funny. I have serious issues with the four principal actors and their ability to convincingly portray their characters. Barbara Harris' kooky persona is as dated as that bouffant bubble hairdo that looks like a wig. She was completely out of step even in 1976. Bruce Dern is annoying in his forced attempt at a comic performance. Karen Black's acting is tentative and uncertain she was too awestruck at being in a Hitchcock film. William Devane's grinning mouthful of capped teeth is similarly a turnoff. It's the same sort of miscasting that ultimately doomed Gus Van Sant's unfortunate Psycho remake. The John Williams score with its tinkling harpsichord more befitting a Disney children's adventure is excruciatingly trite. Hitchcock's misjudgments at that late stage of his career when he probably shouldn't have been making movies anymore can be forgiven in light of the remarkable legacy of masterpieces he left behind.Update I have grown to admire this film more with each repeated viewing. I still feel the casting is weak the music is trite and the overall tone to be too lightweight. However Ernest Lehman's script with its two intersecting story lines is welldeveloped and full of clever dialog. Supporting players are excellent particularly Cathleen Nesbitt as Julia Rainbird and Ed Lauter as Joe Maloney. Hitchcock had not lost his touch. This is definitely not among his worst films.".

On one of her phony psychic sessions Blanche is given the opportunity to earn 10000 for finding the lost relative of one Julia Rainbird Cathleen Nesbitt. As the lovers crisscross the city looking for the lost man they end up caught in the scheme of a jewel thief played by William Devane.The reason this is a solid movie is because the story lines are so interesting. The hunt for the mysterious Eddie Shoebridge contains enough mystery to really suck you in and make you WANT to see the resolution. The concurrent jewelthief plot is also interesting enough to make you wonder how the two can possibly be related. Through some of the soso periods that this movie most definitely hits the overall goal is fascinating enough that you won't even consider turning it off.Another factor that really helps too is the acting. Bruce Dern is an incredible character actor and carries every scene he is given. Harris  Devane are also very capable leads that comprise good scenes with each other. At those moments when the overall storyline lags just a bit the acting is good enough to keep you in the movie.Overall Family Plot is just an interesting little flick. It isn't epic in any sense of the word like some of Hitch's earlier fare but it is just a fun little mysterycomedy that will sweep you away for two hours.".

Perhaps he was telling us.......I do have a naughty side and a sense of humour. Bruce Dern and Karen Black are pretty good and the pace is always fast. This last Hitchcock film was not well received particularly in America. One of the reasons was Alfreds VERY English  naughty sense of humour. There are vast differences between American humour and British humour. Hitchcock finished his great career ..............with one for the Brits. Well done Alfred.....we all know American humour is....ummmm not at all funny.".

Perhaps he was telling us.......I do have a naughty side and a sense of humour. Bruce Dern and Karen Black are pretty good and the pace is always fast. This last Hitchcock film was not well received particularly in America. One of the reasons was Alfreds VERY English  naughty sense of humour. There are vast differences between American humour and British humour. Hitchcock finished his great career ..............with one for the Brits. Well done Alfred.....we all know American humour is....ummmm not at all funny.";

At that point it was about the music the dance scenes and the clothes.It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker but Tony is bothered by her observations.Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 the disco on the weekends. You're a clich. You're no one going nowhere. As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his station in life and tells Stephanie he wants out of Brooklyn.What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments but have no life outside of the night life.And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.For whatever reason Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special but I get choked up every time I see it.Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.".

Saturday Night Fever is one of those rare movies you can watch  just enjoy yourself. How can you get tired of watching John Travolta walking down the street with a paint can? That opening captured your attention right from the start. You know where these characters are coming from. Tony's friends have basically given up on doing any better  have accepted there fate. Tony  Stephanie know there's something more out there for them  their going for it the best way they can. By the end of the movie I'm rooting for them to make it big.

	schema:reviewBody "Although it may seem dated and cheesy to some viewers today Saturday Night Fever remains one of the most underrated examples of '70s popculture. It is undoubtedly the quintessential dance flick and remains one of the most entertaining films of alltime. Yet behind all the music and entertaining aura you are actually viewing a drama studying the American class system and young rebellion. Though at times it is slightly exaggerated it still manages to capture a vast amount of authenticity and ultimately the sights and sounds of the time.Saturday Night Fever follows selfproclaimed dance king Tony Manero John Travolta and his love of dancing and the trials and tribulations of his life in the Bronx. He soon meets an arrogant fellow dancer named Stephanie Mangano Karen Lynn Gorney. Quickly becoming attracted and influenced by the women he starts questioning the way he lives his life.The film is not always upbeat and at times can be depressing particularly the scenes depicting peerpressure. Although both have their differences both are very alike and ultimately want to be something big. There are also the elements of jealously rivalry religion rebellion respect and racism added into the film. This captures the realism of the time and with more accuracy and honesty than a lot of films. Just take a look at the brief scene where Tony is on the tube this is an oddly poignant effecting and compelling scene presenting Tony's confused emotions.Saturday Night Fever still carries the vibe rhythm and atmosphere it did back in '77. It remains one of the most influential films for both the filmworld and popculture. Infamously holding some of the greatest dance sequences ever committed film you can feel the energy emotions time and determination that were spent perfecting the dance scenes to the finest detail. The lighting is perfect at creating the disco world the setpiece of the 2001 Disco is one of the film's many iconic highlights.John Travolta dedicates himself to his dancing and character fitting the role with a graceful ease. The film goes into depth at studying characters too it shows how desperate everyone is to fit in and be able to make an impressive image. The fantastic shots on character's feet show the strut in their walk representing their desire to maintain their reputation of being cool. All the characters want to be something while a lot of them will never add up to anything due to their workingclass backgrounds. There are a fair amount of American socialcomments scattered throughout the film and retaining a surprising amount of intelligent value.The gloriously groovy and funky soundtrack is possibly the film's finest element. The music accompanies the dance sequences with an amazing amount of memorably robust imagery. The use of The Bee Gees' music is wonderful to listen to and also for helping to create an ambiguous atmosphere of love drugs and sex. The shooting techniques in the disco are magnificent for filming the dance scenes and fit perfectly alongside the other technical elements.Saturday Night Fever is a far more professional film than one might expect it has intelligence as well as entertainment which is something that makes a more than just admirable achievement. It is a truly remarkable triumph and a film that deserves more appreciation than it gets.".

	schema:headline " Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair and you hit it!  Tony Manero.";
	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie.I love the way it focuses on dancing yet it isn't about dancing at all. Yes long amounts of time are given to showing John Travolta light up the dance floor but the story's fundamental point is the most subtle Trying to escape from your boring daily routine even if it is just for an hour.That's exactly what Tony Manero does. He saves up his weekly earnings from where he works in downtown Brooklyn at a crummy hardware store then blows it all in one day at the local disco joint where he reigns as king. His female dance partner calls him a walking clich. In a sad sort of way it's true.But this is Tony's dream. I quote an aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime. Saturday Night Fever is based entirely on this idea. In an odd sort of way Rupert Pupkin is a lot like Tony Manero. He just has a different dream. We all do.Saturday Night Live's theme tune Staying Alive the title of the horrendous Sylvester Stallonedirected sequel speaks as much truth about life as the film itself. I'm goin' nowhere somebody help me I'm goin' nowhere somebody help me yeah chants a voice in the Bee Gee's universally known disco hit. As I listen to it right now I realize just how perfect it is for the movie. It's a legendary song and for good reason.I didn't grow up during the disco generation. But Saturday Night Fever makes me feel as if I hadand that is one of the fundamental keys to a film so incredibly outdated and yet still poignant in our memories. It was the film that solidified John Travolta as an icon and the film that eventually led to him being regarded as the King of Cinema Disco. In the Travolta film Get Shorty a criminal threatens a producer by saying that if he doesn't pay up he'll be dead as disco. Ironic.Travolta is in his prime spotlight as Manero a Brooklyn kid aiming to make it big on the dance floor. There isn't much to the movie other than the need for fameas brief as it may beand the most obvious theme of the film which is learning to treat women as something more than just sex objects.Tony and his pals all join together at 2001 Odyssey a crummy disco club with dizzying strobe lights and a constantlywaxed dance floor where Tony is often encouraged to let loose and show everyone his moves. When he's not doing that he's sitting at the bar watching a topless stripper do her thing. And he's only 19.Part of this movie is learning to grow up and treat women as something more than Tony is used to treating them. But that's one of two primary plotsthe other is of course trying to break away from a boring life. Tony comes from an Italian background and he lives in a bad area of town. His mother is proud of her eldest son who became a priest and she's discouraged by the fact that her other son doesn't seem to care about making anything out of his life. We get the feeling that Tony's parents once had the same outlook as their son and fear he may be going down their own path. After Tony gets a raise from 3 to 4 his father tells him that 4 can't even buy 3. His son swears at him and storms away.Some of my favorite scenes in Saturday Night Live are the human ones such as when Tony stares in his bedroom mirror barechested and combs his hair forever looking over himself with the same pride that Travis Bickle displayed in the famous You talkin' to me? scene in Taxi Driver released a year earlier. In the background of the shot are posters of Al Pacino from Serpico and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. Just think Sly directed the sequel and did a cameo yet he was in a way in the first film too. I also like when Tony is interacting with his dysfunctional family. He's nice to his little sister when he walks through the door after work but after working for quite some time on his nowoutofdate hairstyle he barks at his father when he is slapped during dinner in one of the rare scenes that made me laugh. He yells at him Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair and you hit it! I know that scene has been quoted before but I quoted it again since it made me laugh so hard.In one of the finest scenes in the entire movie and certainly one of the most touching Tony has lunch with an older girl who later becomes his dance partner and tries to impress her by acting mature. But his immaturity shines throughhe doesn't have a clue what he's talking about half the time and when he tries to act smart she counters his moves with true brainpower. In a way this is the first time Tony realizes that women aren't as dumb as he thought they were.This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures for all the right and wrong reasons. The wrong reasons include the dance floor numbersI love them and I probably shouldn't. As for the right reasons...I think we already know what they are. It's all about dreams. Everyone has some. Whether it's dancing or whatever we all have dreams. And that's why I think Saturday Night Fever relates to so many different people on so many different levels.".

	onyx:emotionText "I love this movie.I love the way it focuses on dancing yet it isn't about dancing at all. Yes long amounts of time are given to showing John Travolta light up the dance floor but the story's fundamental point is the most subtle Trying to escape from your boring daily routine even if it is just for an hour.That's exactly what Tony Manero does. He saves up his weekly earnings from where he works in downtown Brooklyn at a crummy hardware store then blows it all in one day at the local disco joint where he reigns as king. His female dance partner calls him a walking clich. In a sad sort of way it's true.But this is Tony's dream. I quote an aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime. Saturday Night Fever is based entirely on this idea. In an odd sort of way Rupert Pupkin is a lot like Tony Manero. He just has a different dream. We all do.Saturday Night Live's theme tune Staying Alive the title of the horrendous Sylvester Stallonedirected sequel speaks as much truth about life as the film itself. I'm goin' nowhere somebody help me I'm goin' nowhere somebody help me yeah chants a voice in the Bee Gee's universally known disco hit. As I listen to it right now I realize just how perfect it is for the movie. It's a legendary song and for good reason.I didn't grow up during the disco generation. But Saturday Night Fever makes me feel as if I hadand that is one of the fundamental keys to a film so incredibly outdated and yet still poignant in our memories. It was the film that solidified John Travolta as an icon and the film that eventually led to him being regarded as the King of Cinema Disco. In the Travolta film Get Shorty a criminal threatens a producer by saying that if he doesn't pay up he'll be dead as disco. Ironic.Travolta is in his prime spotlight as Manero a Brooklyn kid aiming to make it big on the dance floor. There isn't much to the movie other than the need for fameas brief as it may beand the most obvious theme of the film which is learning to treat women as something more than just sex objects.Tony and his pals all join together at 2001 Odyssey a crummy disco club with dizzying strobe lights and a constantlywaxed dance floor where Tony is often encouraged to let loose and show everyone his moves. When he's not doing that he's sitting at the bar watching a topless stripper do her thing. And he's only 19.Part of this movie is learning to grow up and treat women as something more than Tony is used to treating them. But that's one of two primary plotsthe other is of course trying to break away from a boring life. Tony comes from an Italian background and he lives in a bad area of town. His mother is proud of her eldest son who became a priest and she's discouraged by the fact that her other son doesn't seem to care about making anything out of his life. We get the feeling that Tony's parents once had the same outlook as their son and fear he may be going down their own path. After Tony gets a raise from 3 to 4 his father tells him that 4 can't even buy 3. His son swears at him and storms away.Some of my favorite scenes in Saturday Night Live are the human ones such as when Tony stares in his bedroom mirror barechested and combs his hair forever looking over himself with the same pride that Travis Bickle displayed in the famous You talkin' to me? scene in Taxi Driver released a year earlier. In the background of the shot are posters of Al Pacino from Serpico and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. Just think Sly directed the sequel and did a cameo yet he was in a way in the first film too. I also like when Tony is interacting with his dysfunctional family.

While his quick study under Denny Terrio for those dance sequences showed a great deal of determination Travolta's Tony Manero shines in so many other way.  The looks of embarrassment and exasperation that his character expresses when confronted with the possibility of working in a Bay Ridge paint store all of his life or the prejudice and regional chauvinism of his friends or the behavior of his friends at White Castle or his initial inability to express himself to Stephanie in any way that might impress her all of these and more contribute to a fully realized character. While Tony's friends idolize him the movie never really does but it does allow empathy for his plight because even Tony realizes that he is virtually trapped by the current conditions of his existence.  While much might be made of the homophobia racism and misogyny of the protagonist and his friends these things are never excused and the movie goes to some lengths to express Tony's own recognition that these are shortcomings in not only his character but those borne of a provincial mentality which he desperately longs to escape.Forget those who call this a musical.

	schema:reviewBody "There are people who have seen this movie that have not been stoked by it see some user comments. Personally I can't understand this. I know that there are people who have different tastes and maybe some younger viewers will not be able to relate to it or appreciate it. However at the risk of sounding like a dick I can confidently say that those are people I would not want to know anyways. This is a film that does what great films are supposed to do that is to transcend our daily lives and bring us joy. There are a few films that can be called masterpieces because all the different film elements that are brought together have a unique quality and vision and the final result is something more special than the sum of the elements themselves. In a nutshell this is a simple story about a young Italian Brooklyn man Tony Manero from humble roots with a gift for dancing who dreams of something better against all odds. He escapes from it all out on the dance floor basking in the glow of the disco ball and the frivolous moving dance music. He meets another young woman at the danceclub Stephanie Modano played by an underrated Karen LynnGorney who is equal to him in dance ability and more importantly in desiring a better life. The two struggle together and against each other in their pursuit of winning a dance contest that may spur on their dreams.A simple story yes. One you've seen before yes. But after that there is no other film that can touch it. John Travolta as Tony was in his prime giving a performance that is so likeable because he is so normal. Who can't relate to a character who is so honest so cool so goofy so conflicted who has talent but doesn't get recognized by the people who should recognize him like his family only by his friends whom he knows deep down are all creeps? This is all of us!The soundtrack features some of the best disco music ever made in terms of making you feel joyous and impervious to the world's problems. Mostly contributed by The Bee Gees as well as others it is the essential element that makes the whole thing work.John Badham's direction is even giving the audience plenty of music and show stopping musical bits yet unafraid to lure you back to the grim reality of what our hero is always up against. But it's never heavy handed. The story is equal parts dramatic comedic exhilirating and pensive and moves along just as rhythmically as the music.In the end literally as well as figuratively Tony is more alone and unsure than ever in his ever changing world. And so it makes sense that he reaches out to Stephanie for love and support someone that has at least a little understanding of who he really is even if they can't be lovers. Simple realistic beautiful. The 70's was the true golden age of American cinema. It was the era of the auteur. Great minds like Scorsese Coppola Lucas Spielberg Badham and so forth had for a decade or so the ability to make truly visionary films in the sense that they had a lot of creative power to express themselves devoid of studio pressure political correctness marketing tieins and big budget sensory offending special effects. They laid it on the line. And we get to enjoy it for eternity.Attention younger viewers don't let the distorted lingering stereotype fool you. This isn't a cheesy film with John Travolta dancing like a clown to music that sucks. It is as good a film as you'll see if you can allow yourself to appreciate it as a real film. Disco music was once cutting edge before it sucked. John Travolta was actually a good dancer and actor and the story really does have depth.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few films can claim the status of creating a national international even phenomenon upon release but this one can. It offers a glimpse into the restless nowhere lives of a group of young Brooklyn men particularly Travolta an hourly employee in a paint store who burns off steam on the dance floor every weekend. At home he's considered worthless but in his favorite dance club he is monarch of all he surveys with men admiring him and women throwing themselves at him even offering to dab his sweaty brow! All important to him is an upcoming dance contest which he feels will propel him into another level of notoriety and prestige and he sets out to win it any way he can constantly practicing his slickest moves. Gorney plays a socialclimbing girl who has laid the ground work for getting out of Brooklyn and though she is attracted to Travolta is repulsed by the common qualities he represents. He becomes fascinated by her and considers her his way out of his current surroundings. Meanwhile Travolta's friends dabble in booze drugs sex and gang warfare as they wallow in the stew of their existence. It all builds up to the big night of the contest where things may not turn out as expected. Travolta is magnetic in this his first major film role. He worked tirelessly to perfect the dance moves which though at times look rather silly today are a highlight of the film. He also however brings much heart charisma and commitment to the dramatic side of his notalwayssympathetic character. Gorney who is easily a decade too old for her role is a good counterpoint to Travolta and ably embodies her tacky but desperatetochange character. She attempts to be as classy and refined as possible yet her accent and crackling chewing gum belies her past. Their somewhat complex relationship adds some depth to what could have been a very shallow film. Travolta's friends are played with much authenticity and verve. Oddly these actors continued with only marginally successful careers while Travolta went through the stratosphere. Another carefully etched performance is turned in by Pescow as one of Travolta's devoted followers. She goes a tad overboard near the end but otherwise presents a solid though pitiful characterization. She was one of the few actors in the film to achieve any sort of success afterwards and even that was limited. Gorney fell off the cinematic map entirely! Travolta's family is played by more believable and welltextured actors. The music of the film the soundtrack of which was one of the all time top sellers is inherent to the story and is a compilation of some of the best that disco had to offer though some might say even the best was still horrible! Even the Disco Sucks crowd cannot deny the impact that this film had on the country as it set trends everywhere. Interestingly some of the group numbers in the disco bear a striking similarity to the more recent country line dancing craze only with more arm movements. The language of the film is tough but necessary and realistic. There are two gutwrenchingly suspenseful scenes atop the Verrazano Narrows bridge. It's a time capsule of a hedonistic and freewheeling era preAIDS but with insightful examination of class structure and economic barriers the nature of friendship among young men and the cost of inhumanity towards one another. A rancid and ludicrous sequel which is good for some unintentional laughs can not tarnish the spirit of the original film which still holds up today.".

It all builds up to the big night of the contest where things may not turn out as expected. Travolta is magnetic in this his first major film role. He worked tirelessly to perfect the dance moves which though at times look rather silly today are a highlight of the film. He also however brings much heart charisma and commitment to the dramatic side of his notalwayssympathetic character. Gorney who is easily a decade too old for her role is a good counterpoint to Travolta and ably embodies her tacky but desperatetochange character. She attempts to be as classy and refined as possible yet her accent and crackling chewing gum belies her past. Their somewhat complex relationship adds some depth to what could have been a very shallow film. Travolta's friends are played with much authenticity and verve. Oddly these actors continued with only marginally successful careers while Travolta went through the stratosphere. Another carefully etched performance is turned in by Pescow as one of Travolta's devoted followers. She goes a tad overboard near the end but otherwise presents a solid though pitiful characterization. She was one of the few actors in the film to achieve any sort of success afterwards and even that was limited. Gorney fell off the cinematic map entirely! Travolta's family is played by more believable and welltextured actors. The music of the film the soundtrack of which was one of the all time top sellers is inherent to the story and is a compilation of some of the best that disco had to offer though some might say even the best was still horrible! Even the Disco Sucks crowd cannot deny the impact that this film had on the country as it set trends everywhere. Interestingly some of the group numbers in the disco bear a striking similarity to the more recent country line dancing craze only with more arm movements. The language of the film is tough but necessary and realistic. There are two gutwrenchingly suspenseful scenes atop the Verrazano Narrows bridge. It's a time capsule of a hedonistic and freewheeling era preAIDS but with insightful examination of class structure and economic barriers the nature of friendship among young men and the cost of inhumanity towards one another. A rancid and ludicrous sequel which is good for some unintentional laughs can not tarnish the spirit of the original film which still holds up today.";

Sad to say the film perfectly captures the emptiness and superficiality of that era and its negative impact on people's lives then and since.Back then it was all about how you looked and how you dressed how you danced and whether you scored. Who knew that the slim sleek svelte Travolta would balloon like Elvis Presley  just as all of us were fated to age lose our hair and expand our waists. The disco culture of the 70s was youthoriented but in a braindead way unlike the politically aware late 1960s antiwar youth culture.Saturday Night Fever sends mixed messages. Its soundtrack of BeeGees hits is a siren song of longing and romance yet the screenplay tells a different story. Tony Manero John Travolta rejects poor Annette Donna Pescow because she's short and dumpy and not good enough for him. Upwardly mobile Stephanie Karen Lynn Gorney spurns him in turn offering only the possibility of platonic friendship. Tony's friend Bobby gets his girlfriend pregnant but is too young and immature to assume his responsibilities. And all Tony's other friends care about is humping virtual strangers for ten minutes in the back seat of a car.Saturday night fever gives them nothing but Sunday morning hangover  without any Sunday morning spirituality to fill the void in their lives. Religion gets short shrift in this film. Tony's brother Frank leaves the priesthood not because he struggles with his faith but because he can't live up to his vow of celibacy. Even he has sex on the brain.Sex was the beall and endall of disco culture  witness the softcore shots of Travolta in nothing but lowrise briefs  and we have inherited its legacy. I say we because I too am a child of the 70s. For the next 25 years I lived according to the values I had learned on the dance floor. I worshipped at the shrine of youth and beauty and sex  and it left me as empty as the characters in the film. Like Tony Manero I found that the only cure for Saturday Night Fever was to escape that world and that life and leave all the beautiful losers behind.".

	schema:headline " The TAXI DRIVER of disco musicals";
	schema:reviewBody "I believe that Saturday NIGHT FEVER in its original 118 minute R version is genuinely one of the great dramas of the 70s a film so severe that I liken it to TAXI DRIVER in its relentless scathing depiction of NY life in the 70s. When first released in Australia in 1977 it was the full full on foul mouthed vicious version that I astonishingly saw in free to air TV in Sydney last night on a 9.30pm slot. This R version had not been seen here for almost 30 years and only existed in its PG re release that played endlessly as a double feature with GREASE thru the 80s. Amusingly that is exactly how it played last night with GREASE prior at 7.30pm. All that aside SNF with its scalding expose of the lives of these 20 somethings is a superb film and for all those moaning about it not being fun because it is a musical... well it is not supposed to be fun... it is a damning comment on the uneducated and ignorance of the lives depicted. If you seek a fun musical then see STEP UP which is NY similar but nowhere as courageous and fully realised as this film. In 1978 with underage fans screaming to be let in it was considered smart to cut 10 minutes out dub over all the swearing especially the two times Travolta says 'cnt' in the same sentence all the references and scenes to car sex... and make it PG friendly... and it certainly was a success. But if you want a Scorsese version as originally released and you can tell drama from drivel then this full R version is for you. I have never seen a better damning of an uneducated bunch of cruel insensitive people in any film... and if there is a moral to this cinematic thrashing... it is that if you are not educated then you will end up like this lot. Brit director John Badham has drawn well from the equally vicious portrayals seen in the 'kitchen sink' dramas made in Britain in the early 60s like Saturday Night And Sunday Morning or THIS SPORTING LIFE where the working class who are bogged in their ignorance keep returning to an emotional bruising cycle of behaviour until one just plain stops and looks at himself. Like Tony does in this film. I also believe the scene with Karen Lyn Gorney and Travolta in the empty apartment they consider renting is one of the great moments in any American film she is sitting on the window sill. This is a great film uncompromising in its depiction of that 'lifestyle' cornered through ignorant meanness into delusion and nowhere. Perfectly realised. then cut to a PG. See the original.".

Most of the people who have that attitude either have never sat down to watch the whole movie these people probably think Travolta wore the white suit throughout all 120 minutes of the film and think that the whole thing took place inside the discotheque or they've never seen the movie at all and have relied on what others say or they just loathe disco music and for these latter people there's not much that can be done.But if you look at the movie in its entiretythe R rated version preferably the PG version is too watered down and isn't the Real Thingyou will be surprised at just how genuinely involving and worthy the movie is. You will also be surprised by how great Travolta is. Yes he plays a character similar to his Vinnie Barbarino TV character in that both are Italian workingclass and native to Brooklyn but the similarities end there. While Barbarino is shallow and awkwardly cool Tony Manero is deep and smoothly hip while Barbarino is happygolucky Manero is seriously troubled and doubtful about many things while Barbarino is dimwitted Manero is not only streetsmart but also peoplesmart he sees right through his dance partner Stephanie's refined veneer and through his father's superior facade.The point here is that Travolta proved in SNF that he's the Real Dealnot just a pretty face or a good dancer or a comic actor but an ACTOR period. And the Oscar nomination he received for his performance is evidence of that. I personally don't think Travolta has given a performance since then which is as consistently ontarget nuanced and powerful as the one he gives in this movie and yes I'm including Pulp Fiction when I make that statement.I won't say much about the music because everybody knows by now how great and attentiongrabbing it is. But what doesn't get as much credit are the movie's director and story. John Badham nicely captures the energy of the disco especially in the LineDancingHustle scene at the halfhour point he gives the scene a dreamy quality complete with camera Dissolves and smoke and he's not afraid to take his time and let the scene play on. Anyone who's ever been on the dance floor knows that sensation the feeling that time has stopped and all that exists are you and the music.Many people have said that the movie's weakest aspect is its story. They say it's unnecessarily sordid ugly and disturbing. In fact the movie's original choice for directoranother John John G. Avildsendeclined to do the film because he felt the story was too downbeat. But I think the downbeat quality is just as necessary an ingredient of the story as its disco music. One of the movie's points is that Disco is an escape a multicolored paradise in which Tony Manero and everyone else for that matter can forget about the ugly unfair world patiently waiting for them outside. That's why Tony flips out toward the end at the dance contest when the Top Prize unfairly goes to him and Stephanie instead of to the more deserving Puerto Rican couple. He sees that the injustice of the outside world has pierced through the silver walls of the disco worlda world which he had always thought was too special pure and innocent to allow that inside and now that world has been tainted...with Reality.Another quality of the film that tends to get overlooked is the supporting acting. I'm surprised that most people have cited Karen Lynn Gorney's performance as being among the movie's weaknesses. I think people say that because Travolta's presence is so charismatic and overwhelming that her contribution has gotten eclipsed. But if you take a good look at her performance you'll see that she creates a convincing impressive portrait of a woman fiercely struggling with what she wants to be what she is and what she used to be. Gorney's Stephanie is a fascinating character a woman with a goddess' face but a Brooklynguttergirl's voice.I saw SNF when it first came outI was 5yearsold now I'm 30 and I will always remember the powerful effect the movie had on me. Even at age 5 I was surprised at how great Travolta was and how engrossing the story and music were.

Besides being the visual symbol of the disco era it is also the best filmed recollection of the post Dodgers era of Brooklyn which sad to say is still going on. Brooklyn does not have the Dodgers any more and in fact the 2001 club is no longer there but you can see a lot of the area that was photographed in Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton. I could even show you the places on tour.But it's the music and story of Saturday Night Fever that has made it an enduring classic. John Travolta left the sweathogs of Welcome Back Kotter and broke out as a major film star playing Tony Manero in this film. Travolta's a kid working at a paint store in a dead end job hanging out with his dead end friends who has only one great talent going for him. On Saturday night when he goes to the 2001 he's king of the dance floor. He can get just about any girl he wants and quite a few would like him especially Donna Pescow but Travolta's got his eye on Karen Lynn Gorney who is of Italian background like himself but has real career aspirations as a dancer. Travolta and Gorney agree to dance together but John just can't let it go at that.The only Oscar that Saturday Night Fever was nominated for was John Travolta as Best Actor. He lost that year to Richard Dreyfuss in The Goodbye Girl. Travolta does a great job in playing Tony Manero a kid who over the course of the film realizes there is a great big world out there beyond his neighborhood. A lot of things help convince him of that his involvement with Gorney his dancing his dead ending friends one of whom meets with real tragedy.Special mention should go to Barry Miller playing Bobby C one of the Travolta friends. He's such a sad case trying so desperately to belong with the crowd. They tolerate him basically because he's got the car and he takes the gang where they want to go. The Motion Picture Academy has committed some god awful blunders in its time. But one of the worst was its total nonrecognition of the music of the Gibb Brothers and the other music from Saturday Night Fever. Saturday Night Fever was incredibly not even nominated for Best Musical Score. Not one of the songs from the BeeGees and others was nominated for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture. The winner that year was You Light Up My Life a nice song but has never had the enduring popularity of any number of the BeeGee tunes like How Deep Is Your Love Staying Alive You Should Be Dancing or Night Fever.The Brooklyn shown in Saturday Night Fever is a Brooklyn that most grew up with. Only old codgers like myself remember the Dodgers but Saturday Night Fever is Brooklyn for the next couple of generations.".

	schema:headline " Not what it's supposed to be  and that's a good thing";
	schema:reviewBody "There are many many people who watch this movie for the first time expecting what pop culture remembers of it  disco a white suit a fun family dinner scene. There are many many people who watch this movie and come away horrified because of the frank depictions of racism sexism and sexual assault depictions that likely would not be in a major film today  and even at the time got the director fired from another project.This frankness leads to some objections to the film that I wholeheartedly disagree with such as it being sexist or that it slut shames Annette for being raped. The whole point of the that scene is that it's wrong that Annette to be raped. That even if she agreed while under the influence to run a train it's still terrible and disgusting. Tony shaming her is also supposed to be terrible. We aren't supposed to watch this scene and think what happens to her is fine or that Tony's reaction is fine. Tony and his friends live in a world where there is no such thing as racism or rape. It's all about them. It's all about getting what they can and blaming others who in their minds take it from them. They have fun they go out and dance but they are dying inside.Tony does not realize any of this about himself or his friends until he gets several system shocks meeting Stephanie his brother leaving the priesthood beating a better couple in a dance contest solely because he's white his friend's suicide. He slowly but surely sees that he is a racist a misogynist that he has an incredibly toxic relationship with his parents he has to escape from before he will never have an escape. This aspect of the film is timeless  watching this in 2014 you will understand as much as you would have in 1977 if not more. The performances are uniformly superb. Travolta gives a career best and a great deal of the film's appeal is based not only on his charisma and acting but on his refusal to allow Tony to be whitewashed as a character. Karen Lynn Gorney has the most difficult role in the film  a woman trapped between two worlds even as she takes Tony down the same path. She plays the soft moments but also plays the harsh condescending moments too. The scene where we meet her exboyfriend and realize he was educating her just as she's trying to educate her is one of the most poignant in the film because we see just how much of how she behaves with Tony is projection is a shell. Joseph Cali is also superb as he gives so many layers to a role that is ultimately only a symbol of Tony's breaking away not a character. His work in small but ultimately pivotal moments like his attempt to counsel Bobby initially treating him as something of a joke then genuinely trying yet still not getting it is so surprisingly complex. And he and Travolta have wonderful chemistry together. Donna Pescow takes a character we could easily dismiss the way the men in the film do and she breaks our hearts especially those closeups of her expressive eyes. Who else could make a scene with holding a bunch of condoms into such exquisite sorrow?The worst mistake the film makes is not handling Tony's attempted rape of Stephanie with more care. Deleted scenes suggest that the last scene in the film where he goes to her apartment to talk to her was darker in tone with Stephanie refusing to let him and his only getting into the building because someone opened the door to leave. The movie takes that out and leaves a somewhat hesitant Stephanie pledging to help Tony ...as a friend. The problem with this is it undercuts the ugliness of what he did especially as it had happened only a few hours before. It spoils what could have been a beautiful last scene and takes away from the other ambiguous moments in the film regarding sexism and rape that genuinely present this as bad and wrong.I strongly recommend this movie but please warn people not to just expect polyester and hip thrusts.".

	schema:reviewBody "1977's Saturday Night Fever is a movie that strongly resonates with a particular generation  mine. Five minutes of the movie brings it all back  the disco era the incredible Bee Gees music and the charm charisma and dance moves that was young John Travolta. If you were around then you'll remember the cultural explosion this film caused. It simply defined the era the way Flashdance an inferior film did in a smaller way with the off one shoulder sweatshirt and music.For me watching this movie has the added plus of being a film about Brooklyn made in Brooklyn and New York City where I lived. In fact a young woman in my dance class is kissed by Travolta as he walks into the club. I can still remember how excited she was talking about it in class.It's the era of platform shoes polyester shirts and big blowdried hair and in the midst of it is a young Brooklyn man Travolta who has a gifted natural ability for dance is surrounded by friends heading nowhere and ItalianAmerican parents who are afraid that he's just like his crowd. He finally realizes thanks to his relationship with his pretty uptown girl dance partner Stephanie Karen Lynn Gorney partly because of a tragedy and partly because of his talent that he needs to stretch himself and move beyond his friends and neighborhood. As Stephanie says to him You live with your parents you hang with your buddies and on Saturday nights you burn it all off at 2001 Odyssey. You're a clich. You're nowhere going' no place. As Tony Manero John Travolta is a sexy number with his swiveling hips and white suit and he has a neighborhood girl Donna Pescow in love with him as well as one of his friends Bobby Barry Miller who's gay and doesn't know it but always shows off for Tony and cries when Tony doesn't call him.I love what Roger Ebert says about the effect of this film which was his review partner Gene Siskel's favorite We all have a powerful memory of the person we were at that moment when we formed a vision for our lives. Tony Manero stands poised precisely at that moment. He makes mistakes he fumbles he says the wrong things but when he does what he loves he feels a special grace. Directed with both realism and romance by John Badham Saturday Night Fever especially for those of us who were young during the disco era holds a very special place.".

To me this movie never evoked any interest because I don't find anything interesting about disco dancing and I don't think John Travolta is the most fetching actor in the world. Clearly he hasn't exactly had the most enviable career. But Saturday Night Fever is not about dancing there is just so much more to it.There can be no doubt about the irony of Travolta starring in a film in which he is the best dancer in town while he is at the height of his awkward youth but like I said the movie is not just about dancing. The dancing is a backdrop for a much deeper meaning. The movie has violence blood death crime sex nudity everything that you would almost automatically expect to be absent from a film like this. I thought it was going to be some goofy romance made goofy by Travolta of course. Can you even imagine him in a romantic comedy? I mean it has romance but the movie is so much more.Saturday Night Fever is a very realist film about a young Italian kid who lives in a rundown neighborhood in Brooklyn and who is trying to find meaning in his life which is virtually meaningless when he is off the dance floor. He has a crappy job no education beyond high school an unhappy life at home and no prospects for the future. His concept of the future is what he's going to wear to the dance hall charmingly named 2001 Odyssey on Saturday night. Clearly outside the dance hall he is not the hero that he is on the dance floor. Early in the film Tony Travolta is walking down the street and he runs back to talk to a girl that he walked past and she blows him off seeming to be annoyed by him which is weird because who could resist a disco stud carrying a paint can!. Yet when he is at the dance hall the crowd parts for him girls ask if they can wipe the sweat off his forehead he is the king.The costumes are excellent from the first frames of the film that show Tony walking down the street in his hilariously disco outfit and all throughout the film. I remember one scene where one of Tony's geeky friends Bobby lets Tony borrow his car and then as Bobby walks away you can see that he has on what have to be the most ludicrous disco shoes ever created. Tony's meticulous care about his outfit is made clear when he wears a sheet wrapped around himself to the dinner table and then gets upset not that his father hit him but that he hit his HAIR. I spend a lot of time on my hair and you hit it.' However no matter how hard he tries he does NOT look like Al Pacino.spoilers But on a deeper level Saturday Night Fever has to do with everything from doing what you want to do with your own life to loyalty among friends to religious persecution and hypocrisy. There is also some substantial symbolism in that bridge that Tony knows so much about and which Bobby doesn't seem to have been mature enough to cross late in the film. It's a dog eat dog world' and Saturday Night Fever uses dancing as only one among many techniques to deliver that message. The film is dated in many ways but it remains a landmark film especially concerning the Italian experience in America in the 70s and is definitely worth a look.".

Perhaps if I'd seen it during its heyday it would have carried more weight but when disengaged from the giddy heights of the disco era it does not travel well. This is basically 'Scorcese lite' a sort of 'Mean Streets' done for teens and missing out almost everything which made Scorcese's work so compelling. The viewer is faced with a parade of characters so stupid selfcentred and underdeveloped that it is virtually impossible to bond with any of them. Tony Manero is an idiot and his friends are even more moronic whilst the girls are doormats nicebutdim Annette or emotionally distant egotists brash bigtalking Stephanie. Add to this some downright unfathomable casting Martin Shakar looks more like Tony's uncle than his brother seriously he looks a good ten years older and whilst cast as Tony's crucial dance partner Karen Lynn Gorney's ability is conspicuously 'school lunchtime disco'. Check the bit at the dance studio where she and Tony converse whilst she's practicing it looks like she's been learning to dance for all of twenty minutes. Having said that the dance scenes themselves are the high point of the movie even if they are all Tony's show. In fact there is an uncomfortable strand of narcissism and outright homoeroticism to 'SNF' which is all in keeping with the essentially nonmacho disco scene. With its falsetto vocals elaborate studiobound arrangements and invariably sexobsessed lyrics the music was made by producers not neighbourhood bands and the emphasis was on glitter and flash not grit and trash. The dance scene's flamboyant exhibitionist nature was far more intune with 'gay' sensibilities than the world of rock music and so it was that disco suffered a boomandbust popularity over the late 1970s. 'Straight' society briefly sampled what the movement had to offer and then moved on to more genderfriendly cultural climes. By 1979 it was all over and 'new wave' music was all the rage. Considerations of personal taste aside 'SNF' is less than the sum of its parts clumsily realised with characters who come far too close to being repellent without any redemptive qualities. It is all too apparently a vehicle for John Travolta who served notice with his performance that his entire career would be based on slight variations on his 'Vinnie Barbarino' character from 'Welcome Back Kotter'. He struts solipsistically through 'SNF' wearing the exact same expression you see staring blankly back at you from a fishshop window. Away from the dance floor he could not carry the movie which is a massive weak point since none of the other characters are as extensively written. By all means watch 'SNF' for nostalgia for the dancing or the music or the actors but not as a movie experience because you will be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen and has since then stood as my alltime favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words 'I believe in America' it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's threshold. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film and believe me there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man he is a criminal he is a mafioso but above all he is a respected family man his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors James Caan John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry including a certain horse's head 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen whilst they are villains the audience will refuse to accept that fact Coppola does something simple and audacious he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography memorable musical scores and wellpaced action and drama. Overall The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right a gangster flick that is overflowing with life rich with emotion and subtle acting and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.".

	schema:headline " Another kind of family movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction to the acting to the storyline to the score The Godfather has the word classic written all over and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or redefined a genre as much as this one did for gangster movies but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every organized crime film nowadays almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The ItalianAmerican old mobster ala Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply influential is to diminish its true qualities and so is to describe it simply as a movie about gangsters. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around despite the fact that the word is never mentioned but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us on how moral values appear different from different point of views on how violence can destroy a human soul and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex threedimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino the performances by Robert Duvall James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen Santino Corleone and Kay Adams the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri  as well as more than a few other roles  are all perfect for the movie and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiplestoryline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter Connie Talia Shire. Don Corleone is a powerful man and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends from the regular worker in a neighborhood to the immensely popular singer to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy some are not but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However this is 1946 times are changing and to many of the younger people working in the crime business Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business narcotics is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up selfdestroying while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter will ignite a war that will cost many lives and that will see Michael Corleone Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business lose his innocence and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance and  believe it or not  there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension various twists and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo the book the film is based on could be an expos of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane  for instance was based on Frank Sinatra's real life and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that frankly I have no idea whether these voices are reliable although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction to the acting to the storyline to the score The Godfather has the word classic written all over and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or redefined a genre as much as this one did for gangster movies but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every organized crime film nowadays almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The ItalianAmerican old mobster ala Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply influential is to diminish its true qualities and so is to describe it simply as a movie about gangsters. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around despite the fact that the word is never mentioned but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us on how moral values appear different from different point of views on how violence can destroy a human soul and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex threedimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino the performances by Robert Duvall James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen Santino Corleone and Kay Adams the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri  as well as more than a few other roles  are all perfect for the movie and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiplestoryline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter Connie Talia Shire. Don Corleone is a powerful man and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends from the regular worker in a neighborhood to the immensely popular singer to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy some are not but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However this is 1946 times are changing and to many of the younger people working in the crime business Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business narcotics is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up selfdestroying while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye.

	schema:reviewBody "Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing what else could you say. What could be more appealing to peopleeven today than watching actors like Al Pacino Marlon Brando James Caan Diane Keaton Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich. His performance though was not a clich. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own innerbattles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head the scene of Brando running with his groceries the coffee shop scene I'll give him an offer he can't refuse and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies commercials etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.".

	schema:headline " Initially I wasn't a fan... but then I realised";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially I didn't like this film all that much  I found it rather overhyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard read every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this take the following pointers on board 1 Contrasting Characters Good films have some character distinction but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course there are exceptions to rule ie... where you want monotonal characters... aka matrix or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element but ultimately this is what makes films deep meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool rational and collected whereas Sonny is more hotheaded spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters  place them in situations  and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2 Transformation The central characters must undergo a transformation resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again many films try but most fail because they come up with unreal literally not praisingly or simply moronic transformations eg Wall Street.3 Patience Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason  it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time  time developing characters family life growth patience with the story telling in general. This is the key provided that the story isn't mindnumbingly boring. Dances with Wolves Heat.. and so on are very patient but topclass films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous rewatchability.".

The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching The Godfather is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film that's so ambitious and so grand down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor family respect and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone Marlon Brando for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight untouchable or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito are of Vito crying over his son Sonny's James Caan death. When Michael learns of the news he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter Connie Talia Shire and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other drinking laughing and sitting next to each other to show how close they are then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family and surprisingly Michael Al Pacino along with his girlfriend Kay Diane Keaton on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen Robert Duvall is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay and they include That's my family Kay. That's not me. We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name This is what makes Al Pacino' role significantly the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to by films end head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated not with respect but as an outsider too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage Fredo John Cazale get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here too as we watch from Fredo's height looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes that have so much going on behind them and simply says Fredo don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father Vito has a soft spot for his children admittedly so as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line It's strictly business when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister Connie calls him a cold hearted bastard at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing great acting and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like The Godfather that made me wish I had amnesia so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.".

	schema:headline " A film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972 the gangster genre chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties had been in something of a decline. It was therefore a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a threehour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate postwar period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn however that times are changing even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families however are eager for the profits to be made from drugs and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses ostensibly for business reasons but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo offended orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons Santino 'Sonny' Fredo and Michael and an adopted son Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hotheaded and impetuous Fredo weak Tom cautious and moderate. Michael the youngest loves his family but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his AngloSaxon wifetobe Kay. The attempt on his father's life however persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear Michael a good man corrupted by power of Macbeth a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy. There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind this was Marlon Brando's last great role I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris' but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man but he is also in a way a magnificent one and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II' I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' as his brother calls him to a warlord from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' which did win is more showy and a technical tour de force but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hotheaded Sonny. This is not a perfect film it has flaws both artistic and ethical. Artistically there are places where it tends to drag particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey and even more so after the killing of Sonny although it recovers at the ending which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out this is a film which views a closed society from the inside the only outsider is Kay and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say however that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty are careful to pay lipservice to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film indeed throughout the trilogy as a whole the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. 'The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism. It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity especially at the end of the film. Michael already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film and although I personally would not have ranked it as my alltime favourite there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 810".

We soon learn however that times are changing even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families however are eager for the profits to be made from drugs and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses ostensibly for business reasons but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo offended orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons Santino 'Sonny' Fredo and Michael and an adopted son Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hotheaded and impetuous Fredo weak Tom cautious and moderate. Michael the youngest loves his family but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his AngloSaxon wifetobe Kay. The attempt on his father's life however persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear Michael a good man corrupted by power of Macbeth a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy. There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind this was Marlon Brando's last great role I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris' but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man but he is also in a way a magnificent one and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II' I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' as his brother calls him to a warlord from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' which did win is more showy and a technical tour de force but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hotheaded Sonny. This is not a perfect film it has flaws both artistic and ethical. Artistically there are places where it tends to drag particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey and even more so after the killing of Sonny although it recovers at the ending which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out this is a film which views a closed society from the inside the only outsider is Kay and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say however that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty are careful to pay lipservice to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film indeed throughout the trilogy as a whole the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. 'The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism. It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity especially at the end of the film. Michael already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film and although I personally would not have ranked it as my alltime favourite there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone head of perhaps the most powerful New Yorkarea mafia family in the 1940s in this wellrespected film by directorwriter Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins Vito is receiving business guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's Talia Shire wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years telling the story of Vito his familyincluding Michael Al Pacino Santino James Caan and Tom Hagen Robert Duvall his associates and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. Even though I've given it a 10 I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years and for me Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate it is definitely mustsee viewingeven if it's only because it's so highly regardedif you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings The Godfather is sprawling and soapoperatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo who also cowrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of charactersmaybe too large as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying Wait who is that guy supposed to be again? The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soapoperatic stories but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root though The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through lifeincluding marriages births adultery spats between family members tiffs with others in their community and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me it and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer 2001 which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However although Ichi's violence is effective setting that knob to 11 doesn't make it better. Besides Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of oscillating dynamics in the family with the pole pairs being interactingdistancing controllack of control benevolencemalevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics and everyone dances around the poles so to speak throughout the film. From this angle even the attractive surface violence well attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving a dynamic equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10 also. The most obvious which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino Marlon Brando Robert Duvall James Caan Diane Keaton and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening for example consists of a long it lasts a few minutes zoom out from Amerigo Bonasera Salvatore Corsitto. The shot is beautifully litmost of the frame is extremely dark giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character.Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about but if you keep this in mind while watching you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag wind to a focal point and so on all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the greatest film of all time hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast and keep in mind that it's as much a historical family saga as a crime or gangster film.".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing The Godfather' is the sense that as a viewer you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie but not necessarily great nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question  the acting. Judged on that scale alone it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted this film can be boring at times. Most notably at least for me was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married it doesn't really show him doing much of anything nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast the book made this particular subplot far more interesting and relevant.And that at heart is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example in the film Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi another character who is developed far more fully in the book.So there you have it. On the one hand you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film but on the other I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect I much more preferred Goodfellas. The acting wasn't as good but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short The Godfather' is sort of like a great but somber piece of music something you can admire but not dance to.810".

Who knew at that time that this bunch of Sicilian emigrants would occupy a high place in the United States and in the history of this country.Sicily is one of the most beautiful places in Italy. Unfortunately Sicilians quite friendly inhabitants of this island the wordssynonyms of Sicily are not only olives butter and wine but also words like omerta vendetta and mafia. Yes the mafia. A small bunch of bandit mackerel in Sicily run by the Don. In the US this word took a slightly different meaning. A huge number of gangsters who seek to conquer and rule all the States. A family is a mafia a mafia is a family headed by a cruel and wise person who manages everything and who owns everything. Proudly and shortly  don.Mario Puzo is a brilliant writer rightly considered to be a recognized classic of the twentiethcentury literature having written several excellent and worthy works the best of which is undoubtedly the novel The Godfather. A book about the life of gangsters and revealing all the doors to the world of the mafia. Mario Puzo was a great connoisseur of human psychology but the psychology of people who transgressed the law especially. That is why in his novel he explores each character to the depths of his soul and climbs into the most intimate corners of their thoughts.The novel and indeed the film  is not a direct and reliable historical source but nevertheless it contains the quintessence of the criminal world. Five families of New York Piuso wrote from the real five families of New York Johnny Fontaine Puzo wrote from Frank Sinatra. The literature was tired of books about Al Capone and Frank Costello and Puzo made a move to a horseinvented a criminal family that was not really there but which subsequently won without exaggeration the whole world.It often happens that the director when stating a picture leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature and Francis Ford Coppola created the film  a masterpiece a film  a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties but also the atmosphere of family life the life of people from Sicily.Vito Carleone is a wise and cruel man with clear principles a loving but stern father. Marlon Brando was just awesome donaCarleone. His character is a serious strategist who has achieved power and respect himself. Don Carleone's sad gaze his smooth gestures his unique voice and his unforgettable bulldog jaw forever blended into the image of the viewer.Don Carleone  this is Marlon Brando  sloven and lover in life but on the screen  a genius who embodied the image of Don Carleone  a strong spirit of a man and a cruel gangster who has enormous authority. Vito Carleone is a very impressive person who knew how to get others to do things their own way. Marlon Brando with his game was able to make the viewer believe that before him is not just an actor playing a role but a real person is that same severe don. Brando is a great improvisator.Michael Carleone character is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kindhearted and truthful knowing what his father does he never wanted to deal with his family and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliant than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed all the destruction of the human psyche and the transformation of his hero from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family of the young war hero to the new Don Carleone possessing an iron will foresight wisdom and dignity.Sonny Carleone is not at all like Michael and Vito. He is an impulsive warrior but a bad strategist who prefers to go ahead not act cunning. Coppola did not lose on the fact that he called for the role of an American from Sicily. James Caan brilliantly played the role of Sonny  a man with an explosive Italian temperament ready to always stand up for the family.In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production in the film there is the wonderful music of the composer Nina Rota. An excellent melody fallen in love with everyone and has long become a classic.Godfather is a masterpiece an ideal gangster movie. The film without minuses blunders and cliches which pulls to review even if you know it by heart. This is a classic a gangster epic a bible for cinephiles giving answers to all the questions. A movie that teems with crown phrases that have long since become part of everyday life. A worthy picture without exaggeration is the best in its kind.Behind every wealth lies a crime c  it is this phrase Honore De Balzac stands at the beginning of the work of Puzo. The film if briefly actually about it. And about the proposal from which you can not refuse c.".

The glowing reviews it gets everywhere many of course calling it the best movie ever made gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought The Godfather was a good movie but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made not even one of the greatest. It was good worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the postwar era seemed realistic enough and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long but it did demonstrate that Corleone's business never ended  he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando of course won and refused to accept the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino as Corleone's son Mike was I thought far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had  to me  an almost cartoonish aura around him. Overrated in my view. But Pacino was excellent and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family business to the eventual Don.It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.610".

This film is a physically painful experience. This film consists of the BAD jokes from Marley  Me. The difference is Marley  Me was touching and funny and cute. This is horrible. No more words to fit this. HORRIBLE! The horrible scene that sticks out the most is the dancing dogs sequence that features a ton of dogs dancing around to music in a park. I just saw a preview for this film on TV and the song Tik Tok was playing during it. Tik Tok during a dog film commercial. The writing is horrible the acting is horrible the effects are horrible the jokes are horrible the music is horrible EVERY SINGLE LAST THING IS HORRIBLE! I did not apply a rating to this review as 1 is too good for this.EDIT Under pressure from somebody I watched the film in theaters to see if anything was different. I was wrong...

	schema:reviewBody "The funniest joke in the longawaited liveactionCGI adaptation of everyone's secondleast favourite comic strip Marmaduke is actually intentional which is kind of impressive. Of course it's not funny in the way that the filmmakers intended it to be funny so that's too bad I guess but it is actually a joke that is actually funny. Some connection had been made through the layers of awful script and boring staging and legitimately creepy CGI. They intended to make me laugh when they had the mean dog Bosco call out our OwenWilsonvoiced hero in the middle of the hero's crowning moment a big raucous O.C. rager of a party icing our dog out with a growled Marmaduke? More like Marmafake. And they did.I laughed I admit it. Marmapuke Marmapoop Marmadreck there's a lot of ways the screenwriters could have gone and they chose Marmafake whichwell doggone it it doesn't even rhyme. Notes I also laughed when the filmmakers seeking to set the tone after Marmaduke  family's big crosscountry move to the O.C. from Kansas so the dad Lee Pace could work for a dogfood company with a mean boss William H. Macy for some inexplicable reason by mixing California by Phantom Planet almost directly into California Love by 2Pac. I assume they'd spent all the soundtrack licensing money by that point because they left out California by Belinda Carlisle and California by John Mayall and California by Joni Mitchell and Going back to California by L.L. Cool J and Hotel California by the Eagles. Too bad. Anyway Marmaduke is we're told a big gangly goofy dog played by two or more real dogs in the film that talks with a creepy CGI animated mouth. I'm pretty sure at least that they used more than one dog because sometimes Marmaduke has a big dangly pair of testicles and sometimes he doesn't which is obviously problematic and I started thinking while onscreen Marmaduke was having another interminable dialogue session with some other dog about something that to so brazenly as filmmakers use dogs with varying levels of testiclehavingness is kind of bold almost as if they're saying Yeah sometimes 'duke's got nuts and sometimes he doesn't. We don't care because nobody will notice and if they do notice it's because you're a perverted weirdo who both looks at and notes dog's nuts. Which left me feeling vaguely insulted and terribly aggrieved. So Marmaduke has some friends that are dogs and some enemies and he makes some mistakes and eventually gets sad and runs away from his family and his haughty girlfriend voiced by Fergie from the BlackEyed Peas who is actually a better voice actor than she is a singer. Marmaduke then falls into a sinkhole along with another funnylooking but faithful and nice dog voice of Emma Stone and then or perhaps before then there is a dogsurfing championship and everything is fine even the subplots about 'duke's dad's mean boss and his kid that hates soccer. Kids might like it but I doubt it as aside from being creepy and awkward and really poorly plotted it's just dull. One of the first thing they teach you in screen writing school is show don't tell that expository dialogue is a nono and narrators all the more so. But dogs can't really act and they don't really do anything except run around and eat sandwiches so for the film to have a narrative structure the dogs have to talk a lot explaining everything and because dogs don't drive or frame houses or fold clothes they talk while just standing there looking around. It's hellaciously boring but probably unavoidable as Marmaduke is clearly an intellectual property that fans have literally been screeching and rending their clothes to see brought to the big screen and given the ol' Hollywood treatment. I don't have anything more to say about Marmaduke. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Since I'm a big dog lover and I loved 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' I had great expectations for 'Marmaduke'. It's based on a wellknown comic strip but isn't as intense as 'Chihuahua'. The plot focuses on Phil a marketing consultant who moves his family from Kansas to Orange County California after being hired by Don Twombly William H. Macy owner of Bark Organics a new age pet food company. Phil owns the star of the film a Great Dane named Marmaduke who speaks to the film audience but cannot be heard by the characters in the film. Marmaduke the film is less sophisticated than 'Chihuahua' since its human antagonist Twombly is a wacky passiveaggressive type as opposed to the more realistic sinister gang memberdog napper in Beverly Hills Chihuahua BHC.Just like in BHC Marmaduke our dog protagonist is opposed by an aggressive and intimidating canine Bosco a Beauceron. Phil's internal arc is linked to Marmaduke's as they both make the mistake of becoming social climbers and turn their back on family and friends. In Phil's case he comes up with an ad campaign involving a dog surfing contest designed to attract Petco as a possible buyer of Bark Organic pet food. Phil becomes so involved in his job that he doesn't pay enough attention to his children.Meanwhile Marmaduke is trying to impress Bosco's girlfriend a beautiful collie named Jezebel by staging a fight with his cat friend Carlos at a dog park George Lopez voices Carlos and also can be heard as a canine sidekick in BHC. Soon afterward Marmaduke wins the dog surfing contest but alienates the Petco executives when he gets into a fight with Bosco.Things only get worse for the human and dog protagonists. Marmaduke's mixed breed friends which include Mazie who jealously watches from afar when Marmaduke goes on a 'dream date' with Jezebel Raisin a brainy Dachshund with an English accent and Giuseppe a fearful Chinese crested pooch boycott the party he throws for the pedigree dogs from the dog park. After Bosco exposes the link between Carlos and Marmaduke the uppity pedigree dogs led by Bosco trash Phil's house and leave Marmaduke with a shattered ego. Crushed by the rejection by those who he considered his friends Marmaduke runs off to the woods where he meets a dog in the wild Chupadogra an old English Mastiff who is reputed to have killed his owner.Chupadogra reinforces the theme of the movie never judge a book by its cover. Chupadogra in actuality was the leader of a pack of strays who abandoned him. He's not as scary once you get to know him and ends up saving Marmaduke by chasing off a rather unpleasant dog catcher. Meanwhile Phil returns from his workvacation and promptly drops his laptop in the backyard pool which contains his final ad campaign to woo Petco.Phil finally realizes that he has betrayed his values and tells Don he can't attend the big meeting with Petco since he has to find the lost Marmaduke. In a dramatic denouement Phil saves Marmaduke from drowning after he falls into a rainwater conduit and is swept away by raging waters. Marmaduke too sees the light by returning to the dog park speaks out against prejudice he argues mixed breeds are just as good as pedigrees and wins over all the dogs except for Bosco who exits vowing revenge.Unlike BHC where I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes 'Marmaduke' will not have you rolling on the floor. A lot of the jokes are pretty corny especially the bit about Marmaduke farting. Nonetheless at its core 'Marmaduke' has a positive message in its rejection of careerism and the need for tolerance between people who come from diverse backgrounds.".

Crushed by the rejection by those who he considered his friends Marmaduke runs off to the woods where he meets a dog in the wild Chupadogra an old English Mastiff who is reputed to have killed his owner.Chupadogra reinforces the theme of the movie never judge a book by its cover. Chupadogra in actuality was the leader of a pack of strays who abandoned him. He's not as scary once you get to know him and ends up saving Marmaduke by chasing off a rather unpleasant dog catcher. Meanwhile Phil returns from his workvacation and promptly drops his laptop in the backyard pool which contains his final ad campaign to woo Petco.Phil finally realizes that he has betrayed his values and tells Don he can't attend the big meeting with Petco since he has to find the lost Marmaduke. In a dramatic denouement Phil saves Marmaduke from drowning after he falls into a rainwater conduit and is swept away by raging waters. Marmaduke too sees the light by returning to the dog park speaks out against prejudice he argues mixed breeds are just as good as pedigrees and wins over all the dogs except for Bosco who exits vowing revenge.Unlike BHC where I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes 'Marmaduke' will not have you rolling on the floor. A lot of the jokes are pretty corny especially the bit about Marmaduke farting. Nonetheless at its core 'Marmaduke' has a positive message in its rejection of careerism and the need for tolerance between people who come from diverse backgrounds.";

I knew that this movie was going to suck when I saw the trailer and the promos with the dogs dancing in the park but then I saw it in theaters and I don't even know if I can fit all of the problems in this review but here it goes 1 The jokes were horrible. Unfunny oneliners and word plays and surprise surprise cheesy fart sound effects used in so many movies it has become recognizable have been placed around almost every corner so be sure to watch out. 2 The acting was awful. Owen Wilson has no personality he rarely does in any movie I am sorry to say the voiceovers by the rest of the cast were either bad or mediocre but the the thing that set the record for me was Lee Page. My God he overacted all the time mainly whenever he yelled Marmaduke NO! A stalk of corn could be acting and it would still be less corny than Lee Page in his role. And 3 Wow can you say low budget? When I saw the movie I thought it couldn't get any worse but it did the dancing dogs. The really sad thing was it looked bad in the promos but it was even worse in theaters. The dogs looked so fake and cheesy when they were dancing and I would love to know what the producer was thinking when he thought that would be a good scene to put in the movie. The CGI animation just looked so low budget that it just ruined the movie. Well I did the best I could. I probably did not list all the ones I wanted but oh well. And before anyone says that it's just a kids movie and that I should cut it some slack they should keep quiet. Just because it's a kids movie does not mean it can't suck. Up was a kids movie and it was great. Furry Vengeance was a kids movie and it was horrible. There is a difference. I rate this movie with a 1 out of 10 and the only thing keeping it from being a zero is because of the all star cast. Other than that stay away from this movie. There are only two uses I can think of for this movie if you have a table that keeps wobbling by a DVD to put under it so it'll stop or if you have ingested poison and need to induce vomiting watch the dog dance sequence over and over. So avoid this movie like dog poop on the sidewalk.".

I also could not believe how dull the incredibly talented Lee Pace and the incredibly talented William H. Macy were in this. The film is a plot less mess trying to claim itself as a movie but failing miserably. It's too mean spirited with jokes about dogs getting high for kids and too immature with jokes about dogs farting for adults. There's really no audience for this film unless some other planet finds all this stuff funny. If you are ever to use this movie for anything break the DVD where you're mad. Everyone involved in this project talented or not should be ashamed of themselves for being in this terrible film. Even if you've read the comic strip there's no nostalgia or entertainment value here as they have turned it into modernized crap.

	schema:reviewBody "Marmaduke is a great family movie for viewers of all ages. I went to see it with my 19 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it! Of course we are dog lovers and maybe a little biased.The movie centers around Marmaduke and his human family the Winslow's. The family is moving from Kansas to California for a job opportunity that Phil Winslow was presented with. Marmaduke struggles to make new friends and to find somewhere to fit in just as the two older Winslow children Barbra and Brian who encounter these very same issues. They all miss their old lives and friends back in Kansas but they eventually adjust and want to stay in their new home.The filmmaker does a good job at portraying Marmaduke as humanlike as possible and captures the typical mischievous Marmaduke that you would remember from the comic strip. He jumps out the bath tub flinging water throughout the house drags Phil eats food off the counter has a party and trashes the house chews up shoes and farts in bed. All classic behavior for Marmaduke.What I liked most was the humanlike behavior that was displayed by the animals. Marmaduke's party has to be one of my favorite parts of the movie. There are dogs jumping off the roof into the pool spraying silly string and there is one dog sleeping on the front lawn. Typical teenage behavior. Another good scene is Marmaduke and Jezebel having a romantic evening at the junk yard. They are sitting on a blanket sharing a jar of peanut butter and Marvin Gay's Lets Get It On is playing in the background. Hysterical! The dialog between the dogs is very cute and creative. There are many oneliner's that incorporate dog behavior and their likes and dislikes in some of their conversations. In one scene when Marmaduke is forced into a surfing competition he tries to calm himself by thinking happy thoughts of open meadows and peeing on everything. Typical dog behavior. There was also a scene when Mazie was showing him around the dog park and telling him about the various dog cliques. She described one group as rich snobs that think their fleas don't bite. Too funny! The overall animation of the film was pretty good and created a believable effect of animals taking to each other. However the scene at the end of the movie where the dogs are dancing in the park could have been a bit better to make their actions look less computergenerated. The movie Scooby Doo had similar issues. Regardless I still love both movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who don't know Marmaduke was originally a newspaper single panel cartoon strip involving the misadventures of an accidentprone Great Dane and his family. Translated to the big screen this becomes a combination of live action animatronics puppetry and CGI with the animals talking to each other and Marmaduke himself voiced by Owen Wilson breaking the fourth wall by addressing the audience directly.The story involves Marmaduke's family moving from Kansas to California and Marmaduke becoming involved in a dog version of the new kid in school being seduced by the snobby clique and not recognising that his real friends are the uncool ones We've seen it in a thousand teen comedies Mean Girls leaps to mind and it's a new wrinkle to see it applied to pedigree dogs vs. mutts and the key element here is that the dogs mainly behave like people although they also act like dogs when it suits the filmmakers.There's also a subplot about Marmaduke's owner's difficulties in a new job and the kids' problems with fitting in.This is a good kids' film. There's some decent slapstick a couple of dog fart jokes some excitement and enough plot movement to hold the interest. The CGI is mostly well done the voice talent is fine the script is light and amusing the moral lessons are delivered fairly subtly but don't make the mistake of thinking this is a movie for adults it isn't and it will drive you wild wondering why everyone in California lets their animals to wander public places 247 and why Marmaduke's family has a permanently unlocked dogdoor which is big enough to admit burglars!".

Translated to the big screen this becomes a combination of live action animatronics puppetry and CGI with the animals talking to each other and Marmaduke himself voiced by Owen Wilson breaking the fourth wall by addressing the audience directly.The story involves Marmaduke's family moving from Kansas to California and Marmaduke becoming involved in a dog version of the new kid in school being seduced by the snobby clique and not recognising that his real friends are the uncool ones We've seen it in a thousand teen comedies Mean Girls leaps to mind and it's a new wrinkle to see it applied to pedigree dogs vs. mutts and the key element here is that the dogs mainly behave like people although they also act like dogs when it suits the filmmakers.There's also a subplot about Marmaduke's owner's difficulties in a new job and the kids' problems with fitting in.This is a good kids' film. There's some decent slapstick a couple of dog fart jokes some excitement and enough plot movement to hold the interest. The CGI is mostly well done the voice talent is fine the script is light and amusing the moral lessons are delivered fairly subtly but don't make the mistake of thinking this is a movie for adults it isn't and it will drive you wild wondering why everyone in California lets their animals to wander public places 247 and why Marmaduke's family has a permanently unlocked dogdoor which is big enough to admit burglars!";

Now I am a sucker for a talking dog movie and this being school holidays in Australia it was the perfect opportunity for my 5 year old son and I to go and see this great talking dog movie. We laughed from the minute it started we ooh'd and aaah'd at the cute bits and generally had a lot of fun watching it. I must admit I was expecting a real dud from the reviews but Marmaduke isn't one. It's wonderful for kids and wonderful for any dog owner who finds humor in their canines. If you fail to laugh at a great Dane sleeping in his owners' bed and farting when they embrace then you are a very serious grumpy soul who needs to lighten up. My son is still talking about those farts hours later! Come on this movie isn't going to win any Oscars and yes its corny a wee bit predictable but its the sort of kids movie we grew up with. Some kids movies like UP and even Toy Story 3 are too complicated and involved for young children  this simple tale is just the ticket. Love you Marmaduke and all your dog park friends too.".

We're talking about the same studio that flawlessly reconstructed the dated Garfield and SO last decade Alvin  the Chipmunks to fit into this fresher generation of modernized teen lingo consistent pop culture references and omitting an occasional bodily humor gag every now and then every two minutes can be considered occasional right?. I'm happy to say that this is a worthy new addition to the gang that I go as far as to hold on par with Mike Myer's glorious Cat in the Hat.First of all you have to appreciate the man who helmed it all Tom Dey for establishing a brave new look towards the characteristics of a beloved cartoon canine. All he really had to pick was a flashier setting increase the obliviousness of his human companions maybe add the most hip pop songs on Billboard's Top 100 during a montage OHhe also may have also added more ignorance to his personality. But that's okay out of all the things they could have forgotten I'm grateful they've maintained the premise of destructive slapstickreliant Great Dane. Once I saw that pack of computeranimated dogs dancing in unison to What I Like About You I realized this would be the most criminally misunderstood thing Dey had ever captured on film since Terry Bradshaw's rear end.Major kudos also goes out Owen Wilson for FINALLY picking a wellmeaning dog movie this time around. Marley and Me was idiotically under the impression you could show the shenanigans of a household pet every once in a while but spend the rest of the time observing serious consequences and responsibilities of owning him. What were they thinking?!?! Kids shouldn't worry about all that  their parents should! Children should be aware that it's okay for a dog to run around wet after a bath violently flip over masters and succumb to peer pressure for the sake of holding a party. Your mom will take care of it little guyuntil then point and laugh!!! Not only does Wilson pick a better dog movie this time around but also voice character too. What America was thinking in making Cars a 200 million hit I shall never comprehend. It took an admirable heroic lead who knew his place in society and had his mind twisted around into thinking losing is excusable. Unbelievable! Marmaduke on the other hand gives some strategical tips to the youth of our ages to fit in if your household canine can't squeeze into anybody's 700 Gucci purse than you should deny all existence of the one you actually own until he does something cool like surfing. You'll never live up to be the next Paris Hilton with that overly strong a backbone sweety.Marmaduke didn't get the strong box office performance or glowing reviews it deserved. Hopefully it has a better shelf life when it comes to DVD this August. That's rightAugust. How cool are these producers for putting it from the big screen to TV within a three month period? Really cool I know. Just goes to show that if movies are as good as the time it takes them to get to stores than I'd be embarrassed to be attached to Monsters Inc and it's 10 month gap.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jim Carrey puts so much energy and pure comedic brilliance into this movie that we hardly noticed how corny and hackneyed was the plot or how wearily didactic was the moral lesson for all fathers who neglect their children for the goddess of success. And really we didn't care. What we loved almost as much as Carrey's rubber mouth and oral blockage like an overheated boiler fighting not to explode was the premise a lawyer that can't lie. Now there's an oxymoron! As Carrey tries to explain to his son Max lawyers need to lie. Actually he says grownups need to lie which is a truth that we really do not need to exam too closely here. To laugh at something deeply troubling in our nature is a way of dealing with it.So the genius of this movie is first the talent of Jim Carrey but second for kids who come to the realization of adult mendacity for the first time it is the discovery of comedy as a way to cope. Why do adults need to lie? is a question that a kid can never figure out and then by the time he is an adult himself or actually a teenager he can no longer comprehend how important the question once was. Call it innocence lost or the socialization process.My favorite part of the movie is the courtroom scene with Jennifer Tilly dressed oh so sluttily and her adulterous beaux looking like a model for the cover of a romance novel and Carrey in tatters in his 900 suit. Second would be the bathroom scene in which Carrey tries to tear himself apart and seems to almost succeed. His flapping mouth between the toilet seat and the bowl was inspired. Give some credit to director Tom Shadyac who managed to steer the vehicle with Carrey at the controls and to writers Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur who wrote some funny lines.The great comedians totally let themselves go. They are totally on. They go to extremes and beyond. It's like transcending not just the ordinary but even the imagined. See this obviously for Jim Carrey one of the great comedic talents of our time an original who would have delighted Charlie Chaplin with his extraordinary muggings his blatant audacity and his suburb timing.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is absolutely hilarious! There are few movies as humorous as this one being Mousehunt one of those few  another 1997 motion picture.Every minute of Liar Liar is pure fun and every minute means a good laughter. Many moments are hysterical! Jim Carrey is often a great comedian but this is him at his funniest side.The story is very funny and entertaining Fletcher Reede a lawyer with the habit of lying and breaking promises suddenly sees himself forced to become honest during the next 24 hours after his son's birthday wish comes true. He doesn't understand what's happening to him and that is driving him insane... he can't tell any lies not even write a little lie! Whenever he tries to and whenever he talks it's a huge mess for sure! He even transforms the court room into a circus seems to lose his mind and makes goofy faces! Incredibly hilarious!The actors have great performances. Jim Carrey is great as Fletcher Reede but there are other equally good actors like Maura Tierney as Audrey Reede Cary Elwes as Jerry and little Justin Cooper as Max Fletcher's son. Max is also referred to as Maximillian and Monster Max by his father who loves to do The Claw much for his son's delight. I know Cary Elwes from Robin Hood Men in Tights and I do know that he is an English actor but he speaks with a good American accent in this film. Some might think that Jim Carrey overacts here and that his humor is too crummy but the energy he shows here is not something anybody could do. It requires a very energetic and patient comedian and Jim Carrey proves his talent to do so. The kid is cute. He almost looks like Sean Marshall in Pete's Dragon with that face and long hair.At my point of view Liar Liar has funny humor not irritating or dirty humor. It is a modern lighthearted comedy. Its aim is purely fun at the highest level. I think it's difficult not laughing while watching this movie. Lots of very funny lines are another attribute.Directed by Tom Shadyac Liar Liar is the best thing Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac ever did together and slightly superior than the later Bruce Almighty.".

He's a huge success and is about to be made partner by his firm if he wins one last case for Mrs. Cole a divorce who cheated on her husband with tons of proof against her Fletcher has to prove that she was a victim of circumstance. Fletcher has a son and an ex wife as well he lies to them all the time as well and makes excuses why he can't spend enough time with his son Max.

It works! Fletcher wakes up and tells his boss she was not the best he had leading to an encounter with a hottie in the elevator and making offensive comments about her jugs. He passes a homeless man and tells him why he doesn't give change to the decay of western society! and goes to court not very ready to fight his case that could make or break his career since he can't lie. More comedy ensues as Fletcher deals with the pressure on how to learn to tell the truth to win the case and prevent his son and ex wife from moving to Boston with her new boyfriend.Liar Liar will make your sides hurt and you'll watch this movie again and again when you see how hilarious Jim Carrey is.

	schema:headline " The best comedy of 1997!";
	schema:reviewBody "Liar Liar was easily the best comedy of 1997. When I saw this when it first came out in theaters I was literally laughing my head off. Jim Carrey gives the best comic performance of his career here as Fletcher Reede a fasttalking lawyer who's always lying. His son Max doesn't like this one bit. Fletcher promises Max that he'll be at his 5th birthday party. But Fletcher calls and tells his exwife Audrey that he can't make it because at the moment he's being seduced by a female partner. Max has had enough. His birthday wish for one day his father can't tell a lie. And it miraculously comes true! And this is where the movie gets explosively funny.

Jim Carrey gives the best comic performance of his career here as Fletcher Reede a fasttalking lawyer who's always lying. His son Max doesn't like this one bit. Fletcher promises Max that he'll be at his 5th birthday party. But Fletcher calls and tells his exwife Audrey that he can't make it because at the moment he's being seduced by a female partner. Max has had enough. His birthday wish for one day his father can't tell a lie. And it miraculously comes true! And this is where the movie gets explosively funny.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit I'm probably a little biased with this movie as it contains two of the things I love the most in any movie court scenes and Jim Carrey. I'll try my best to be objective in this review though. The plot is good and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fastpacedwell for a Jim Carrey comedy anyway I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good Jim Carrey is in his element so it's no surprise that he's good but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English not American and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accentRobin Hood Men in Tights I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are wellwritten and credible. The humor is great partly because it's well Carrey but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles this is fairly clean so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great I mean we all know that we lie several times a dayheck it's even been scientifically proved but what about if we for one whole day couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall I don't have any major complaints with the film though I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film the comedy and all is stuff he's done before but that's OK it's not any less entertaining here regardless of the fact that we've seen itor something similar to it earlier. The dialog is great with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all a typical Carrey film which can be a good thing as well as bad Carrey does exactly what you expect him to and he's very entertaining and all but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note I think thisas well as his other work proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talentshe also directed Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty. I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey andor Tom Shadyac. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Liar Liar is one solution to the problem of what kind of movie vehicle to write for overacting rubber man Jim Carrey. Following the success of Ace Ventura director Tom Shaydac casts Carrey as a divorced lawyer who has no time for his young son. In the film the word liar is a pun on lawyer equating the two words since his character is a lying lawyer. Every time he promises to attend one of his son's school events or play with him Carrey finds some excuse to get out of it. His son makes a birthday wish that just for one day his dad would tell the truth and it happens. Carrey is incapable of lying and when he tries to lie his face and body go into every contortion imaginable as he tries to suppress the truth. There is a literally off the wall scene where he beats himself up in a bathroom. Carrey is a likable guy and carries the movie. Of course you can't believe for a second that he's a lawyer but belief is not needed in this film. This is a movie with a message that fathers shouldn't ignore their children. For a film aimed at kids there is a surprising amount of boob and sexual humor. Maura Tierney is very cute as his exwife. Amanda Donohoe plays Carrey's seductress law partner and Jennifer Tilly is a buxom bimbo client. Director Tom Shadyac later worked with Carrey in Bruce Almighty. Liar Liar is for Jim Carrey fans and fathers who ignore their kids.".

I didn't like him at first. Then I learned to put up with him. Now I find him perfect for some film roles such as Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber 1994.I never think that Jim Carrey is ideal for a role really until I see him in it and then I think that no one could have done it quite so well. But I still don't particularly think he's a very good comedian per se.Here he plays Fletcher Reede a highgrade attorney so caught up in his work that he has little time to devote to his young son Max Justin Cooper the type of plotcreated kid that these type of films deserve. Max is mad that his dad keeps missing out on all his activities so his birthday wish is every lawyer's worst nightmare no lying. Max wishes or commands that his father can no longer tell any lies and the wish is granted by the powers that be. This is a problem for Fletcher indeed since he has just acquired the case of an adultress housewife Jennifer Tilly who wants to keep her kids. She spills the truth to Fletcher  that she has had many affairs  and this is not the type of thing a man uncapable of lying is able to cope with.Fletcher spills his guts at the court proceedings tarnishing his image as a professional lawyer. In one of the film's better scenes he walks into a court bathroom and beats himself up slamming his head in a toilet and punching himself so that he can postpone the trial to a later date.Why is the sight of a man violently clapping his head against and between a toilet seat funny? Because it's Jim Carrey who as I mentioned above may not be the funniest man alive but by the box office numbers may technically be  and he does have a knack for physical spastic comedy too bad it can overtake his roles sometimes. Here he unleashes it when it is needed and it works because it is not a pointless exercise in energetic behavior but quite the contrary.The situations one can get into with the restrictions of only telling the truth are limitless. These types of formulas always work good in Carrey's movies  those involving abnormal abilities. There's a reason they keep making similar films following the same formula.As my small number of readers probably know I am not a commercial critic with my grading scale. I am quite conservative only giving high ratings to films that really deserve them. I hesitate to give Liar Liar anything more than the rating I have given it although I must say that it is a very fine comedy with some great gutbusting laughs and that any fan of inventive comedy  Carrey fans or not  should see this movie.After all would I lie?45 stars.John Ulmer".

	schema:headline " Liar Liar is a great example of a film that teaches the audience to appreciate their loved ones and to be honest.";
	schema:reviewBody "Liar Liar stars Jim Carrey as the lying selffull lawyer Fletcher Reede. His life takes a turn for the worse when his son Max wishes Fletcher would not tell a lie an entire day. This came after Fletcher broke yet another promise and missed his son's 5th birthday party. The theme of this movie is honesty and appreciating your family and friends. During the film we learn that Fletcher and his former wife Audrey were divorced due to Fletcher being unsupportive and breaking promises like he does through most of the first act of the movie. Fletcher finds out that Audrey and Max will be moving to Boston after Audrey's new boyfriend Jerry proposed to her. Audrey had mixed feelings about leaving from Los Angeles to Boston as this would make it more difficult for Max to see his father Fletcher. After missing Max's birthday party Audrey decided to move to Boston with Jerry and Max. While blowing out his birthday candles Max wishes his father could not tell a lie for an entire day. This wish comes true and Fletcher finds out the hard way. Throughout most of the movie Fletcher struggles to do his job and nearly loses his job friends and family during the way. He even gets put in jail and gets his car towed away. As mentioned this film's theme is honesty. During the film Fletcher realizes he is a bad dad and even he knows it. During the day he cannot lie he says I'm a bad father. This saddens him and he realizes he is a bad father. The directory uses a low angle to put emphasis on Fletcher hitting rock bottom. The audience at this point begins to realize just how important it is to be honest with your friends and family.

By the end of the movie Fletcher is able to make everything right and get back together with Audrey and restart his family with Audrey and Max. Liar Liar is a great example of a film that teaches the audience to appreciate their loved ones and to be honest. Even though Fletcher is a successful lawyer he made his way to the top by lying. He even got a case by agreeing to lie to the judge. However we learn in this film that being a liar will eventually cause you problems. For Fletcher this happened all at once. This life lesson can be implied to anyone.".

	onyx:emotionText "Liar Liar stars Jim Carrey as the lying selffull lawyer Fletcher Reede. His life takes a turn for the worse when his son Max wishes Fletcher would not tell a lie an entire day. This came after Fletcher broke yet another promise and missed his son's 5th birthday party. The theme of this movie is honesty and appreciating your family and friends. During the film we learn that Fletcher and his former wife Audrey were divorced due to Fletcher being unsupportive and breaking promises like he does through most of the first act of the movie. Fletcher finds out that Audrey and Max will be moving to Boston after Audrey's new boyfriend Jerry proposed to her. Audrey had mixed feelings about leaving from Los Angeles to Boston as this would make it more difficult for Max to see his father Fletcher. After missing Max's birthday party Audrey decided to move to Boston with Jerry and Max. While blowing out his birthday candles Max wishes his father could not tell a lie for an entire day. This wish comes true and Fletcher finds out the hard way. Throughout most of the movie Fletcher struggles to do his job and nearly loses his job friends and family during the way. He even gets put in jail and gets his car towed away. As mentioned this film's theme is honesty. During the film Fletcher realizes he is a bad dad and even he knows it. During the day he cannot lie he says I'm a bad father. This saddens him and he realizes he is a bad father. The directory uses a low angle to put emphasis on Fletcher hitting rock bottom. The audience at this point begins to realize just how important it is to be honest with your friends and family. Fletcher wants to change but his friends and family are sick of giving him second chances. By the end of the movie Fletcher is able to make everything right and get back together with Audrey and restart his family with Audrey and Max. Liar Liar is a great example of a film that teaches the audience to appreciate their loved ones and to be honest. Even though Fletcher is a successful lawyer he made his way to the top by lying.

Liar Liar takes a concept that's funny to begin with and makes it at times actually hilarious  mainly by not taking itself to seriously and just going wildly creative and outrageous with the concept. This is a movie that I would solidly recommend to someone who just wants a light if rather manic comedy. I am picky about my comedies and consider this to be actually hilarious in some places a good example being in the court room when Cary in the middle of questioning a shady client who is lying objects to his own questions. LiarLiar is not without flaws there are some times it gets a bit to slapstick a bit to obnoxious and the ending while very sweet was a little over the top with the airport scene. I still liked this a lot though as a whole. It's purpose is to entertain which it does. I really do love this concept. Imagine someone who lies regularly having to tell the straight truth no matter what. I could think of a few people who might have trouble with thatand who it might be really entertaining to see while they do it!. In closing I really liked this very much and the movie makers and cast especially Carey did a great job of having fun with the concept and pushing this as far as they could. My vote's 7 of 10.".

As a fan of the show In Living Color I enjoyed Carrey immensely when he was at his zaniest doing just about anything for a laugh. This movie allows him to let everything hang out without being overly silly like in Dumb and Dumber and The Mask and he hits all the right marks. A perfect movie for when you want to just sit back and laugh his performance is brilliant. Justin Cooper the little boy who plays his son is absolutely adorable. Maura Tierney does a bangup job as Carrey's ex and she plays the straight role to a tee. Swoosie Kurtz and Jennifer Tilly and Amanda Donohoe are tailormade for their roles and add the perfect flavor to this delicious film. I loved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The imaginative but wellconceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always1989 had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mysterybased expectations. Yet Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.However Ghost accomplished of what Always tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze  Demi Moore  Whoopi Goldberg for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others' feelings and that taught us Love begins with emotions ends with thoughts. On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant. I was in love with someone and it was February2005 we were both watching the Ghost on TV both talking on the phone. Then that scene came uponSam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing and keep saying to me I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don't need to be alive to recall this Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well several years after the release of the movie as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing that the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.".

The story is about Sam who has a great life and this movie is the opposite of CLICK. Unlike that stupid movie this guy doesn't want to fast forward his life with a beautiful loving wife and great career. But it is taken away from him when he is killed. He becomes a ghost. And that might be one of only two flaws in the story. Why he can project his needs when billions of other dead souls can't. But a great movie like this endears us to the characters and plot enough so that this is a very trivial flaw. He finds he can communicate with a fake spiritualist Whoopi in a role few could do as well which is the second flaw since we have a feeling we've seen this character in this instance all too often. Hoever again if the movie is good enough we can overlook this. Without making spoilers I can only add that the movie satisfies the viewer. There is romance humor logic adventure suspense and great scenes. Among the great scenes that make the movie I'll only mention some are the scene where Sam follows his friend to the killer's apartment actually just about every scene with his friend is classic the scene where Whoopi goes to the bank the scene where she leaves the bank the scene where Sam is a ghost in the office with his friend the scene where the friend hits on Sam's woman the first scene with the little dark men the second scene with the little dark men...I could go on and on. What is lost in all of this is one of the greatest emotional bits of capturing character ever when Sam realizes what is going to happen to an evil man when the little dark men appear the second time and he expresses true sorrow and compassion for a man who stole so much from him. This is one of the most poignant and heroic scenes ever in any movie I would find it very hard to believe anyone could not enjoy this movie. Truly a winner. Know what? This is a classic.".

	schema:headline " Forever a classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Certain movies will just always be hard to write a review for. You can give your opinion and say what you enjoyed or didn't enjoy but I find myself hesitating in certain aspects just because a classic must be left some space to be a classic. Ghost as far as I'm concerned will forever be a romantic classic. It's sheer brilliance is it's twists it is incredibly deeply romantic and at the same time terrifying and has an underlying story that is never fully explored. It's got action mystery horror and at the heart is the pure simplistic romance of it all.The story is about an investment banker played by Patrick Swayze and his girlfriend played by Demi Moore. Sam and Molly are deeply in love planning for the future and happier in their lives than ever before. Until Sam discovers laundered money in investment accounts. He is robbed and subsequently murdered for his password to the computer in order to empty the laundered money from the accounts. But Sam doesn't go the other side. He is kept on earth in spirit form because of his unfinished business both with Molly and to discover his murderer. He must learn the ropes of being a ghost and nobody else can hear him until he runs into a so called psychic who scams people into believing she can contact their dearly departed. However it turns out Oda Mae Brown played in her academy award winning role by Whoopie Goldberg can actually hear Sam. Together the unlikely team must help each other uncover the horrible murder plot and save Molly.Swayze and Moore make an incredible couple..hot on screen. Their careers have perhaps slipped since then one might say but this was them at their best. Swayze was indeed at the top of his game coming out of Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse and Moore was young and a new hot commodity which made them undeniably perfect together. Their roles fit them perfectly. Whoopie Goldberg was hilarious and believable as Oda Mae and her character was such an integral part of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays a great villain as the betrayer of the film. In a short time director Jerry Zucker establishes a best friendship between Goldwyn and Swayze a deeply loving relationship between Swayze and Moore and a plot line that goes far beneath the movie. Obviously Goldwyn's character is being used by a much higher up criminal to launder money although we never see him. Is he being blackmailed? Paid off? Something held over his head? Maybe he's not the bad guy but rather forced to commit these acts? It's a big job because we also know Willie Lopez played by Rick Aviles is involved in this as well. And deeper than that we have the theology in the film. The light brings good people to the afterlife and the dark shadowy beings torture the evil. This film is one of a few that is endlessly watchable meaning you can sit down any time and watch it through over and over and over again which is exactly what makes it a classic. It has it's holes it has to with a plot like that. And it has it's disturbing moments a gratituous death scene a make out scene which although features Swayze and Moore is actually Demi and Whoopi...you have to see it to understand it. Also if Sam Wheat must learn how to physically touch things in his ghost form...how does he sit walk etc before he learns that? And his first experience with walking through a door happens days after his death. I'm sure sometime between then and that point he would have had to have walked through something. Perhaps those are minor points but they are things that will come up especially if you have seen it as many times as I have. The film is a must see and if you haven't seen it go watch it right now!! Because it's one of those staples of films that everyone must know about. Ghost is amazing!! 910Happy Anniversary to my beautiful Sam...we watched Ghost together last night.".

You can give your opinion and say what you enjoyed or didn't enjoy but I find myself hesitating in certain aspects just because a classic must be left some space to be a classic. Ghost as far as I'm concerned will forever be a romantic classic. It's sheer brilliance is it's twists it is incredibly deeply romantic and at the same time terrifying and has an underlying story that is never fully explored. It's got action mystery horror and at the heart is the pure simplistic romance of it all.The story is about an investment banker played by Patrick Swayze and his girlfriend played by Demi Moore. Sam and Molly are deeply in love planning for the future and happier in their lives than ever before. Until Sam discovers laundered money in investment accounts. He is robbed and subsequently murdered for his password to the computer in order to empty the laundered money from the accounts. But Sam doesn't go the other side. He is kept on earth in spirit form because of his unfinished business both with Molly and to discover his murderer. He must learn the ropes of being a ghost and nobody else can hear him until he runs into a so called psychic who scams people into believing she can contact their dearly departed. However it turns out Oda Mae Brown played in her academy award winning role by Whoopie Goldberg can actually hear Sam. Together the unlikely team must help each other uncover the horrible murder plot and save Molly.Swayze and Moore make an incredible couple..hot on screen. Their careers have perhaps slipped since then one might say but this was them at their best. Swayze was indeed at the top of his game coming out of Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse and Moore was young and a new hot commodity which made them undeniably perfect together. Their roles fit them perfectly. Whoopie Goldberg was hilarious and believable as Oda Mae and her character was such an integral part of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays a great villain as the betrayer of the film. In a short time director Jerry Zucker establishes a best friendship between Goldwyn and Swayze a deeply loving relationship between Swayze and Moore and a plot line that goes far beneath the movie. Obviously Goldwyn's character is being used by a much higher up criminal to launder money although we never see him. Is he being blackmailed? Paid off? Something held over his head? Maybe he's not the bad guy but rather forced to commit these acts? It's a big job because we also know Willie Lopez played by Rick Aviles is involved in this as well. And deeper than that we have the theology in the film. The light brings good people to the afterlife and the dark shadowy beings torture the evil. This film is one of a few that is endlessly watchable meaning you can sit down any time and watch it through over and over and over again which is exactly what makes it a classic. It has it's holes it has to with a plot like that. And it has it's disturbing moments a gratituous death scene a make out scene which although features Swayze and Moore is actually Demi and Whoopi...you have to see it to understand it. Also if Sam Wheat must learn how to physically touch things in his ghost form...how does he sit walk etc before he learns that? And his first experience with walking through a door happens days after his death. I'm sure sometime between then and that point he would have had to have walked through something. Perhaps those are minor points but they are things that will come up especially if you have seen it as many times as I have. The film is a must see and if you haven't seen it go watch it right now!! Because it's one of those staples of films that everyone must know about. Ghost is amazing!! 910Happy Anniversary to my beautiful Sam...we watched Ghost together last night.";

	schema:reviewBody "I must say this film surprised me. Coming in I knew nothing about it but the famous clayforming scene... I didn't know I was in for such a strong experience. This film had me from the first few moments of it. I never lost interest. The plot is so interesting and intriguing you can't help but watch often at the very edge of your seat. I will say that I found one twist somewhat predictable but maybe I've just seen too many later movies before watching this. There is a lot of suspense in this film. When I found that it was directed by a Zuckeryup... Airplane and so forth I was somewhat doubtful as to any other quality in the film than the humor of it... if you're reading this and you're thinking the same trust me he pulls it off. Excellently. There are few if any flaws in directing. The writing is solid. At times there seemed to be a little too much humor and some scenes were maybe a tad long but apart from that there was not really anything with this film that was flawed. The score is great. The pacing is incredibly good. The acting is really good allround. Goldberg provides a lot of comic relief without being obnoxious. Moore and Swayze have magnificent chemistry you truly believe them as a couple. The special effects are grand yet they don't take over the movie. This is driven by the emotions by how the plot affects these characters. I was completely into this movie all the way. The humor is very good and surprisingly tasteful for the theme. Much of it is derived from the situation of Swayze's character and his interaction with environment and other characters. All in all just a very impressive film. I recommend this to any fan of drama romance comedy thriller or fantasy as well as anyone interested in seeing a nonparody Zucker film and fans of the actors. 710".

However Sam is murdered in an attempted mugging and as he remains on earth in spiritual form he must find a way to protect his girlfriend before the killer strikes again...Swayze and Moore work well as a couple and you really believe in the connection between them. But you need some eccentricity in this kind of picture in order to balance out the romantic element. The film gets this in the form of Oda Mae Brown Whoopi Goldberg. The joke with this character is that she is a fake medium who learns to her surprise that her powers are in fact real. Goldberg is excellent in this role her timing is perfect and she is hilarious throughout. Also of note is Vincent Schiavelli as the deranged Subway Ghost who teaches Sam how to affect the world around him. This a brief but scenestealing performance.The villains come in the form of Tony Goldwyn as Sam's slimy doubledealing and increasing desperate best friend. Rick Aviles is also wellcast is lowlife hitman Willie Lopez.Best of all is Patrick Swayze who heads the cast as the title character. Swayze takes a lot of riffing for his performances but having seen him in three movies including this one I don't know why. Sure he's not a great actor but he's not a bad one. He creates a terrific chemistry between him and Moore and an even better comic chemistry in his scenes with Whoopi Goldberg. His partnership with the latter really makes the picture. Check the scene where keeps her up all night singing I'm Henry the Eighth I Am.The film is wrapped up nicely with a lovely moving theme tune and some good ghostly special effects. Despite some serious moments in the main the film is very lighthearted and doesn't take itself too seriously.Definitely one to watch for a good night in.".

	schema:reviewBody "When seeing Ghost 16 years ago with friends and family I knew that this film would go down as a classic and it did it's one of the 90's best films. The movie in my opinion is so successful because of the many themes it's associated with it's not only a love story but also this film has plenty of comedic moments while at the same time the main characters face a web of betrayal. The plot is well written with many turns as Patrick Swayze gives a strong performance as a New York City banker who is gunned down and killed right in front of his sweetheartDemi Mooreand all of this is over a dirty investment scandal. Ghost then gets very interesting when the Swayze character finds out that the after life does indeed occur! He can see people but they can't see him! Never fear the only hope is to team with a psychicWhoopi Goldberg who rightfully wins an AcademyAward for best supporting actress to uncover the truth behind his murder and to rescue his loveDemi Moore. Overall this movie is a great romance that touches your heart and makes you appreciate your loved ones especially after their gone. The laughs are also good with Whoopi and it's nice to see the now late Vincent Schiavelli have a small part as a subway ghost who helps Patrick believe in his supernatural powers. Overall again one of the best movies of the 90's that taught us love hope and made us a believer that our past loved ones could be ghost. Also this picture helped make Demi Moore a superstar in the 90's as she would earn 12 to 15 million a picture during this decade.".

This is a great film with character you care about suspense romance and a fresh script.  This film made Patricks carrier and after this film  he chose a few films that killed his chances of acting in higher budget films.  I believe if he picked a couple more scripts like this one he would be on the same level as Tom Cruse.  I think the politically correct 90's found him too macho for their tastes and it drove him to do that film about India which helped kill his carrier.  In the end this film is a little about what Patrick could have been a true international star.".

But as it turns out that's only the beginning of the story.If you were to describe Ghost I guess the best way you could describe it would be a dramafantasy with some humorous moments mostly as a result of the casting of Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic. But she comes into the story in the middle of the film. Patrick and Demi those brat pack alumni are now eager young urban professionals Demi makes and sells her own pottery and Patrick works in a bank in the high end area of one he's not just a teller. When we meet them they are starting to fix up their Tribeca loft with one of Swayze's coworkers Tony Goldwyn.But one fateful night after seeing a performance of MacBeth Swayze is killed as a result of a street mugging. But was it just that a simple robbery? Not by a longshot and Swayze who was killed before his time is angry enough to stay on Earth and find out what really happened.Of course he needs an ally and that's where Whoopi comes in. Turns out that there might be a little truth in her advertising as a spiritualist and consultant to the dead. Good enough for Whoopi to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress the other Oscar Ghost won was for original screenplay.But you won't forget Patrick and Demi as a pair of literal starcrossed lovers. You also know that the universal fates will reunite them because people who care for each other as much as they did aren't destined to stay apart.I do so love Unchained Melody. Introduced originally by blues singer Al Hibbler in the Fifties it got a revival a decade later by the Righteous Brothers. Tony Bennett also recorded a fine version and after his death a previously unreleased version of it was put out by Bing Crosby's estate. It's a perfect song for the theme for Swayze and Moore.One of the best love stories of the last decade of the last century despite the tragedy that takes place Ghost is one feel good motion picture.".

However my apprehensions were instantly wiped away. This movie lived up to all of it's praise! It's the story of two young lovers Sam Patrick Swayze and Molly Demi Moore. They have just moved in together. After a night out on the town Sam is brutally killed by a seemingly random mugger and Molly holds Sam's bloody corpse in her arms all while Sam's spirit watches. He has been left to wander Earth and desperately try to protect Molly. He gets help from Oda Mae Brown Whoopi Goldberg a psychic fraud who has more power than she realized. Together Sam and Oda Mae begin to piece together the puzzle of Sam's death and uncover something much more sinister than they ever imagined.The whole cast does an excellent job here. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play the roles of grieving lovers perfectly. Ms. Moore is especially affecting. But it's Whoopi Golberg's fantastic performance as Oda Mae Brown that truly steals the show. Her performance is hilarious and endearing throughout and she takes the film to an entirely new level. She's really is half of what makes it so good.This in my opinion is a great film. It entertains it thrills you and it even moves you. The writing is also excellent. The only place the film suffers is the special effects. Even they are fine accept for the demons. The demons of the film are laughable. That is one major downfall. However it's not bad enough to ruin a film that is one to be treasured. Good fun all around! 810 stars! Jay Addison".

The story is that of a boy and his family about to lose their farm to a railroad tycoon in the early 1900s something that did happen back then.

You don't have a clue.  But if you are the father of a small boy go to the public library's children's room and get this movie pronto.  And if like me you're an old movie propman get ready to enjoy some of the nicest set dressing and model work you've seen for a long long time.  I wish I had that train on my resume.";

	schema:reviewBody "Written by Steve Bloom and Robert Rodat and directed by Ornie Orsatti Tall Tale stars Nick Stahl Patrick Swayze and Scott Glenn. Released in 1995 this ActionAdventure film takes place in an old western town at the start of the twentieth century and focuses on the modernization of America.In 1905 Daniel Hackett Nick Stahl lives with his mother and father on the farmlands of Paradise Valley. As the film progresses the audience learns that Daniel is growing sick of his life on the farm and expresses his bitterness to his father Jonas. Daniel's father tells him repetitive stories of folk heroes Pecos Bill Paul Bunyan and John Henry in whom Daniel no longer believes. Meanwhile J.P. Stiles Scott Glen enters town with his gang of wealthy men and his modern machinery with intent of buying the land in order to develop it. When Jonas stands up to stiles and refuses to sell his land he ends up being shot but not before he hands the deed to his land to Daniel. Jonas survives but is badly injured Daniel meanwhile runs and hides in his boat where he falls asleep. When he wakes he finds himself in a dried up lake bed in Texas where two men try to rob and kill him only to be rescued by legendary cowboy Pecos Bill Patrick Swayze. The two of them later meet up with famous lumberjack Paul Bunyan and exslave John Henry. The team gets into a tough battle with Stiles whose greediness threatens the strength of the folk tales and the livelihood of the farmers.The acting by the Stahl Swayze and Glen was very impressive. They were able to capture the feel of the early Midwest and made the audience feel as if they were part of the story. The compelling acting brought out the excitement of the folk lures that every child reads when growing up. Gender clearly played a large part in casting actors for the film because men play all of the dominant roles. This can be attributed to the fact that women didn't have a large role outside of the home during this time period and unfortunately there are not many women folk heroes.The costume design and set design also played large roles in creating a convincing story. The costumes were dead on for what viewers would imagine Pecos Bill Paul Bunyan and John Henry to look and dress like. The costumes really brought out the feeling that this film was based in the early Midwest and the set was designed perfectly to give the feeling that the audience is involved in a folk story. For example Paul Bunyan's log home was exactly what you would imagine it to be along with his blue ox Babe.I would highly recommend this film as I have loved it since I was a child. It is a great movie for children and for families and should be watched by anyone who enjoys adventure films.".

It was cowritten by Robert Rodat who a few years later wrote Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot and is every bit as serious.

The familyfilm presentation is true to the Code championed by those legends Protect the land defend the defenseless and don't never spit in front of women nor children. The script hands us the cognitive key Just 'cause it's a TALL tale don't mean it ain't TRUE. By 1995 America was simply too far gone to cherish this. Ignoring it as a consumer remains my worst bigscreen mistake. Kudos to Mr. Rodat the director the cinematographer for gorgeous moments Randy Edelman  his score for the scene of the farm horse abandoned in harness by a farmhating boy is fleetingly but heartbreakingly perfect  and to the project's rebel distracted? shallow? Disney VP. The scene in which Pecos emerges like heroic resolve itself from the midst of a richly diverse public that has F I N A L L Y come together to nobly stand against the takeover by predatory eastern greed and its hired guns  Rodat's script does not favor a disarmed populace  deftly fulfills the principle of showing not saying it. This is a beautiful ambitious patriotic alarm contained in a suitableforchildren and therefore subversive valentine to a Western American dream that was worth fighting for. All that and veteran character actor Burgess Meredith bidding a suckeredandproudofit boy us farewell. See this serious as a heart attack film  we get a horrific prophetic vision in a scene that is Hell on Wheels not Little Red Caboose of a subjugated West whose workers are getting additional productivity squeezed out of them to use a postBailout euphemism with literal whips  before or after the documentary Inside Job. Speaking of hired guns Wall Street and the Business Roundtable America's unelected voterunaccountable rulers with politicians in their pockets have a vested interest in popular media as both profit sector and opinion influencer. They have agents in the field and the field now prominently includes cyberspace. Do not be deceived. That this deeply patriotic lamentwarning is fit for children older than perhaps 7  a 12yearold boy is propositioned by a pathetically degraded woman then nearly killed by a knifewielding Wall Street hatchet man and former farmer played presumably as written with noncartoonish touches of passionate hate cold honesty restrained pride with demanding eastern bosses and even a flash of tenderness by Scott Glenn  does not make it lightweight. It makes it brilliant. And convicting. Embarrassing in a way. Pecos Bill Calamity Jane free man John Henry and Paul Bunyan are what many used to want America at least the American West to be an America standing morally tall. Truly free truly brave. Not a shark tank casino and pharoahslave pyramid whose slaves admire the pharoahs preying on them more than each other. At least I've got the movie. To the Code!".

	schema:reviewBody "Tall Tale is a pretty dumb film and contains an UNFORGIVABLE 'twist' 15 minutes from the end... But at least you can't accuse it of lacking imagination.Apart from in the setup that is. A landhungry baron during the Ol' West wants to buy up the property of nearby farmers. If they refuse to comply he has his army of goons to do his dirty work for him. Guess what happens to the only farmer to protest this policy... And guess who 'inherits' the deeds to the land so he can go on a 'mystical quest' with them to hide from the baddies. That's right... His 12 year old son.En route he befriends great figures of American legend... Such as Pecos Bill Paul Bunyan and John Henry. Nope I haven't heard of any them either...

	onyx:emotionText "Tall Tale is a pretty dumb film and contains an UNFORGIVABLE 'twist' 15 minutes from the end... But at least you can't accuse it of lacking imagination.Apart from in the setup that is. A landhungry baron during the Ol' West wants to buy up the property of nearby farmers. If they refuse to comply he has his army of goons to do his dirty work for him. Guess what happens to the only farmer to protest this policy... And guess who 'inherits' the deeds to the land so he can go on a 'mystical quest' with them to hide from the baddies. That's right... His 12 year old son.En route he befriends great figures of American legend... Such as Pecos Bill Paul Bunyan and John Henry. Nope I haven't heard of any them either...

It's an educational film for those studying American Tall Tales.This is a Disney Drama Classic!! It has many big Hollywood names in it! Nick Stahl Patrick Swayze Oliver Platt Scott Glenn Stephen Lang etc... why isn't this film more popular!??? They ALL play such memorable  much better roles than in the overrated  nonsensical movies they're mostly known for. I was really hoping for Doug Walker to review this film during his last Disneycember yeah I know Great family movie with a great story and good morales too! I actually learned a lot from this film. Great fatherson storyarc in this it could really likely make son's bonds with their father's stronger! And in my book it seems quite Biblical too with the facts that 3 legendary characters Pecos Bill Paul Bunyan  John Henry are sent to help this boy Daniel Hackett they're somewhat like 3 GUARDIAN ANGELS since the Number 3 appears quite a lot in the Bible. Also Randy Edelman's score for the film is especially underrated! He deserves an Oscar nomination for SOMETHING! A MUST SEE!!!910PS Quite ironic too that the director also directed the movie that's universally considered bad The Avengers 1998".

But the rest of this movie is a disaster. It has almost NO plot and what little shreds of a plot it has are ridden with holes. I'll explain.You see there's this guy Stiles who wants to buy up all the land in a community. So he holds a town meeting promising to give people vast sums of money in return for their land. Everyone is positively giddy about it until this guy Jonas stands up and makes a touching speech about how the land is their heritage and it would be a sin to sell. Everyone gets on his case about it and he concludes with Well I ain't selling. Then what happens? Do they discuss it further? Does Stiles resume the meeting? No! Everyone just gets up and LEAVES! The meeting isn't even adjourned they all just... walk out of the building! Did they forget what they were doing? Do they have Attention Deficit Disorder? Someone please explain this scene to me.Now if I remember correctly Stiles is so mad about Jonas ruining his meeting that he does the logical thing and... shoots Jonas. At the last minute Jonas's son Daniel gets ahold of the deed to their land and runs away with it because Stiles will stop at nothing to snatch it right out of his hands a triedandtrue legal tactic. Daniel runs away and falls asleep in a boat. Then he dreams about being in the Old West with Pecos Bill. Then he wakes up and Stiles tries to run him over with a train. Suddenly all the townspeople are on his side and he gets to keep the deed. It's all very confusing.What a dumb movie. 210 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me take you on a trip to the late 60's. When Movie theaters only had one giant screen and a few hundred uncomfortable seats that housed the future of America. A thick pack of licorice in one hand and a movie sized candy bar in the other. A monster cola between the knees insured the blessed arrival of the sugar coma fairy before movies end.The cool kids sat in the balcony and it was just plain survival of the fittest to the front rows by the screen. If even two of your friends survived the mle to the front row with you it was a miracle. Typically when your parents arrived to ask you how the movie was someone in your party was sure to say so and so got to sit in the front row! America in its innocence good or bad dropped their children off for the double feature that usually ran on Saturday afternoon. With evidence that anarchy could indeed survive in places the roar of the room continued all the way through the cartoon that preceded the movie typically our old pal Jimney Cricket singing I'm no fool no siree.Then as the first feature appeared the music would thunder into the room tinkerbell would wave her wand and color would overwhelm your senses. The room became silent as everyone prepared. This was the magic and the miracle of Disney. For the next few hours you would be transported to a place where people sang instead of spoke where villains were easy to spot and the good guy was small and scared and helpless just like you. That said what a delight it was to stumble upon Disney's Tall Tale this afternoon. Just 43 year old me in a recliner laptop pushed aside and housework not going anywhere until movies end. I only half watched until the father began retelling the tales to his son. I thought HEY I remember those characters! Of course Swayze had me hook line and sinker within 5 minutes on screen. So ruggedly handsome and confident I knew I wasn't going anywhere. SBeing from Minnesota I felt actual anticipation when I realized they were going to introduce us to Paul Bunyan! I envisioned some buff blonde with a dazzling smile some more greedy eye candy to accompany Patrick I suppose. As the movie progressed I understood why Paul's character had to portray more of a gruff Uncle. You know the one that messes up your hair instead of hugs you when he sees you. Something Platt does brilliantly with very little dialog. The sunglasses added to the costume in the desert scene finally made him Paul Bunyan to me.Speaking of eye candy that smile on Brown had to be the deciding factor that he was cast as John Henry. He appeared illuminated with joy. He introduces the subplot to the theme You don't know unless you try. And drives home the point by losing the contest despite his best efforts with a winning smile and the decision to try again later.Can't quite tell if Calamity Jane was chopped up after the fact or if she was set to make a token appearance from the start. The Don't mess with Texas bit was hilarious but I think it cost us spending time hearing Jane's story. In fact I think it would've been funnier to have that same guy get a beating from HER for being inappropriate.In closing I don't like someone's Wizard of Oz analogy at all. The trio in that movie are missing key elements that will help them defeat their enemies and arrive safely home. No our hero's here possess the key elements that represent determination tenacity and ingenuity all in allegiance with the code which is integrity. Finally the true hero here is our own Walt Disney. Who continues to leave his signature after he's long gone. Always reminding us that if we use our imagination life can be bigger bolder and more beautiful that sometimes it's better to sing instead of speak and he'll keep that place for us where the good guys always win.I'd love to see this piece redone big budget for the big screen!".

With evidence that anarchy could indeed survive in places the roar of the room continued all the way through the cartoon that preceded the movie typically our old pal Jimney Cricket singing I'm no fool no siree.Then as the first feature appeared the music would thunder into the room tinkerbell would wave her wand and color would overwhelm your senses. The room became silent as everyone prepared. This was the magic and the miracle of Disney. For the next few hours you would be transported to a place where people sang instead of spoke where villains were easy to spot and the good guy was small and scared and helpless just like you. That said what a delight it was to stumble upon Disney's Tall Tale this afternoon. Just 43 year old me in a recliner laptop pushed aside and housework not going anywhere until movies end. I only half watched until the father began retelling the tales to his son. I thought HEY I remember those characters! Of course Swayze had me hook line and sinker within 5 minutes on screen. So ruggedly handsome and confident I knew I wasn't going anywhere. SBeing from Minnesota I felt actual anticipation when I realized they were going to introduce us to Paul Bunyan! I envisioned some buff blonde with a dazzling smile some more greedy eye candy to accompany Patrick I suppose. As the movie progressed I understood why Paul's character had to portray more of a gruff Uncle. You know the one that messes up your hair instead of hugs you when he sees you. Something Platt does brilliantly with very little dialog. The sunglasses added to the costume in the desert scene finally made him Paul Bunyan to me.Speaking of eye candy that smile on Brown had to be the deciding factor that he was cast as John Henry. He appeared illuminated with joy. He introduces the subplot to the theme You don't know unless you try. And drives home the point by losing the contest despite his best efforts with a winning smile and the decision to try again later.Can't quite tell if Calamity Jane was chopped up after the fact or if she was set to make a token appearance from the start. The Don't mess with Texas bit was hilarious but I think it cost us spending time hearing Jane's story. In fact I think it would've been funnier to have that same guy get a beating from HER for being inappropriate.In closing I don't like someone's Wizard of Oz analogy at all. The trio in that movie are missing key elements that will help them defeat their enemies and arrive safely home. No our hero's here possess the key elements that represent determination tenacity and ingenuity all in allegiance with the code which is integrity. Finally the true hero here is our own Walt Disney. Who continues to leave his signature after he's long gone. Always reminding us that if we use our imagination life can be bigger bolder and more beautiful that sometimes it's better to sing instead of speak and he'll keep that place for us where the good guys always win.I'd love to see this piece redone big budget for the big screen!";

Her naturalistic style of acting sometimes seems out of place with other more studied actors e.g. the almost unwatchable Hurlyburly but here she and Daniels and the minimal dialogue of the script work so well.

I was surprised at how efficiently this movie drew me in but then again I'm a big softie at heart. I started watching this movie late one night and didn't want to stop  so I didn't!The movie concerns a young girl who goes to live with her father after her mother is killed in a car accident. Dad and Mom divorced many years before and live on opposite sides of the world  Canada and New Zealand  so she doesn't know Dad very well.Jeff Bridges plays the father in this film and does it incredibly well. He's an artist who is just a little bit quirky a big believer in following your dreams and desperately trying to capture the love for his daughter that he regrets having lost in the divorce years before. Anna Paquin as his 13year old daughter is wonderful  how do young kids act so well???  as she learns to grieve for her mother find a new life in a new country and love and trust a father whom she has barely known most of her life.The supporting cast shines as well in most cases. Most notably is Terry Kinney as Daniels brother and the young girls uncle. He's the kind of uncle everyone wants to have around although when he falls asleep while babysitting and Paquin's character disappears he doesn't seem very responsible. He becomes a bit of a scene stealer though as the movie progresses. He has one of the best lines in the film when he tries to convince a U.S. borderpatrol agent that he needs dozens of gallons of gas to go camping for his portable generator to run his blender and TV. Nothing like camping in the middle of no where with your VCR a good movie and a pina colada.Dana Delany of TV's China Beach fame plays Daniels sometimes livein girlfriend and seems to be the only actor who doesn't really stretch in this part. I don't believe this is Delany's fault however. This story is primarily about the fatherdaughter relationship and Delany's part suffers as a result. Most scenes are supportive and don't really give her a chance to shine.The story is well written with a combination of genuine emotion without becoming overly sappy. Yes the film is sweet but not sickeningly so. When the credits began to roll at the end of this movie the first thing I thought of way How could this have gotten a PG rating? I literally heard one fourletter word in the entire film and that is said under the breath so that I wasn't even sure I heard it. There is one reference to sex outside marriage and a car accident at the beginning of the film. That's it. Parents you can show this to young children without any real concern. My suggestion Watch the first 5 minutes of the film and if you decide your children can handle the opening sequence of a car crash then there probably is nothing else in the film that should be a problem in my opinion!".

	schema:reviewBody "I got sucked into a movie on the satellite dish the other day 'Fly Away Home.' It's a story about a young motherless girl Amy who rescues some wild goose eggs and basically becomes their mother. The story evolves as the goslings grow into young adult birds ready to fly south. Since they never had parents the geese haven't learned to fly. The girl's dad thinks he can get them to fly by following him in his ultralight. But they will only follow Amy. So dad teaches her to fly. Soon the geese are flying. Next dad and Amy hatch a plot to fly south and have the geese follow them. We know this actually happened when 2 scientists did something similar. One of the reasons I was sucked into this wonderful family movie was the photography. It is National Geographic quality. In fact I was so impressed with the cinematography that I had to look up who did it Caleb Deschanel. The setting a farm in Southern Ontario allowed him to become intimate with the geese and the natural setting. Another reason I couldn't stop watching the movie was the stunning performance by Anna Paquin the 16year old girl who played Amy. I remembered her from the movie 'Piano.' She played Flora the daughter of Holly Hunter. I'm sure they picked Paquin to do that part because of her speaking ability. Holly Hunter played the part of Ada a woman who couldn't talk. She communicated with sign language through her daughter. Paquin was so good in her part that she won the Oscar quite a feat for an 11year old.The story 'Fly Away Home' is touching because she's not the kind of Hollywoodtrained child actor you find in most movies. A surprising thing happened as I watched Amy and her geese. I could sense a startling serenity from her as the bond had developed between them. I wondered how she could manage that. She was only a 16year old actress then but she conveyed a mothering instinct that goes back to the ageless beginnings of life on this planet. When the goslings were following her around much of the photography was from ground level. Later when they were all flying the photography was right there in the flying formation. You were seeing the birds in flight right next to you. The beauty of motion was unbelievable. I thought 'How could anyone shoot these creatures?' There is beauty in seeing them fly. There is beauty in seeing them in their habitat. But the overwhelming beauty is in their living. They deserved that life. It made me think of this sad planet and the billions of creatures that have died because of the human race. Here was a story that went against the slaughter. When Amy and her birds arrived at their destination in Chesapeake Bay I had misty eyes.So I'm a soft touch.".

One issue had this incredible story by some kindly if eccentric Canadian folks who had raised a gaggle of baby geese and you know the rest. Details of aviation aside the story warmed my heart. Most Unusual.A year or so later I took my kids to see Flyaway Home expecting a mildly entertaining nature documentary like Disney's old Prairie Dog Town with an aviation twist.What I saw was a superbly crafted and deeply touching little masterpiece. I was in tears by the end.Metaphors of kindness aside this film will touch any heart however hardened or scarred .And the kids liked it too.";

	schema:headline " A Story of Returning to Joy";
	schema:reviewBody "The greatest challenge any of us will ever face is how to regain the ability to reach for joy after the loss of a loved one.  Especially when that loss is abrupt and occurs at an age before one has developed the capacities to manage it. That is the overarching and powerful theme that Fly Away Home manages to evoke so beautifully.It's difficult to pinpoint which of the masterfully developed elements of filmmaking that make this movie such a joy to watch again and again. But surely it all comes down to the great storytelling ability of Mr. Carol Ballard. Everything is harnessed to tell the story a basic element of drama surprisingly ignored these days in Hollywood of a girl who loses her mother at a critical point in her life and has to find a way to the rest of her life while reeling from the trauma and uncertain of how to survive her grief.The discovery of an abandoned nest of Canadian geese eggs is the simple overlaying metaphor that takes us on her journey.  The great difference between this movie and other movies of its type is that Mr. Ballard resists the temptation to explicate the transcendent story of Amy's emotional triumph over her loss and grief.  Simply put the story is about the geese but it's really about Amy's recovery and reconnection with her future with her life  though there isn't one line of dialogue explaining that to the viewer.  It seeps out of the story through the masterful chekovian performances of Anna Paquin as Amy and Jeff Daniels as her father.  This theme is supported with such unerring consistency in the music Mark Isham at his most sublime the cinematography editing lighting art direction and casting.  All of the casting is just perfect. Especially in the sense that none of the actors ever seem to be pulling anything out of their bag of tricks or doing some bit you've seen them do before.  The quality of the work is such that much of the dialogue in the movie seems spontaneous and almost ad libbed.  The final sequence is a thing of sublime subtly powerful beauty that is rarely seen in movies these days.  A powerful wordless climax. Something that happens so effortlessly because the story that comes before has been told so completely and with such skill.  I cry every time I watch it.Thank you Carol Ballard for this beautiful gift of compassion and belief.Note  Did Anna Paquin actually move from little girl to adolescent in the course of making this movie or is it more of the master magicianry of Carol Ballard and his team?".

Jeff Daniels is a revelation as the father in one of his best performances and Anna Paquin is just superb in the title role. Of course the scene stealers are the adorable baby geese but Paquin's chemistry with them so motherly she was reduced me to tears on several occasions.This movie shouldn't be dismissed as an overly sentimental bittersweet bit of eye candy. It is to me and my entire family a truly beautiful well meaning and poignant film for the entire family to treasure for a very long time.

At the risk of seeming sexist I'm usually apprehensive at the sort of chick flicks she often chooses.This movie however was a home run. There were many things about it I loved.

The movie gives a vivid and often raw presentation of the relationships within a family particularly between estranged members and raises interesting questions about what family itself is and what it means. The view is utterly breathtaking as we're taken on a flight through the Canadian skies following both the physical and emotional journey of Amy and her father. The fatherdaughter relationship in any context is often a touchy subject and many films have a tendency to overdramatize certain elements of such a relationship. While the drama is certainly here with this one we see less of the verbal noisy drama than we do the quiet awkward tense and somewhat snippy sentiments which exist between the two. Anna Paquin is flawless. Jeff Daniels will make you laugh cry and applaud. The chemistry between these two actors is beautiful making this film one of the first and only that I have ever seen that has not made me despise the rebellious daughter figure. If this movie has a flaw it is only that it is a bit slow by times. Still for those who like me don't mind those sweepingly beautiful images of Canadian landscape even if nothing much is happening... you'll enjoy the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fly Away Home is a family oriented emotionally charged drama in which a young girl's mental recovery from her Mother's death is achieved by a monumental feat. Thrust into her Father Tom's world of inventions and experiments Amy is lost and uncomfortable in this new environment along with still being vulnerable from her Mother's death shown in her anxious reactions watching Tom try out his latest invention. Yet it is an aspect of Tom's life that Amy soon finds herself in after discovering Geese eggs once they hatch Amy is lead down a memorable path of courage and bonding. As Amy begins to raise the Geese as her own Fly Away Home becomes an incredibility touching story where it is hard not to want Amy achieve the goal of getting the Geese to migrate south. Fly Away Home succeeds on an emotional scale in placing the viewer into the predicament Amy faces and the love she feels for the Geese. The cinematography is an additional factor to the heart  tugging vibe watching the Geese eggs hatch and crawl out of their shells with crystal clear precision as if we are witnessing the birth in person is extraordinary to see and sentimental to feel as they are just as vulnerable as Amy. This sense of vulnerability makes the aerial shots of Amy and Tom leading the Geese to their rightful place in nature later on all the more powerful. It coincides with the soundtrack in relation to Fly Away Home's poignancy with the use of the song '10 000 Miles' towards the end of the climatic scene which had been the show piece of the opening credits depicting the death of Amy's Mother increases the atmosphere to the status of a tear jerker bringing home how much Amy has achieved. However there are some clichs which slightly spoil the experience. Having corporate bosses as antagonists is nothing new and tense moments made to briefly unease the audience most notably when Air Traffic Control are about to send out a war plane on Amy Tom and the Geese when they are seen as a UFO comes across respectively as platitude and ridiculous. But these are only minor flaws in a film whose good heartedness paves these criticisms over.So if you enjoy story lines with a feel  good vibe and the old fashioned good triumphing over evil Fly Away Home should be one for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a review of Fly Away Home and Wind two films by Carroll Ballard.Loosely speaking Ballard makes two types of films. Those in which humans tentatively interact with wild animals and those in which man interacts with nature via technology inspired by the natural world. In the first category Ballard's made fare like The Black Stallion and Duma in the second he's made films like Wind and Fly Away Home. Arguable one of his best films Fly Away Home is about a daughter and father who build an ultralight airplane that mimics the behaviour of and acts as a surrogate mother for a flock of geese. Using the plane the duo guide the birds to a sanctuary several hundred miles away. It's a touching picture filled with beautiful scenery gorgeous aerial footage sensitive direction and some wonderfully understated acting by Jeff Daniels Anna Paquin.Though his financiers force formulaic plots upon him Ballard dislikes heavyhanded storytelling and so tends to keep his characters quiet and muted. With his ethereal visuals use of silence and love for windnature Fly Away Home strongly conjures up the work of Malick and Miyazaki.The film has flaws some of its rear projection is intrusive some of its conflicts are a bit clichd some of its villains are cartoonish and aside from the opening and closing song Ballard's musical score isn't strong enough for such a poetic picture. Still these flaws are minor and don't intrude on the film's better qualities. While Fly Away Home involves an inventor building an airplane Wind involves a group of mechanical engineers designing a boat. Sounds boring? Both films are more interested in mood and ambiance than they are plot. In Wind the design team relocate to a huge hanger at the centre of a vast desert a world away from the oceans they hope to conquer. We watch as they sculpt away at their boat Ballard salivating over sleek hulls tall masts and mighty rudders. Muscles skeletons animals rocks wind and water are studied and observed the boat a failure if its body doesn't bend to the will of the waves.Both films deal with men and machines waltzing with nature our ultralight airplane is only believable to the geese if they perceive it to be their biological mother and Ballard's boats fail if they don't slice cleanly through the winds and waves. To resist nature is to compromise the design.Both films were also mildly influential in how they added to our camera vocabulary. Fly Away Home gave us some then new threedimensional camera sweeps and Wind offered several cinematic baby steps as well using specially designed camera mounts for both helicopters and boat hulls masts etc. Fly Away Home is the better of the two films  it's one of the best family films of the 1990s  whilst Wind is plagued by a bad script though it does also offer excellent mood and ambiance. You sense that Ballard wants to avoid conventional Hollywood scripts as much as possible but that they're necessary to provide some semblance of either structure or marketability.Fly Away Home  8.510 Wind  810".

	schema:headline " A movie to make your dreams soar";
	schema:reviewBody "There is already written a lot about the story of Fly Away Home so I'm not going to repeat my previous reviewers.I have watched the movie for the first time on German TV in 1998 by chance I zapped into the movie and stayed there mesmerized fascinated enchanted by its magical richness of animal goose beauty and lush landscape cinematography. When the film ended I had a lump of emotion in my throat for several days. Something changed deep inside of me namely the perception of nature animals birds specifically of wild geese. Something made click inside my mind and since then I adore geese very deeply. Before the movie geese were of no special interest to me oh how ignorant I was! As a matter of fact my love is so deep and the movie inspires me so much that I want get my own geese.Fly Away home's cinematography and script is performed what I can describe as silent calm quiet and serene but never lengthy is performed suspensepacked but never thrillerlike. Romantic but never corny or clich. Close to life itself and nature but never overcharged with exaggerated ecomessages. In short a perfect mixture of all the elements that make a movie worthwhile.The landscape shots are very idyllic Oscar nomination on this movie for cinematography and you begin to long and crave for a life on the countryside away from it all the boisterous cities and its citizens with their insignificant problems of their everyday lives. When Amy is flying in her ultralight airplane leading the flock of geese as their surrogate mother then you can see that the problems on land down there are small and trivial. That is where the geese show us how life is meant to be more simple more straightforward and peaceful. Brilliant.And the film music the fantastic movie score composed by Mark Isham transports all the previous mentioned qualities and features in a perfect manner. The introductory song 10000 Miles by Mary Chapin Carpenter and cocomposed by Mark Isham is a real tearjerker of the special kind. This song alone summarizes what this movie is all about. Love friendship a deep bond among humans and animals care for nature peace freedom and to never give up no matter what. The track expresses Amy's love to her family and at the same time the love between Amy and the wild geese. I cannot watch the movie without a package of Kleenex and I'm male and an adult a child at heart. I believe everyone has this ability we just have to show it more often and this movie can help to release the inner child in all of us.There is no lukewarm love story in Fly Away Home which is a big plus if at all it's only presented very subtle and unobtrusive. There have to be more movies like this to prevent a shallow development in our society but I digress. The main focus of attention is clearly on the geese who outact all human actors with feathery ease. Bravo! Please more movies like this! There are to my knowledge only a handful of movies where script cinematography directing music dialogs and actors come together and are mixed in this perfection.I can only recommend this movie to anyone who still believes in his or her dreams and wants to realize them. This movie supports you there and makes your imaginations soar literally. As for my part I'm checking out where I can get geese and how I have to keep them and gain their amazing friendship deep bond and love. One of the most fascinating movies Hollywood has ever done Oscarnominated and rightly so. Big kudos. Seal of approval Highly recommended!".

When the film ended I had a lump of emotion in my throat for several days. Something changed deep inside of me namely the perception of nature animals birds specifically of wild geese. Something made click inside my mind and since then I adore geese very deeply. Before the movie geese were of no special interest to me oh how ignorant I was! As a matter of fact my love is so deep and the movie inspires me so much that I want get my own geese.Fly Away home's cinematography and script is performed what I can describe as silent calm quiet and serene but never lengthy is performed suspensepacked but never thrillerlike. Romantic but never corny or clich. Close to life itself and nature but never overcharged with exaggerated ecomessages. In short a perfect mixture of all the elements that make a movie worthwhile.The landscape shots are very idyllic Oscar nomination on this movie for cinematography and you begin to long and crave for a life on the countryside away from it all the boisterous cities and its citizens with their insignificant problems of their everyday lives. When Amy is flying in her ultralight airplane leading the flock of geese as their surrogate mother then you can see that the problems on land down there are small and trivial. That is where the geese show us how life is meant to be more simple more straightforward and peaceful. Brilliant.And the film music the fantastic movie score composed by Mark Isham transports all the previous mentioned qualities and features in a perfect manner. The introductory song 10000 Miles by Mary Chapin Carpenter and cocomposed by Mark Isham is a real tearjerker of the special kind. This song alone summarizes what this movie is all about. Love friendship a deep bond among humans and animals care for nature peace freedom and to never give up no matter what. The track expresses Amy's love to her family and at the same time the love between Amy and the wild geese. I cannot watch the movie without a package of Kleenex and I'm male and an adult a child at heart. I believe everyone has this ability we just have to show it more often and this movie can help to release the inner child in all of us.There is no lukewarm love story in Fly Away Home which is a big plus if at all it's only presented very subtle and unobtrusive. There have to be more movies like this to prevent a shallow development in our society but I digress. The main focus of attention is clearly on the geese who outact all human actors with feathery ease. Bravo! Please more movies like this! There are to my knowledge only a handful of movies where script cinematography directing music dialogs and actors come together and are mixed in this perfection.I can only recommend this movie to anyone who still believes in his or her dreams and wants to realize them. This movie supports you there and makes your imaginations soar literally. As for my part I'm checking out where I can get geese and how I have to keep them and gain their amazing friendship deep bond and love. One of the most fascinating movies Hollywood has ever done Oscarnominated and rightly so. Big kudos. Seal of approval Highly recommended!";

Both have lost their love for one reason or another and are each other's companion and support.  Newman gets the fun punch lines Costner gets the woman.  If I were about 150 years younger' starts one of Newman's lines  it must be different for him not to play the leading role.  Costner seems right at home playing a shipbuilding sailor who is lost because of his lost love.Robin Wright Theresa Osborne is equally strong playing an independent and patient reporter who follows her heart and decides to find the author of the love letters from the ocean.  She gives Garrett distance gently when he needs it yet pushes back equally hard when she needs to.Much of the acting relied not so much on the delivery of lines as on the body language on looks on the strained silence between a couple who is unsure of each other often unsure of themselves yet strongly attracted to each other.Both Garrett and Theresa seem to struggle at conversation both uncertain of how to discover each other yet each finding an attraction they can't seem to deny.  Garrett is hanging on to the love he still feels for his wife who died too early.  Theresa is still recovering from a divorce and the busy life of a single parent.  Neither is sure they can be open to a new relationship nor are they ready to say goodbye to something that is starting to feel so right.The photography of the sailboats on the ocean were enough to bring out the romantic in me.  What could be a more peaceful setting than a sailboat anchored privately in a small cove of the ocean in the Outer Banks?.  We're given just enough peek into the unfolding world of a couple discovering love without it feeling like an intrusion.To talk more of the ups and downs would give away too many of the secrets that only the theatre the bookstore or the ocean will release.".

The pace of the movie and the dialog are not rushed some may even say leisurely. But that is a welcome change from many of today's fast action cuttothechase movies which neglect character development.This movie developed characters. I found myself really caring for all of them. The dialog between Costner's and Newman's characters son and father is very natural and believable. The meeting and getting to know one another by Penn's and Costner's characters is also very natural and believable.This movie could have taken the easy way out with a neatly tied together ending everyone living happily ever after. Instead it takes an unexpected turn but love is still the driving force a strong message about love relationships and living each day for what it is worth.Finally the scenery and photography are wonderful. Definitely one of the better modern movies I have seen. SPOILERS He finishes his boat named for his deceased wife but encounters a family having difficulty on their boat during a big storm. He rescues the dad and small daughter but both he and the wife perish when he has to dive in to try to save her. Update 2008 I saw it again after over 8 years and my opinion has remained the same.

Also mixed into this wonderfully crafted plot is Newman who plays Dodge Garret's father who acts as a calming effect for his son when trying to deal with his newfound feelings about Theresa and those for Catherine the object of the mysterious messages.The performances by Costner Penn and Newman seemed so natural it was enjoyable to watch actors not try so hard to do their best. I got the feeling that the actors truly cared about making this film the best they could for their fans because of the integrity and sincerity they brought to their characters.Message In A Bottle was a powerful and inspirational movie to watch and will be treasured for years to come. In addition it had two of my favorite actors and it gave me the opportunity to watch a brilliant actress come in to her own.".

Also mixed into this wonderfully crafted plot is Newman who plays Dodge Garret's father who acts as a calming effect for his son when trying to deal with his newfound feelings about Theresa and those for Catherine the object of the mysterious messages.The performances by Costner Penn and Newman seemed so natural it was enjoyable to watch actors not try so hard to do their best. I got the feeling that the actors truly cared about making this film the best they could for their fans because of the integrity and sincerity they brought to their characters.Message In A Bottle was a powerful and inspirational movie to watch and will be treasured for years to come. In addition it had two of my favorite actors and it gave me the opportunity to watch a brilliant actress come in to her own.";

Well if you're like any normal person you'd answer it. How do you form romantic chemistry between two characters in a movie? If there isn't already dramatic fire when you look at two characters then you have to form it will dialogue.In the new romantic drama Message in a Bottle all that the two main love birds do is ask each other and respond to questions. They meet when a Chicago newspaper worker named Theresa finds a bottled up note on the shore while jogging. She becomes curious as her friends find more evidence leading to this man that she deeply wants to meet. When she does meet him a boat worker named Garret Blake hey Blake is my first name isn't that neat romantic music instantly surrounds them. And the questioning begins.Theresa asks Garret many questions but all Mr. Blake does is answer. Is that a bad thing? Not really but when a movie is trying to form romance chemistry well this is not the way to do it. The only character who seems to be at all alive here is Paul Newman as Blake's father who masters every scene he is in. The scenery in Message in a Bottle is absolutely stunning. From the busy landscape of Chicago to the blue sea waters and crystal clear waves. This kind of material sweeps me away every time I see it in the movies. I would compare this film to the beautiful Montana countryside's in  The Horse Whisperer one of the best movies of 1998. The performances in this film are mostly quite good but none are Academy Award material. Robin Wright Penn is realistic and wellcasted. She uses confusion and sorrow to build up momentum for the Costner character. As for Costner himself however he is surprisingly bad. I mean just recovering over last year's The Postman this man should be rebuilding his career not destroying it even more. He gives another Waterworld type of performance acting dumfounded throughout most of the film. It's Paul Newman who is the real surprise. He adds comic relief from all the ineffective melodrama which permits most of the movie. The characters themselves are indeed likeable. Some are a bit stubborn and bullheaded others are freewheeling and carefree. This is okay because variety is good you know. I liked Newman the most but Robin Wright Penn is right up there with him.A major flaw in the film however is the ending which is completely out of place and disappointing. I have nothing against this type of closing but I have already seen this in material in last years City of Angels sorry if that gives anything away. It leaves the audience with a feeling of depression and disappointment as they walk out of the theater.In the end Message in a Bottle is a close call but I do recommend it. Thanks to some attractive features original screenplay based on a Nicholas Sparks novel and some fascinating characters Luis Mandoki has created a satisfactory movie that I did enjoy for most of the way.Brought to you by Warner Bros.".

	schema:reviewBody "Message in A Bottle packages the strength of a love story about finding love again with the breathtaking beauty of the sea and seasoned actors who make endearing characters come alive to bring an unforgettable romance to the screen.It reminisces of Bridges of Madison County but with a stronger and more reallife appeal.  Theresa Osborne Robin Wright Penn is from the city quite happy in her work as a Chicago Tribune researcher and as a mother to Jason.  But in her moments alone she has to deal with the reality of her husband leaving her for another woman sometimes forced to face the two of them and their own toddler when she brings Jason to visit with him.   Garret Blake Kevin Costner restores sailboats in a seaside town he looks after his father Dodge Paul Newman and keeps a shrine for his wife Catherine in his house even after her death 2 years ago.  He has left every brush oil pastel crayon and easel where it was as when she died.  It was through the letter he wrote to Catherine which Theresa found in a bottle at the beach that brought him and Theresa together.I thought the development of the story was fast paced at the start when the mystery of the letter sender was quickly revealed  in the first quarter of the movie that I wondered what was to be expected to happen for the rest of the story.  And after that initial exciting buildup leading to the meeting of Garret and Theresa the pace slackened  a bit too slow for my taste as the pair discovers their attraction.  What added relief to the intense romantic but sometimes dragging moments is the appearance now and then of Paul Newman's character Dodge.  Dodge has his own hurts to heal but his stubbornness not to let Garret go through the same path he did and his curt but witty remarks brings out laughter and makes him truly endearing.   One notable scene is in the diner when he flared up when asked why he chose a particular seat.  The romantic scenes are also complimented by the scenery. The glorious backdrop of the sea  you'll almost feel relaxed as you hear the breeze rustling the leaves the lapping of the waves on the shore and the cry of the seagulls.Kevin Costner as Garret could have done better.  He convinces us that Garret is a simple unassuming man but I was hoping to see the same man who wrote with such sensitivity and passion to his wife and I just couldn't find it in Kevin.   Robin Wright Penn however is very inspiring. She shows you just what it is like to fall in love in these times.  She shows both the vulnerability and the strength of which Theresa is made of.   She draws the viewers into feeling for her  her courage to go into something so unsure her excitement her joy in letting go and loving again and then her fear of expecting too much.Another character who brings comic relief is Theresa's editor Charlie.

I'm not really sure myself if this kind of relationship will work but who knows what can happen if we really try?The message of love in Message in a Bottle is courage.

	onyx:emotionText "Message in A Bottle packages the strength of a love story about finding love again with the breathtaking beauty of the sea and seasoned actors who make endearing characters come alive to bring an unforgettable romance to the screen.It reminisces of Bridges of Madison County but with a stronger and more reallife appeal.  Theresa Osborne Robin Wright Penn is from the city quite happy in her work as a Chicago Tribune researcher and as a mother to Jason.  But in her moments alone she has to deal with the reality of her husband leaving her for another woman sometimes forced to face the two of them and their own toddler when she brings Jason to visit with him.   Garret Blake Kevin Costner restores sailboats in a seaside town he looks after his father Dodge Paul Newman and keeps a shrine for his wife Catherine in his house even after her death 2 years ago.  He has left every brush oil pastel crayon and easel where it was as when she died.  It was through the letter he wrote to Catherine which Theresa found in a bottle at the beach that brought him and Theresa together.I thought the development of the story was fast paced at the start when the mystery of the letter sender was quickly revealed  in the first quarter of the movie that I wondered what was to be expected to happen for the rest of the story.  And after that initial exciting buildup leading to the meeting of Garret and Theresa the pace slackened  a bit too slow for my taste as the pair discovers their attraction.  What added relief to the intense romantic but sometimes dragging moments is the appearance now and then of Paul Newman's character Dodge.  Dodge has his own hurts to heal but his stubbornness not to let Garret go through the same path he did and his curt but witty remarks brings out laughter and makes him truly endearing.   One notable scene is in the diner when he flared up when asked why he chose a particular seat.  The romantic scenes are also complimented by the scenery. The glorious backdrop of the sea  you'll almost feel relaxed as you hear the breeze rustling the leaves the lapping of the waves on the shore and the cry of the seagulls.Kevin Costner as Garret could have done better.  He convinces us that Garret is a simple unassuming man but I was hoping to see the same man who wrote with such sensitivity and passion to his wife and I just couldn't find it in Kevin.   Robin Wright Penn however is very inspiring. She shows you just what it is like to fall in love in these times.  She shows both the vulnerability and the strength of which Theresa is made of.   She draws the viewers into feeling for her  her courage to go into something so unsure her excitement her joy in letting go and loving again and then her fear of expecting too much.Another character who brings comic relief is Theresa's editor Charlie. Robbie Coltrane couldn't be more perfect for the role. He leaves the audience on guard wondering if he is really the big bully which he seems to be or someone with a soft heart. Anyway I end up laughing at his antics whenever he comes on screen.  Best scene is when he gave Theresa a framed picture of himself.  In all of the movie I think it is Charlie who is the most unreal as I find it hard to believe that there could be editors who are genuinely caring for their staff in this way.Perhaps it is also the script that adds to the magic of the story  the dialogue was written so cleverly and the scenes made just so that I can say hey this is real life this is what everyday people say and feel and think.

I got caught up in the sadness and tragic shift in what might have been good live for both of them had Garret made a choice to be with her after she came to see the boat launch. I think the acting and direction was outstanding. Kevin handled his role magnificently and Paul was also outstanding. This is one of the first movies I've seen Robin in and she is indeed a great actress. I watch a lot of movies and am not much of a critic. But she turned in an Academy performance. Very nice musical score. I think overall this movie deserves a much higher rating than the 4 or 5 rating on IMDb.".

	schema:reviewBody "At Last! One of the most eagerly requested movies gets a Region 1 DVD release. For many years now collectors have been hollering for LONELY ARE THE BRAVE 1962 to be issued. So Universal have finally seen the folly of their ways and here it is in a splendid 2.35 sharp as a button Monochrome widescreen presentation that everyone will adore. Although there is in existence a reasonably good Region 2 version from Spain it cannot compare to this new release.Kirk Douglas is terrific in the story we all know and love of the free spirited latter day cowboy who resents the conventions and restrictions of the modern day west everywhere you go keep out stop no entry go away get lost drop dead. The wire cutters he carries in his saddlebags gets plenty of use! On the run from the law because of a misdemeanour he takes to the hills with his faithful horse Whiskey in an attempt to escape into Mexico. But the rough terrain and upward climb is not easy particularly for a man on horseback. In a wonderful scene where he realizes he would make it without the animal he leaves Whiskey and begins to climb a cliff. But looking back at her and with that soulful look in her eyes as she watches him climb he just can't do it. He comes back down to the horse mumbling..... you're worse than a woman. It is one of Douglas' best and most likable roles! Being alone for a good portion of the movie he dominates the screen. It is an admirable and engaging performance plus his expert handling of the horse is quite remarkable. Giving excellent support is Walter Matthau as the pursuing but compassionate sheriff Morey Johnson ye son of a gun  ye made it!. John Schillart gives an amusing turn as the guileless deputy. Judas priest Morey! he exclaims as the sheriff bumps his way along the rough trail at speed in the jeep. The female lead is taken by a young and quite beautiful Gena Rowlands as the wife of Douglas' jailed best friend. However the relationship between her and the cowboy is kind of puzzling! The kisses and clinches to my mind appear a tad steamy for a pair who are supposed to be just good friends.Hmmm! Also in one of his early roles is George Kennedy as a sadistic guard and watch out for the late Bill Bixby as the helicopter pilot. The only drawbacks I found in the picture is the over emphasis on the Carroll O'Connor character as the truck driver. After all the horse could have been hit by a motor cycle and end up the same way. Also the great scene where the cowboy makes that dash for the trees under gunfire and in the ensuing shot rides into a indoor exterior. Wow! I thought they had stopped using indoor exteriors by 1962! Also I thought the downbeat ending somewhat severe for what is essentially a light hearted drama and we never do learn what becomes of our cowboy!Sharply photographed in Panavision by Phil Lathrop the film based on the novel The Brave Cowboy by Edward Abbey had a fine screenplay fashioned by Dalton Trumbo. David Miller  who never really distinguished himself except maybe with Sudden Fear 1953  does a nice job in the director's chair and composer Jerry Goldsmith provided a wistful score with one of his early efforts.Surprisingly there is no trailer but the extras do have two interesting featurettes. One called Lonely Are The Brave  A Tribute has contributions from Steven Spielberg Michael Douglas Gena Rowlands and a very aged Kirk Douglas. The other blandly presented by some record producer shows Jerry Goldsmith at work scoring the picture.AN EXCELLENT ISSUE OF AN OVERDUE AND MUCH VAUNTED CLASSIC!".

I think of it the same way that Bette Davis says about Dark Victory that the role of Judith Traherne is 98 of me. Like the film's Jack Burns Kirk Douglas has charted his own way through life in Hollywood the way Jack Burns does. Burns's problem is that he's a man born a century too late.Run another of Kirk Douglas's classic westerns Man Without A Star side by side. Dempsey Rae in that film isn't too much different from Jack Burns in fact they have opinions on certain subjects almost identical.But the frontier that Dempsey dealt with in that film has changed it just doesn't exist any more. But Burns won't recognize it. I'm also not so sure how much film and television have influenced 1962's Jack Burns in the way a cowboy should behave.Kirk is returning to his home town from God knows what and meets up with Gena Rowlands who is married to his best friend Michael Kane. Kane's in jail for helping illegal immigrants cross the USMexican border. What to do but be a cowboy hero and bust him from jail. So Kirk gets himself in a nasty bar fight with one armed Bill Raisch and gets tossed in sheriff Walter Matthau's jail. While there Deputy George Kennedy works him over.So when Kirk's ready to bust jail Kane refuses to go to his surprise. But that doesn't stop Kirk who breaks loose and the chase is on.The nonconformist part of Jack Burns certainly must have appealed to Kirk Douglas. He invests so much of himself in Burns it's hard to tell where Kirk leaves off and Burns begins. And he's one of the most appealing of all the roles Kirk Douglas has. You root for this law breaking maverick every step of the way.Mention must also go to Walter Matthau as the wise and laconic sheriff who really does understand Douglas's mentality as no one else really does. In a lot of ways it's like the Charles Bronson classic Death Hunt where Mountie Lee Marvin truly is sorry he's on this particular job. Of course if Douglas had actually killed someone in eluding the law Matthau's duty would have been clear.The ending is truly an ironic one as the cowboy loses that part of him that makes him a unique American icon. Absolutely don't miss Lonely Are The Brave when it is broadcast especially fans of Kirk Douglas.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just couldn't let the previous review stand as the only review of this film. Based upon The Brave Cowboy by Edward Abbey Lonely Are The Brave is a very good screen adaptation of that classic work. Ed Abbey excelled at demonstrating the loss of the West either in the environmental impacts that devastate vast areas The Monkey Wrench Gang Hayduke Lives or the loss of individuality and freedom Fire on the Mountain The Brave Cowboy. Ed Abbey understood that the character of America surviveduntil recent timesupon rugged individualism that could unite with others in times of trouble. Jack Burns is an individualist who wants to live his own way yet he had fought in WWII and was coming to the aid of a friend. Burns does not try to make others live as he does or make them believe as he does he simply wants to be left alone in a rapidly shrinking world with his sense of frontier dignity intact. Walter Matthau plays the sheriff who understands his adversary too well his is the character that has lost the faith and become a collaborator. Matthau's bumbling deputies represent the federal government who stumble over themselves in order to crush Burns' freedom. Kirk Douglas considers this one of his most important films. Ed Abbey approved of the film and even makes a walkon appearance.".

Jack Burns is an individualist who wants to live his own way yet he had fought in WWII and was coming to the aid of a friend. Burns does not try to make others live as he does or make them believe as he does he simply wants to be left alone in a rapidly shrinking world with his sense of frontier dignity intact. Walter Matthau plays the sheriff who understands his adversary too well his is the character that has lost the faith and become a collaborator. Matthau's bumbling deputies represent the federal government who stumble over themselves in order to crush Burns' freedom. Kirk Douglas considers this one of his most important films. Ed Abbey approved of the film and even makes a walkon appearance.";

The problem is the open range is disappearing around him. A guy like that can't live off the land anymore because there's no land for him to live off of. Everywhere he goes the land is either owned or forbidden for him to enter. Kirk Douglas stars as the last cowboy who just can't get it into his head how much the times have changed. Especially when he tries to rescue his good friend from the local jail. This causes more trouble than he can comprehend.What's so funny about this movie is how much of the story scenes and situations were later used in it's quasiremake First Blood. The basic story line and his troubles with the law are quite similar. Walter Matthau and Gena Rowlands costar in this awesome film about a dying way of life. I saw this film several years ago on Turner Classic Movies. It's a sad tribute to the old west. Highly enjoyable and recommended.P.S. Gena Rowlands looks pretty good in this picture!".

It's the kind of life Kirk Douglas was still living as the cowboy in Lonely Are The Brave long after the horse had given way to the horseless carriage and most people were living in towns and cities working for someone else. His only accommodation to the modern world are a pair of snips he keeps in a saddle bag for getting through barbed wire fences. A man like that is just bound to run up against the System and that is precisely what happens when the cowboy arrives at the house of an old friend whose wife they both loved. She tells him that her husband has been jailed for smuggling illegals across the border and the cowboy resolves to get arrested and help him break out. However married life has changed his friend's perspective and he is content to do his time. After taking a beating from the sadistic jailer played by George Kennedy the cowboy escapes alone. The rest of the movie is about his attempt to elude the authorities led by Walter Matthau as the efficient sheriff in charge of lesser lights who admires Douglas enough to hope he makes good his escape and who pursues him skillfully but without enthusiasm. Much of the story is about the relationship between the cowboy and his inexperienced young horse who symbolizes the wild and free life being lost bit by bit. As they surmount a rugged mountain range the extent of their trust affection and ties to the land become clear while socalled civilization aptly represented by a truckload of new toilets threatens to do what the police can't.This is a very good movie wellshot wellacted wellwritten and with a very poignant theme. In it Kirk Douglas delivers one of his best performances.".

It may not win awards every time but every person who ever sees a movie with a good story has warm and fuzzies in that moment and somehow Karma rules the day. The Universe doesn't forget a good movie with a good story to it. Such is this movie. Kirk Douglas knew what he excelled in and what he did not. He instantly recognized himself in the lead role and he was right. You can identify with this cowboy of a man the last of his kind for thinking the way he does to want to get away while being chased and you join him as he is being chased. Live and let live rules the day but you cannot break laws while carrying or living that belief out..Kirk Douglas goes fine line on the subject. We are reminded that the Wild West consisted in a man his horse and his gun for its beginnings. Here we are treated to how the three got along and depended on each other. Great scene of a bar fight with twists and good discipline practiced by Jack Burns Kirk. I am a big fan of food scenes in movies and this has one where Kirk goes at a plate of ham and eggs. I know sales hiccuped for both with this scene. A good meal to a cowboy is a gift and Kirk makes the scene speak just that. Highly recommended movie and I have seen this at least 5 times over the years always pleased and captured and held unto The End....enjoy all you pards out there".

Not having seen the beginning I can obviously only comment on the what I have.The scene at the end when he's laying in the rain cradled by the truck driver his face being splattered by the rain surpasses all others before it and most scenes of chase injury and confrontation that I've seen in other movies. He's confused and bewildered as if he'd been abruptly jerked out of the past and dropped into the future. Where did it all go? What will happen to me? What is he seeing and feeling? His unresponsiveness to those around him but to his horse when he hears the shot is priceless. It was neither too long nor too short. I'll make an effort at recording it on Cable the next time it returns.".

When Jeri Bondi Gena Rowlands laments her husband's incarceration for helping illegals cross the border she mentions the consequences one might face for violating real borders real fences real laws and consequently getting mixed up in real trouble. No way anyone involved with the picture could have foreseen the day when all of the 'real borders' stuff is just a moot point and authorities are told to stand down by a lawless administration. This film couldn't even be made today it wouldn't have any relevance.I'm reading some of the other reviews for this movie and scratching my head over the comments linking it to First Blood. From the outset in that film Rambo was the character who was being provoked here it's Jack Burns Kirk Douglas doing the provoking all the way. I didn't find Burns to be a sympathetic character in that respect as he went looking for trouble and generally found it. With Stallone's Rambo you want to root for the guy who's being pursued by a megalomaniac sheriff who has a distorted sense of right and wrong. Sure you had Gutierrez George Kennedy here as the stand in for Brian Dennehy's Sheriff Teasle but he was an ancillary character. The principal sheriff Morey Johnson Walter Matthau appeared to have a more realistic approach to apprehending Burns. When he didn't 'recognize' him at the end of the story as the man he was chasing it said a lot about the sympathy he had for a man defying the odds and coming up short.There's an aura of the passing of the Old West that's quite pervasive with this story and a lot more pronounced with the juxtaposition of Burns out in the wilderness and all of modern day technology for 1962 brought to bear against him. Burns himself describes what it's like to be the last cowboy when he explains to Jeri why they never hooked up  Cause I'm a loner clear down deep to my very guts. You know what a loner is? He's a born cripple. He's crippled because the only person he can live with is himself. I've spent a lot of time thinking about that because for this cowboy it strikes very close to home.".

There are few other movie protagonists like this one. Other merit found in the movie includes some tense moments while Jack is on the run plus a gutsy and unconventional ending that you probably couldn't get away with today.If there is a flaw to be found in this good movie it may be that some modern day viewers may object to the pacing. It takes about half of the movie before Jack is on the run and some scenes do seem to run a little longer than they should. While every scene DOES provide some purpose I think the movie would have been improved had several scenes been cut down in length slightly.

	schema:reviewBody "Lonely Are the Brave is a western from 1962 an era when this genre was suffering changes. If you are to judge the movie from the plot outline you might consider it to be an old fashioned western but this is not the case here. This aspect can be noticed from the beginning when the character of Jack Burns Kirk Douglas is introduced. He is a lone cowboy traveling across the land on his horse caring little about tomorrow. He seems to be out of place in the modern world and this modern world is hostile to him and his old ways. One of the strengths of the movie is that it has a well developed central character. Kirk Douglas manages to create a believable cowboy one that is stuck in the past refusing to acknowledge that the world has changed and he needs to adapt. Jack Burns is indeed a lonely cowboy because his way of seeing things is not shared by the others. The film also has the advantage of having a good screenplay written by Dalton Trumbo Spartacus Papillon one of the best screenwriters of his time.This was Kirk Douglas' favorite movie of his own and you can surely tell that because he gives here one of his best performances. The acting is generally good the roles of Walter Matthau and Gena Rowlands being worth mentioning. You can also check out George Kennedy in one of his early roles as the brutish deputy Guttierez.The movie may have its flaws but it is definitely worth seeing by everyone. Due to its style and content the film also marks a transition from classical westerns to modern ones so fans of the genre should not miss it.My rating 7510".

	schema:reviewBody "Hadn't seen this movie in more than twenty years and so I was able to look at it from a more or less historical perspective. The story is simple. A middleaged cowboy escapes from jail rides his horse into the mountains towards Mexico is pursued by agents of social control with modern technology and is finally done in on a rainslick highway by a truck full if ironic crappers.The first time I saw it it seemed full of impressively new ideas. The cowboy Kirk Douglas is napping in the desert near his horse and is waked up by an overhead jet airplane. Douglas has a fight with a onearmed man in a saloon after he ties one of his own arms behind his back. The juxtaposition of the old ways a man on horseback in the wilderness and the new sheriff Walter Mathau with his jeep radios and helicopters.The chief impression it left me with this time is that it MUST have been a pretty good story because Rambo is practically a remake. The only thing is that if this were a McDonald's meal Rambo would be extrasized. Douglas is an ordinary but stubborn man whose alienation from society is never explained. Rambo is a superman who is deliberately mistreated by authorities despite his having won more medals in Viet Nam than anyone could imagine. Rambo whips everybody. Douglas is killed by a truckload of toilets. Lonely Are the Brave is a far more mature movie.Douglas's horse Whiskey plays an important role in the movie. Douglas himself may have learned how to deal in his own quiet way with legitimated authorities but Whiskey represents the Old West. He holds Douglas up. He's frightened by noisy helicopters and betrays Douglas's presence. He slips on a highway amidst the traffic and dooms them both. Whiskey is in a sense that part of Douglas that keeps getting him into trouble.The movie like most others of its period strikes us as heavily orchestrated now  booming dramatic drums and whatnot. But it's easy enough to see how a narrative dealing with alienation from modern life would have fit into the early 1960s when this was released. The 1950s were in retrospect a period of bland and prosperous conformity. The lawns of the newly constructed and almost identical ranch houses were as neatly trimmed and manicured as the haircuts of the time. The late 1950s and early 1960s were a prelude to the last half of the 60s when all hell broke loose. Kirk Douglas seeking freedom on a horse isn't really that different from Peter Fonda doing the same thing on a motorcycle.It's not a great movie but it is far more complex and human than Rambo. This movie is filmed without color but it's really Rambo that is black and white.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe David Miller's Lonely are the Brave is a confrontation between the modern era and the dying west. Despite helicopters a wagon jeep and police stationed everywhere Kirk Douglas' Jack Burns is able to climb into the rugged mountains with his horse. This film is about Jack's escape from prison after an attempt to persuade an old chum to break from the cell into freedom. His wife played by the always wonderful Gena Rowlands was once Jack's love but as this film ultimately proves he's a loner and admits that to her approving of marrying his best friend.Walter Matthau is just sublime as Sheriff Morey Johnson the man who must somehow figure out how to get jack out of those mountains and into jail. His radio operator is played by the very talented and underrated actor William Schallert. George Kennedy as a key role in the film as Deputy Sheriff Gutierrez..the man who viciously beat Jack while he was in prison one night..though he gets his comeuppance soon enough.The film is about all the modern means at Johnson's disposal yet he can not seem to nab Jack in those mountains. There's a nifty scene where Bill Bixbyof Incredible Hulk fame as a helicopter pilot is cocksure he can get Jack once they spot him from the sky. Jack however is able to shoot their tail downing them without harm to anyone..except a few helicopter pilots'..and policepride. But they keep after him nonetheless as we watch him struggle with that blame beloved horse as he scales those mountains.Like I mentioned above this film works best as an allegory of the dying west. It's clear Jack doesn't fit in this modern age and he's presented as a relic of sorts with no real place to go in the growing America he now resides. With an intent to go to Mexico he works eversohard up the mountains with this goal just in reach despite unsurmountable odds such as several men after him with rifles all the radio equipment to contact each other etc.This film is wonderful though because of Kirk Douglas who just exudes such charm and likability in Jack. You know he's a rowdy smiling' sort who loves to live and you root for him despite knowing he deserves to be in jail. It's a loving ode to the cowboys of the old west..their spirit is in every frame of this picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don Siegel will always be remembered as the man who gave us Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers and Dirty Harry as well as being the mentor of Clint Eastwood when he was just starting out in the acting business. Here he tackles very atypical material with a lowkey British spy thriller based on the book Seven Days To A Killing by Clive Eggleton. Although this is not really Siegel's kind of thing he manages to coax sound performances from an impressive cast and gets across a certain degree of excitement. From time to time the suspense slackens a little but on the whole this is an engaging enough potboiler.Major John Tarrant Michael Caine is a secret agent who is distraught to learn that his son has been kidnapped by a gang who want a batch of diamonds for his safe return. Tarrant's boss Cedric Harper Donald Pleasance has never got on well with Tarrant and even goes so far as to suggest that maybe the kidnapping is an elaborate doublecross hatched by Tarrant himself in order to get hold of the diamonds. Supported by his wife Alex Janet Suzman Tarrant steals the diamonds needed for his son's safety and attempts to elude his own colleagues plus the police long enough to secure the return of the young boy.Critical opinion at the time seemed to be of the view that The Black Windmill was a bad film. Generous critics were kind enough to call it average. Perhaps everyone still had Siegel's extraordinarily good Dirty Harry fresh in their memories and were unable to accept that he couldn't always make films of that standard. The Black Windmill while stilted and a touch dry in parts is certainly not a fullscale dud. It has interesting plot twists good acting always good to see John Vernon in any of his '70s villainous roles intriguing character clashes and a nice sense of genre. I'd rather have a lowkey thriller like this than one of the modern spectacularbutempty popcorn actioners. Try not to be influenced by the negative buzz.... give The Black Windmill a try. It's no classic but it's better than you might expect.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this film when it was shown on British television recently and was surprised that I had never previously heard of it despite the fact that it stars an actor as iconic as Michael Caine and was made by a director as famous as Don Siegel. The black windmill of the title is one of the two Clayton Windmills known locally as Jack and Jill on the South Downs near Brighton this windmill plays an important part in the plot.As in The Ipcress File Caine plays a British secret service agent but his character here John Tarrant is very different to Harry Palmer. Whereas Palmer was a workingclass outsider a former Army sergeant who was virtually blackmailed into joining the secret service to avoid a criminal charge Tarrant is an establishment insider part of the officer class. He holds the rank of Major. He is engaged in an undercover operation to counter the activities of a gang of arms smugglers selling weapons to terrorists in Northern Ireland. The film was made in 1974 when the Northern Irish troubles were at their height.The film starts with Tarrant's young son David being kidnapped and held to ransom. The kidnappers appear to have a detailed knowledge not only of Tarrant's family circumstances but also of the work he is engaged on as their ransom they demand a valuable quantity of uncut diamonds which he has recently acquired to fund his intelligence work. Tarrant initially believes that the kidnappers are connected either to the arms dealers or to the terrorists for whom they are working and confides in his superior Cedric Harper. As matters progress however he begins to wonder whether matters are really as they seem and whether he can really trust his colleagues.This is far from being Caine's worst film. For an actor of his distinction he made more than his fair share of dreadful ones Blame It on Rio and Ashanti being two that come to mind. It does however highlight one of his weaknesses as an actor namely that in the early part of his career he was not very good at conveying strong emotions. Most of his iconic roles at least from this period involved him playing characters who for one reason or another avoid showing much emotion. This could be because they need to keep up the stiff upper lip his characters in Zulu and Battle of Britain because they hide their feelings beneath a mask of impassivity Jack Carter because they deliberately avoid emotional commitment Alfie Elkins or because they try and distance themselves from their feelings through cynicism and irony Frank in Educating Rita. Certainly some of his more mature performances do show greater emotional depth such as The Honorary Consul and The Quiet American but in The Black Windmill he is rather wooden never suggesting the anguish and anxiety of a man whose son is being held for ransom.Some of the acting is better Janet Suzman as Tarrant's estranged wife Alex provides the emotional conviction that Caine's performance lacks while Donald Pleasence is very effective as the smooth but unsympathetic and possibly duplicitous Harper. The film as a whole is a professionally made thriller if not a very original one but an essentially American director like Siegel was not the most natural choice to direct a British spy thriller like this one. The Black Windmill is never going to rank on his filmography as highly as the likes of Dirty Harry and The Shootist. 610".

By 1974 the moviegoing public was used to seeing him in the role of a secret agent. Here he gets in trouble and although you know that by the end of the film he will emerge victorious or will he? I'm not telling. But the excruciating fun is in trying to figure our what will happen next. Filmed in Europe Black Windmill is directed by Don Siegel. Clint Eastwood credits Don for his success as a director and of course Siegel also directed some of Clint's best movies. The pacing is even throughout and builds to a suspenseful climax. Let it not be overlooked that Donald Pleasence in a supporting role is at his usual best. The human chameleon that adapts beautifully to whatever role is given him. John Vernon is especially menacing. To me seeing old movies a second or third time is like visiting with old friends. Everybody has their own Casablanca and Shawshank Redemption.

He should never have rushed to make this movie under such conditions. Then he puts the blame on Universal who in the beginning suggested he managed all three jobs then decided to release it as The Black Windmill a title which bears no relevance with what the movie is about.Sure the storyline is far from flowing and it's a pity since there are so many fine performances in it. Donald Pleasance John Vernon Delphine Seyrig Catherine Schell to name a few. Roy Budd's score is wonderfully in line with the atmosphere too. With all these Don Siegel should really have been able to blame himself for his trademark flaw used to shoot low budgets with lots of energy he forces a minimalistic loner hero inside the story. In his previous movie Charley Varrick it worked much better since the plot was more simple aftermath of a bank robbery with only a couple of important characters. Charley Varrick already lacked character development but with Michael Caine a counterespionage civilservant stuck between his bosses his wife and the villains it really bogs down the whole narrative.It's a real pity so many things just don't add up to a tense situation. There is nice interaction in some scenes involving female characters but basically the plot is not streamlined. One final word Don Siegel style the ending as in Charley Varrick is quite unsatisfactory. Not that it should be changed to some other outcome but all good directors know how to close an action movie shortly after the ending climax. I don't know why Don Siegel would add some postcotum shot having you wondering about some final twist but no it was just some fancy shot demonstrating how much the screenplay wasn't polished enough.".

One final word Don Siegel style the ending as in Charley Varrick is quite unsatisfactory. Not that it should be changed to some other outcome but all good directors know how to close an action movie shortly after the ending climax. I don't know why Don Siegel would add some postcotum shot having you wondering about some final twist but no it was just some fancy shot demonstrating how much the screenplay wasn't polished enough.";

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and again you come across a film that's somewhat a letdown even when those expectations are kept at bay. Don Siegel's mid70s espionagethriller 'The Black Windmill' that starred Michael Caine falls in that category. If anything it was that title which the story is adapted off Clive Egleton's novel Seven Days to a Killing which caught my eye. Siegel's adapt controlled workhorse direction tackles the subdued material with little suspense but constructing something tight sullen and dry with the main focus on building something out of its elaborately knotty but dubious premise. It's a true potboiler entangled with twists. While the material is stimulating with some good work by the solid support performances and an occasionally witty line and the sturdy setpieces are competently crafted however the pacing is too blotchy and in the end it builds to really nothing. It loses some weight due to the lack of suspense and urgency with a crackerjack climax that's just too quick. Michael Caine's composed performance is strongly delivered and John Vernon makes for an ideally icy and conniving villain. Donald Pleasance is delightfully squirmy which his character likes to really fiddle with that moustache and Janet Suzman provides some fire. Delphine Seyrig and Clive Revill offer able support too. Roy Budd's sizzling but lowkey music score works well and Ousama Rawi lenses it with a great illustrative eye. Siegel's touch is evident in both of those devices. An unexceptional feature but still its well organised and performed.".

	schema:headline " Muddled but mostly interesting plot heavy tale of revenge and espionage coming to form a workmanlike thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Black Windmill combines the minds and talents of a certain American filmmaker named Don Siegel with a certain British actor named Michael Caine between them coming up with this a perfectly fine if rather unspectacular and somewhat flimsy thriller about kidnap espionage suspicion and stonefaced revenge. Three years earlier each of the said men had had separate hits within the field of most of the above in the form of Get Carter and Dirty Harry respectively two films about coldblooded and somewhat self centred men willingly going up against rather impossible odds to attain a sort of personal or moral parity. The films were lean and mean thoroughly engrossing pieces featuring a lead actor some might say has never been better and a director handling particular material with the utmost care and attention. 1974's The Black Windmill takes the lead from one and the director from t'other thus cooking up a tale which is again a combination of both Get Carter and Dirty Harry in the form of search and rescue melded with coldhearted revenge before serving an edible enough dish which isn't as engaging nor as daring as the said films but is perfectly fine in its own right.Those expecting something anything better than either examples will be sorely disappointed The Black Windmill far 'talkier' and dealing more with crime and investigative procedure in a way that sees its leads as more mature without the material actually being as mature. When Caine's character organises to meet up with his wife covertly and behind the backs of those whom trace them for whatever reason they work out a series of codes or keywords that each of them know the other will immediately recognise and it's all played out rather tactfully and routinely. Both leads in Dirty Harry and Get Carter probably wouldn't have even bothered with such things wading on it doing what needs to be done before wading on out again with a putdown not worried if anybody was hurt or offended as long as they got what they wanted. There was more of an immediacy to those attitudes complimenting those films both a starker and franker atmosphere encapsulating the mindsets of the leads where such methods were far more primitive it was additionally far more daring far bleaker and far more engaging in that manner they were.This film begins with two boys playing where they ought not be playing lessso because of the sign telling them not to and moreso because a psychopathic criminal and his blundering accomplices plan on swiping the pair of them. We can tell something's not quite right with these military officials when they're picked up and brought back to a hangar the headlights of a jeep obscuring clear view of those instigating the scenario and a female second in command revealing a little more leg than a more upstanding respecting officer of her ilk might. Sure enough they are taken and it is Michael Caine's father John Tarrant of one of the boys whom is the parental victim along with his wife Janet Suzman. Tarrant is more broadly linked to the military a British intelligence officer with the rank of major whom is working on another job at the time of the crime to do with other criminal dealings the fact he has to pass on a stakeout mission for what arises suggests expertise within that field specifically in both tracing and investigation whilst maintaining an anonymous presence key items which will help in his eventual quest.The impact of his son's taking is made all the more affecting when the time comes for he and Janet to first find out what exactly has happened the calling of their house by the enemy a certain individual identifying himself as Drabble allowing the voice of Tarrant's son David on the phone and Siegel allowing Janet's pained reaction fill our screens. The film toys as to whether Tarrant himself might be in on it Caine's minimalist reactions and reserved response to the situation causing certain higherups to question his integrity and if he isn't then only adding to the professionalism and coldbloodedness his character surely embodies. With a ransom demanded fingers pointing in everywhichway and everybody rather perturbed at everything and everyone else the stage is set for Caine to embark on a treacherous mission encompassing danger and death to try and fetch his son and use violence as a means of getting even. The film is a firmer and more calculating effort in its depiction of both revengeseeking as well as peoplefinding a film heavier with plot which in itself isn't necessarily as water tight as one would have liked and only really allowing Caine to step out of the boundaries of the law in a stable but more watereddown manner when compared to the unperturbed pulpy brute force of certain other antiheroes in certain other earlier examples whom you felt were frothingatthemouth mad dogs let loose from their collars and on a mission to attain what they wanted.Siegel does just about enough to keep everything moving along the odd narrative hiccup here and there not necessarily pasted over enough for it to not be as glaring as it is while the postQ's workshopsubJames Bond gadgetry sequences of a certain briefcase being introduced purely so that it may be used later on are a little strange.

	schema:reviewBody "This early 70's British thriller is presented by a famous director Don Siegel of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Dirty Harry and stars a couple of very prominent and contemporary popular male names like Michael Caine Donald Pleasence and John Vernon. Yet it somehow ended up in total oblivion and it has not been released on DVD so far. Perhaps this can partly be explained because it's a very slow and largely actionfree movie that came out in era dominated by rough and extravagant exploitation efforts. Still if you're a fan of espionage or political thrillers in general you might want to look for the Black Windmill after all since it definitely contains some redeeming elements. Although completely implausible the story is fairly compelling with some inventive plot twists and  most notably  some excellent examples of dry British humor. Caine plays an agent working for the country's secret service a job that already cost him his marriage. When his 7yearold son gets kidnapped and the culprits demand an extremely high ransom to be paid in diamonds John Tarrant starts the rescue mission on his own. While his supervisors still wonder about where the leak in their organization comes from Tarrant steals the diamonds himself and heads for France to meet the kidnappers. Nothing spectacular happens for a long long time and it's only Donald Pleasence's and others wit remarks that keep you mildly interested in the film. The entire middlesection is painfully boring and although the ending makes up for much it can't possibly be called a classic. Oh and don't start looking for the mysterious titular black windmill right away as this uncanny building is just a tiny aspect in the story and not even that relevant. Not trying to spoil things here just advising the people that are like me attracted by the ominous windmill on the box cover not to expect too much.".

	onyx:emotionText "This early 70's British thriller is presented by a famous director Don Siegel of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Dirty Harry and stars a couple of very prominent and contemporary popular male names like Michael Caine Donald Pleasence and John Vernon. Yet it somehow ended up in total oblivion and it has not been released on DVD so far. Perhaps this can partly be explained because it's a very slow and largely actionfree movie that came out in era dominated by rough and extravagant exploitation efforts. Still if you're a fan of espionage or political thrillers in general you might want to look for the Black Windmill after all since it definitely contains some redeeming elements. Although completely implausible the story is fairly compelling with some inventive plot twists and  most notably  some excellent examples of dry British humor. Caine plays an agent working for the country's secret service a job that already cost him his marriage. When his 7yearold son gets kidnapped and the culprits demand an extremely high ransom to be paid in diamonds John Tarrant starts the rescue mission on his own. While his supervisors still wonder about where the leak in their organization comes from Tarrant steals the diamonds himself and heads for France to meet the kidnappers.

The plot is extremely convoluted a gang abducts the son of one man Michael Caine with no money in order to obtain diamonds from the government via Donald Pleasance. Pleasance then refuses the diamonds to Caine thus proving the gang should have chosen someone with money who then steals them and travels to France with a JamesBondesque suitcase. Meanwhile the gang is meticulously trying to implicate Caine in the abduction for some unclear reason which involves killing their own female gang member and framing Caine. But when he is captured by the police they help him escape...If this were not convoluted enough the writers obviously try to lighten the tone of its harrowing subject matter child abduction and torture with some comedy moments which seem very misplaced.The whole implicate Caine subplot is particularly strange and seems more to inject a bit of lurid sensationalism nude snaps and dead girl in bed and to provide an excuse for a poorly executed escape sequence. I'm not even sure why the captureescape is staged in France apart from the fact that French cops have guns and therefore Caine can be shot at. This brief French excursion unnecessarily causes another poorly staged sequence his need to get back into England.One also wonders why the girl would allow herself to be photographed etc. Planting evidence incriminating your own guilt is hardly a good idea and she must surely have smelt a rat? All this shot in the unimaginative fashion of a typically gritty 1970s British film with typical music too which makes us think more of a long episode of THE SWEENEY than anything cinematic compare the feeble pursuit on the underground here with that in the FRENCH CONNECTION which was obviously the inspiration for it.".

He would continue to have big hit films for the next two decades and several beyond that. But his hits were interspersed with some lesser films. A number were average and some even below average. Black Windmill is one of the first of his soso movies. The film is based on a 1973 novel Seven Days to a Killing by British novelist Clive Egleton. The idea of the plot is a good one and the film has a cast of fine actors. But the screenplay is poor. The film direction and editing are weak and appear to leave holes in places. The story is very slow and Caine's character Maj. John Tarant is weak and poorly scripted. His performance is even less than mediocre at least through the first twothirds of the film. This movie had the potential to be a griping spy and crime thriller. But the poorly written story and lack of energy among most of the cast quickly tire an audience. It's a strain to rate this film even six stars which I give on the strength of two performances. Donald Pleasance is very good as the hypersensitive nearly schizoid MI6 chief Cedric Harper. And John Vernon is very good as the hardened criminal plot leader.".

	schema:headline " Two thumbs up for this overlooked 70's caper!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which although in essence a comedy it was based on one of the UK's biggest ever bank heists. In fact one of the titles that this film is known by includes caper therefore that in its self is an indication of the type of movie. A of a bunch of lovable rouges who are not the violent or psychotic types who with cheek an guile pull off the biggest job of their lives. To be honest I don't really know too much about the real crime and can't comment if it accurately depicted the events that unfolded or the characters involved.Richard Jordan handles himself very well playing PINKY Green and is very believable as an easy going small time American born crook who seems very comfortable with himself. I have to add that sometimes American actors struggle gel well with English actors in a British made film the chemistry is not always there however this is no problem for Jordon who fits right in with his role.It's worth pointing out that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70's and 80's and never really got the recognition he deserved. He seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and B movies not a fair representation of his acting ability. He has played a corrupt cop in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE a sadistic killer in THE MEAN SEASON. In THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS he played a sort of comical Gordon Gehco character and also in the 1980's EQUALIZER TV show he played a good guy. All of this displays the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of David Niven Kurt Russell Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham.In this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning. You can't help liking Green   you see he really did want to go straight but once blackmailed it all seemed too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he relished the thought of all that money.David Niven is the boss and calls the shots the police inspector was brilliantly played by Richard Johnson who typically portrayed a smarmy but thorough London detective who clearly loves his job. The other supporting cast don't say too much but looking at them they were all very well known British character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or coppersisn't that ironic. Elkie Sommers Oliver Tobias do what they have to do and it's good to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role.To some viewers particularly Americans it would seem ludicrous that somebody with Greens record could land a maintenance job at of all things a bank and come and go when he pleases. In addition the stunt he pulled at the crown court after sentencing was not as far fetched as it might seem back in the 1960's and 70's security was not as nearly as tight as it is now.As for the movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations. With small time crooks the haul here was too much. There have been other movies where this occurs too i.e. THE BRINKS MAT. It's not just the disposal or the hiding of the loot but with so many people involved somebody is going to be careless is going to blab or just simply break once leaned on. In addition the authorities come down on very hard on local rouges when such huge robbery is carried out. Also they say there is no honor amongst thieves but Ivan was adamant that PINKY got his whack. You only had too look at his stare in the dock if looks could kill a look of total betrayal! How could he have dobbed them all in after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself a question why is it that crooks can be so stupid? Did Green really think that he could sweet talk his way out of suspicion a second time around? Inspector Watford was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well constructed alibi the whole caper reeked of inside job. In addition you have to wonder why they leave so many clues? A note pad with the safe numbers jotted down travel brochures for overseas trips still leaving his telescope around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery which was out of character.With some decent but common sense police work Insp Watford quickly had the measure of Green picked him up and soon had him singing like a canary. It just shows how despite well thought out planning things can unravel very quickly there is never a clean getaway for every body some are always going to get nabbed. Although it's worth pointing out that a lot of the money was never recovered.All in all an entertaining movie interesting shots of London and England in the late 70's well paced with a great ending. I would highly recommend this particularly if you enjoy capers.  Note I recently purchased a DVD of this but the transfer was obviously taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality. Therefore do not pay too much for it!".

The movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history.Richard Jordan who I must admit to not having heard of plays the lead  Pinky Green. A charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the lead bad guy also with the great charm for which he is famous. Bad but with scruples as when he refuses to deny Pinky his whack for the job. Whack in England apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in American gangster films! All the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable movie.What is perhaps best to me is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable I frequently find myself lost in plot confusions and various characters without ANY special effects. NO blood. No violence. Not even a single car chase! Just a well written story well acted well directed and well photographed! If I had any complaints about the movie I would question the music. WHAT is bluegrass music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in England?".

	schema:reviewBody "Delightful! It never pretends to be a masterpiece but it's a minigem of lateSeventies British comedy. Given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad it stars an American the late character actor Richard Jordan but at least he isn't the usual dull Hollywood hunk type. Surrounding him is the cream of British character acting talent led by a wonderfully waspish and superior David Niven.Niven's Ivan the Terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots. He also manages to be surprisingly menacing and intimidatingly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club when he drops the charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan will come as a shock to those viewers who think of Niven as being only a light drawingroom comedy star. He is filled with genuine power and ruthlessness as we see all at once how Ivan earned his nickname. All the more surprising given how ill Niven was at the time. Shortly after filming this production he lost his powers of speech to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis known as Lou Gehrig's disease. This is the last picture Niven made where you can hear his own voice being dubbed thereafter by the comic impressionist Sid Little.Alongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from Seventies cinema and television. Elke Sommer flashing her breasts in true Seventies era politically incorrect bimbo mode Oliver Tobias Michael Angelis Brian Croucher Richard Johnson John RhysDavies Davy Kaye etc etc. Davy Kaye gets one of the biggest laughs as he holds up a security guard caught making a phone call to the old UK analogue vinyl telephone music service DialADisc. Who you ringing?!....Bloody DialADisc! You gormless git! Great shots of London street locations making the film a period patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky rounddial manual handsets black cabs driven by Cor blimey gov! cockneys and ladies and gents modelling all manner of deeply dodgy lateSeventies retro leisurewear and hair styles. Highly entertaining quaintly dated in its fashions and attitudes and the stuff of late night cult viewing. Perfect to watch at midnight after the pubs have shut if you're of a certain age are feeling a touch nostalgic and have always wanted to see David Niven swanning about inside a branch of McDonalds silently intimidating an American via the deployment of a retractable telescope!".

When some of the crime underworld from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and rob the bank. Pinky is at first horrified because he really wants to go straight but when a twist of fate happens Pinky begins to think one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper amongst others! this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s. London and all it's highly dubious fashions are lit up like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmes' cunningly crafty caper. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an aged crime lord of some evility it's not easy i can tell you then A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square could well surprise you. The actors aren't pulling up any trees for sure but it's really not hurting the picture at all it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining. The score and soundtrack is perhaps guilty of over jollification during the dramatic criminal moments but it's a minor complaint to leave me thinking this is an under seen British gem.Richard Jordan takes the lead role of Pinky obviously hoping to lure in American viewers 70s heart throb Oliver Tobias a mass of hair is in there to keep the ladies interested whilst the blokes get the pleasurable sight of Elke Sommer and her delightful legs for company. Moving along at a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square deserves far better than the paltry 5.7 rating here on IMDb but just how many people have seen it i wonder? hmm go on give it a go if you the chance it's good stuff. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "One of those lovely little films that would be more or less lost to the 21stcentury viewer were it not for the interest of certain Freeview TV channels such as Talking Pictures in broadcasting such gems.Not a great film it has to be said but an opportunity to see the talented David Niven in what was sadly to be one of his last roles. Also catch the muchmissed American actor Richard Jordan whose portrayal of a terrifying killer in 1985's 'The Mean Season' has ever stayed in my memory as the lead character. A charming  if not stretched  role for one of the leads of the film classic 'Logan's Run'.There are a few crashing disappointments. The American actress of sultry 1940s'50s film noir roles Gloria Grahame is criminally underused in the role of Richard Jordan's mother. And Elke Sommer's character ends up as nothing more than the role in which unfortunately she was always typecast the token sexpot female. A waste of skills in both cases.Re the musical score there are a few inexplicable   inappropriate to the scene  motifs in the incidental music that are redolent of a Benny Hill theme. Being a 'caper' movie does not also make it a farce! This badly judged feature might in fact have been more to with the film's director  Ralph Thomas  having had a film career that included directing a string of lightweight sex comedies such as two 'Carry On...' movies  the 'Doctor...' films. But in most scenes the score  by Stanley Myers the composer of the entrancing 'Cavatina' theme tune from 'The Deer Hunter'  has moments of great perceptive interpretation of the storyline.The film must also be noted for a few novitiate roles by now wellknown actors spot Alfred Molina in his second ever film role as a ferry port official uncredited too! And Duncan Preston he of superb comedic roles in 'Dinnerladies'  'Surgical Spirit' as a blinkandyou'llmisshim policeman driver. Even John RhysDavies shows his future capacity to play a role with gravitas in a small part as a solicitor.Oliver Tobias takes a sizeable role a charismatic man if ever there was one. And Joss Ackland has a cameo. The fact that Auckland's role as the prison warden is uncredited on the film's cast list surely must mean that he took the role for fun. What with David Niven's stature as an actor especially as the 1st part of his superb  witty autobiography  The Moon's a Balloon  had recently hit the bestseller list I should think several people got involved in the film just for a chance to act with the great man. In fact it would be nice to dream that lots of old film career friendships were consolidated in the making of this Londonset film! The director Ralph Thomas had not made a film in five years when he made this 1979 movie  it turned out to be the last film he made before retiring.It is frankly preferable to gloss over the sad fact that this was to be the last film for too many of the actors. David Niven's quietly threatening  manipulative crime lord was one of his last film roles and the last role he voiced himself after disease affected his voice. Plus this was the last film of Hugh Griffith. And Gloria Grahame only made a few more movies before passing away.If you know London then the locations will be of interest to you. West London features heavily as do central parts of the city. And I would even be so bold as to swear that I recognised the microhouse of Gloria Grahame's character as the same splitlevel London house that was lived in by the character of Bodie or was it Doyle?! in TV's 'The Professionals'! I remember so well the trendy 1970s' house layout from watching the series reruns because as a teenager I always used to daydream that my first flat would look like it! So more fond memories...A little 'find' on the Freeview TV schedule well worth a perusal.".

	schema:headline " Fiction vs fact in the biggest bank heist in Britain";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1975 eight men pulled off what was then the largest bank robbery in the history of the United Kingdom. The Bank of America heist in Mayfair London netted an estimated 8 million in cash jewelry and valuables. A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square was made just four years later. It is a fictional story based on the heist with all fictitious characters and names. The film has a large cast with several prominent actors of the day in cameo roles. David Niven was ill at the time and the producers hurried to get some of the filming completed. As a result the film appears choppy in places. The main details of how the heist was pulled off are accurate according to police reports and later documentaries. But the background of the main character Pinky in this film is doctored considerably. As are the details of how Scotland Yard caught the real inside man Stuart Buckley and his naming the other crooks. In reality only 500000 of an estimated 8 million was recovered. The heist included cash jewelry and other valuables. All of the cast do a fine job. Richard Jordan is the main character as Pinky. He is based on Buckley. The real Buckley had a minor criminal record and had been in prison a couple of times. And he was an electrician. In the movie he is referred to a general service job that eventually leads to the bank. In reality Buckley answered an ad by the Bank of America for an electrician and was hired directly by the bank  with no background check at all. Perhaps some of the real details were glossed over or changed in this earliest film of the heist for one or more reasons. The truth may have alerted other criminals to the poor to almost nonexistent security at many banks at the time and led to a rash of attempted bank robberies then. Or it may just have been too embarrassing for the Bank of America at the time which it should have been. The way that Buckley made the keys to the vault gates and discovered the double combinations is accurate. He waited all one night crouched above the ceiling until the bank manager and other person with the combinations came to open the vault in the morning. And he recorded the combinations as he watched them turn the dials below. But that's where the accuracy in this film ends. In this film Scotland Yard nabs Buckley almost by chance. With his record he was among suspects whose homes the police checked. And they found the papers with the safe combinations written on them in one of Pinky's jackets. I couldn't believe that anyone as clever as Pinky would be quite that dumb as to not having destroyed those papers or concealed them in some inconspicuous way. Well the reality proved he wasn't as dumb as made out to be in this film. The police got to Buckley through his connections with the other crooks. The police recovered cash and jewelry from Pinky's stash as shown in this film. The movie doesn't show them getting any others but they did get the shares of two others. When the Scotland Yard detectives confronted the real Buckley with those he saw that his share was much smaller than the others. And that's what Scotland Yard used to convince him to spill the beans. He was one of the first criminals in the UK to be granted Supergrass status. He would receive reduced sentence and be given protection while in confinement then helped to relocate and change his name to avoid likely revengeful killing by any of the rest of the gang. The character that Niven plays Ivan is based on a younger established criminal Frank Maple. Buckley had known him before and when they met up again and Buckley told him about his job in a bank and all that he was able to do and seek Maple took it from there and planned the whole heist. But unlike the motley bunch shown in this film he recruited three top people for their special abilities. In time they added three more men for lookouts and other help. They pulled off the real robbery by eight men entering the bank right after its closing  with the front door key. They were dressed as businessmen and didn't arouse suspicion. And one other big variation from the film was the capture of Ivan. The real Frank Maple escaped the U.K. for Spain and Morocco and has never been found since. As to the capture of the real Buckley Pinky in the film Scotland Yard intelligence had been watching a couple of the real bigtime crooks especially the safecracker. When the heist group began to assemble they met often in a caf. That's where Scotland Yard knew that something was in the works and who they characters of this group were  including Buckley Pinky. So it turns out that the crooks themselves had been careless and set themselves up for eventual capture. All except Maple were arrested within a couple days. One escaped custody. In the film it's Pinky but in reality it was another crook. Scotland Yard eventually caught him in hiding several days later. In the movie Richard Johnson plays Inspect Watford. His character is based on the real Jack Slipper the chief detective inspector. Scotland Yard tabbed him to head the investigation. He was the best and was known for having pursued Ronnie Biggs after the Great Train Robbery of 1963. Other big names in this film are Elke Sommer and Gloria Grahame. Among the rest of the huge cast some prominent actors of the day have cameos. They are Hugh Griffith John RhysDavies Joss Ackland and Alfred Molina.".

In the movie he is referred to a general service job that eventually leads to the bank. In reality Buckley answered an ad by the Bank of America for an electrician and was hired directly by the bank  with no background check at all. Perhaps some of the real details were glossed over or changed in this earliest film of the heist for one or more reasons. The truth may have alerted other criminals to the poor to almost nonexistent security at many banks at the time and led to a rash of attempted bank robberies then. Or it may just have been too embarrassing for the Bank of America at the time which it should have been. The way that Buckley made the keys to the vault gates and discovered the double combinations is accurate. He waited all one night crouched above the ceiling until the bank manager and other person with the combinations came to open the vault in the morning. And he recorded the combinations as he watched them turn the dials below. But that's where the accuracy in this film ends. In this film Scotland Yard nabs Buckley almost by chance. With his record he was among suspects whose homes the police checked. And they found the papers with the safe combinations written on them in one of Pinky's jackets. I couldn't believe that anyone as clever as Pinky would be quite that dumb as to not having destroyed those papers or concealed them in some inconspicuous way. Well the reality proved he wasn't as dumb as made out to be in this film. The police got to Buckley through his connections with the other crooks. The police recovered cash and jewelry from Pinky's stash as shown in this film. The movie doesn't show them getting any others but they did get the shares of two others. When the Scotland Yard detectives confronted the real Buckley with those he saw that his share was much smaller than the others. And that's what Scotland Yard used to convince him to spill the beans. He was one of the first criminals in the UK to be granted Supergrass status. He would receive reduced sentence and be given protection while in confinement then helped to relocate and change his name to avoid likely revengeful killing by any of the rest of the gang. The character that Niven plays Ivan is based on a younger established criminal Frank Maple. Buckley had known him before and when they met up again and Buckley told him about his job in a bank and all that he was able to do and seek Maple took it from there and planned the whole heist. But unlike the motley bunch shown in this film he recruited three top people for their special abilities. In time they added three more men for lookouts and other help. They pulled off the real robbery by eight men entering the bank right after its closing  with the front door key. They were dressed as businessmen and didn't arouse suspicion. And one other big variation from the film was the capture of Ivan. The real Frank Maple escaped the U.K. for Spain and Morocco and has never been found since. As to the capture of the real Buckley Pinky in the film Scotland Yard intelligence had been watching a couple of the real bigtime crooks especially the safecracker. When the heist group began to assemble they met often in a caf. That's where Scotland Yard knew that something was in the works and who they characters of this group were  including Buckley Pinky. So it turns out that the crooks themselves had been careless and set themselves up for eventual capture. All except Maple were arrested within a couple days. One escaped custody. In the film it's Pinky but in reality it was another crook. Scotland Yard eventually caught him in hiding several days later. In the movie Richard Johnson plays Inspect Watford. His character is based on the real Jack Slipper the chief detective inspector. Scotland Yard tabbed him to head the investigation. He was the best and was known for having pursued Ronnie Biggs after the Great Train Robbery of 1963. Other big names in this film are Elke Sommer and Gloria Grahame. Among the rest of the huge cast some prominent actors of the day have cameos. They are Hugh Griffith John RhysDavies Joss Ackland and Alfred Molina.";

The story of an excon who has to go back to a life of crime has gotten overused throughout the years but this is still a pretty fun movie. And not just because of a certain shot of Elke Sommer!

Deep Impact is a drama Armageddon is an action film and delivers just what we would expect from an action film namely overthetop characters a simplistic storyline and an abundance of special effects. Deep Impact presents just the opposite Characters that are notably human several dovetailed story lines and it saves the special effects which are very good for the movie's climax.Armageddon did better at the box office primarily because it was much more hyped and because it featured an Alist star Bruce Willis while Deep Impact did not. Its enjoyability though is very limited If you are not a fan of the action genre you will not like Armageddon. Deep Impact is the substantially better film and reaches out to the viewer to a far deeper degree.As you certainly know the plot revolves around the fact that a sevenmilewide comet is on a collision course with earth and if it makes impact it will represent an Extinction Level Event i.e. the death of all life on the planet. Having about a year and a half's notice of this the U.S. and Russian governments send a spacecraft the Messiah to destroy the comet by drilling nuclear warheads into its core and then detonating. The movie focuses on three primary story lines 1. The young reporter Jenny Lerner Tea Leoni and her struggles with her career and her parents 2. The highschool couple of Leo Biederman who discovered the comet Elijah Wood and Sarah Leelee Sobieski 3. The crew of the Messiah.All three story lines are done in such a way that the viewer easily sympathizes with the very believable characters. The best done of the three is the spaceship's crew although the most time is spent with Jenny. They all suffer from the film's only notable problem The story lines seem somewhat rushed. Considering its broad scope Deep Impact clearly would benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop especially with the underdone angle with Leo and Sarah but the directors evidently decided two hours was all they could use.Deep Impact as I mentioned lacks an Alist star but it does feature superb performances from two of the best supporting actors of our generation Robert Duvall Spurgeon Tanner captain of the spaceship and Morgan Freeman Tom Beck the U.S. President. Duvall is definitely the standout of the film with an A performance as Tanner.As for the other actorsactresses Tea Leoni playing Jenny Lerner gets the most face time in the film and delivers a believably good performance. Maximillian Schell as Jenny's father is the one notable casting mistake I'm not sure what they were going for with him but they could have done better. Venessa Redgrave does well as Jenny's divorce mother.Elijah Wood now a star but at the time just an upandcomer works very well as the teenage Leo Biederman and Leelee Sobieski as his girlfriend Sarah gives us as good a performance as we can expect considering how woefully underdeveloped her character is. The film arguably devotes a bit too much time to Jenny and her father and not enough to Leo and Sarah.If you haven't seen this movie yet it should be at the top of your mustsee list. The film moves at a good pace if a bit fast grabs your attention at the beginning and holds it throughout and it features a truly exceptional final 2025 minutes. What stands out most about this movie is its human touch and sensitivity. It manages to probe an impressive array of human emotions in two hours' time and it will leave you with plenty to think about  although it probably will not leave you with dry eyes. There are precisely three movies I have seen that caused the room to get dusty around me if you get my drift and this is one of them.In conclusion See this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen such films as Armageddon and The Day After Tomorrow I really expected this film to be basically an effects demo reel. Most disaster films fit into this category their plot is loosely tied together with some major event humanity is threatened a group of heroes is sent to try to save the world and mankind prevails over nature. The rest of the film is essentially nifty visual effects that don't do much to enhance the plot.So when I saw the first half of Deep Impact I was amazed. Apart from a brief montage of special effects in the opening sequence a car crash that simply screams big budget the movie is one of the first disaster movies I've seen that actually focuses more on the human side of the drama rather than the awesome visual effects that computers can accomplish.Many times during the film especially during the latter half I felt myself touched by the realism that the actors and actresses convey. There are moments when you realize how fragile and precious life is and that's saying something for a film of this budget.While the visual effects are indeed impressive there are other features that make Deep Impact a necessary film to watch. James Horner's music is strikingly similar to his previous Titanic and Apollo 13 scores but it is still hauntingly beautiful and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. Tea Leoni does a good job of portraying a newscaster attempting to cover the events surrounding her while dealing with her own personal emotions which is undoubtedly a hard act to pull off. Elijah Wood shows his skill years before Lord of the Rings hit theaters. The other actors and actresses are very realistic and emotional and the movie flows smoothly with their presence.All in all this movie is not one to be missed. Keep an open mind while watching this movie don't watch it with the misconception that it's just going to be another one of those bigbudget dull blockbuster films that gets churned out every summer. This one dares to avoid the seemingly standard clichs set by other films of the genre which makes it a truly unique film to experience.Score 910".

	onyx:emotionText "Having seen such films as Armageddon and The Day After Tomorrow I really expected this film to be basically an effects demo reel. Most disaster films fit into this category their plot is loosely tied together with some major event humanity is threatened a group of heroes is sent to try to save the world and mankind prevails over nature. The rest of the film is essentially nifty visual effects that don't do much to enhance the plot.So when I saw the first half of Deep Impact I was amazed. Apart from a brief montage of special effects in the opening sequence a car crash that simply screams big budget the movie is one of the first disaster movies I've seen that actually focuses more on the human side of the drama rather than the awesome visual effects that computers can accomplish.Many times during the film especially during the latter half I felt myself touched by the realism that the actors and actresses convey.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems 1998 was the year Hollywood turned to the idea of the world being decimated by objects from outer space to fuel their disaster films. Both 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon' were released in that year but while I did enjoy the thrill and special effects of the latter film I find 'Deep Impact' the superior of the two.The film begins when a teenage amateur astronomer discover a comet on a direct collision course for the Earth. The world is then thrown into turmoil has humanity has to accept their possible extinction. While NASA sends a shuttle up with the intention to try to blow the comet to bits the US government selects people to be saved in a cave they are building to withstand the event. Focusing on various unrelated characters the film shows how people react differently to the destruction of all that they know.The brilliant cast including Morgan Freeman Vanessa Redgrave Robert Devall Elijah Wood Ron Eldard and many others all given great depictions of their characters. It is because of their ability to bring their respective characters to life that 'Deep Impact' stands up so well as it is a very emotional and character driven story as opposed to 'Armageddon' which relied much more on humour and special effects to sell it. Ta Leoni is the only one who doesn't shine through like her costars as her performance is quite bland and doesn't capture her character's turbulent emotions. However as the rest of the cast give great performances it's easy to overlook her. And even though there is much attention given to establishing the characters doesn't mean the film skimps when it comes to the special effects. Both the scenes in space and those on Earth when the comet hits the planet are wellhandled visually. It features some of the best special effects of planetary annihilation that I've ever seen and I'm a big fan of these disaster flicks.What makes 'Deep Impact' rather unique in terms of disaster films is that it gives a very human side to tragedy and devastation by showing how ordinary people cope in times of crisis but it avoids the trap of being trite and overlysentimental. It's a shame the film is so underrated then as it is a film that would appeal to scifi fans and those seeking an interesting story with strong characters.".

The solution to the problem was more real in Deep Impact and the time frame was much more believable. I like how the film focused more on what was happening on earth rather than in the spaceship. The end was interesting because the disaster wasn't totally averted so there was no cheerful hugging in the end with lame Aerosmith playing over it. The only thing that bothered me was that all of the nuclear missiles from the US and Russia had no effect on the comet. Wouldn't several hundred nukes do something? anything? and why wasn't the Messiah destroyed in the blast? So overall good flick deserves more credit.".

I've seen this film several times and EVERY TIME it gets me a little mistyeyed at certain points in the film.  Since the release of this film and Armageddon I've been unsure which of the two I liked better.  I have always been leaning towards Deep Impact so today I watched the film again to be sure.  I definitely believe that Deep Impact is a better film.  Although Armageddon is a fantastic movie in it's own right.  I like Deep Impact better because I feel the story is much more realistic and slightly more interesting.  Also the acting in this film is just fantastic but again Armageddon was wellacted as well.  After viewing the film again today I thought ya know there is virtually nothing in the film that I really disliked whereas there are a number of things in Armageddon that I really disliked!  The cast in this film is absolutely superb!  You've got Robert Duvall Tea Leoni Elijah Wood Vanessa Redgrave Morgan Freeman Maximilian Schell James Cromwell Ron Eldard Jon Faverau Laura Innes Mary McCormack Richard Schiff Leelee Sobieski Blair Underwood Dougray Scott and Kurtwood Smith.  They all did a superb job in this film and I think they all deserve a great deal of credit.  I really liked that all the characters in the film were likeable.  There wasn't a single one that rubbed me the wrong way they were all very well done characters.  I have to mention the special effects as well.  They are just mindblowing!  All of the scenes with the astronauts on the comet are just superb!  ...And the ship that they fly looks so cool!  Also the scene where the smaller comet hits the earth is just great!  The level of detail is unbelievable in some of the scenes.  You should see this film for the special effects alone.  If you like science fiction films with a great story that is quite touching at times then by all means go see it.  This film is honestly one of the better movies I've seen in quite some time.  I truly hope that you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading.Chris".

	schema:reviewBody "What would you do if the end of the world was near?  How would you react if you knew that there was no way you were going to survive what was about to happen?  Would you want to survive what was about to happen?  Deep Impact is an excellent film that tells the story of a giant comet that is heading towards earth and unless it is stopped it will destroy everything.  It contains many interpersonal relationships and it examines how people would react if the end was near.  It doesn't get as deep as Last Night at examining those issues but what it does better than Last Night and even Armageddon  another film that I loved  is it shows a little more about relationships.  It has a father and daughter trying to patch things up before the end is upon them.  It shows young love parental love and the love for a country and the world we live in.  Deep Impact had a deeper impact on me and I really admire both Hollywood summer films that came out and dealt with this issue.  But Deep Impact has more to say than Armageddon does.One of the things that I admired so much about this film was how Tea Leoni was so hell bent on uncovering a story so that she could move up in the ranks of reporting and in the process she uncovers something bigger than any political scandal could ever be.  At first she is following a tip about some senator that has retired from office rather urgently.  She has transcripts with him talking about a girl named Ellie.  And she is determined to uncover who Ellie is so she can embarrass the senator and quicken her pursuit to greatness.  She finally confronts the senator on the dock where he is laoding a boat with what looks to be enough supplies to last for a year.  She tries to bully the senator into telling her the story but he refuses.  She then does some research on the Internet and finds out that Ellie wasn't the name of a woman but an acronym for the comet. E.L.E. Extinction Level Event.  She is horrified.  The beginning takes up a good half an hour of the movie and it is during that thirty mintues that I became hooked.  My emotions were manipulated to the point where I felt like I should  be at home with my family.  The direness of the situation was very well executed.  And the rest of the film is on the same level.  It does a great job at making us ask questions about ourselves.  And we examine our own lives and wonder if we would be prepared if something like this ever happened.  I realize this may be getting a little sentimental and perhaps sappy but this film really tapped into my emotions and I think it did that to a lot of people.  I highly recommend htis film for all that it is.  The acting is top notch especially from Morgan Freeman.  He conveys the hurt confusion and utter regret as the president of the United States.  He knows that it is impossible to save everyone but he has to do what he can to save as many as possible.  He truly is a great and gifted actor.  The score is also a moving orchestra and the direction by Mimi Leder is swift and appropriatly crisp and dizzying in some ways.  I have never heard of her before this but I heard that Spielberg picked her himself for this project. And he was smart to pick her.  She really does a wonderful job here.Deep Impact is more than just a movie it is an experience and one that should be had by all.  A wonderful wonderful film.".

I think the people who don't like it are 1 people expecting it to be a summer blockbuster popcorn movie with a million special effects or 2 people upset because they think it's cheesy  has scientific errors. Let me address both points.First of all this is not a disaster movie in the style of Armageddon or Volcano or any of them. It's a movie about humanity's struggle to deal with an impending disaster. And in doing that it succeeds. Most of the film is supported by strong talent including Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman. In smaller roles Max Schell Vanessa Redgrave and Ron Eldard really shine. I was disappointed by Tea Leoni's acting. And Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski didn't really do much for me although they weren't bad.Second while the movie is not standard Hollywood flair it doesn't altogether escape the Hollywood curse. There are a few fairly ridiculous moments and plot points. HOWEVER compared to disaster movies I have to say this are extremely minor. To counter this there are some very touching scenes. I don't want to give anything away here but most of them occur near the end of the film.This is not the best movie ever by any means but it comes as close as a mainstream Hollywood movie dealing with the end of the world is going to get. Also James Horner's score was terrific.Definitely worth a watch.".

There are a few fairly ridiculous moments and plot points. HOWEVER compared to disaster movies I have to say this are extremely minor. To counter this there are some very touching scenes. I don't want to give anything away here but most of them occur near the end of the film.This is not the best movie ever by any means but it comes as close as a mainstream Hollywood movie dealing with the end of the world is going to get. Also James Horner's score was terrific.Definitely worth a watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "I recently rewatched Deep Impact for the first time since its release. I remembered enjoying it the first time quite a lot and wanted to see how it held up after all those years. Verdict? I honestly can't imagine what I was thinking that first time and how I could ever call this film quality entertainment. Most likely my teenage brain stopped at giant asteroid destroying Earth  sooooo cool! because this film does not have much to offer beyond that.With a global disaster movie you can go one of three basic ways. One you can get serious and make it all about the big picture  realistic whatifs governments' reactions impact on society scientific background. Two you can make it all about the characters  focus on a small group real and interesting enough to make the audience genuinely care about them. Three go for pure popcorn entertainment with great production values and a huge spectacle that never takes itself too seriously. Combinations are possible too  my favorite example is World War Z the book not the film which skillfully combines the first two approaches.Deep Impact is a complete failure no matter which template you compare it to.The big picture part is unbelievably stupid as if the writers had a single afternoon to come up with reasonably realistic ways this scenario might play out and on top of that never bothered to talk to anyone who deals with actual real world disasters. The idea of everyone just going about their daily lives up to the last moment instead of putting a sizable portion of the nation's resources into preparing the majority of the population for the aftermath is too dumb for words. The idea of millions of people dying in the first impact because despite knowing months in advance about it no one thought to evacuate the coast may be even worse.The characters are equally awful. First of all there are too many of them. There's only time for a brief introduction and as a result no one goes beyond a cardboard cutout with a couple of hamhandedly presented personality traits. The ones we're supposed to care about  Jenny and Leo with their families  are merely devices for generating artificial drama. Their idiotic actions are supposed to make the audience sympathize with them and feel their emotions. In my case they made me wish the tsunami would hurry up and wash them away already with the sole exception of Jenny's mother who I thought was rather interesting and well played.Finally Deep Impact is too cheap too serious and too boring to be successful in the last category  pure silly fun. The special effects are third rate the humor nonexistent and the plot slowly stumbles towards one of the least satisfying endings in the history of the disaster film genre. The climax should either tie up all the parts of the plot into a nice satisfying package or leave us wondering about what happens next  on the big planetary scale as well as with the characters we've come to care about. In Deep Impact the character are either killed by their unfathomable stupidity pretending to be deep sentiment and romantic natures or they simply disappear their future fate unknown and unimportant though I imagine quite a lot of regrets in their future concerning the needless deaths of their loved ones. The big picture is narrowed down to an optimistic speech and the image of reconstruction of a single part of a single country which seems to stand for the entirety of human race in this case.Ultimately the film that features one of the greatest natural disasters imaginable ends not with a bang but with a disinterested whimper. Which could be considered quite an achievement but not the kind I would give any stars for.".

Its Tuesday night and I don't want to start on my homework yet so I thought I would give this classic a view.Now I'm not an astronomy major but I'm pretty sure an Earth killing comet would be spotted by someone other than a group of snotty nose kids in a field since yanno people look for comets all of the time. Furthermore there is no way the Government which can't even keep itself funded half of the time could keep the news secret since eventually you would be able to SEE the comet with your naked eye. Also blowing a comet up only creates more chucks of ice that basically equals the mass of the entire comet. Therefore you would not only still have to deal with the full effects of the impact but debris would hit more places around the globe.The science in this movie is bad but considering this was probably a summer blockbuster aimed at basically stealing 7 bucks from dumb Americans its OK. What is NOT OK is the acting and the actions several characters take. There are several characters that behaved so stupidly and unnaturally I couldn't list them all if I tried so I'll focus on the dumbest. 12 year old Leo the kid that found the comet gets married lol to his 12 year old girlfriend. They are offered a spot underground and will survive the Comet. Leo's girlfriend decides she wants to DIE with her mom and dad. Young Leo can't accept this and turns away to go get his girlfriend AFTER YOUNG LEO AND HIS PARENTS HAVE ALREADY TRAVELED TO THE OZART MOUNTAINS IN MISSOURI THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THEIR VIRGINIA HOMES. Young Leo's parents say aww OK here is a WATCH SO YOU CAN TRADE WITH PEOPLE ON YOUR WAY 3000 MILES BACK TO OUR OLD HOUSE BE SAFE SON. What parents in their right minds would allow this. You're sending your 12 year old son out into a world that will be on FIRE I 20 minutes with no realistic way of evening getting out of the parking lot before impact. Also remember this girl CHOSE to STAY with her parent and DIE in a tidal wave rather than be with Leo. I used to be 12 years old and every girl I meet was the one. I would never leave a secure location to go be with a girl that would literally rather DIE IN A TIDAL WAVE than LIVE with me.Anyway Leo somehow makes it across the country back to his Virginia house in less than 10 minutes with no means of transportation and finds his lover in traffic. This time she RELUCTANTLY agrees to go with him 10 minutes before the comet slams into the ocean. Young Leo outruns a tidal wave moving 1100 MPH on a scooter. Let me say that again. Young Leo outruns a tidal wave moving at 1100 MPH on a scooter. I guess that makes sense considering he got from the Ozark Mountains in Missouri to Virginia in 10 minutes walking. Maybe HE should have been tasked with blowing up the comet.Oh I almost forgot about the ending. The idiots in space nuke the 2nd chuck of comet saving the planet. Like I said before the energy released from the comet would have the same effect regardless if its a solid body or broken up into chucks. Would you rather have 1000 nuclear bombs explode in one place or 1000 places? Just Stupid. I can't believe this movie turned a profit and I can't believe its considered a classic. Morgan Freeman should demand his name by deleted from the credits. Just imagine watching a bad soap opera music and all wrapped in a disaster movie. I didn't even discuss the reporter. Awful. This is what I get for procrastinating on homework.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why is it that everytime someone had an idea for a movie in the late 1990s someone at another studio decided to bring out a similar movie ? DANTE'S PEAK and VOLCANO both came out at the same and both featured volcanoes suddenly exploding into life  and there's several other examples of this unimaginative  let's makes a movie similar to a studio rival  movie pitch from the 1990s . Perhaps the best example is DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon which feature a giant comet going to collide with planet Earth . I should point out though that both movies were pitched to different audiences . Armageddon is marketed to the unthinking macho American audience . It stars Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck  is directed by Michael Bay and is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer so unsurprisingly it's a pile of expensive effects laden bubblegum . DEEP IMPACT came out a couple of months previously and is by far the better movie . However it is flawed I think the problem with DEEP IMPACT is that it's probably produced to appeal to women . The main protagonist is female and there's several sub plots involving family issues   Gee Mom I hope the end of the world doesn't ruin my weekend    oh and a bit of romance too . This doesn't ruin the movie but I did find the heroine's trembling lip and tears in her eyes in every emotional scene grating and the movie does lapse into terrible mawkishness several times . I also found the concept of a  lottery draw  to send people into deep bunkers where they have a chance of surviving the apocalypse unconvincing . Yeah right I sure the American president is going to give trailer trash and red necks to chance to come live with him . America might be a classless society but it's not that classless and considering Bill Clinton  Often described as  America's first black president  was in the White House at the time do we think that either men or ugly women would have a chance of being selected ? About as much chance as Bill inviting Hilary into the bunker I imagine There are a few good points about the movie that stops it becoming an overproduced disease of the week movie . One thing is the cast  Armageddon had Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck while DEEP IMPACT has Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall . Do I have to spell out what movie has the better cast ? Okay DEEP IMPACT isn't a career highpoint for either actor but they do bring serious class to the production and there's lots of familiar faces on screen like Frodo Baggins and the bad guy from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 . The special effects are very good and there is one absolutely superb scene on a highway where thousands of bickering people are in gridlock  they slowly stop arguing and fighting amongst themselves as they look up and see the meteor pass overhead . On paper this scene might have seemed ineffective but on screen it's breath taking with a deep emotional impactSo in my humble opinion DEEP IMPACT is the better of the two movies and is probably the best cometmeteor movie ever made . It is flawed and could have been better especially if the producers cut out of the chick flick stuff but a good cast and some good scenes stop it from being worse than it could have been".

In this movie it takes an hour and 45 minutes before the dreaded comet hits Earth. When it does however there are some awesome sights. The sound was great on the DVD and the picture very sharp.Tea Leoni the main character an MSNBC reporter this network must have funded the movie with all the publicity it got in here is flat in her delivery. She speaks in a monotone most of the time. Pretty pathetic to have her in the lead when you also have actors the caliber of Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall. Both of them are fine as always. Also in the cast worth noting are preLord Of The Rings star Elijah Wood and veterans Maximlian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave.".

A great wave not only takes down the Statue of Liberty it decapitates her! Director Mimi Leder and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin are very big on tearful goodbyes that let's keep a stiff upperlip mentality which allows couples married or otherwise to stare lovingly into each other's eyes whispering dedications as death looms above. LeeLee Sobieski's entire role is based on a series of these teary farewells she's so deadset on staying with her doomed parents that her character takes on a suicidal edge. Yes she's in denial but her suffering seems to go on forever and by the end a frustrated viewer could possibly be excused for screaming Stop whimpering and move! How are the effects? Very good when they finally arrive about four minutes before the film wraps up. Some of the incidentals during the final devastation are suspect such as a twosecond shot of an elderly man getting hit with the wave from behind while he's sitting outside reading the paper is he in denial too?. I would think that the lotteryaspect of the plot wherein people are picked at random to live underground for 2 years would be more exciting than reporter Tea Leoni sniffing out a juicy story. The movie seems to start at much too early a point with introductions to the characters and to an asteroid exploration team that just chews up time on the clock. There's also the timeworn idea about what books should survive not Huckleberry Finn and Moby Dick again! Hasn't Rubin's thought process matured beyond 1960?. Naturally it's we Americans who suffer on the screen. There's a tidbit late in the film wherein Freeman talks about Europe and Africa suffering from the meteor's destruction but it's shucked off as basic info. The filmmakers don't care about the lost lives and homeless injured of other continents they have their own agenda. By letting the Americans scream and cry and crawl through the debris they can also let them triumph over all this tragedyenough for a feelgood finish. But if Bruce Rubin thinks these stock characters are the most powerful representation of America's suffering own then it is he who has been hit with a 7milelong hunk of rock. 12 from ".

The striking scene and the ones that followed of the devastation were breathtaking. Rather than disregard scientific laws and reasoning Deep Impact embraces it and includes it in the film.What I liked most about this movie was that it provided what could have been a real picture into what would happen should a comet be on course for Earth. The panic widespread fear and the tough decision to move only so many people into 'The Arc' made this a surprisingly moving film.The acting is mostly superb as well. Morgan Freeman puts out an amazing performance as the President and Robert Duvall is first class as is Maximilliam Schell. The only performance that brought this movie down was that of Tea Leoni. I like Tea as an actress just not in this role. She was the only one who seemed out of place in an otherwise wellcasted movie. Her dark pessimistic broodings did not go over well. She was just too stiff and rigid to play a character like Jenny Lerner.Deep Impact works on many levels because of the humanistic underlying tones. Humanity has never faced such a crisis before and God forbid we never have to however if it were to come to pass I believe that this movie provides the best window into a catastrophic future. By far the most complete through moving disaster movie made. Well worth watching especially the comet striking sequence. You'll be moved I guarantee it.".

	schema:headline " A noteworthy film from Korean director Kiyoung Kim";
	schema:reviewBody "Kiyoung Kim's The Housemaid proved an interesting viewing experience for me in that it ultimately differed very much from what I had come to expect about a half hour into the film. What we appear to have here is another film like Joseph Losey's The Servant which was a leftwing revolutionary exercise in which a lower class man enters an upper class household as a servant and ultimately takes over the bourgeois home throwing it into upheaval and chaos. Likewise in The Housemaid a young woman joins a wealthier household as a maid and instantly things begin to take a turn toward disorder and familial disintegration. It could easily be a revolutionary communist film like Losey's. It is not.In fact it is the polar opposite. It turns out that The Housemaid is actually an overtly conservative film. This film is undebatably a defense of traditional family values like faithfulness fidelity and monogamy. Another film with a virtually identical plot could have just as easily been an attack on those same values. In The Housemaid however the character of the maid is not the instrument of revolution the hand of Marxist justice that has come to wipe out every trace of bourgeois society from our microcosmic household e.g. Dirk Bogarde's character in The Servant rather she is the face of temptation the tantalizer that will be the destruction of a healthy happy family should the patriarchal figure fall into that inescapable abyss of adultery.Some viewers have interpreted the film in other ways though I don't see how they could. This isn't that kind of film. There really isn't anything ambiguous here. The only exception  the one place where interpretation of the film's message might become a bit convoluted  is the framing device that Kim uses at the film's bookends. I would note the likelihood that this was added for the sake of the censors. After all it is somewhat surprising that Kim got this film passed in the first place and the frame story which abruptly obliterates the reality of the film's central storyline may have been the only reason he was able to do so. Despite my usual partiality for any kind of narrative complexity or nonlinear structure I felt this device was mildly detrimental to the film's integrity. Regardless it really doesn't change anything about the nature of the film's message. Thematically the key moment in the film comes fairly early on immediately after the decisive act of infidelity. Kim goes to great lengths to underline this instant as the pivotal moment in the lives of his characters a moment from which there will be no return. He achieves this rather heavyhandedly by cutting away from the room in which the action occurs to a shot of a large tree standing outside the house which is immediately struck by lightning as if to make it abundantly clear written in Fulleresque boldface type This is the moment that changes everything! This is the undoing of a family!It's not a subtle film needless to say. There are however master touches throughout. The cinematography is certainly impressive as is Kim's direction. The laterally panning shots through the plate glass on the upper floor of the house are fantastic. It is quite a well shot film and Kim works inspiringly within the limited space of only a few settings. Dramatically however The Housemaid was somewhat disappointing. The film can't decide whether it wants to be a Buuelian art film or a Hitchcockian thriller and the resulting blend is very uneven increasingly as the film progresses. Kim never gives this film any real constant identity. The score was quite poor. With its obtrusive and highly transparent attempts at creating tension and coercing the viewer into a certain emotion it never ceased to intrude on the viewing experience.This may be a political film  it certainly has a plainly conservative message  but if it is it's not because Kim intended it to be. Despite being pressured by his government to foray into political filmmaking on a few occasions Kim himself was not particularly interested in politics. He once said North or south capitalist or communist ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes.Indeed this is evident in The Housemaid. Kim is clearly much more interested in the boundaries and barriers between men and women  the impediments that obstruct the path to intimacy and healthy relationships  than he is in any specific political ideology. And this is where the film regains some of its composure. Comparisons have been made to the work of Luis Buuel and Shhei Imamura. I can see it in terms of its portrayal of passion and conflicted attempts at intimacy between the sexes but on the whole I think those are pretty loose comparisons. The Housemaid works best as a psychological drama. When we analyze the motives of the characters and what drives each of them toward their respective actions the film comes into focus fairly nicely. When it tries to move into suspense however it looses its momentum as a drama and as a successful cohesive work of cinema.All things considered I think this is a good film. I can't call it a masterpiece or even a great film although I know many feel that way about it but I do think it's quality cinema that's worth seeing. My biggest complaint with the film is its extreme lack of subtlety in multiple facets of the art of filmmaking. Dramatically The Housemaid goes way over the top one too many times and thematically the film essentially boils down to a cautionary tale about adultery and infidelity. Nonetheless it's a film that deserves to be seen especially with the relatively small place that South Korea occupies in the cinematic landscape.RATING 7.33 out of 10".

It was also utterly bonkers the most outrageous plotting this side of Italian exploitation but it lacked the ability to see that in itself to recognize the madness and defy it. The Housemaid at first seems like the product of Ed Wood incompetence. Some of the dialogue and character behavior had me in stitches. But it soon reveals that to be a facade which the movie can lift and put back in place at whim so that it can be all things to all people not because of any particular notion of ambiguity shared by Kiyoung Kim because the movie is blunt like a hammer in the face but because it doesn't abide by any notion of common sense or realism unless it wants to. The movie behaves with the same audacity of its maid protagonist. It sets up an image of a socially upwards mobile household where a couple can afford to buy a television even if it means hours of slaving away on a sewing machine to get it and then affronts it violently perversely toys with it and corrupts it to the heart.In the end if any more clue was required we get fourth walls broken and a man winking straight at us.

The good news is that Hanyo The Housemaid is the real thing  the kind of rarity that fills the viewer with such astonishment that you talk about it years later. Kim Kiyoung's 1960 masterpiece must be seen at the first possible opportunity  if you have the luck. This black and white morality tale is pure black comedy the almostcampy tale of a respectable music teacher whose life is soon complicated with a passion for one of his students. The tone is not unlike a deliciously lurid preCode drama about the withering power of vice but The Housemaid almost takes pleasure at showing the incremental erosion of morality and the corrosiveness of sin. The strange subtitles some handwritten only add to the atmosphere. And if you're blown away by the deadpan comedy prepare yourself for an ending that will leave you slackjawed for days. The movie's a miracle.Hanyo's construction is inventive and completely unpredictable  a fascinating casestudy on Confucian ethics. It's so good that Martin Scorsese and other sponsors funded a complete restoration of the old print which includes painstakingly subtitle tracks.

Starting out as a typical realist glance into 1960's South Korea as centered on a upwardlymobile family after the plot gets settled becomes a hysterical and expressionistic tale of corrosive sin and deception. The transformation of one night's flirtation into a grandiose moral eradication is the one of the most stunning turns of atmosphere I've ever seen in a film. Also amazing is how your view of the characters changes dramatically as they are faced with this living hell. While researching about the director I found out that the actress who played the housemaid Eunshim Lee fulfilled the part so well that she couldn't find work after this movie. Audience members were literally screaming for her death at the original showings! See this film just for her you won't regret it! I can't say enough great things about the director Kim Kiyoung too bad most of his films aren't available in English!".

The housemaid character is a castrating hosebeast Not exactly the kind of Korean woman portrayed in most Korean movies made then or now.  Director Kim Kiyoung tends to turn the conventional Koreanmovie plotline on its head in this movie since there is no real happyending in fact things just seem to get worse and worse. The only other Korean movie similar to it in this sense is the recently released Kilimanjaro also an EXCELLENT film.  This movie is indeed a Koreanmovie classic.  It's just too bad that the remaining copies of such classic Korean films are not given the best of care since many like this one are in fairly rough shape.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a real surprise. I knew nothing about this director or  'old' Korean cinema so I had no idea what to expect from this movie. I  was really surprised at how incredibly well and professionally it got  directed and the story got written as if it all got done by some big  Hollywood names involved with years of experience in the business  under their belt.  Everything about this movie got basically done extremely well. Asian  cinema is not often known to feature the fastest pace but this movie  has a very pleasant quick pace to it and still manages to build up its  characters and drama as powerful and effective as any other old and  much slower Asian genre attempt. This is of course for most part due to  the directing approach of Kiyoung Kim that is nothing short of  brilliant to be honest. There are some amazingly well set up moments in  the movie that get brought beautifully and at times even artistically  to the screen.  But it's also due to the fine written story by Kiyoung Kim as well  that makes this movie such an extremely good one. It's a quite simple  movie in terms of that it doesn't feature that many characters in it  and it is being set for most part at only two different locations an  house and a factory. What I foremost liked about the story was that all  of the characters within it interact differently with each other and  each of them have a different feeling and opinion about the other. It  lets the story and all of its emotions and tension work out so very  well. And this is all despite the fact that the movie just doesn't  really have the most likely and convincing story in it. Or perhaps this  is more due to the fact that's its about an entirely different culture  so all of the character motivations and their actions often seem like  odd ones through modern Western eyes.  The movie is being a melodrama but with definitely a thriller  overtone to it. The movie features some classic effective genre  elements such as a great sense of claustrophobia a constant sense of  danger and unpredictability to it all overall desperateness and even a  femme fatale.  It's also being a very well cast movie. Not only do all of the actors  really let their characters work out well but they also all seem to  have the right looks for their part. They are also all very distinctive  looking so you never have to worry about mixing one or two different  SouthKoreans up with each other like perhaps sometimes is the case in  other black  white Asian movies in which all of the characters look  alike with the same costumes and hairstyles.  One surprisingly great movie that got beautifully and fully restored  by Martin Scorsese's World Cinema Foundation.  910".

Nevertheless The Housemaid remains as a stinging social  commentary and a powerful tale of lust greed and revenge.

	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago this film was completely restored and has recently become a classic to many people. Because of this I expected a lot from the film. Imagine the surprise when I saw it...and I felt like the film was just chock full of plot problems.The story is set in the household of a niceguy music teacher. He's very devoted to his family...and that's much of the reason so much of the movie doesn't make sense. You see after clearly establishing in the film that he's a very nice guy the family gets a crazy manipulative maid and she seduces him. Then after she becomes pregnant she falls down the steps and she loses her baby. It gets REALLY crazy now...she then murders one of his children in front of the family and they do NOT call the police or throw her out because the wife and husband are worried the publicity will cause him to lose his job!!! Then through the remainder of the film she torments and threatens the family repeatedly. Then after a crazy ending you find out it's all a dream and the guy who WAS dead then lectures the audience about affairs!!So what didn't I like? Well a lot of it was just how unbelievable the plot became. A film might get the audience to suspend disbelief once...but not again and again and again...which you have to do here. Also what makes it worse is that early in the film you see rat poison and again and again the film telegraphs that this will be instrumental to the film. Why is this a classic? Perhaps because the acting is good and the plot salacious. But it lacks believability and really annoyed me because of that the poison and the copout ending. Not a classic in my mind.".

Basically set in the 1960s music teacher and composer Dongsik Kim Jin Kyu Kim reads a story to his wife Mrs. Kim Jeungnyeo Ju about a man falling in love with his maid. The story then jumps to the composer working in a factory he his wife and their children have just moved into a twostory house. His wife is pregnant and becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family. So the composer hires a housemaid named Myungsook Eunshim Lee to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely catching rats with her hands spying on the composer and trying to seduce him eventually she lures him and becomes pregnant with his child. The composer's wife discovers his infidelity and convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident the housemaid's behaviour becomes more erratic including threatening the life of the composer's newborn son. The housemaid tricks the composer's son Changsoon SungKi Ahn into believing that he has ingested poisoned water and in a panic he falls to his death down a flight of stairs. Myungsook persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends at the point it started with the composer reading the newspaper to his wife so the narrative has apparently been told by the composer he smiles and warns the film audience that this sort of thing that could happen to anyone. Also starring Aengran Eom as Kyunghee Cho and Yoori Lee as Aesoon Kim. This blackandwhite film has been described as a domestic horror it is a very simple story of a woman hired to do the house chores ends up having an affair with the man of the house and becomes a deadly femme fetale but it has suspense and disturbing bits that keep you guessing where it will go an interesting thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "Well what I didn't expect was that this seemingly average film with all it's simple elements or limitations has managed to turn it into something complex and with thrilling unpredictability. I was shocked  to actually see this masterpiece hiding in obscurity and enjoy it immensely. Everything about it screams classic and yet it's techniques are even better than most modern movies. The director is a genius. The story itself instead of sticking to the formula of its genre has written a convoluted story of human morality obsessive love betrayal in such a way that you really can't predict what will happen and made it so thrilling that you find yourself on the edge of your seat waiting for the scene to unfold. What also made this film more interesting is that the villain is a female sexual predator with a seemingly unstable personality  which defies how Korean women at that time should act in society. This antagonist gets what she wants and she took control and made everyone around her submissive to her wishes. I wouldn't expound on the plotstory anymore. You just have to watch it.The acting is great. One of the best from any cast I've seen. Even the children were so damn effective esp the boy. The housemaid hands down is the star of this movie. She is so freaky and terrifying but still managed to evoke my sympathy. The couple did great too. Each one of them are worthy of praise because if handled sloppily their characters will lose something. Whether they'll lose the sympathy from the audience or credibility. Superior acting. I've read that the actress who played the housemaid has been so effective that women hated her so much that movie producers were hesitant to cast her in other projects. Her career went to a screeching halt. Pity.My favorite aspect of this movie is its camera works. Wow. I really love it. It reminded me of Hitchcock with its playful camera angles  uncommon camera movements zooming in and out from one room to another in a fluid technique. Every shot has a purpose even the littlest seemingly random things in the house helped in adding to the sinister feel of the movie. Add in the piano sounds properly injected in scenes the result is an ominous creepy mood all throughout. The editing is very clean and seamless. I really like that fade outfade in transition of scenes. Unlike the movies nowadays with their lazy editing.This film has been restored and the result was great with sharp black  white photography and even with those scenes that are patchyblurry the product is magnificent. The lighting is great. Again this is a superior movie can't stress that enough. The VerdictThis is a great film. So simple and yet so complicated. It teaches you that love should be taken seriously and treated responsibly and that one mistake whether it's intentional or not could turn your world upside down. A brilliant timeless masterpiece that must have been controversial during its time and still relevant in this modern age.".

The special eastAsian resignation towards tragic fate makes it double tragic and by the end you'll be gasping for breath.I also warmly recommend the 2010 version of hanyo which is not as much a remake as a inventive homage they go very well together.".

The evolution of the supposed killer from carefree youth to malignant immoralist is depicted step by step. The strength of the movie as a story lies in its focus on a web of characters and their relationships to one another rather than on the crimes themselves. We never see actual violence but only its effects on characters and their subsequent efforts to conceal the truth to escape from their situation or to satisfy some personal need. The movie functions mainly as a kind of indictment and I wonder if it would work were it not for the 'documentary' angle the movie as crusader for the truth bringing to light the possible culpability of a real person abetted by certain friends and family a man as yet unpunished.The motivations of this character the object of the indictment are accounted for in the course of the story as various traumatic and painful incidents from his life are shown or recalled and by allusions to deviant mental conditions or sexual preferences that are not. Whether these revelations are served up clearly or merely hinted at they somehow fail collectively to satisfy as explanations for the barbarism that emerges as the story proceeds. At the end the inner life of the putative killer remains obscure a source of dissatisfaction for a movie that is about character.So not a great movie but an engrossing entertainment if you are in the mood for a dark story that leaves you wondering how closely real events in fact matched up to this clever reconstruction.".

Jarecki's film Capturing the Friedmans won numerous awards and is among the best documentaries ever made. He has a knack with dark family secrets.In the film Ryan Gosling plays David Marks disenchanted son of Real Estate mogul Sanford Marks a powerful Frank Langella who witnessed the grisly suicide of his mother when he was very young. David meets the energetic and affectionate Katie Kirsten Dunst and the two dreamers escape Daddy's clutches and head to Vermont to open a health food store. Finally wilting under pressure from Sanford the couple returns to the city and David joins the family business. The good things are soon to end.Since much of the real life story is still a mystery Jarecki does a nice job in assembling pieces from the trial records. Along the way we meet David's friend Deborah Lehrman Lilly Rabe an acclaimed writer who seems to always be there for David ... as he is for her. We witness the transformation of David from loving husband to mentally disturbed murder suspect.Jarecki gives us some guidance on what might have happened and how the plan could have been executed but we'll never know for sure. What we do know is that there was not much happiness associated with this family despite the wealth and 42nd Street real estate holdings.The acting in the film is tremendous. Gosling Dunst and Langella are top notch. Yes Ms. Dunst provides what is easily her best screen performance ever. Support work from Lily Rabe Phillip Baker Hall Nick Offerman and Kristen Wiig is all strong and believable. This one will give you the creeps ... and rightly so.".

	schema:headline " Spectacular performances by Dunst and Gosling!";
	schema:reviewBody "All Good Things is a love story and murder mystery set against the backdrop of a New York real estate dynasty in the 1980s. Directed by Andrew Jarecki director of the Academy Awardnominated doc Capturing the Friedmans the film was inspired by the story of Robert Durst scion of the wealthy Durst family. Mr. Durst was suspected but never tried for killing his wife Kathie who disappeared in 1982 and was never found. The film stars Ryan Gosling as David Marks Kirsten Dunst as Katie McCarthy and Frank Langella as David's father Sanford Marks.From the beginning the relationship between Gosling and Dunst is very intriguing and interesting possibly the best part of the story. Their chemistry is very believable and charming. As David and Katie start their lives together everything seems perfect. However all good things must come to an end.David's father does not approve of Katie or of David's lifestyle. Disappointment is all he sees in his son. David seeks to please his father even if that risks his own happiness. Katie becomes increasingly independent hoping for more out of their happy life and marriage. David likes things as they are. Soon enough secrets from his past slowly begin to surface resulting in mistakes and consequences that cannot be changed. I won't mention details into David's past but it soon becomes apparent that this happy marriage wasn't meant to be. Jarecki does a very good job of showing us a perfect marriage as it slowly crumbles and falls into nothing. It's very effective and at times tough to watch.Although it is difficult to get into his character Gosling is superb. He does the best of what can be done with a character that isn't given easy material to work with. It's quite sad to see a character who obviously needs help but is never able to get it. Dunst gives an incredible performance. She stole the show. Her character is of a woman who loves her prince charming with everything that she has but as their relationship dies she slowly disintegrates into an abused mess. Dunst gives one of the best performances of her career.The first half of the film was good. Jarecki however did have issues with piecing together the second half of the film. This is when the supporting characters of the film became an important part in moving the story along. Truthfully we did not know or care enough about some of these characters. It was difficult becomes there was no one that we could really root for. It was still interesting but not nearly as good as the first half. Everyone gave great performances. Lily Rabe Kristen Wiig and Philip Baker Hall were wonderful. Not one bad performance out of the entire cast.All Good Things is an intriguing story that studies two people as they rise to their greatest but unfortunately fall to their worst. The performances make this film worthwhile. The film isn't perfect but I found it to be a very interesting portrayal of a true story that will clearly blow your mind.710".

And so All Good Things had all the right things to get going.On top of that the three actors are all excellent in their own ways Ryan Gosling Frank Langella and Kirsten Dunst respectively. What falters is something more subtle some combination of screen writing that magic of turning an idea into something concrete and direction that hard technical and aesthetic work of pulling it all off. It turns out that the screenwriters are both first timers and the director has one other film to his credit so there is a sense of still figuring things out that is evident here. The movie lacks elegance for sure though it doesn't lack intensity at times using wellworn but necessary tricks girl arrives at night into dark room and man is waiting in shadows for her etc..Not that this is a bad movie. The story itself grows and multiplies even as the characters remain somewhat thin. The one character who get complicated is the leading man Gosling's David Marks the troubled son who knows he's troubled and tries to hide it and eventually cannot.You can ask of course deep questions about why this man turned so rotten and the answer the film provides is that his father pushed him relentlessly in a dirty business rife with secrecy and power. That he didn't find salvation in the perfect Kirsten Dunst who was never demanding always supportive and loving etc. to the point of simplicity is part of his own tragedy. Ultimately this is a simple story about guy who as his father said to his face was a weak man. And if this is a movie about a weak man being trapped by circumstances and therefore given a license to violence it doesn't reveal or express those qualities in ways that would sway or disturb us.

	schema:reviewBody "ALL THINGS GOOD is a polished little film based on a true story that while it may not have the visual gruesome detail of the usual thriller tropes of films it is terrifying in its presentation of personality variations that produce a shuddering reaction on a purely intellectual level for the audience. It is both a love story and a missing personsmurder mystery based on a still unsolved case that continues to haunt New York investigators and reporters and detectives. What writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling have created from known and newly discovered facts speculation and court records results in a psychological examination of a powerful New York family obsession love and loss. The film relates incidents that began in 1972 and end in 2003 and at this time the truth is still unknown. Director Andrew Jarecki uses a superb cast and a fine sense of voiceover narration to interweave the puzzling history with the gradual dissolution of each of the characters involved. Sanford Marks Frank Langella is one of the wealthiest owners of Manhattan real estate the current head of a family that has long dominated the New York scene with its power and money. Marks is aging and is relying on his son David Ryan Gosling to take over the family business he sends David out to the brothels and filthy hotels and porn houses to collect rent. David is reticent to be a part of his father's business he is a deeply disturbed young man having witnessed his mother's suicide leap as a child. David meets a tenant in one of the properties  Katie McCarthy Kirsten Dunst who longs to go to medical school but at present has no income to support that dream. The chemistry between the two is magnetic and despite David's father's objection that Katie is not of 'their kind of people' David decides to marry Katie and move to Vermont to open a Health Foods store  a move that makes the couple ecstatic but is financed by Sanford Marks who eventually convinces David to sell his haven and move to New York to stay with the family business. In their Manhattan home and in their country lake front home! the couple flourishes until Katie mentions she'd like to have children  a force that drives David back into violent behavior resulting form his witnessing his mother's suicide David can't understand why Katie would want anything but the obvious life of wealth they enjoy. The shell is cracked and the subsequent events include Katie becoming pregnant only to be forced by David to terminate the pregnancy Katie's disappearance after uncovering the facts about the sources of wealth of the family David's descent into drugs and irresponsible behavior and ultimately his leaving New York for Galveston Texas where he lives a life disguised as a woman his only friend being another old runaway Melvin Bump Philip Baker Hall who David engages to do away with a 'problem confidant' Lilly Rabe after which Bump is killed and dissected and tossed into the river. The murders are never solved nor is the mystery of Katie' disappearance. A trial the source of the voiceover throughout the film has been the lawyer's interrogation of David in the year 2003 fails to resolve anything and the film ends with the message that David Marks is at present a real estate broker in Florida. Frank Langella is superb as the heartless father who drives his family like cattle in the quest of power and wealth. Ryan Gosling offer a multifaceted performance of the deeply disturbed David and is match by Kirsten Dunst's bravura performance as Katie the simple bright girl whose life is quashed by a powerful family's sickness. The brilliant cast including the performances by Philip Baker Hall and Lilly Rabe  daughter of the deceased Jill Clayburgh has excellent cameo roles by Diane Venora Trini Alvarado David Margulies Nick Offerman and many more. This is a tough film to watch because at the bottom of it all is that it is true and the cases are unsolved. It makes us cringe but it is a very fine film. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "The dysfunctional family of David Marks appears to have scarred him. His mother's death at a young age seems to haunt him. He is the eldest son of a shady demanding real estate mogul and seems uncomfortable following in his father's footstep and getting involved in this financial empire. He seems bored disconnected. One day he meets Katie McCarthy a sunny and enthusiastic young woman. The story taking place over several decades explores their growing relationship and how the weight of David's dark legacy makes it all spiral down. Andrew Jarecki is better known for the wellreceived Capturing the Friedmans. This is his first fullfeature film and he tackles a difficult project but in many respect this seems a logical continuation. His past as a documentary maker serves him well since All Good Things is based on a real story. And much like Friedmans once again this is about very scary dark characters. Jarecki's direction is mostly slick and simple relying on a script and also an amazing castIt is David who narrates the story yet things are kept enigmatic and viewers have to reach certain conclusions. There is an economy in dialogue but everything is put in place for you to have a good idea of what is going on in Marks' life. There's something really powerful yet understated about how David inherited of traits both from his mother and his father pulling him down. Many people have described the film as a sort of mix of romance and mystery which is accurate. There are almost noir elements to the film.What is most remarkable about the film by far is the cast. Ryan Gosling continues his ascension as one of the best actors working today. Kirsten Dunst shows why she has become kind of underrated in a very difficult role. They both play every single emotion perfectly and must use a lot of range and in very few words we get their characters. Frank Langella as the father steals almost every scene he is in. This is an actor who always took his craft seriously but seems to be getting even better as of late. People talk about the chemistry between Dunst and Gosling but I was amazed by Langella and how he made these two actors better in every scene he was with them. Philip Baker Hall is another veteran who shines here in a smaller role later in the film. It's not easy establishing your character with little screen time but he pulls it. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent. Really strong point and good for Jarecki a guy used to film real people and not actors.Where the film is a little less successful is in drawing the audience in. We feel sometimes as emotionally disconnected from these characters as David and Sanford Marks themselves. Jarecki is almost clinical in his approach. The romance never lifts up and so the mystery grabs the audience a little less. Visually the film also ends up a mix bag of more naturalistic shots and weird artsy attempts. There are abrupt flashbacks and forwards that make for an uneven pace and a less engaging experience.Overall this is still an interesting take based on a fascinating reallife mystery and a rewarding film if you are patient.".

	schema:reviewBody "All Good Things is based on the infamous life and media circus around Robert Durst an New York heir to billions infamous for the string of murders and disappearances that have revolved around him for three decades. For those familiar with his story the film will reacquaint you and surprise you. For those who have never heard of him it will be even more shocking. The characters' names in the film are altered slightly but the story is nonetheless the same. Ryan Gosling plays David Marks who meets Katie McCarthy Kirsten Dunst in 1971 Katie comes from a middleclass background while David comes from billions of dollars of old New England money. The two fall madly in love and are married soon after but their relationship deteriorates over the next decade. David becomes abusive toward Katie and they eventually end up living in separate houses as Katie studies at medical school while David works in New York City under his dad's company. In 1982 Katie vanishes without a trace. Fastforward to 2000 and David is living under the identity of a woman in Texas the deaths of friendpublisher Deborah Lehrman and the gruesome murder of elderly Malvern Bump reignite interest in Katie's 18yearold disappearance. They all have one thing in common David Marks.The entire film penned by Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling plays out like a featurelength segment of Unsolved Mysteries except with awardworthy performances and stellar storytelling. I personally see this as a positive thing I am after all a big fan of true crime tales and unsolved murders. The circumstances of the characters and the entire realm of which this takes place makes for not only a fascinating biographical narrative but a love story murder mystery and a period piece. The crossdecade stretch the film makes also gives the audience a sense of relevance since this man's history of crime or innocence? spreads across time. On top of the weird fascinating aspects of this story it was superbly acted which makes it even more of a treat. Ryan Gosling takes a turn as a semisociopathic husband and he carries the film gracefully he's played the psycho role before see Murder by Numbers. He plays that balance of sympathetic and downright evil to a tee even when he's dressed in drag in a masquerade to hide his identity. His blonde wig trench coat and sunglasses evoke an eerie image very similar to the villain in Brian De Palma's 1980 thriller Dressed to Kill. Gosling aside Kirsten Dunst is the real winner here. Her role as the vulnerable goodhearted wifeturnedvictim is played so well that it would catch any of her Spiderman fans off guard. Dunst is a capable actress but she often chooses shallow films that don't exactly showcase that this surely wasn't one of them. She is the window into David's psychosis and we see the deterioration of their marriage through her eyes after she's vanished her presence is felt like a ghost looming over the rest of the film. This is really Dunst's movie and she gives what is easily one of the best performances of her career here.The most disturbing scene in the movie in my opinion is one of extreme suggestion involving Katie on the night of a grand fight between she and David at their lake house a neighbor is making tea in the middle of the night. The neighbor looks out her window at the Marks' house and sees all the lights are oddly turned off except for a single basement window lit with an eerie fluorescent blue. We as an audience can only imagine what happened to Katie in that basement and it's nothing short of horrifying. The modern day sequences much in contrast to the retro '70s'80s vibe the first act of the film has are extremely welldone too and the courtcentered narrative is largely accurate in terms of what actually happened in this case. The entire film in fact is surprisingly accurate which is nice to see for a change very little artistic liberties or fabrication if any is embedded in the script. It's nice to see a true crime film tell it like it is the truth is often more interesting than dressedup fiction. The sad truth here is that in reality Robert Durst hardly paid for his crimes he spent nine months incarcerated for improper disposal of a corpse when he dismembered Morris Black renamed Malvern Bump in the film after killing him in self defense in 2001. Susan Berman's renamed Deborah Lehrmen in the film shotgun murder at her California home in 2000 is still unsolved. And Durst's wife Katie who vanished in 1982 has never been found god only knows what happened to her. The mere fact that this man has been able to dodge any punishment for these murders is frustrating and paints him as quite an evil enigma.Overall All Good Things is one of the best movies I've seen this year. I'd say that seeing it for Dunst's performance is reason enough but it's also a treat for true crime buffs and people who are familiar with this decadeslong story of secrecy and murder. While it may lack the conventional thrills and spills of fictional psychothrillers All Good Things maintains a chilling picturesque truthfulness to it and for that is a real winner in my book. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "A disquieting thriller complexly plotted and with numerous twists and turns which actually turns out to be fairly closely based on a reallife story in America which kind of shoots to pieces any criticisms I had of the credibility of the narrative development here. That said I'm not sure the timehonoured device of flashbacking from the trial of the accused David Marks with interspersed updates as matters proceed best serves the flow of the film. Moreover things do take some time to get moving with too much concentration in my opinion on character development especially on subsidiary characters before Marks' strangeness starts to manifest itself although this too is done awkwardly off camera conversations with himself pointblank rejection of having a family with his living wife peerpressure from his father so that I'm not sure I made the leap to psychopathy that Ryan Gosling's character actually makes.The supposed thriller sequences are done in a hackneyed manner too with nighttime filming dark shadowy interiors and even thunderstorms outside which work against the realism striven for elsewhere. By the end after some headscratching about Marks' transvestism and the strange fateful relationship he builds up with his elderly fellow tenant I felt the movie hadn't satisfactorily plugged the plotholes along the way for it to flow as it should.Gosling and Kirsten Dunst are both good in the lead parts although the shifts in character for the former as indicated are difficult to surmount. While Gosling plays each facet of Marks' contrasting personalities at different stages I'm not sure he convinced this was all mixed up in one person although that may be down to the writing. I did appreciate the subHerrmann use of soundtrack music but ultimately felt this movie failed to gel in attempting to combine factbased analysis of a psychotic Norman Bates type character with the conventions of a mainstream Hollywood psychological thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a great creepy story. This film falls under 'truth is stranger than fiction' and slips right at the top of that genre. Best film of the year. Great acting Excellent Direction.Andrew Jarecki took a fascinating story and made it into a great film slipping it just under your skin where you may find it hard to scratch away after viewing. All Good Things is an experience its amazing how this story comes to life through under the umbrella of Andrew Jarecki and his team. Like Wynn Thomas the production designerArt Director who's team put us right smack into 70's New York. There is no question of where you are all details between dirt and sky are early 70's like a SpaceTime blizzard came and left everything in Vanderbilt jeans Hals ton Tops covering Times Square in sleaze and tight tank tops for fat guys in pastel leisure suits. This is not the swinging Studio 56 70's but the creepy Times Square Porn theatres Taxi Driver Son of Sam 70's Dark and strange where wealthy and powerful New Yorkers Civil servants and Leisure suited Larrys' live under their own rules and law.Like Marcus Hinchly and Marc Smerling the writers who took a big twisted story one may have read in Vanity Fair on hot Southampton summer beach unraveled into a clear and coherent clich' free film strung together with clever dialogue and cleverly created a non narrator narration through the POV of a court room character brief  testimony.Frank Langella who with one look at an empty chair early on in the movie could have stolen the film outright  had it not been for for the careful editing of David Rodenbloom and Shelby Seigel under Jarecki's umbrella making sure the film which is not about his character Sanford Marks remains that way true to the story.Langella brings weight to every frame he's in his charisma so apparent it's not his fault really that he commands every scene he's in stealing the viewer's attention from what may be going on in the frame. see The Ninth Gate or Frost Nixon  it's 39.50 each that includes a very generous tip The Father and son subtext combined with the functional madness of real life Durst David Marks played by Ryan Gosling as you've never seen him is so very strange and unnerving it may make you shudder knowing that people like this exist all around you everywhere you go all the time.Kristen Dunst shows her range in this film. This is not your friendly Spiderman love interest but a woman pushed emotionally to her frayed ends where in one near silent dinner scene she with great countenance shows us how she can move from a woman trying to salvage what she can from her relationship  to great disgust sadness fear and hurt all on one look all in reaction from a single line slung at her by Gosling's 'Durst'. We watch as the light Kristen Dunst brings to every role she plays drains away into the black hole of Durst GoslingMarks until she becomes a paranoid wreck and rightfully so. Not every actress can do this we take her for granted as an actress but in thanks to Jarecki's direction we get to see what a truly great actress can do.Philip Baker Hall in the last third of the film is a treat to watch as he plays a strange homoerotic vet who befriends Gosling who at this point has succumbed to his madness but like a functioning alcoholic.

	onyx:emotionText "What a great creepy story. This film falls under 'truth is stranger than fiction' and slips right at the top of that genre. Best film of the year. Great acting Excellent Direction.Andrew Jarecki took a fascinating story and made it into a great film slipping it just under your skin where you may find it hard to scratch away after viewing. All Good Things is an experience its amazing how this story comes to life through under the umbrella of Andrew Jarecki and his team. Like Wynn Thomas the production designerArt Director who's team put us right smack into 70's New York. There is no question of where you are all details between dirt and sky are early 70's like a SpaceTime blizzard came and left everything in Vanderbilt jeans Hals ton Tops covering Times Square in sleaze and tight tank tops for fat guys in pastel leisure suits. This is not the swinging Studio 56 70's but the creepy Times Square Porn theatres Taxi Driver Son of Sam 70's Dark and strange where wealthy and powerful New Yorkers Civil servants and Leisure suited Larrys' live under their own rules and law.Like Marcus Hinchly and Marc Smerling the writers who took a big twisted story one may have read in Vanity Fair on hot Southampton summer beach unraveled into a clear and coherent clich' free film strung together with clever dialogue and cleverly created a non narrator narration through the POV of a court room character brief  testimony.Frank Langella who with one look at an empty chair early on in the movie could have stolen the film outright  had it not been for for the careful editing of David Rodenbloom and Shelby Seigel under Jarecki's umbrella making sure the film which is not about his character Sanford Marks remains that way true to the story.Langella brings weight to every frame he's in his charisma so apparent it's not his fault really that he commands every scene he's in stealing the viewer's attention from what may be going on in the frame. see The Ninth Gate or Frost Nixon  it's 39.50 each that includes a very generous tip The Father and son subtext combined with the functional madness of real life Durst David Marks played by Ryan Gosling as you've never seen him is so very strange and unnerving it may make you shudder knowing that people like this exist all around you everywhere you go all the time.Kristen Dunst shows her range in this film. This is not your friendly Spiderman love interest but a woman pushed emotionally to her frayed ends where in one near silent dinner scene she with great countenance shows us how she can move from a woman trying to salvage what she can from her relationship  to great disgust sadness fear and hurt all on one look all in reaction from a single line slung at her by Gosling's 'Durst'. We watch as the light Kristen Dunst brings to every role she plays drains away into the black hole of Durst GoslingMarks until she becomes a paranoid wreck and rightfully so. Not every actress can do this we take her for granted as an actress but in thanks to Jarecki's direction we get to see what a truly great actress can do.Philip Baker Hall in the last third of the film is a treat to watch as he plays a strange homoerotic vet who befriends Gosling who at this point has succumbed to his madness but like a functioning alcoholic. Gosling as Durst playswears his aberrations as the straight man in a twisted comedy duo.Kristen Wiig shines here proving her talent stretches way past just comedy straight into the world of excellent dramatic acting be careful you may develop a crush on her eat your saladJarecki shows us much in All Good Things the breakdown of a marriage the strained relations of a father and son wealth and its trapping but more intriguingly how a seemingly 'normal' man can hide the sociopathic madman inside carefully while unbeknownst to us can live a functional and again subjectively 'normal' life.

	schema:reviewBody "Some movies are bad. You get to the end and you wonder why you bothered watching them. And then some movies are painful. All Good Things falls into the painful category. Was this a story that deserved to be told? It's based on the story of Robert Durst whose name is changed in the movie to David Marks played by Ryan Gosling. The details as far as they're known of Durst's life are fairly well presented. The story revolves around the troubled relationship David has with his real estate mogul family and with his deteriorating relationship with his wife Kathleen played by Kirsten Dunst. Eventually Kathleen disappears and to this day no one knows what happened to her.The movie clears nothing up which is forgivable since it is an unsolved case. It revolves around testimony David gave in his trial for killing someone else which is the somewhat clich means by which the movie unfolds. The problem with it is that it starts out uninteresting from the very beginning becomes downright boring quite quickly and enters the realm of the truly bizarre in the last 45 minutes or so. The story doesn't flow well and the pieces don't seem to fit together. The story seemed to move in a sort of A to E to M to X direction with the viewer not really being sure what the connecting points were and in the end it left me completely unsatisfied.To be frank this was a waste of time. 110".

Even when the plot makes a swerve towards oh i can't believe that's what really happened for a second territoryits the little details and short scenes that makes it feels true to life. i'm thinking of the scene where Kristen dunst painfully mails this evidence indicting her husband to the senator only to have him mail it back to her husband the next daythis is family business...and none of our affair or the quick scene of Ryan gosling writing his phone number on the boat in case it gets lost or the terse Leave A Message greeting on Gosling's hideaway's answering machine every time someone calls. There are a lot of little things like that throughout that really make the movie pop.Yes its true that the story is yet another one about an increasingly sociopaths rich guyand the unraveling of his life as he gets more and more paranoid etc. We never really get to know why the main character starts to feel the way he does beyond the standard he's upset that he's being pushed into a lifestyle he didn't want and doesn't feel the least bit appreciated by his dad bull crap. We don't ever know what's going on inside the main character's mind and its to the film's credit that it doesn't really try to generate any sympathy or likability on the main character's behalfeven if the director and Gosling gives us a slight clue or two as to what might of shaped his current mania. based largely on the should be coasting but somehow still excellent Frank Langella's treatment of Gosling Gosling's witnessing of his mom's death at a very early age and his overall shift in attitude towards his life as portrayed by his nonverbal cues. That the film succeeded in keeping my interest for its entire running time would be a good question to ask however. The two main performances are topnotch of course you really get why both parties would be attracted to the other without ever really questioning ityou even get why Dunst would choose to stay with Gosling even after the first bits of crazy start appearing and there's a lot more where those first bits came from. The film however is also very well directedthe pacing is perfect for this type of film the film begins right with the meeting between Gosling and Dunst thankfully wasting zero time on filler material before their courting i've said before the small details that can make or break a true story are pretty perfect here the tone of the filmstraight face verging on very dry black comedy at times is very good too. When it was over I really felt like i hadn't wasted my time watching it and that i was really absorbed by the storyhowever i could not quite place my finger on WHY the film was made in the first place. It was a good story with solid acting all around but the real question that you will want to ask at the end of the film remains unanswered in real life too which may in fact be the reason the film was made but its still frustrating to ask a question that remains completely unsolved even in the true life story on which this is based. This is however a solid film with a solid Ryan Gosling performance at the center that too few people will see and will probably go unappreciated for many years until some writer or blogger exploring his filmography years from now tries to pulls it out from obscurity as a rediscovery or whatever. The real story though really should be how Andrew Jarecki successfully made a more or less compelling feature film out of true life events. something that too few documentary filmmakers actually manage to do even a quarter as well when they try their hands at fictional films.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are old enough to have lived through the 1980s you would have heard of the McDonald's Boys. Known to be one of the most chilling police cases in Singapore this mystery has two boys who left home for school in 1986 but both boys who were said to be good friends never got to school. 24 years later the two of them remain missing. The fast food chain had offered a 100000 reward for information about the boys' whereabouts but to date they remain missing.As much as recalling this infamous case brings chills down our spines it also occurred to us how this incident would serve as a sensational inspiration for a movie screenplay. Guess this was what writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling had in mind when the duo penned the script for Andrew Jarecki's romantic mystery film which is inspired by the true story of a New Yorker whose wife disappeared in 1982.The film begins in 1980s New York City where the son of a powerful estate tycoon marries a working class girl. Everything seems perfect in the beginning as the lovebirds move to the country side but tensions eventually arise due to differing expectations. Tempers fly as family secrets are revealed. One day the girl disappears without a trace without any closure. 20 years later the man's best friend shows up dead and the case is reopened leading to an unsettling truth.If you didn't have the context that the plot was inspired a true incident this 101 minute movie may have played out like any other murder mystery. However your mind tells you that there is a possibility that out there somewhere the girl is still alive. On the other end of the spectrum the girl may be well be dead without any proper closure. So what purpose does a movie like this serve then?One thing for sure it is a stark reminder of what humankind is capable of when desperate circumstances arise. It is definitely a reflection of human nature's darker side. Things are kept fairly ambiguous throughout the film as it only offers glimpses of what might have happened. Of course due to the structure of cinema certain dramatic elements have been played up to make this a commercial project. Ultimately the paced plot development makes the viewing experience an engaging one from beginning to end.It also helps that a capable cast has been assembled for this production. Ryan Gosling gives a noteworthy performance as David Marks an heir to a real estate fortune  the Oscar nominated Canadian actor portrays a torn soul coming to terms with inner demons with empathy. Kirsten Dunst plays his wife Katie a caring wife whose life takes a turn when she finds out about her husband's troubled past. Dunst manages to shed her famous Mary Jane image to play this tormented character. Their great performances are supported by Frank Langella as the demanding tycoon who wants nothing more than his fortune to be appropriately handled. The veteran actor's gravity lends weight to the character aptly.Director Jarecki who helmed the critically acclaimed documentary Capturing the Friedmans 2003 does a decent job to bring this tale of love turned sour to his audiences. Although it prods you like a clichd mystery thriller it also intrigues you with the more disconcerting aspect of human nature.".

But then the filmmakers finally gave us some facts of the real story and I realized how far off this was. The filmmakers were extremely heavyhanded in who they thought were the guilty parties and that just seemed so wrong to me.Being a thriller about an unsolved disappearancemurder case you can expect it to be violent. And it was kind of violent but they could have told the exact same story and made it more interesting without any violence. But the little bit of violence really isn't the problem. The problem is their unprofessional way of implying what really happened. And that really is a problem because otherwise All Good Things would have been a great movie. Unfortunately I can't recommend it because I don't believe in such a distortion of the truth.".

Ryan Gosling is the stand out like he is in most movies he partakes in. It's not that he's doing any grand emoting with the material but he does go through the rigors of character transformation as the film progresses. Kristen Dunst does fine as well and Frank Langella well he is Frank Langella. Frank seems to be the same guy in most every movie he acts in. I'm not saying that as a bad thing though.Bad Thing The delivery of the plot is disjointed all over the place. This is an Indie vibe movie so no easy Hollywood A to B 123 structure. It felt like different movies in its separate acts at times. The main issue is probably the fact that it is based on a true story and there are so many stranger than fiction developments and points of interest that trying to capture real life can get messy when trying to also entertain.Good Thing I thought the movie was well shot with a lot of night scenes they handled the visuals in an interesting mood setting way. Many direct to video films with smaller budgets will have dark scenes be too dark but All Good Things plays with the night artistically.The End Of The Review Thing this movie made me more interested in reading about the facts of the case and the people involved but it did not draw me into the world created within the movie. It is worth a rent if you are a fan of the actors and can watch anything with them in it. I think Ryan Gosling has that old school movie star appeal.".

This should have gone directly to Lifetime Movie Network but even their ratings would have suffered because no one outside the industry would even sit through this production. The music is another ineffective tool that could have given some life to the suspense of the movie. However the sound editor seems to have nodded off during the production process because the background music just seems to come on and off at odd times. Maybe when they when to get coffee and then started dozing off and then had more coffee. There are dark areas in the movie that just suddenly change to lighter moments no transitions between. They probably cut this into a decent thirty minute documentary. Its like the editor was tasked to make this into a feature length movie and doesn't have enough content. This makes for prolonged periods of nothing but scenery or traffic scrolling across the screen. The pans over to the beautiful dog at least provides a few limited moments of watchable screens. Also the dog does not appear to age throughout the movie. We do get the narrator to let us know that time has elapsed but there is not build up or followup to what was missed during the missing years. I don't understand the use of the lead male character constantly wearing the same sweater. Understandably the budget for the movie was probably nonexistent but surely the actor could have tapped into his personal wardrobe. Stay away from this one. The wife will forgive you once she goes and walks out after thirty minutes of languishing through this true display of awkwardness.".

	schema:headline " A great western which enables multiple interpretations";
	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne is The Ringo Kid in this John Forddirected parable of outcasts traveling towards various kinds of figurative and literal redemptionsalvation. On a surface level the basic plot is disarmingly simplea motley crew of eight takes a stagecoach from Tonto to Lordsburg trying to avoid Geronimo and his Apaches on the way. They are having their own problems with the U.S. government and are thus likely to attack. The stagecoach bounces from outpost to outpost while the relationships of its passengers evolve helping each other to find themselves and usually providing hope of some kind of new life.The Ringo Kid has been wrongly accused of a crime and is on his way to Lordsburg to avenge both the false accusations and more importantly the murder of his father and brother. Dallas Claire Trevor is implied to be a prostitute and so is ostracized from Tonto which means stupid foolish or daft in Spanish by a selfstylized matronly moral majority. Doc Boone Thomas Mitchell is far more concerned with getting drunk than being a doctor and is partially ostracizing himself from Tonto. Hatfield John Carradine is a gambler gentleman with a shady reputation and a false identity. Lucy Mallory Louise Platt is trying to get to her husband who is in the military she's in a surprisingly secret physical state. Samuel Peacock whom everyone keeps mistaking for a reverend is in the alcohol business and just wants to get back east to get back to his business. Henry Gatewood is a crooked banker trying to flee before his questionable dealings are discovered. And the stagecoach drivers consist of a lovable buffoon Buck Andy Devine and the most forthright straight arrow of the bunch Marshal Curly Wilcox George Bancroft.Even though Stagecoach remains tightly focused on its wilderness road trip that might seem like a large stable of characters to shape into a taut plot. Ford working from script by Dudley Nichols and Ben Hecht based on a short story Stage to Lordsburg by Ernest Haycox which itself bears a relation to Guy de Maupassant's Boule de Suif 1880 keeps the proceedings in check by only giving us the information we need to explore the evolving relationships and only focusing on each character when they're important to the plot. This results in a few of the characters being functionally absent for extended lengths of time but Ford can so easily establish a deep character with a minimum of screen time that the absences are not a detriment.The principal focus of course is between Ringo and Dallas as on a significant level Stagecoach becomes a romance. They're initially brought together via their mutual ostracization even among the ostracized which gives them an immediate bond beyond their physical attraction towards one another. Wayne and Trevor are both fantastic in their roles avoiding the occasional overacting by some other performers. But this is a film where it's difficult to count the slight overacting as a flaw as it was more of a stylistic tendency of the genre during this period and it provides a nice counterbalance to Wayne and Trevor.Stagecoach is also famous for its setting. Much of the film was shot in Utah's Monument Valley along authentic stagecoach roads. The beautiful starkness of the desert is often taken as a symbolic trip through a kind of purgatory for the characters where they're left alone with their souls their only connection being their small group to contemplate their pasts and futures. Whether we choose to read something along those lines into the film or not Monument Valley is at least a captivating presence in the film although for me the cinematography could have been better technically especially considering that Stagecoach was made at the same time as The Wizard of Oz 1939. Ford's famous tendency to do only one take results in a couple minor gaffes such as the initial shot of John Waynea zoom into a closeupthat is out of focus for most of the zoom.As one could guess eventually our passengers run into a band of Apaches who are often interpreted as representing more of a natural force that our heroes must surmount. The climax features a fabulous extended chasefight sequence with a number of amazing stunts by both humans and animals. The most impressive human stunts are performed by the legendary Yakima Canutt including one that involved being dragged through the dirt by the horsepulled stagecoach which was moving along at about 40 miles per hour and supposedly missed running over Canutt by only 12 inches 30.5 cm. This scene was an inspiration for a similar stunt in Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark 1981.Although it's not a perfect film to me and it's not even my favorite western I'm more partial to the classic spaghetti westerns for example Stagecoach is a very good film and was very influential despite being made at a time when Ford was told that he was committing professional suicide by even contemplating a western. As the plethora of critical literature attests it works on many levels including as an allegorical microcosm of U.S. Depressionera society and should be seen at least once by anyone serious about film literacy.".

It's easy to see while watching his performance how this film made him a star. As great as Wayne is in this film he doesn't overshadow any of his fellow performers. Thomas Mitchell plays the drunken doctor thrown out of town a performance that earned him an Academy Award. Andy Devine is hilarious as the complaining squeaky voiced stagecoach driver. John Carradine is sleek and snakelike as the gambler. Claire Trevor gives a heartbreaking turn as the goodhearted whore thrown out of town by pious hypocrites. Donald Meek plays his name a meek whiskey salesman befriended by the whiskeyloving Doc. Each actor quickly and deftly sketches his character so vividly that every performance is memorable.But the real star of the show is John Ford the director. To introduce and define nine characters in the context of a fastpaced western is no easy task and he accomplishes it in masterly fashion. Much of the action takes place in the limited confines of a stagecoach but Ford takes advantage of the limits by staging brilliant and subtle bits between characters John Wayne casts sultry glances at Clare Trevor who blossoms under his glance the young calvary wife's eyes glaze over as the banker pontificates and Doc sneaks sips of whiskey from the samples case while he solicitously keeps the wind from chilling the whiskey salesman. When the action moves outside he films the action in dynamic angles and stunts that were the most daring of its time.If you enjoy westerns and haven't seen this you have a great night of filmwatching ahead of you. And if the last time you saw Stagecoach was some midnight years ago when you wandered home for a bit of the late show before bedtime watch it again and rediscover what a great western it is".

	schema:reviewBody "The Overland Stage Lines stagecoach is traveling from the frontier town of Tonto Arizona to Lordsburg New Mexico.  Geronimo the Apache chief has just jumped the reservation and starts an uprising.  Before leaving Tonto the passengers are notified by the Calvary that they are now traveling at their own considerable risk but they will be escorted by the soldiers here's a clue don't believe it.  Among the passengers are a prostitute being thrown out of town by a group of women with their noses so stuck up in the air you could fly flags off of them.  She is joined by a drunken doctor a gentlemen card shark a meek whiskey salesman a crooked banker a pregnant woman on her way to meet her husband and a young cowboy who just broke out of jail and out to revenge his family's murder.  The coach driver and his shotgun complete the group.  It's all based on a short story called appropriately Stage to Lordsburg but also on a French story Guy de Maupassant's Boule de Suif with similar characters traveling in a coach during the FrancoPrussian War.The basic structure of the plot is also familiar to fans of disaster films. Passengers are introduced board a common conveyance and face a tremendous danger.  The exciting adventure of who lives who dies will the stage make it to its destination and what happens next is highlighted by perhaps the most famous stunts in film history by the most famous and respected stuntman of all Yakima Canutt.  If one of the stunts looks familiar Steven Speilberg recreated it for his first Indiana Jones film.  The film is also a lot more.  Unlike other westerns up to its time which were mainly shootemups between the good guys in the white hats and the bad guys in the black hats it examines very serious social issues and how different people look down at others differently.  Besides prejudice some of the characters are flawed with alcoholism greed and revenge.  We also see the good in bad people with respect for new life and ultimately redemption. Nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Cinematography Best Interior Decoration Best Film Editing Best Supporting Actor won and Best Score won Stagecoach was John Ford's first sound Western and elevated the genre in both critical praise and popularity.  The low camera angles in Monument Valley would become a John Ford trademark.  Despite doing 70 films this is the one that made Wayne a star and it's easy to see why.  Many consider it his best performance both subtle and clear he cares for the needs of the people around him and yearns for his own need for a home a wife and a family.  It is considered one of the great films in cinemas greatest year 1939.  Gone With the Wind Goodbye Mr. Chips Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Wuthering Heights Dark Victory The Wizard of Oz Of Mice and Men and Ninotchka were all nominated for best picture alongside Stagecoach that year.Regarding the political incorrectness of an Apache uprising well they happened.  If you just happened to be in a stagecoach in the middle of the southwest during an Apache uprising chances are you would be killed.  This story does not examine the reasons for the uprising only the effects on a group of travelers trying to travel through it.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite movie shots of all time comes in Stagecoach when the coach rounds a bend and you see a figure in the distance and has the camera zooms in closer you recognize it as John Wayne saddle in one hand and winchester rifle in the other.Certainly the figure of John Wayne is familiar enough even to today's moviegoers as the man who put more people in theater seats than any other player. But back then in 1939 all he was known as was B picture cowboy who was a friend of John Ford whom Ford happened to be giving a break to. He sure took advantage of it.Wayne heads an ensemble group of players who are journeying from Tonto to Lordsburg by stagecoach. It is a dramatization of the western novel by Ernest Haycox and John Ford brilliantly cast his film.Anyone of them could have been Oscar material but one player did win an Oscar Thomas Mitchell as the alcoholic Doc Boone. 1939 was maybe the highpoint of Mitchell's career. Imagine being in three films nominated for Oscars Stagecoach Gone With the Wind and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He could have been nominated for any one of them.On top of the coach is driver Andy Devine and riding shotgun is Marshal George Bancroft. Devine is a befuddled dunce and a lot of reviewers usually pass him over in talking about the film. To be sure he is but there is a scene where the stagecoach has to cross a deep stream. A pontoon like device is rigged but it's professional teamster Andy Devine who drives the stage across with his team swimming it. He may be a dunce but he's a professional at his job. I think it was Andy's moment to shine.Bancroft is a stern but kindly marshal. He and Mitchell are friends of Wayne who plays the Ringo Kid. Wayne's busted out the penitentiary to get the Plummer brothers who framed him. There's a reward for Wayne but Marshal Bancroft ain't worried about the reward he's concerned about Wayne getting killed biting off more than he can chew. However Mitchell spends most of the journey cultivating mild mannered Donald Meek who's a whiskey salesman. A useful friend to have you like to imbibe. If ever a character actor was aptly named it certainly had to be Donald Meek.In 1939 you couldn't say that Claire Trevor was playing a prostitute named Dallas. But it's surely hinted at often enough. Claire Trevor was Hollywood's greatest portrayer of girls with easy virtue and a heart of gold which she has here. She got her Oscar in Key Largo again playing just such a role. The difference is she loves good guy John Wayne instead bad guy Edward G. Robinson in Key Largo.And to add to the mix we have an embezzling banker on the journey played by Berton Churchill who played many a sanctimonious hypocrite in his career. He gets news that the telegraph is down because of the Apaches on the warpath and in an act of impulse fills a satchel full of the bank's money and grabs the stagecoach at the last minute. He's also trying to escape a hatchet faced harridan of a wife. Nevertheless he's the least sympathetic and most useless character on the journey.A few months ago I saw and reviewed the film Carrie which was based on a Theodore Dreiser novel. The lead character in that George Hurstwood is also an embezzler of his employer's money as he runs away to New York to get away from his harridan of a wife. But Hurstwood same crime for the same reasons is a sympathetic figure. Not our friend banker Gatewood as Churchill portrays him here. It some times depends on the writer's point of view.The last two passengers are John Carradine a mysterious gambler of Southern origins and the pregnant wife of an Army Captain played by stage actress Louise Platt. He also boards the stage at the last minute as he's crushing out big time over her. He becomes her protector during the journey.Of course Stagecoach is the first film that John Ford shot in Monument Valley and the long shots of the valley with the lonely stagecoach driving on to Lordsburg are breathtaking. And there's the Indian attack. The question is often asked why didn't the Indians just shoot the horses. The real answer is you wouldn't want to cut short abruptly one of the most spectacular chase scenes in film history. And then of course maybe the Indians wanted the live horses.Ford uses for the first time a spectacular gambit during the Indian attack. I won't say more but think about the fact that he repeated the same shot in Fort Apache with the Indians chasing John Agar and the repair party there.What I like most about Stagecoach altogether is that it sticks to the first rule of movies it moves. Even in the scenes of dialog inside the coach you get the feeling of movement. Nothing static about it and the story could never be adequately done on a stage.It's what movie making is all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "A stagecoach sets out across the desert with a load of passengers looking to catch up with a military unit and drop off the wife of the officer in charge.  All the other passengers have their own reasons for getting to the destination including a vengeful outlaw a prostitute a drunken doctor and a cad.  However the journey is made incredibly hazardous by the fact that Geronimo is on the warpath in the area they must pass through.Although I miss seeing the desert landscape in full yellows and blues this film is one of my favourite westerns and only suffers a little by being in black  while and not really enjoying the visual sweep that later Ford westerns had.  The plot is quite simple on one hand  a group battle Indians on their way to a town while some of the characters confront their own battles.  However this succeeds because it is more than just a Bmovie shoot'em up it has characters and sub plot.The characters may be quite broad and the film may well use them like a disaster movie set them up just enough to care about and then see who gets knocked down but it does have touches that improve it.  Characters are shunned due to their social status good' people are revealed to be not so good as they think themselves while bad' people reveal themselves to have good hearts and the potential for redemption in their lives.  While it isn't earth shattering it is well crafted and well written in the context of the traditional western.Wayne is good and this film allowed him to step up from Bmovie westerns to the type of films that made his career.  The rest of the cast are also good in their various roles while the characters are broad they all play it well especially Trevor Devine Mitchell and Carradine.Overall this is a solid western that has good action include a great stunt that was lifted directly into Raiders of the Lost Ark but also has characters and interactions which make for a polished and enjoyable movie.".

	schema:headline " Dallas and The Ringo Kid  Awesome!";
	schema:reviewBody "Stagecoach' isn't so much a traditional Western as it is a forefather to the modern disaster film with Apache warriors being the disaster'.  In many ways the film is closer in style to The Towering Inferno' than to True Grit' but it's undeniably a great film one of John Wayne's best. It's a simple story really  eight strangers each with their own secrets and emotional baggage are passengers on an Arizona stagecoach going from the town of Tonto to the city of Lordsburg despite the looming threat of imminent Apache attacks.  Along the way the stagecoach comes across the Ringo Kid John Wayne who's just broken out of prison  he's looking to go to Lordsburg as well to avenge the death of his kid brother.  He joins the passengers to Lordsburg and during the journey in one way or another most of the passengers wind up learning something about themselves  and wind up fighting Indians as well.Hokey?  Not really  the story's quite good and for the most part the acting's wonderful.  John Wayne's great as the Ringo Kid  this actually may be one of his best Western roles.  The Ringo Kid is a murderer looking to avenge his family but he's also a fairly principled man.  The role's a lot deeper and more complex than some of Wayne's later white hat' heroes who were always perfectly good and flawless.  The Ringo Kid wants a normal life but at the same time knows he'll probably never have one and John Wayne pulls off this internal conflict flawlessly.  Wayne also has great chemistry with the wonderful Claire Trevor who plays Dallas the former ladyoftheevening  she's also seeking to create a new life and the uncomfortable almost shy way she reacts to Wayne's gentle genuinely polite comments is terrific to watch.  Like the Ringo Kid  indeed like most of the characters in Stagecoach'  Dallas wants to change her life around but doubts that she can.  The other characters in Stagecoach' are excellent as well but it's Claire Trevor and John Wayne who really make the film enjoyable.  Side note  while he's quite good I was shocked to read that John Mitchell actually won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dr. Josiah Boone in this film.  His character's essentially a cross between W.C. Fields and Yoda and while I'm not sure who else was in contention for the Best Supporting Actor award with Mr. Mitchell I find it hard to believe that this was in fact the best supporting performance captured on film in the year 1939.John Ford's direction is excellent as well.  Stagecoach' is the first film where Mr. Ford used the breathtaking landscapes of Monument Valley and even in blackandwhite they're still used to vivid effect.  His action shots of an Apache attack and war raid are also stunning even by today's standards. Ford also has great touch with changing moods in Stagecoach'  the film moves effortlessly from light comedy to tearjerking drama and the changes of mood never seem contrived. Stagecoach' is clearly one of John Ford's better films.  Does Stagecoach' have problems?  Yes but most of them are more a byproduct of the customs and conventions of filmmaking in the 1930s.  For example the music is often obtrusive and doesn't always fit with what's actually happening in a given scene.  There's also not a lot of time spent exploring the character's backgrounds  it would've been nice to know lot more about where the characters had come from particularly Dallas if only to help understand each character's motivations.  Since this can be said about most films made during this era it' somewhat forgivable.  However one significant flaw of Stagecoach' itself is the character of Hatfield John Carradine  while Mr. Carradine does a good job with the part the character constantly contradicts himself.  He behaves one way in one scene then in a completely different manner in the next and there's never a reason given for this.  Add to this that Hatfield adds next to nothing in the film his only useful purpose apparently is to ask Mrs. Platt Lucy Mallory Are you all right?' every thirty seconds and he becomes totally superfluous.  If the part of Hatfield had been excised entirely from the script Stagecoach would have been much better. Stagecoach' is not a typical Western there's a lot more character introspection going on than blazing sixshooters but it's an extremely entertaining film nonetheless.  The memorable interaction between John Wayne and Claire Trevor alone makes it a nearclassic.  Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Classy Western dealing with a motley crew of roles in a crosscountry coach beset by Indians and thieves . A voyage throughout Arizona with varied group of characters  a strange assortment of individuals formed by a prostitute Claire Trevor who received topbilling  a coward swank Donald Meek  a crooked cardplayer John Carradine turned into protector to pregnant young wife Louis Platt  a philosopher alcoholic doctor Thomas Mitchell  deservedly winner Oscar  a swindler banker Barton Churchill  a sheriff George Bancroft a sympathetic coach driver Andy Devine and  of course  Ringo Kid John Wayne  who arose his career languishing in Poverty Row . The motley crew pull off a journey through Indian territory passing Apache Wells and towards Lordsburg . At the beginning they're protected by a military detachment commanded by a brave lieutenant Tim Holt. Ringo Kid is an outlaw looking for to revenge the killing his father and brother by the Plummer brothers Tom Tyler . The stagecoach is besieged by Apaches and several dangers.....The first pairing of Ford and Wayne changed the course of the modern Western turning into adult Western  portraying in depth characters and brooding events with allegorical issues running beneath surface script . But the movie's little budget looked cash well spent when this classic picture earned more than two million dollars on first exhibitions . Based on the story 'Stage to Lordsburg' by Ernest Haycox and this one based on Guy de Mauspassant's novel . Outstanding cinematography capturing the nebulous skies by Bert Glennon and Ray Binger . Thrilling as well as sensitive soundtrack by Richard Hageman based on traditional music . Slick edition by Dorothy Spencer  a woman with a long career during fifty years . Stunning shooting by John Ford in the mythical Monumental Valley  a place that Ford was often to revisit and he befriended Indians tribes . The film won Academy Award for secondary actor  Thomas Mitchell  original musical score and was nominated to best movie for Walter Wanger and major studio  United Artists  furthermore for edition and Production Design . Very inferior remake in 1966 by Gordon Douglas with Alex Cord  Anne Margret  Red Buttons  Van Johnson  Mike Connors  and a forgettable adaptation for TV in 1986 by Ted Post with Willie Nelson  Johnny Cash  Elizabeth Ashley  Mary Crosby  Tony Franciosa  John Schneider and Kris Kristopherson.".

It wasn't until my boys were growing up and into cowboys and Indians that I saw my first John Wayne movie.John Ford is one of America's most important directors and pretty much made John Wayne a star. Stagecoach is a movie about a journey cross the West for a group of people with different agendas. None of these individuals have anything in common at first until the journey develops into a need of survival so they all come together over the course of their voyage.The use of the moving camera from the beginning of the film to the end gives you great visuals and details of the characters and the situations happening within the film.The use of the different characters changes throughout the film and we see that people are not as they seem on the outside. A prostitute with a heart of gold a well respected woman is actually pregnant a doctor is an alcoholic and a convict Ringo Kid is actually on a mission of revenge but at the same trying to keep everyone safe.The use of off camera sounds gives us a different visual of what is going on in the film. For example the ending scene of when you hear shooting you don't know exactly who gets shot until the survivor appears out of the dim lighting.A brilliantly directed movie of western outlaws and crime turns into a love story.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason 1939 has been proclaimed  Hollywood's greatest year.  I doubt that but the year IS important if only because John Ford released his mythic  Stagecoach  in the midst of the surrounding Technicolor sap 'n' pap  Gone With the Wind Wizard of Oz etc..  In fact Stagecoach firmly gets my vote for the best Western John Ford ever made.  Unlike the current critics'  darling The Searchers this movie doesn't depend solely on John Wayne to save it from selfparody andor pretension.  In 1939 Monument Valley wasn't a cliche yet.  As it was by 1956 when  The Searchers  came out.  The whorewiththeheartofgold the Southerngentlemanwhoishandywithagun the overeducateddrunkwhocanbecountedoninapinch and naturally the honorablegunslinger weren't cinematic cliches yet either.  For that matter John Wayne wasn't a cliche yet.  Therefore if you can forget the 6 or 7 decades of baggage that trailed after this movie baggage that has turned up not just in Westerns but in other genres such as film noir and romantic comedies and  disaster epics then the freshness of Stagecoach  becomes readily apparent.Oddly enough the movie seems at first to be a cowboy spoof of  Grand Hotel  in the manner in which it throws together its 7 archetypal characters into the stagecoach for the long journey to Lordsburg.  But soon enough Ford creates his own archetypes like John Wayne emerging from the desert alone carrying his saddle like some epic hero.  And there's the magnificent setting itself empty and unforgiving and beautiful. Unfortunately Ford would come to rely on Monument Valley to convey significance but here it seems at once incidental and yet integral to the plot.  Stagecoach  ultimately comes to feel like the birthing of our great mythos both of our understanding of our nation's expansion and of the importance of our 20thcentury entertainers.  Even the characters'  names have been burned into our consciousness  Ringo Kid Stella Dallas Doc Boone.  And this is the movie that made John Wayne the indispensable American hero a role he easily carried for 4 decades.Above and beyond all this the movie also features one of the alltime great chases in cinema  the breakneck race across the saltflats with Wayne expertly wielding his shotgun keeping Geronimo's hordes from getting too close.  Watch for some deathdefying stuntwork as Wayne's character leaps from harnesstoharness along the teamofeight . . . then consider how cheaply it would be done today with computer imaging and choppy editing. Ford delivered action the oldfashioned way  he made his stuntplayers EARN it keeping an unblinking camera on them the whole way.  Superb.".

Therefore if you can forget the 6 or 7 decades of baggage that trailed after this movie baggage that has turned up not just in Westerns but in other genres such as film noir and romantic comedies and  disaster epics then the freshness of Stagecoach  becomes readily apparent.Oddly enough the movie seems at first to be a cowboy spoof of  Grand Hotel  in the manner in which it throws together its 7 archetypal characters into the stagecoach for the long journey to Lordsburg.  But soon enough Ford creates his own archetypes like John Wayne emerging from the desert alone carrying his saddle like some epic hero.  And there's the magnificent setting itself empty and unforgiving and beautiful. Unfortunately Ford would come to rely on Monument Valley to convey significance but here it seems at once incidental and yet integral to the plot.  Stagecoach  ultimately comes to feel like the birthing of our great mythos both of our understanding of our nation's expansion and of the importance of our 20thcentury entertainers.  Even the characters'  names have been burned into our consciousness  Ringo Kid Stella Dallas Doc Boone.  And this is the movie that made John Wayne the indispensable American hero a role he easily carried for 4 decades.Above and beyond all this the movie also features one of the alltime great chases in cinema  the breakneck race across the saltflats with Wayne expertly wielding his shotgun keeping Geronimo's hordes from getting too close.  Watch for some deathdefying stuntwork as Wayne's character leaps from harnesstoharness along the teamofeight . . . then consider how cheaply it would be done today with computer imaging and choppy editing. Ford delivered action the oldfashioned way  he made his stuntplayers EARN it keeping an unblinking camera on them the whole way.  Superb.";

	schema:reviewBody "If John Ford's Stagecoach is clichd today it is merely because it set the standard for A' Westerns in 1939. That many of Stagecoach's attributes eventually became clich simply speaks for the importance and the elegant simplicity of the film.I had intended to see Stagecoach for years. This in fact was one of the few times I actually read several IMDb reviews of the movie before seeing it. Ford's classic definitely met or surpassed all of my expectations. I came away with a strangely fulfilled feeling after watching it. Much of the plot shooting style and other devises were so familiar to me from later duplication if not outright plagiarism that one corner of my brain occasionally complained This is a tad corny.' Yet the bulk of my brain came away immensely satisfiedas if I had just enjoyed a favorite desert alamode. My best explanation for this is that Ford's film simply WORKS. It worked in 1939 and it does in 2003. That of course is why so many other Westerns and other movies borrowed so heavily from it. It set a standard that held sway for more than a quarter of a century.What is so good about Stagecoach? Plenty. Ford combines just enough action with strong character development solid dialogue and outstanding cinematography to piece together a very satisfying 96 minutes of entertainment.  Those unable to comprehend that a film made in 1939 and set by my best estimation in 1880 is not going to be played out in 1999 politicallycorrect sensitivity naturally cry long and hardas they do with nearly all pre1990 films. Other than Get a life' I have no real comment to direct at this group. To those others who fail to see anything above the ordinary here I suggest an additional viewing. It may not be Hollywood's best film of the 1930sor even the legendary year of 1939 for that matter but it is a true Hollywood classic.SPOILERS AHEADSet in the Arizona Territory probably in 1880 The Longstar newspaper editor noted that the Republican National Convention was in Chicago at that time making it 1868 1880 1884 or 1888. Considering the apparent age of the Civil War veterans and Geronimo's activities 1880 would be my best guess. the film has a simple linear plot. A private stagecoach tries to make it from Tonto to Lordsburg despite the ominous threat of the legendary Geronimo going on the warpath. Soldiers are promised as an escort but are later reassigned when more pressing dangers arise. The stage forges ahead unprotected and eventually faces the Indian attack everyone has feared. Inside the coach nine individuals are gelling into a somewhat cohesive minicommunity. As some posters have noted Ford was good at building characters that were deeply developed yet still managed to represent an entire class or group of people.The ensemble cast is outstanding with John Wayne bursting on the scene with a strong and likeable performance as the Ringo Kid. Claire Trevor Oscarwinning Thomas Mitchell David Caradine George Meek Burton Churchill and Louis Platt along with Andy Devine and George Bancroft are believable and for the most part likeable.Without rehashing every aspect of the plot I will comment on the Caradine character which has bothered andor stumped some viewers. Hatfield at first called a notorious gambler' and certainly no gentleman' certainly perceives himself to be an old style southern gentleman. He seems to prove that he really isat least when he is in the inspiring presence of a real southern belle like Lucy Mallory Platt. Of course Hatfield turns out not to be the lecherous wolf we assume he is. Rather he is a loyal exConfederate solider who fought under Mrs. Mallory's father. Apparently recognizing the nowgrown Lucy he decides she needs protection on the voyage. I personally do not find this sudden show of loyaltychivalry out of characterdespite Hatfield's recent activities.The most fascinating and riveting scene for meand one I have seen no other reviewer accurately pontificate uponis the climactic moment in the Indian fight when the ammunition supply has been exhausted. We have sensed that the good guys' have a slight chance of surviving thanks to the good shooting of Wayne Caradine Bancroft and even Mitchell. Now however the ammo is gone and only a fraction of the attackers have been dealt with. Hatfield finds one lone bullet in his chamber. Apparently envisioning likely rape and torture for Mrs. Malloryas well as her possibly being forced to witness her baby's murder he faces a titanic moral dilemma and then puts his gun to the head of the praying woman. Before he can perform this apparent mercy killing' though an Indian bullet hits HIM. Moments later Mrs. Mallory closes her prayer and seems to be deliriously imagining a bugle call. Of course it isn't her imagination and the first of the everpresent justinthenickoftime U.S. Cavalry charges of Western fare quickly saves the day.Other than Hatfield apparently dying everything is wrapped up smoothly and happily. One hopes SOMEone takes poor Mr. Peacock up on his invitations to visit his wife and himself in Kansas City KS. Since no one can seem to remember his name correctly however this seems unlikely! Of course Ringo and Dallas ride off into the panoramic Ford sunset safe from the blessings of civilization' and wise enough not to let social stigmas hinder their love for each other. For Ford Wayne and the modern Western of course the end was really the beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's Stagecoach1939does a great many things well. The photography of the beautiful and deadly wild west landscape impressive action sequences universally solid performances and very good use of light and shadows to set the tone and mood of the piece. Where the film failed for me was that I just didn't find any of the interlocking stories of the travelers very interesting. The romance between John Wayne's Ringo and Claire Trevor's Dallas seemed to come out of nowhere as the characters had no previous contact it just seemed like the romance hadn't been earned in the time they shared on the screen. At one moment Ringo is inviting Dallas to sit next to him at dinner and at the next he's proposing marriage it just didn't follow for me. The crime drama story seemed to be completely thrown away and needless with Berton Churchill's Gatewood being a thief that nobody really cares about. John Carradine's mysterious Hatfield is probably the most interesting of the dramatic characters as the dark and brooding gambler is not one to show his cards. The film's main thrust is John Wayne's revenge storyline and it certainly the most satisfying storyline of the piece but Wayne's characteristic lack of emotion hurts what could have been a more interesting and personal throughline. The film's brightest spots are two genuinely entertaining comedy double acts in the drunkard Doc and whiskey salesman Peacock as well as Buck the driver and Marshall Curly Wilcox. Both pairs have great comic dialogue and wonderful comedic performances and really bring a lightness and an easiness to an otherwise dark film. The other highlight of the picture was the climatic wagon chase scene near the end of the film while it wasn't exactly believablethe Indians just kept comingit was extremely impressive and entertaining. Stagecoach1939 is certainly a mixed bag but there are a few very nice treats for those like me who just can't get into the whole John Wayne thing.".

Once they get on the Stagecoach it's no better their selfrighteous attitude which comes across in the director's and script writers' intents are much to stomach. You have a prejudiced aristocratic dandy John Carradine a dumb as nails loner John Wayne a gullible understanding prostitute a vile corrupt banker a smug smallminded preacher an inane drunk doctor an annoying sanctimonious lady who is pregnant and a few other dimwits all riding on the Stagecoach ever fearful of the evil Indian attack. They talk about the most frivolous rubbish ever imagined. All of the characters are entirely irksome. Scenes proceed from A to B without any story good dialogue or interest.The Apache are played by Navajo Indians or a Mexican woman in ranch scene in close ups and by blatant white stunt men in the horse shots. Of course as expected since this is filmed by a virulent white bigoted Director financed by a greedy studio and written by calloused shortsighted studio stable script writers it is no surprise that the Apache are played off as a hostile threat to the grand white civilized lifestyle if you have a brain you will observe that the 'grand white civilized lifestyle' is nothing but a bunch of loathing drunks who shoot each other. You will notice that the Apache are so inept that they can't even stop a Stagecoach and are shot by the rabble riding in said Stagecoach who never run out of bullets and put down about 55 of the attacking Apache in one of the most shallow impalpable scenes ever imagined. If you are wondering how the Apache stopped Stagecoaches all they had to do was shoot one horse. The Apache by that time having been reduced to being a poor starving band of corralled slaves imprisoned murdered by the US government and it's hostile citizens were fighting for survival at that point. Instead they are called savages and made to resemble subhuman scum. Having lived with the Apache myself I realize that they have a rich culture are deeply spiritual and had a love for their land.If you can get past all the inept portrayals and ostensible characters which if you are intelligent is impossible to forgive then at least you can enjoy a narrative but Stagecoach lacks that as well. John Ford doesn't even give us a palpable story. All that is left is cheap 1930's gimmicky cutouts as John Wayne instantly falls in love with ostracized prostitute kills all bad guys then everything is fine.After Stagecoach 1939 was over I was left questioning all the misleading great reviews.

	schema:reviewBody "The John Ford Stagecoach 1939 is a movie to be treasured not analyzed. Its enormous virtues have more to do with the way it was made than what it is about whether the characters are wellwritten or how much sense certain scenes make. Stagecoach is not sensible it is a movie and it is the kind of movie than Americans do best and which no one else can touch.Ford was a great primtive artist not a thinker. In Stagecoach we see him at his best. He blends action and emotion seamlessly and has the one virtue that all great directors possess whatever their subject matter or level of sophistication he knows exactly where to place the camera. This may seem like a minor virtue to literaryminded critics and viewers but it is as much as anything what Ford is about. Stagecoach is among other things one perfectly photographed and acted scene after the other with the camera whether discreet or close at hand always positioned for maximum effect which in this film is as much musical as visual. Stagecoach is among Ford's most graceful films. It is also perhaps his least pedantic.The actors whether sitting standing jumping riding talking shooting giving birth or dropping dead are at all times where they ought to be on screen. How they go through their motions constitutes the bulk of the movie. We are not told how characters feel through dialogue it is shown to us vividly. The later scenes in Lordsburg are staged almost like a ballet a ballet in the dark. Whether in a crowded saloon or an empty street we experience the movements of the principle characters as well as the denizens of the town often accompanied by music some of it underscoring some of it from an upright barroom piano all of it relevant to the feeling of the story and the film. This is not a smart movie of the kind they make today. What irony there is is none too impressive and the dialogue is not clever. It works at a different almost subconscious level and what one of its characters says about the young couple riding off to freedom in the end could be said of the entire movie saved as it is from the blessings of civilization.".

So he instructs them to get local PD'S to take care of it. And one of the cops they ask is John McClane who is tasked with bringing a hacker named Farrell to the FBI. But as soon as he gets there someone starts shooting at them. McClane manages to get them out but they're still being pursued.

	schema:reviewBody "Live Free or Die Hard 2007 is the last good Action film of 2007 in the Die Hard franchise. An oldfashioned cop emerges to foil a hightech attack on the country's computer infrastructure as Bruce Willis brings back one of the biggest action franchises in screen history. It is one of my personal favorite action movies it is a sequel I love to death.It's been over a decade since audiences last saw New York cop John McClane Willis but now as the world's greatest criminal mastermind Timothy Olyphant attempts to cripple the entire country with an innovative act of technological terrorism only one cop can insure that the integrity of the system stays intact. In this the fourth installment of the longrunning action series Underworld director Len Wiseman picks up the torch formerly carried by directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin to helm a script penned by Mark Bomback. Best Action Film Of 2007. Even with ratings PG13 this film works for me. Those four movies of the franchise are the ones I love. When a criminal plot is in place to take down the entire computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the United States and the world it's up to a decidedly old school hero police detective John McClane to take down the conspiracy aided by a young hacker.Well I can't believe I'm saying this but the newest edition to the Die Hard series may rank with the first. It's superb direction fantastic acting groundbreaking special effects and clever scenes will leave you with almost nothing to complain about. Die Hard may very well be the best action flick of 2007. It can be beat but I doubt by a sequel. I am proud to say that Bruce Willis still has some John McClane left in him. Bruce gets to say one of most famous lines in action film history Yippy Kiya Motha ! without cuts he even gets to talk to himself a scene that is almost identical to the scene in the air vent of the first film. C'mon it'll be fun come out to the coast have a few laughs. About all the controversy for the MPAA rating...it was all useless. Die Hard acts just like a rated R film just because it says PG13 doesn't mean its not as violent as the others. No he doesn't say the F word but it's not as bad as you think. It's more of a character to character type of thing then anything else. John McClane learns to bond with a young hacker. Justin Long It's more...I don't know...cute then the other movies it doesn't need the F word. I don't think there is much else to say. Die Hard is one of my best movie experiences to date. The crowd laughed and screamed and then cheered at the end. The only slightest problem I had with this film was the fact that the realism was quite low. Then again as I have said before if everything were realistic we wouldn't have action movies. Live Free or Die Hard is a mustsee FOR DIE HARD FANS.Live Free or Die Hard also known as Die Hard 4 Live Free or Die Hard or simply Die Hard 4 and released as Die Hard 4.0 outside North America is a 2007 American action film and the fourth installment in the Die Hard film series. The film was directed by Len Wiseman and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The film's name was adapted from New Hampshire's state motto Live Free or Die.I loved the fact it's still Die Hard especially in the Unrated cut. the PG13 didn't bother me he still told jokes put a smile on my face gave his tagline  killed the bad guy. But my favorite scene is the Car Chase with the Chooper if I had to pick one. An enjoyable pop projection of post911 anxiety. That said it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didn't have to deal with it. Bruce Willis should not be the victim of facile stereotyping. He brings more heart and humor to apocalyptic pulp fiction than any other actor I can think of offhand. That film is great and the last good Die Hard film A Good Day To Die Hard sucks horrible. Live Free or Die Hard is my favorite fourth film in the Die Hard franchise and this film filmed in 2007 was great. 910 Score A".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Die Hard was probably the best modern action film ever made. The second Die Hard works because the movie has a major sense of humor about how ridiculous it is to put John McClane through such a similar situation again it practically makes fun of itself for a lot of the movie. The third one works because you have a bad guy that is out for revenge against John McClane. The fourth one though it just felt like McClane's character was dropped in as an after thought. I don't think you can just drop John McClane into any story and call it Die Hard and this movie felt more like a Tom Clancy political thriller than a Die Hard movie.While watching this I at least thought I would let it pass as a generic action movie because I was having fun. However then I started thinking about it and I'm sorry I need even my action movies to at least make a little bit of sense. There was just too much stuff in this one that didn't work for me. The first problem I had was that the bad guys created a giant traffic jam in DC causing congestion everywhere except of course for the streets they need for the major car chase scene. Also during the part of that car chase that took place in the tunnel how come when the bad guy started turning the lights off in the tunnel not a single person though to turn their head lights on? However the biggest action scene that bugged me was the scene where John McClane is driving the big rig truck and being chased by the fighter plane. This scene was so laughably over the top that it had no place in a Die Hard movie. I know Die Hard movies are known for their over the top action at some points but I just could not stop laughing at how completely ridiculous this scene was. Oh and seriously since when does the 695 beltway around Baltimore have palm trees? OK that is a bit too nitpicky but it was kind of funny.The film seemed to me to also be extremely inconsistent about whether or not cell phones were working. The cell phones weren't working so he reprogrammed the phone to use the old satcomm satellites instead. Then that stopped working and then a little bit later that is working again. Also I'm still amazed at how Kevin Smith's character is still able to hack into so much stuff even after all the power on the entire eastern seaboard has been shut off. I mean seriously there are a lot of servers out there that have battery backups and stuff but a lot of the servers he would need to go through to have a good enough connection to do any of the hacking he was doing would have been shut down after the power outage. OK maybe I am picking at too much of the film but all this bugged me while watching the film and I wasn't able to just sit back and get sucked in like I would in any other Die Hard film.The acting in the film for the most part was pretty good except of course for the main bad guy. He had one facial expression for the entire movie and the tone of his voice never changed. His only way of showing anger was to throw something off his desk. His performance was so wooden it just paled in comparison to Alan Rickman William Sadler and Jeremy Irons who all three just played wonderful bad guys.The look and feel of the movie didn't feel at all like a Die Hard movie to me either. Sure John McClane takes a good beating like he does in all the films but all the action seemed to crisp and clean. It didn't feel nearly as gritty as the previous Die Hard films. Also one of the things I noticed was the film seemed to have this predominantly blue color scheme going on. It just felt like there was this blue hue through out the film where in the previous Die Hard films the predominant colors are very earthy and red. I don't know if anyone else even knows what I am talking about but that is just something that I noticed that took away from the gritty Die Hard feeling.".

How can somebody who is a fan of the first Die Hard possibly give this one such a high rating?? given that not all voters are confused misguided 15 year old who might have dubious judging criteria at times...A few reasons for being so utterly disappointed1. Okay this is just me I would have liked to see a little more of Mclane's contemporary everyday life  AA meeting perhaps... just to get to see the character and how he's changed a while longer before the action kicks in kind of like in the original maybe I'm living in the wrong decade with such wishes... 2. Again I understand if some disagree The Idea of Willis picking up a kid to take him somewhere and ending up protecting him from killers was already used and done well in 16 Blocks and Shouldn't have been used again...3. The CGI. Most people laud this film including Willis for being so real real images real stunts yes my compliments on the stunt work that WAS real... however i actually gave up counting the effect shots after a while no matter how well they're done one can simply tell the difference between real movie and computer game scene. And I'm so sick of watching artificial computer action especially in movies where it is so damn unnecessary.4. The action. Somewhere along the line in the tunnel this movie stopped being a Die Hard Movie and became a cross between The Matrix The Transporter 2 and MImpossible Mclane and the kid ducking from a falling car that bounces off just inches from their heads. Mclane jumping out of a speeding car since he's so optimistic about the vehicle taking off and crashing into a helicopter MClane in a fistfight in a car dangling in an elevator shaftMclane taking down a Jet etc... thanks a lot John Hunt! 5. Stupid patriotism It's not a system it's a country!... Uh huh...You know I could go on and on but I think the biggest problem of this movie is that the creators have simply ignored who John Mclane was in the original A grumpy Antihero who gets into dangerous situations yes Len Wiseman got that right but who gets himself out of them in a way that is human and doable HE WAS NEVER A SUPERHERO. I don't know what most of you see in this that you find so outstanding I really just think of it as another pebble added to this landslide of senseless sequels that overshadow this summer.".

Uh huh...You know I could go on and on but I think the biggest problem of this movie is that the creators have simply ignored who John Mclane was in the original A grumpy Antihero who gets into dangerous situations yes Len Wiseman got that right but who gets himself out of them in a way that is human and doable HE WAS NEVER A SUPERHERO. I don't know what most of you see in this that you find so outstanding I really just think of it as another pebble added to this landslide of senseless sequels that overshadow this summer.";

No doubt Mr Clancy has also read the original Farewell to Arms article by John Carlin.The first 30 minutes were vintage wisecracking shoot firstask questions later Willis.

I have seldom seen an action movie where the bullet holes appear disappear reappear and vanish so often between scenes. The director must have found the magic bullet that shot Kennedy.The truck vs fighter scene was like watching the bad parts of True Lies and the Matrix spliced together. And are we really meant to believe that a cyber terrorist would leave the government GPS tracking unit attached to his getaway van ! My only surprise was that they didn't remove it with a barrel roll ala Transporter 2.I walked out of Spider Man 3 after 60 minutes. I wish I had walked out of Try Hard 3.9 after 30.".

	schema:reviewBody "...but literally a quadruple serving of awesome Die Hard action.My girlfriend and I saw Live Free Or Die Hard at a premiere screening last night at Radio City Music Hall. The place holds about 5000 seats and it was packed. With an 830 start we got to our seats by 730. The movie didn't begin until 930!!! Guess who was late?Julie and I are not particularly big 'Die Hard' fans. And having to catch a train home from Grand Central station at a certain time we both agreed that if the movie was subpar we would split early to get home earlier.So finally the lights go down around 920 and out comes Bruce Willis. He respectfully apologized and then started jazzing up the audience for the film. The excitement was palpable as the crowded theater whooped it up with Bruce shouting Are you ready!!! Well Julie and I were as we got swept up in the excitement and cheered aloud as if we were at the ball game. Even the couple next to us I'd say they were about in their late sixties dressed very 'proper' were just as energized. The movie starts and a mere few minutes in the action explodes. By twenty minutes into the film Julie and I were sold. Who cares what time we're gonna get home!? I have not had this much fun at the movies since I can't remember when. I have always loved summer movies but only the ones that deliver the goods. The action sequences are top shelf 21st century movie making brilliance. These explosive scenes are a seamless composite of fantastic real world stunt work and exceptional CGI. Hands down they make the film. And for an action movie with 'die hard' in the title I'd say that was the point.It was awesome watching this film with so many people because it was like riding a gigantic roller coaster with everybody having a shared hair raising experience. People were cheering like when Luke blew up the Death Star. The humor throughout was just right. By the end of the film our senses were stunned as we dizzily made our way out of the theater thoroughly entertained.Excellent summer movie! Well done Bruno and crew!".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie with very high hopes. I loved the first three in the series  they are among my favorite action movies of all time. When I first heard they were making a fourth Die Hard movie I thought  Awesome what a great way to introduce Die Hard to a whole new generation of fans.What I saw was a laughable mockery of a Die Hard movie. Let me start by saying the first problem was the rating. Turning a series of R rated gory action flicks into A PG13 imitation does not work. It was as if Fox was trying to pass it off as some type of family friendly movie. This resulted in the film being minimal in bloody action violence minimal in language use and the use of McClane's staple line  Yippee Ki Yay Mo  was made to be slightly distorted so the last word all Die Hard fans know what it is was more implied than spoken. The rating also had another effect. Since the aspects listed above were downplayed so much the movie's style didn't come anywhere close to matching the style of the first three. It didn't Feel like Die Hard.This is off topic but it reminds me of another time the same company took two GREAT! R rated series  Alien  and Predator  and combined them to make the PG13 mockery we now know as AVPI didn't like the villain. The whole movie it didn't seem like he himself really did anything. He didn't really torture or shoot or even severely harm McClane's daughter. He was never really a threat. It was always a henchmen up until the end of the movie. Unless you count the TunnelHelicopter sequence Which bugs me where did all the henchmen come from? In the first and third movies they were German militants and the second movie they were military extremists supportive of General Esperanza. It this movie  they were just kind of there. I mean Gabriel was suppose to be a DoD government employee  and he just pulled a crap load of henchmen out of no where. Were they terrorists? Wow nice background check on a government employee with links to terrorist organizations if they were.The use of technology was just awful. Specifically what you saw on the computer screens was unrealistic and felt like some sort of hi tech fairy tale to me being a networking professional. I mean I had no idea hacking was so graphical and straightforward.To close  if the characters weren't making some cheesy quip or not dying after smashing through multiple plains of glass and being hit with SUV at one point  they most defiantly were contributing to what should go down in history as a sorry day indeed for the Die Hard series.My advice  pull a matrix and pretend the sequel doesn't exist.".

	schema:headline " One of the worst sequels in the history of film";
	schema:reviewBody "die hard 4 is a PG rated kiddie movie with a bored middle aged superhero sleepwalking through uninspired vignettes while tackling an internet hacker with all the charisma of pancake batter. Its plot was seemingly written by a grade schooler with a box of crayons. The CGI action sequences were uninspired and badly staged to the point of almost being slapstick or satirical the only scene that had even a modicum of excitement to it was the opening shootout in Long's apartment. The real Die Hard trilogy may have one or two scenes in each movie which pushed credibility but they were well directed and photographed and had a musical score to add to the tension and the earlier stories were so strong that we could overlook a couple of lapses in logic. This movie was so outlandish and the plot was so badly written it was insulting. We're actually expected to believe that McClane can drive an 18 wheeler and outrun a fighter plane jump out of the 18 wheeler as it rolls over and fall 20 feet onto the wing of a jet then hang onto the wing of this spinning out of control fighter plane jump off the jet and survive a 40 foot drop onto a concrete embankment and survive sliding on his back down another 30 feet or so. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! There were several lengthy scenes of Willis and Long driving and talking endlessly attempts at human drama which amounted to nothing more than Bruce Willis' character complaining about how his life had turned out. The character of his daughter is seemingly about four different characters throughout the movie she's a bitch for no reason in the first scene but then when she gets into a jam in the elevator the first thing she does is ask to talk to daddy so that he can help her out then later she wants to kick the bad guy's ass herself then at the end she wants McClane to set her up with Long's computer hacker character like a schoolgirl. Apparently the writers couldn't make up their minds over her. The dialogue is uninspired and blandly delivered it's clichs about McClane not being able to understand computers already done better in Die Hard 2 and Long's character being unable to deal with McClane's being out of date and not being able to understand computers none of the other characters were memorable they just seemed to drift in and out of their scenes.The entire movie except for the insultingly stupid jet fighter sequence was filmed through a horrible blue grey filter trying to give the movie a sleek look but only making it look drab and dull. For the first time in the series they did not film this movie in widescreen format this was another attempt to cut corners and lowering the cost of the movie and lowering the amount of money this movie would have to make to be commercially successful. The elevator shaft sequence the falling down the stairs bit McClane's family not using his own last name were all done in the first three but the producers claim that they're referencing the earlier films not ripping them off and copying them. Riiight. The reference to the two Agents Johnson from the first Die Hard makes no sense seeing as McClane never met or spoke to either of them in the first movie so how the hell would he remember them after 20 years? Let's go back to the elevator sequence in DHWaV the elevator sequence had the same claustrophobic feeling of the first movie. It was just as well photographed as the original movie had a convincing and memorable score to it full rich vivid colours and was violent without being too over the top and it was short less than 60 seconds. Short but memorable. But the elevator scene in dh4 is a silly vignette badly photographed through that obnoxious blue grey filter and it just lumbers about for the entire lengthy sequence. And the music score? What score? I remember absolutely NOTHING about the musical score in any scene in this crapfest. You can NOT tell me that McClane would remember that catchphrase after 20 years and would think of it to say it at the end of this movie and even if he did it would mean NOTHING to the villain in this movie. What made the line amusing in the first movie was the terrorists' reaction to the line NOT the line itself. And the people who made such a big deal about Does he say his catchphrase or doesn't he? are genuinely pathetic are you that desperate to hear profanity? And we even got to see that moronic catchphrase used in an Arby's commercial or at least as much of it as they could say on television. It's almost like this movie was just an excuse to say that moronic catchphrase yet again. Then in one of the most anti climactic endings ever McClane shoots through his own shoulder and hits the bad guy in his shoulder and kills him instantly? Again ARE YOU SERIOUS?! This movie was an insult to the real Die Hard series as well as the fans. In one hundred years people will look back on Die Hard as being one of the best action movies ever made. die hard 4 live free or die hard is one of the worst sequels in the history of film it took a dump on one of the best action film trilogies ever made. It's the only Die Hard movie notice the quotation marks that I'll never watch again. If it was meant to be a straight sequel they failed. If it was intended to be a satire they failed.Die Hard is a trilogy. There never was a fourth Die Hard movie. Die Hard ended With A Vengeance.".

The character of his daughter is seemingly about four different characters throughout the movie she's a bitch for no reason in the first scene but then when she gets into a jam in the elevator the first thing she does is ask to talk to daddy so that he can help her out then later she wants to kick the bad guy's ass herself then at the end she wants McClane to set her up with Long's computer hacker character like a schoolgirl. Apparently the writers couldn't make up their minds over her. The dialogue is uninspired and blandly delivered it's clichs about McClane not being able to understand computers already done better in Die Hard 2 and Long's character being unable to deal with McClane's being out of date and not being able to understand computers none of the other characters were memorable they just seemed to drift in and out of their scenes.The entire movie except for the insultingly stupid jet fighter sequence was filmed through a horrible blue grey filter trying to give the movie a sleek look but only making it look drab and dull. For the first time in the series they did not film this movie in widescreen format this was another attempt to cut corners and lowering the cost of the movie and lowering the amount of money this movie would have to make to be commercially successful. The elevator shaft sequence the falling down the stairs bit McClane's family not using his own last name were all done in the first three but the producers claim that they're referencing the earlier films not ripping them off and copying them. Riiight. The reference to the two Agents Johnson from the first Die Hard makes no sense seeing as McClane never met or spoke to either of them in the first movie so how the hell would he remember them after 20 years? Let's go back to the elevator sequence in DHWaV the elevator sequence had the same claustrophobic feeling of the first movie. It was just as well photographed as the original movie had a convincing and memorable score to it full rich vivid colours and was violent without being too over the top and it was short less than 60 seconds. Short but memorable. But the elevator scene in dh4 is a silly vignette badly photographed through that obnoxious blue grey filter and it just lumbers about for the entire lengthy sequence. And the music score? What score? I remember absolutely NOTHING about the musical score in any scene in this crapfest. You can NOT tell me that McClane would remember that catchphrase after 20 years and would think of it to say it at the end of this movie and even if he did it would mean NOTHING to the villain in this movie. What made the line amusing in the first movie was the terrorists' reaction to the line NOT the line itself. And the people who made such a big deal about Does he say his catchphrase or doesn't he? are genuinely pathetic are you that desperate to hear profanity? And we even got to see that moronic catchphrase used in an Arby's commercial or at least as much of it as they could say on television. It's almost like this movie was just an excuse to say that moronic catchphrase yet again. Then in one of the most anti climactic endings ever McClane shoots through his own shoulder and hits the bad guy in his shoulder and kills him instantly? Again ARE YOU SERIOUS?! This movie was an insult to the real Die Hard series as well as the fans. In one hundred years people will look back on Die Hard as being one of the best action movies ever made. die hard 4 live free or die hard is one of the worst sequels in the history of film it took a dump on one of the best action film trilogies ever made. It's the only Die Hard movie notice the quotation marks that I'll never watch again. If it was meant to be a straight sequel they failed. If it was intended to be a satire they failed.Die Hard is a trilogy. There never was a fourth Die Hard movie. Die Hard ended With A Vengeance.";

I am regular reader at IMDb for perhaps 5 years but this was the first movie that forced me to get registered and write a review of it. Warning. Text below may contain spoilers  Well not really there is absolutely no suspense in this movie and it is entirely predictable right from the beginning.The movie consists of series of chases and shootouts that are not particularly well choreographed. Plot is virtually nonexistent in other words there are more of the holes that of the plot itself. Willis with his sidekick are dragged from location to location without any explanation how and why they got there. The scale of McLane's actions increased with each instalment first saving the staff of a skyscraper then airport then a city and this time the whole country unfortunately there are 2 issues now. First the whole premise hacking and controlling so many different computer systems is ridiculous second the threat of terrorists does work at all. They are simply not menacing enough. They are led by guy who shut down NORAD just with his laptop but when they shut down traffic in a big city all they create is few car accidents of the kind that can only happen when people are driving with their minds shut down. Other than police department being swamped by citizens what the hell are they doing there? not much happens. Cellphones work it is possible to move around in a car no real panic visible no police presence on streets. Especially response to events from both citizens and government is not depicted at all. I would like to know where the hell was the mighty US Army for entire duration of the movie apparently still tied down killing civilians in Iraq.There are all sorts of clichs you can imagine  Computer genius who is at the same time exceedingly naive at the same time a bit paranoid uttering nonsense all the time and absolutely useless except he miraculously saves the world in the end.  Another overweight computer genius who is a bit paranoid uttering nonsense all the time and absolutely useless.  Supermodelkungfu bitch crossover female terrorist  Girly main terrorist who fails to be intimidating at all he seems he can start crying any minute I really miss calibre of Grubers or Colonel Stuart.  Terrorist masterminds who personally involve themselves dirty jobs instead of employing their minions.  Generic industrial locations which seem completely out of place.  1960s scifi meets Matrix style computer rooms I recommend sets designer to visit real server room next time reality may look more menacing than this uneducated fantasy.  Cop chief who always seem to be genuinely busy but he really does nothing in the movie.  Terrorists have resources to hack stock exchanges traffic systems and utilities all over U.S. But still the only thing they can afford to stop a poor cop is a chopper and few not particularly well trained guys with assault rifles.Cast There are really only two characters in the movie all other people appearing in the movie are just faceless bystanders including main foes and their performance is not any better than of any random bystander watching making of a movie.Willis' performance is pretty generic he tries to utter the same kind of one liners as in previous instalments sadly most of the time they are out of place badly timed or complete non sense. As the scale has been upgraded so is the McClane's self confidence who became true superhero with some supernatural abilities. Expect projecting speeding cars into helicopters walking on a wing of a jet etc. This is in contrast with previous instalments where McClane had been smart guy but still realistic police officer who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.Long is genuinely B movie actor. His performance is at best bearable. He might be OK mindless script does not give much space for his character.Bottom line No doubt it is the worst of all 4 Die Hards. I compared it to Independence Day it resembles a bit but in many aspects ID is much better working. If you like mindless movies filled with explosions but can do without any coolness factor then you can try this everyone else avoid it!disaster 0 out of 5".

When Farell's apartment is converted into Swiss Cheese by certain terrorist types just after McLane comes aknocking everyone's favourite NYPD detective smells one of his famous rats and the pair come into the orbit of Thomas Gabriel a very overplayed wouldbe psychotic Timothy Olyphant a very bitter former NSA computer expert who's out to teach Uncle Sam a thing or two by systematically shutting America down via the internet.

Unfortunately whether due to budget restrictions or simple laziness on the parts of director Len Wiseman and writer Mark Bomback we never really get to see what the aweinspiring and terrifying consequences of such action might be short of a few nasty traffic pileups and lots of lights going out. To wit McLane isn't really put through much hell before inevitably he starts getting well'ard with the terrorists.Much praise has been heaped on the stunts which are in keeping with the 'Timex hero in a digital age' theme nearly all genuine rather than CGI based but whether they're bluescreened or for real things exploding are still just loud bangs if there's little or no suspense. Let's face it charming though Willis still is and this installment's buddybuddy factor works pretty well thanks to an intelligent twitchy turn from Long there is never any doubt that it's going to be McLane victorious and once again entirely at ease with having just killed some 1520 terrorists.Credibility was there in spades in Die Hard despite its 'high concept' narrative  by part four rhyme and reason seem to have been finally sacrificed for boxoffice certainties.

C'mon it'll be fun come out to the coast have a few laughs. About all the controversy for the MPAA rating...it was all useless. Die Hard acts just like a rated R film just because it says PG13 doesn't mean its not as violent as the others. No he doesn't say the F word but it's not as bad as you think. It's more of a character to character type of thing then anything else. John McClane learns to bond with a young hacker. Justin Long It's more...I don't know...cute then the other movies it doesn't need the F word.I don't think there is much else to say. Die Hard is one of my best movie experiences to date.

	schema:reviewBody "12 years on McClane is bald estranged from his family and feels increasingly like an anachronism. There is a strong 'post911' vibe a muted color scheme and a strangely sombre tone that permeates proceedings. The film covers more terrain literally than it's predecessors and the action is slightly episodic as a result of shoehorning a series of minishowdowns into a plot about cyberterrorists and an attempt to shut down the US infrastructure. It's handled more deftly and inventively than you might expect but it's not an obvious marriage.The authenticity of the 'hacking' that takes place is also suspect webcam becomes spycam in the basement of a security obsessed computer nerd? and there is a horribly misjudged piece of casting in Kevin Smith as a stereotypical basementdwelling uberhacker.he simply doesn't have the acting chops Having said all of that the action sequences are topnotch brutal and oldschool. with a couple of nods to the 'new' in the form of the stoic but sizzling Maqqie Q and 'le parkour' madman Cyril Rafaelli whose incredible dexterity is captured to dazzling effect by Wiseman and crew The performances are mainly strong especially Bruce who immediately reminds you that you're watching McClane despite the slightly sanitized language and vanishing hair. Justin Long is surprisingly engaging as McClane's assignmentsidekick in a role which could so easily have been irritating and Olyphant as the main bad guy gives an intense and charismatic performance full of understated humor and implied menace. He makes for an interesting antagonist reminiscent of Rickman's 'Hans Gruber' in the original a little less verbose but a similarly charming sociopath with a formidable subzero stare. Even the inclusion of Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter another move which on paper seemed destined to annoy works well. She has inherited some of her fathers personality traits to frequently amusing effect but the filmmakers wisely avoid the temptation to give her any 'Lara Croft' type abilities in order to appease a wider demographic a move that would have potentially alienated the core audience  even more than the furore over the PG13 rating.Speaking of the rating while the film is light on blood and one particular swearword the violence hasn't been toned down at all. If anything McClane is actually more hardened and brutal than before. Enemies are often dispatched with an efficiency and a ruthlessness commensurate with a man who's done this before. There is also a calm resignation in Willis' body language at times. McClane is a man who has found no solace in being a hero postdivorce and struggling to maintain a relationship with his daughter His son is barely mentioned he feels he has lost the things that matter most to him. This is the single most notable change in the film. Gone is the wildeyed heavybreathing frantically pacing McClane of the original Die Hard The man rapping on the windows desperately trying to signal the fire brigade. Willis communicates this malaise subtly and effectively prompting the Justin Long character to ask at one point 'Why are you so calm? Have you done that kinda stuff before?' The direction is astonishingly controlled and confident from the man that bought the world 'Underworld' He may be one to watch after all. and for my money offers the best spectacle of any film this summer.There is a weight and an impact to the stunts and the fight scenes that comes from using actual stuntwork so often eschewed these days in favor of scenes built entirely on disk.As mentioned the tone is slightly subdued for a summer actioner despite a good number of amusing lines and a healthy amount of selfawareness which differentiates it from the others in the series. There is a worldweariness amongst the chaos. A meditation on being 'that guy' is one of the more inspired exchanges and the greatest insight into McClane's journey through the missing years. As a result the audience is not left to enjoy the sense of good triumphing over evil at the end without at least a little remorse about the meaning of it all It reminded me of one of the great strengths of '24' in that regard.. As the credits roll all may not be right with the world as would be more typical of the genre but there are other more personal triumphs to savor. This gives the film a little more depth than the previous sequels though it takes some of the edge off the 'octane buzz' that the film injects you with.Nevertheless this remains significantly the best blockbuster of the Summer Season. It is the first to truly deliver on all it promised and probably surpasses realistic expectations It would require a second viewing to determine where it might rank in the series but it is more than worthy of the name and Die Hard remains for my money the undisputed champ amongst action franchises. I humbly request one more installment in which Bruce et al pour heart and soul into creating a worthy sendoff and then suggest that Bruce let's McClane retire undefeated. He'll have earned it.".

He cracked me up a few times especially his comment when the badguys brought him out of the lift. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was also good as Lucy but was clearly shoehorned into the script at the last minute and was underused. She also suffered from Wiseman and Bomback's insensitivity for internal human logic  she's clearly feisty and punchy yet doesn't make a sound when Gabriel orders the jet to target her dad in the truck.Which brings me to Timothy Olyphant. The guy's a good actor and was superb as the villains in Go Scream 2 and The Girl Next Door but here he's totally nonthreatening. One almost feels sorry for him as McClane now a terminator relishing the capacity for murder his total invulnerability affords him marches unstoppably to kill Gabriel while as mentioned before teasing him about his dead partner.The climax was pumped and tense and I quite liked McClane shooting through himself but the censoring of 'mother beep with a gunshot was as insulting as all the obvious redubbing I noticed throughout the film. There'll be an unrated DVD with the original language and GCI blood but you can't polish a turd.A hollow collection of 'goodbits' some of them good enough to be worthy of Die Hard but ultimately there were too many jumps in logic internal and external for me to suspend disbelief. As I said before I don't have problems with such films and this was an undeniably enjoyable 2 hours but the Die Hard banner is reserved for superior quality adult entertainment and this fell short. Congratulations to Wiseman for upgrading from a Paul W S Anderson to a Jonathan Mostow but please hone your craft somewhere other than on the Die Hard pitch. Get McTiernan out of prison get a good screenwriter eg Shane Black and give McClane his brain and balls back for Die Hard 5.".

Much like the previous Die Hard entries logic isn't exactly a part of the game but sheer adrenaline packed excitement sure is. John McClane is faced with many outrageous challenges and like before he doesn't back down even after seriously getting his ass whooped. But that's McClane you. Also McClane isn't just as tough and resourceful as ever he is a wise ass at the top of his game. Much of the controversy on the forums here was about the PG13 rating's limited profanity I know I participated in the discussion but guess what? There is profanity! But it is not really that that matters it is John McClane's wise ass no fear attitude that fans want and that is just what they get. The profanity is obviously less than in the previous films but it still has plenty of funny moments and the famous 'yippy kah yay' quote is here in full glory.Also the stunt work is in full glory with several amazing set pieces especially a dual with a super fighter jet near the end. GradeA Hollywood mayhem and destruction and very little apparent CGI. As far as summer entertainment goes  forget Pirates 3 or Spider Man 3  this is an action movie that knows when it is getting over the top ridiculous and spares the viewer overkill but still manages to be ridiculous and entertaining. There are also subtle references to previous Die Hard movies that fans will undoubtedly smile at.  810Rated PG13 for violenceintense action and profanity. Ages 13.".

	schema:reviewBody "Live Free or Die Hard 2007 out of 4The fourth film in the franchise has John McClane Bruce Willis asked to pick up a hacker Justin Long for questioning by the two of them are soon under attack from an unknown group of men. Soon it becomes clear that a madman Timothy Olyphant plans on hacking into every U.S. system to bring the country down. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD sounds like it would be a complete loser. I mean after all who thought it would be a good idea to put McClane up against internet hackers? As silly as the story might sound it actually works extremely well thanks in large part to a pretty nailbiting and tense story that fits into the post 911 world of fear where we could be hit hard at anytime. Now I will freely admit that you've really got to suspend your disbelief because not for a single second did I buy McClane being able to pull off what he does here. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I'd buy the events in the first three films a lot more than I do this one but director Len Wiseman handles everything so well that you can overlook the unbelievable nature of the picture. What works best is the direction actually because he at least makes you believe that this terrorist group could pull off what they're doing and pretty much attack America on three different levels. I'm really not sure if would be as easy as the bad guys do it but this is just a minor problem. There are some really terrific action scenes scattered along the way including a real nailbitter on a highway where all lanes are opened and this leads to an amazing crash. Another terrific sequence happens with Willis driving a semi and a fighter jet comes to attack. Willis as you'd expect is in fine form as he has no problem fitting into this character. The oneliners and his smart mouth are right on the mark and he manages to also play the more dramatic moments. I thought Long was okay in his role but there's no question that it's rather underwritten. Olyphant makes for a good villain as does Maggie Q in her brief scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also good in her scenes as the daughter. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD manages to deliver in the entertainment value the drama and there's no question that the action is fun. The film has a few flaws along the way but it's still another good entry in a very good series that manages to be different yet keep the same type of fun.".

	onyx:emotionText "Live Free or Die Hard 2007 out of 4The fourth film in the franchise has John McClane Bruce Willis asked to pick up a hacker Justin Long for questioning by the two of them are soon under attack from an unknown group of men. Soon it becomes clear that a madman Timothy Olyphant plans on hacking into every U.S. system to bring the country down. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD sounds like it would be a complete loser. I mean after all who thought it would be a good idea to put McClane up against internet hackers? As silly as the story might sound it actually works extremely well thanks in large part to a pretty nailbiting and tense story that fits into the post 911 world of fear where we could be hit hard at anytime. Now I will freely admit that you've really got to suspend your disbelief because not for a single second did I buy McClane being able to pull off what he does here. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I'd buy the events in the first three films a lot more than I do this one but director Len Wiseman handles everything so well that you can overlook the unbelievable nature of the picture. What works best is the direction actually because he at least makes you believe that this terrorist group could pull off what they're doing and pretty much attack America on three different levels. I'm really not sure if would be as easy as the bad guys do it but this is just a minor problem. There are some really terrific action scenes scattered along the way including a real nailbitter on a highway where all lanes are opened and this leads to an amazing crash. Another terrific sequence happens with Willis driving a semi and a fighter jet comes to attack. Willis as you'd expect is in fine form as he has no problem fitting into this character. The oneliners and his smart mouth are right on the mark and he manages to also play the more dramatic moments. I thought Long was okay in his role but there's no question that it's rather underwritten. Olyphant makes for a good villain as does Maggie Q in her brief scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also good in her scenes as the daughter. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD manages to deliver in the entertainment value the drama and there's no question that the action is fun. The film has a few flaws along the way but it's still another good entry in a very good series that manages to be different yet keep the same type of fun.";

First fire hydrants lose their high pressure once the water has traveled about 3 feet. And the pressure comes from the narrow hydrant nozzle not the water supply in the ground. If you knock the hydrant over it won't spray upward more than a few feet and certainly wouldn't knock a guy out of a helicopter who would've been clipped into a safety harness for rifle sniping anyway. Idiotic.All in all this movie is terrible. We walked out. How can chase set pieces be boring? Die Hard 4.0 will show how. Lousy movie.".

Non stop action grabs you in the first ten minutes and doesn't let go till the credits. Mclane is back rugged and raw Willis gives a great performance as he reprises his role. There's one scene in particular that i loved When hes driving the computer nerd that hes protecting after he has several run ins with Assasians and Johns a little banged up. He's asked Why are you doing this? or something like that and McClane says If there was someone else I would be glad to let them do it. then the kid asks So why do it then McClane responds Because there is no one else. I don't know maybe I'm reading to deep in but i thought that really shows who and what McClane is hes the guy who is willing to put his own neck out to protect us because thats what he needs to do not what he wants to do. He didn't ask to be a hero just that no one else stepped up that was willing to take the hits. Live Free Or Die Hard is a great action movie that even thou it may not rank with the original nor the third installments i would definitely say its better than the second. And it sure is nice to see McClane back in action.......Yippie Kayay MtherFcker".

The sequence where Bruce engages in handtohand combat with a fighter jet yes really is just plain ludicrous. Maggie Q's henchwomanshe's Asian so of course she is an expert martial artist must have been a terminator it's the only way to explain why she took so long to die. Timothy Olyphant's villain must rank as the dullest screen villain in living memory he was given literally NOTHING interesting to say or do. Oh wait I think he kicked a chair once. He was angry you see. Not as angry as I was at the thought that the two hours of my life I wasted watching this drivel are now lost forever. And if I see one more pretty estranged daughter in perildaddy's coming to save the dayI love you daddy subplot I will puke.

	schema:reviewBody "Skritek is hilarious. One viewer described it as being like a Czech Married with Children. I was reminded of Mr. Bean and Benny Hill and maybe Delicatessen. Characters talk in grunts and some Czech but it's a film that has very little dialog and mostly surreal visual gags. It translates into all languages and can be enjoyed by anyone. The directors other film I saw Cesta Z MestaOut of the City was good but didn't translate well outside of Eastern Europe territories. Shritek is different. The film follows the daily routine of a dysfunctional family. Dad's a butcher having an affair mom's an unhappy grocery store clerk although she tries to smile the son's a pothead skateboarder in trouble with the law and the sister is busy trying to contact her Elf friend. That's right throw in a Fellini like Elf who tries to help the family. The film is shown in a very fast speed too which makes it all the more silly and cartoonish. But be warned some of the images of dad's job at the slaughter house are very grotesque. I could only find this film on DVD on Czech websites luckily Demonoid had it. It's a shame such a hilarious bizarre comedy has never got a DVD distributor in the US. This film would Definitely have a huge cult following if more people new about it. If you enjoyed Delicatessen Tuvalu Benny Hill or Jos Stelling's De Illusionist 1984 you'll dig this film. It's a must see for fans of bizarre and absurd comedy.".

Good film especially if you want something different.This is also a pretty funny film to watch under the influence of mind altering substances. Especially since it deals with this subject.

In this way the movie is a commend on the strict way we think about families in the West.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1950s and 60s there were practically zillions of giant radioactive monster films. Giant shrews ants spiders dinosaurs and whatnot scared audiences and were immensely popular throughout the world. For example THE BEAST FROM 20000 FATHOMS 1953 clearly led to Japanese films such as Godzilla 1954 and its many spinoffs. In general these films were supercheesyhaving pretty secondrate special effects even for the time and lousy dialog. Godzilla was a guy in a reptile suit TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE used a lobster and THE KILLER SHREWS used hairy costumes placed on dogsall very high on the cheeseometer. However a very small number of these films did have decent special effects for the time period and tried to be serious entertainmentand IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is one of them.Unlike many giant monster films IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA looked like it had a larger budget. Much of this was because they had the cooperation of the navy and because they used GOOD stock footagenot the usual grainy and irrelevant filler used in many of these films. It also looked big budget because of the work of Ray Harryhausen. Now in the 21st century his work appears rather crude and old fashioned but for the mid1950s it was state of the art and still holds up reasonably well if you aren't an idiot who expects CG and state of the art effects. Sure the giant octopus looks a bit odd and is obviously controlled through stopmotion but it is very well integrated into the scenes and still impresses. It's obvious that they really cared and wanted to make a quality picture.As far as the romance and dialog goes I will admit it has a lot of clichssuch as the brainy but sexy female scientist. However it was handled a bit better than usual and at least Faith Domergue a perennial in 50s scifi was pleasant looking. I know it's weird but I really get turned on by the brainy scientists in these film. In fact I married one myselfthough she has no experience so far with giant monsters! Don't worry folksI showed this review to my wife and I am NOT in the dog house!For lovers of the genre this film is a must. For those who think giant monsters attacking mankind are stupid then at least one is better than most of the rest!!".

My only regret is that this is all too infrequent and most of it arriving at the end of the film.  The rest of the story centers around Kenneth Tobey Faith Domerge and Donald Curtis trying to discover what it is that held Tobey's submarine. There is also a weird love triangle among the three as well which enhances the story I believe.  All in all this is a fine piece of classic science fiction entertainment.".

Eventually after a considerable struggle they do escape and later discover that what had held them down was in fact a giant Octopus!From scientists Dr. John Carter Donald Curtis  Dr. Leslie Joyce Faith Domergue working along with the military's Commander Matthews we learn that this Octopus has undergone an atomic mutation and has now come to prey on man instead of fish and is all set to ravage the West Coast of America. Eventually it surfaces and attacks the Golden Gate Bridge while San Francisco panics in fear! Can It be stopped? The real star of this film is Harryhausen's Giant Octopus who even with only six tentacles manages to make a more lasting impression on the viewer than most of the cast. That said the theme of feminism is also an important undercurrent of this story and I felt Faith Domergue did a wonderful job with what she was given to work with. The moments she coaxes the transsteamer survivor into admitting it was a giant Octopus that attacked his ship is a great one for her. While this movie is much too slow getting to its eventual payoff for most viewers it's never bothered me as much because I felt Domergue and Tobey had a great chemistry on screen together and I actually liked the addition of their romance here. Still this has to be one of the first disaster films really considering how a giant Octopus nearly does in San Francisco...and well that's a cool and fun premise for a movie in my book even if one does have to swallow one's disbelief.".

When there it brings down the Golden Gate Bridge and destroys several other landmarks before being attacked by flame throwers to send it back into the sea where is it blown to bits by a torpedo.The stopmotion animation by Ray Harryhausen is excellent despite the fact that the movie's low budget made the octopus have six tentacles instead of eight.

	schema:headline " Giving a Big Octopus a Hot Foot";
	schema:reviewBody "It Came From Beneath the Sea was one of the better monster films from the Fifties as Hollywood cinema was desperately trying to compete with the small picture box gradually invading American homes. One of the answers was large screen special effects and this film was one of the best in that department.Ray Harryhausen's name so far is still the only special effects man that I know who's name will actually encourage people to buy a movie ticket. He created some marvelous film monsters and this was one of his best.The octopus we are told comes from the Mindinao Deep a spot on our planet still not totally explored because it is the deepest part of our ocean's bottoms. Presumably there are a whole lot more like him around and in point of fact to this day we don't know all the creatures of the sea. That perennial villain of Fifties Science fiction atomic testing andor radiation has made this big guy move out of the depths and try to capture Captain Kenneth Tobey's submarine. He barely gets away and Tobey's is the first of several incidents involving the creature. Scientists Faith Domergue and Donald Curtis are also on the job and the creature ends up in San Francisco Bay. He does a number on the Golden Gate bridge and then tries to beach himself at the Embarcadero. Army flame throwers see that doesn't happen.Faith Domergue was a really beautiful woman who became known again through the Howard Hughes biographical film The Aviator. She was at one time Hughes's main squeeze. This is probably the film she's most known for though. There's one scene where Domergue uses her best asset to convince a merchant seaman whose ship has been sunk by the octopus but is afraid of being given a section 8 to fess up about the monster. Kind of campy but fun.The monster's no villain here as in some films. He's just a creature whose habitat man has disturbed that's trying to survive. Unfortunately we can't have him roaming the Pacific destroying all kinds of civilian and military activity. So he has to be killed. For me it was a bit sad seeing the outcome. I think other viewers will feel the same way.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't tell you how many times I tried to catch this flick over a span of years but was always stymied in the attempt. Chalk it up to bad timing falling asleep or missing it in the cable listings. I might have blown this one too but thanks to DVR even nodding off would have had a remedy.The first thing I noticed here was that the black and white transfer I viewed on Turner Classics was phenomenally crisp and offered a first rate viewing experience. Ray Harryhausen's monster effects and the film makers' stop motion wizardry really brought a level of sophistication to this otherwise B grade scifihorror film. Granted the action isn't what modern day viewers would expect given the prevalence of CGI but for the midFifties this was pretty cool.But you know the picture had it's share of goofs too and it's the kind of stuff I live for with these old pictures. Remember when the airplane pilot spotted the pair of survivors in the rubber dinghy after the sailors abandoned ship during the first attack? When the scene transitions to the naval hospital there are four men brought in! Then this next scene I had to wonder whether it was intentional or not because it was just so ironic. In the lab where the scientists and Commander Pete Matthews Kenneth Tobey are working there's a prominently displayed sign that says 'No Smoking' but the commander spends his entire time taking drags on his cigarette.But the one that really doubled me over was when Commander Matthews and Professor Joyce Faith Domergue are on the beach investigating the latest missing person headline and the professor explains to the Admiral that the potential sea monster probably hasn't gone away from the area. Yet she and the commander are out in the ocean swimming!Well if you can take your scifi with a grain of sea salt this is probably one of the better giant mutant due to atomic radiation flicks you're likely to come up with from the era. The octopus attack on the Golden Gate Bridge was a pretty creative affair and if you're going to make a stand for humanity you might as well have the movie heroes blow the monster all to hell with an explosive torpedo. It sure does rule out a sequel though.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Ray Harryhausen since I was old enough to appreciate movies so I bought the DVD of It Came From Beneath the Sea even though I hadn't seen the film in many years. Having rewatched it I have to admit that it's perhaps the least of his film accomplishments.Once again the atomic bomb provides the justification for another giant monster though despite what has been inaccurately reported elsewhere the octopus in the film has not been mutated by radiation. It's simply a very large example of its kind that was living at the bottom of a deep ocean trench. When atomic testing made it radioactive it couldn't effectively hunt because other sea creatures could somehow sense its presence. Therefore it came to the surface in search of food.One of the major problems with this film is that while an octopus makes a decent giant monster it completely lacks the personality of some of Harryhausen's other creatures. Furthermore it is confined to the seaand by extension the shorelinelimiting its ability to go on a proper rampage.Even at 79 minutes the film moves very slowly until the climax. The opening sequence in which the beast attacks a submarine captained by Kenneth Tobey's character goes on for several very long minutes of inconsequential naval dialogue.The lethargic pacing extends to the plot as well. The team of scientists assigned to determine what attacked the sub take a full two weeks to identify it as an octopus.An odd love triangle of sorts pads the running time. Faith Domerguewho is presented as a modern feminist despite her tendency to scream on cueseems just as interested in Tobey's navy man as she does in her fellow scientist. The two men acknowledge the triangle but neither seems at all competitive about it.Domergue is one of the best things about the film. She's credible as both scientist and sweater gal and is a good example of the increasing role of female characters in sciencefiction films of the period.Once the octopus attacks in earnest things pick up quite a bit and Harryhausen's effectsincluding stopmotionanimated building demolitionare quite effective. While this is definitely a lesser effort for him he still shows what he can do with a small budget and a relatively uninteresting monster.".

Surprisingly for this type movie the three share equal time on screen and it's pretty clear director Gordon's instructions to them are to lowkey it which they do to good effect.The first atomic submarine the Nautilus sailed in mid1954 to a lot of public interest. No doubt the producers here were well aware and wove a crowdpleasing story around the film version. Then too mutant monsters had not yet taken over movie screens as they would a few years later. No doubt the success of this film was parent to many of those creature offspring. Anyway as these movies go this is definitely one of the better ones in all departments though a couple of romantic scenes could have been easily economized.In passingI really like that last scene where our three musketeers get no recognition for their heroics.

The special effects are certainly not incredible but are very good looking as 50's style effects go. Watch for the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge by the giant octopus as well a the scene in which it's tentacles lurch through San Francisco like giant snakes.     An above average 50's SciFi.";

The HBomb Tests that mutate an already gigantic Octopus octopus into an even bigger monster  it becomes radioactive. Submarine commander Pete Matthews played by Kenneth Tobey The Thing From Another World '51 The Beast From 20000 Fathoms '53  The Vampire '57. he  his crew get attacked by it in the beginning.

In the climax the monster attacks San Fran. even the famed Golden Gate Bridge  Embarkidaro Tower are demolished. Great entertainment with thrills  chills. Got this on DVD in 2004 My favorite Harryhausen Film! Looking forward to the Jan. 2008 Colorized 2Disc Special Edition DVD Release which Legend Films will not be colorizing it as they did 20 Million Miles To Earth 1957 which I have  is pretty impressive. West Wing Studios are supposed to do It Came From Beneath The Sea I hope it has some nice exclusive special features like the Colorized 20 Million. Audio Commentary Video Interview with Ray  an Image Gallery those at least. I am not sure if it will include the BW Version. Columbia TriStars recent DVD wasn't that great only extra it has was the trailer. I got It Came  Earth vs. 2Discs they are really awesome!  have the movies remastered in HiDef with 5.1 Surround why didn't 20 Million have 5.1 Surround? oh well. I love the colorized versions for both films  the technology has improved  looks much better then the 80's Colorizing Process like done to King Kong which looked awful. I am not hip on Colorization but Legend Films has been doing a great job on Films like Ray's  others. Anyway if u hate Colorization so much both Discs also include the original BW Versions with a toggle between feature which I found annoying on my one DVD Player every time the chapter changed a small camera popped up in the corner  I couldn't make it go away quite annoying! otherwise perfect DVD's with nice special features. Far surperior to the old Columbia TriStar DVD Releases from a few years back.".

Also Faith Domergue's character of Professor Joyce was hard to figure out.

I am a big fan of SciFi's from the 50 's but this one is too dated military and lame. The story takes place after WWII and during the Cold War in a period when the military people were in the summit of their careers but there are many others good movies from this period. The greatest problem is the lack of action with the romance without any chemistry between Pete and Joyce with John Carter with them all the time in a total waste of time. The period of research is also too long. The stopmotion effects are OK for a 1955 film. The good point is Prof. Lesley Joyce a woman ahead of time with her independence and not fainting or screaming like most of the heroins from the 50's and 60's movies. My vote is four.Title Brazil O Monstro do Mar Revolto The Monster from the Choppy Sea".

	schema:headline " Sexist Feminism";
	schema:reviewBody "Faith Domergue had a cold beauty that made her suitable as female scientist Professor Leslie Joyce. The stereotype of the cold hard scientist whose intellect does not allow itself to be swayed by mere sentiment and feeling was especially prevalent in the old science fiction movies and thus a beautiful female scientist constituted a special challenge for a macho man used to having his way with ordinary women. In this movie said macho man is Commander Pete Mathews.A lot of old movies are sexist by twentyfirst century standards but science fiction movies from the 1950s with their inevitable beautiful female scientists often have a feminist theme in them pushing back against that sexism. But the message tends to be mixed with the movie expressing a sexist attitude one minute and a feminist attitude the next. No more is this so than in It Came from Beneath the Sea.Joyce's colleague is Dr. John Carter. They have both been called in to investigate a hunk of mysterious substance that got caught in the diving plane of Mathews' submarine. When Joyce definitively determines the nature of the substance a piece of giant octopus Carter kisses her on the cheek and then she nestles in his arms as Mathews calls Naval Intelligence.

	onyx:emotionText "Faith Domergue had a cold beauty that made her suitable as female scientist Professor Leslie Joyce. The stereotype of the cold hard scientist whose intellect does not allow itself to be swayed by mere sentiment and feeling was especially prevalent in the old science fiction movies and thus a beautiful female scientist constituted a special challenge for a macho man used to having his way with ordinary women. In this movie said macho man is Commander Pete Mathews.A lot of old movies are sexist by twentyfirst century standards but science fiction movies from the 1950s with their inevitable beautiful female scientists often have a feminist theme in them pushing back against that sexism. But the message tends to be mixed with the movie expressing a sexist attitude one minute and a feminist attitude the next. No more is this so than in It Came from Beneath the Sea.Joyce's colleague is Dr. John Carter. They have both been called in to investigate a hunk of mysterious substance that got caught in the diving plane of Mathews' submarine. When Joyce definitively determines the nature of the substance a piece of giant octopus Carter kisses her on the cheek and then she nestles in his arms as Mathews calls Naval Intelligence. If they were actually involved romantically this would not be so strange. But they are not. As a result we get that strange mixture of feminism and sexism on the one hand she is the expert in her field and has found the solution on the other hand she is a pretty girl that men just naturally kiss and hold in their arms even when that man is a colleague in a professional setting.On their last night in Pearl Harbor they all decide to have dinner together at a restaurant.

	schema:headline " An enjoyable 50's giant monster flick.";
	schema:reviewBody "It Came from Beneath the Sea may get overshadowed by movies like Them! and Tarantula when it comes to the giant monster movies of the Atomic Age but it's a good and enjoyable example of the genre.The It of the title is an enormous octopus that has become radioactive thanks to A Bomb testing and because its prey can now be alerted to its presence it's been forced to move out of its natural habitat and look for sustenance elsewhere. Among the people figuring out how to track down the beast and destroy it are intrepid submarine commander Pete Matthews Kenneth Tobey and scientists Lesley Joyce Faith Domergue and John Carter Donald Curtis.The movie is typical of its kind in the way that an ever present narrator provides us with a generous amount of exposition. It is admittedly somewhat slow and dialogue heavy much of the time and truthfully doesn't feature a whole lot of good octopus action but in a way this does help in the appreciation of all of those moments when the monster makes its presence known.This was the first collaboration between producer Charles H. Schneer and legendary stop motion expert Ray Harryhausen and Harryhausen's effects are as always quite fun to watch. Even if budget constraints necessitated the octopus possess six tentacles rather than eight the effects still work incredibly well. Robert Gordon's direction is efficient right down the line up to the big finish which is equal parts exciting and suspenseful. Of course with an engaging Tobey in the lead this is highly watchable on that merit alone as he'd proved himself a reliable hero in this and the other 50's science fiction efforts The Thing from Another World and The Beast from 20000 Fathoms. The beautiful Domergue is good with her character in the mold of other leading ladies from the era intelligent and capable and more than eye candy. Curtis is solid in a nononsense role and the three main characters also figure in a love triangle that takes up a little too much of the running time. A fine supporting cast also includes Ian Keith Dean Maddox Jr. Chuck Griffiths Harry Lauter Richard W. Peterson and Del Courtney. Anybody who enjoys the genre Harryhausen's work or the actors is sure to have a good time with It Came from Beneath the Sea.Seven out of 10.".
