He does a great job in acting Sven until the end too.Stefan Kurt is very good. As always. But it's my favourite German actor Jan Josef Liefers who's movie this is really. He is just awesome. He puts more meaning into a raised eyebrow than  speaking from a German perspective  hammy Gtz George puts into a whole movie. He always gets it right. OK he had the most thankful role changing from wannabe yuppie to a caring friend but he never overdoes it. Hollywood should take note. Given the fact that he played his part in bringing down the wall... Check it up and enjoy this genius actor.".

That Justus von Dohnanyi uff what a name!? acted directed and wrote the script of this fantastic and so funny movie is extraordinary and so well done that it reminds me of Woody Allen's work. So if you understand German and if you love the simple things in life and you love to laugh for at least 70 minutes about men and their wired behaviour when they are left alone but get together coincidentally on a swiss mountain hut then you really have to see this black humorous roadmoviecomedy where the hero gets at the end what he wants to be buried in the sea.".

Morgan Kevin Robert and Michael were so refreshing and funny together they really played off of each other well and because of that the film moved along at a great pace. I hate when movies drag on and fall flat in the middle and that's when I start checking my watch to see how much longer the film is going to trudge along. Sometimes movies seem to stall in the middle and the drag on but this movie is almost two hours long and it moved along so seamlessly that the time just flew by.This isn't a movie that's going to win any Academy Awards it's not Shakespeare nor will it solve some huge social problem it's just good fun that everyone in the audience enjoyed. If you are looking to just go to a movie for pure enjoyment and forget about the outside world for a moment go see this movie you won't be disappointed.".

They have enjoyed much and suffered much in their lives apart and together. The movie doesn't dwell on the negative but it does unfold at a comfortable pace. The actors are perfect for their roles and each relishes the part he plays. The supporting actors are able to enjoy their time on screen whether it is for five or fifty minutes. This movie is about family too and grown children might understand their parents better seeing this film with or without them.This is definitely a movie for mature audiences  children will not understand some of the jokes and parents will become red faced explaining them. In fact children will probably want to avoid this movie at all costs. Young people from 18 to 30 may not appreciate the depth of the friendships exhibited by these four friends and they may misunderstand the difficulty of these old folks performing some of the day to day antics that they take for granted dancing drinking picking up women. Getting old is neither easy nor fun but it beats the alternative! Some may refer to this as HANGOVER on Viagra. I prefer to think of it as HOW TO ENJOY OLD AGE WITH A BANG. Or maybe it's a first  not last  hurrah to be repeated annually by anyone over 60.".

Of course it's easy when your those four great actors. Freeman Douglas Kline and De Niro give one of the best ensemble performances in a movie that I've seen in a while. Everyone plays well against each other. These guys must have enjoyed working together because it shows. Good casting and chemistry.Decent story and writing some predictable moments that are elevated to another level are pulled of because some things done or said that were surprising. You'll know when you see it.Mary Steenburgen is wonderful. Still a lovely woman and her character adds a dose of heart when it's needed. A terrific performance from her as well. Just the right kind of singing voice for the part.Pacing was perfect. I didn't feel like I'd been siting in a cinema for very long. Score was well done good job Mark Mothersbaugh!and enjoyed the cinematography too. Big moments were spectacular and the little moments intimate.If I could rate this I'd give it a solid 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lost Vegas was the most uplifting movie I have seen in ages. Being of that 'certain age' I found it poignant and refreshing.All the cast were magnificent. Mary Steenburgen was a pure delight. I know she has taken up music lately and brought it to the screen! De Niro was great as the crusty widower with a chip on his shoulder. Morgan Freeman was as usual bigger than life. Kevin Kline is always a joy to watch I've never forgotten his roll in A Fish Called Wanda!. And last but certainly not least Michael Douglas was spot on with his depiction of a person resisting the aging process. If you think this movie is not perfect you are probably too young to appreciate getting older. Buy the movie and hang on to it until you are in your 60's...you will appreciate it then for sure! All in all if you want to feel good really good after seeing this movie head out the door today and enjoy the ride!".

Mary Steenburgen was a pure delight. I know she has taken up music lately and brought it to the screen! De Niro was great as the crusty widower with a chip on his shoulder.

The actors were of course playing the roles they were made for and I wish Kevin Kline would do more along with Morgan Freedman. I will say Michael Douglas looked awful primarily because his skin tone was so orange. The beginning riff on Kevin Kline's life was hysterical and his final action or lack thereof you saw coming a mile away. However the secret story between DeNaro  Douglas was good and I wasn't quite sure in the beginning which way Mary Steenburgen was going to jump. By the way is it a law in Hollywood that all actresses must get a face lift? Anyway if you want a feel good movie with a good moral message and many a chuckle plus a few gaffaws go see Last Vegas.".

Robert De Niro has perhaps the best role here as an old man whose wife has died and whose soul has died Vegas gets him out of his frump. Morgan Freeman...what can one say about him is there anything he can't do. Kevin Kline is a favorite of mine but somehow he just didn't seem old enough here...although he plays his role well.Then you've got a fine supporting cast Mary Steenburgen is swell as the woman who brings De Niro back to life and tempts Douglas...bringing up to date the old rivalry of two friends. Jerry Ferrara is pretty good as a young swinging single who isn't any too clever...but adds a lot to the story. Romany Malco's role here doesn't get a lot of screen time but he is rather engaging. Why did Michael Ealy take such a small role as Freeman's son he's capable of much more! And then you've got a pretty decent story Four old friends and I do mean old who have known each other from their teens to their 60s head to Vegas to celebrate one of their upcoming marriages. Douglas is trying to recapture youth. Kline thinks he is ready for marital infidelity with his wife's permission. De Niro has lost his zest for life and holds a grudge against Douglas. Freeman isn't quite ready to be truly old...even though he son treats him as if he should be in a nursing home. Will Douglas marry the young thing or will true love be discovered? The first third of the movie was funny and interesting. The last third gets down to the drama that makes the film meaningful. The middle third gets a little old so to speak as one tires of the continual stereotypical jokes about old people. But sitting in the theater the audience was clearly enjoying this film with plenty of laughsoutloud.There are life lessons to be learned here and this is a film worth seeing.Side note I don't find Vegas  as portrayed here  as someplace I'd like to visit. It just seemed decadent and notreal. Made me wish there were some references to Dino and the Rat Pack! But then again I'm old!".

I had 0 desire to see the movie but since it was free and she kinda wanted to go we went. I knew what to expect from this kind of movie heading in but it really surpassed all of my expectations for how awful a movie going experience can be. Within the first 2 minutes of the movie I knew I was going to hate every second of it and that I would have to hold my tongue in mocking every stupid tired worn out joke that the movie presented as an original. It honestly seemed like the kind of movie that they could've had a computer program write. The cast is made up of Hollywood superstars who have worn out their careers by doing every role offered to them what was the last thing Robert DeNiro did worth any value?. I'm so absolutely sick of Morgan Freeman that I can't stand the sound of his voice. Kevin Kline was the only tolerable character in the movie. Essentially the movie was about 4 friends who have been friends since the 1950s who are now all in their 60s dealing with all the usual issues of impotence hip replacements death old people things. So the cool phony Michael Douglas decides to get married to his 30 year old girlfriend at his bosses funeral while giving a eulogy? This doesn't seem to bother anybody at the funeral. The 4 friends with a reluctant and sour Robert DeNiro who is depressed since his wife died go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Let the hilarity ensue! This was a pure example of a cheap studio jerk off feeding off of pop culture cold lifeless jokes and relying on their audience being mostly over the age of 50. If I hear one more Goddamn joke about Viagra using the google or cellphones being complicated I have a good mind to smack my head against the wall till I have the senility of the old people in this movie. As you can imagine the audience chirped with laughter at each of these truly innovative jokes and every line of dialogue was so witty that I could hear Billy Wilder rolling over in his grave. The movie was full of young hot girls in bikinis and also Mary Steenburgen who still looks good. The movie was so predictable that you could see the cookie cutter patterns projected right on the screen. I would've walked out after 5 minutes if I paid for it or if I was alone. I won't vent anymore about how awful everything about the movie was but I was looking for a movie executive afterwards to punch in the face and tell him how much I hated his movie.  Enjoy!!".

It is like the Frankenstein monster  a combination of parts haphazardly put together this time to create a mockery of a movie. If this movie was a living creature it like the Frankenstein creation would be pursuing its creator to the ends of the earth demanding to know why it was created. Nothing saves this movie. When a story is based on the belief that to validate ones life one should drink smoke fornicate dishonor ones marriage vows risk ones health and basically waste time then it's a sure thing that something is awry. And when a story has one guy wanting to talk another guy out of getting married to a younger woman who loves him then look for that red flag which means danger! According to this movie a 70plus year old man with money wanting to marry a 31 year old woman is not necessarily good. RED FLAG! The story is so contrived that it gives one cause to wonder why anyone would want to make this movie in the first place. You have four guys getting together in Las Vegas one guy harbors animosity toward one of the other guys that guy describes that other guy as a best friend. These kinds of nonsensical inconsistencies run throughout the movie making watching this movie drudgery. This movie may set the record for the most worst performances by major movie stars in one movie. The movie's attempts at levity are insipid and misplaced and the actors looked tired like the script. And the biggest clich of the movie is the setting itself  in Las Vegas. One has cause to wonder how much the city of Las Vegas paid the movie producers to advertise Las Vegas in the movie. The personal values promoted by this movie are so destructive as to render them humorless. There is nothing funny about an elderly person going missing on his son with whom he lives or of a socalled friend wanting to ruin another man's relationship with a woman as a way of showing that he cares. The format of this movie  four elderly men getting together for one last fling  had comedic potential but instead fails as it gets bogged down in silly dialog contrived scenes and blatant commercialism in which nobody comes out looking good. The one good feature of this movie is Mary Steenburgen who at age 60 is hot and easily gives the best performance.".

Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a nave Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith James Stewart is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor Edward Arnold millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  When he tries to stop the project Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.This film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  I was dismayed to see a comment obviously from a young viewer of this film that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.  A 1010.".

In typical Capra style the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  I was dismayed to see a comment obviously from a young viewer of this film that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.

A great performance was given by Harry Carey Sr. who plays the Vice PresidentPresident of the Senate for comic relief.  The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smith's final filibuster that were shown give the most impact.  There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score.

The movie showed an ideal a supposed lost cause of truth in government.  And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture at least it shows that maybe once in a great while being the good guy has its definite rewards.  If using the same analogy of the 1998 baseball season The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of 1939 moviemaking then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak something done with full class and the highest respect in mind and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches.  This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic with thoughtprovoking ideas wit a little bit of platonic romance and an excellent cinematography and score and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10.  And in giving this rating either I'm damn right or I'm crazy.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was a lot of fun watching Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in a class where the professor noted how this was the sort of film that was of historical importance while not taking itself too seriously. And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due though according to the trivia it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy works. But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8to80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout particularly in that climactic rousing twentyminute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant unfaltering filibuster is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done to an extreme perhaps in getting things done in government. But at the same time Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here you just have to see them again! This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time or even after could have pulled off.The rest of the film isn't just Stewart's struggle to be heard as a young newintown senator. It's also a witty more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should. Basically the core of the story is the fishoutofwater type where Stewart's Jefferson Smith one of his better Hollywood performances leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state. He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator Claude Rains terrific as always. And there's even a woman Jean Arthur in the mix that's growing an interest in him at first dubious. But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor Edward Arnold as skilled a character actor as could be asked for Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster which includes a reading from the Constitution inandout cheers from the Boy Rangers and general guffaws from the other senators. In other words it's really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that 'Mr. Smith' is working in and even at its cheesiest and sometimes mostdated moments it's a very successful picture for what it wants to do. It's really an equalopportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course.".

And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due though according to the trivia it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy works. But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8to80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout particularly in that climactic rousing twentyminute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant unfaltering filibuster is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done to an extreme perhaps in getting things done in government. But at the same time Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here you just have to see them again! This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time or even after could have pulled off.The rest of the film isn't just Stewart's struggle to be heard as a young newintown senator. It's also a witty more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should. Basically the core of the story is the fishoutofwater type where Stewart's Jefferson Smith one of his better Hollywood performances leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state. He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator Claude Rains terrific as always. And there's even a woman Jean Arthur in the mix that's growing an interest in him at first dubious. But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor Edward Arnold as skilled a character actor as could be asked for Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster which includes a reading from the Constitution inandout cheers from the Boy Rangers and general guffaws from the other senators. In other words it's really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that 'Mr. Smith' is working in and even at its cheesiest and sometimes mostdated moments it's a very successful picture for what it wants to do. It's really an equalopportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course.";

James Stewart is deservedly remembered most for this role. That's saying a lot given his impressive body of work. This is also Frank Capra's signature film along with Mr. Deeds. The idealism of Jefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but and I know this is a clich the world could use more people with his values. The supporting cast is also spot on. Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr. Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith. Strongly recommended 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Capra's knack for getting the best out of JAMES STEWART and JEAN ARTHUR is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances. Ironically Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.As a bumbling naive senator who is a lamb thrown to the wolves in Washington D.C. Stewart does a fabulous jobalthough there are moments when his bumbling awkwardness looks a bit staged. Jean Arthur is a natural for the role of the wise secretary who at first scorns his innocent ways but soon comes to realize he's the real thing.All of the supporting players are excellentespecially CLAUDE RAINS as a mentor to Stewart who finally has a conscience about deceiving him and Harry Carey the western actor as the man with the gavel who soon realizes that Stewart is not to be underestimated. His reaction shots grinning and sometimes stifling a grin say more than words. He and Rains both deserved their supporting role nominations.But as usual in a Capra film you have to be willing to forgive some obvious plot contrivances or overall schmaltz. The ending when it finally comes after some excessive length in running time is rather abrupt as though the director suddenly realized he'd gone overtime on the story. And some of the sentimentality such as the scene where Arthur joins him at the Lincoln Memorial where she knew she'd find him is hard to swallow until you remind yourself thathey this is Capracorn. Nevertheless despite some flaws it's the kind of comedydrama about Washington D.C. that only a director like Capra could make. And the replica of the Senate is amazingly detailed as are all the interiors which were shot on a soundstage at Columbia. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works how bills have to go through committees the rules of behavior filibustering etc. It will leave you with a warm glowsomewhat like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE in that respect.Summing up It's Stewart's show all the way. He's at his peak here.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Mr. Smith Goes to Washington a U.S. senator suddenly passes away and Mr. Smith is tapped to fill the position. Unbeknownst to the honest decent Smith he is intended merely to be a puppet of the powerful forces that already control the state's governor and its other Congressmen. Smith collides headon with these forces and must fight to save himself and his values from destruction in the public arena.Mr. Smith directed by Frank Capra is not meant to be very realistic. The basic plot and characters of Mr. Smith are borderline ridiculous. Smith goes beyond naive to the point of appearing ignorant and lacking in common sense at times. He seems to have the civics education of a 2ndgrader. Everything in the movie is exaggerated to the extremes.Capra's D.C. is likewise a caricature. The U.S. Senate is a united front of entrenched cronyism. They move as one nonpartisan mass always supporting each other in their mutual corruption. The media is easily herded into line an interpretation that probably strikes closer to truth although that system today has been undermined by the Internet.Still if the true Washington is not quite as fraudulent as Copra's version there's no doubt that it is probably perceived that way by many Americans today. The film touches upon real issues that affect modern politics. It's amazing how relevant certain lines and scenes remain after all these years perhaps more so today.What did bug me about the film was its shamelessly idealistic view of smalltown American heroes like Mr. Smith. Like a Bruckenheimer movie where Billy boy and Jim Bob from the ranch save the planet Mr. Smith sometimes comes off as a selfcongratulatory pat on the back to the common man. It rails against the elitism and special interest of Washington a popular sentiment today.This might not bother me so much except that this country is just coming off an extended experiment of putting a commoner in a government seat of critical importance and things didn't turn out so hot. As nasty cold and dirty as it may seem to place a compromising politician into DC that may be preferable to putting an oh shucks well golly gee I dunno kinda guy into a position of major responsibility.This country has a low tolerance for corruption. It has an even lower tolerance of incompetence.".

How can a movie that brings out all those different emotions in someone not be great or even spectacular!  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is definitely one of the best movies ever made despite the fact that it is mostly about politics! It's still interesting!While watching this movie the audience might be thinking that the acting isn't half bad and is actually quite realistic.  They would be right too! All of the acting is really very good and it draws the audience in and keeps them in.  This movie was so close to not having one single cheesy line or unbelievable acting job that it's really a shame that it did.  At the very end of the movie Saunders played by                  stands up from her seat in the balcony and yells Stop Jeff! Stop!' and then falls to the floor.  The line and the way       says it is very very cheesy and something the audience might find themselves laughing at.  That line is just about the only time in the entire movie where the acting was lacking.  James Stewart was of course phenomenal.  He is a very good actor and one that should be remembered for a very long time.  He's awesome!The only other not so great thing about Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is the ending.  It's a happy ending but well it just ends.  It's an abrupt ending.  It ends so abruptly that the audience isn't even expecting it to end when it does.  It has one of those endings where the audience knows a bunch of things that will be happening they just aren't shown happening. This reviewer doesn't really care for those kind it is much better when you get to see the things carried out.  Although the ending could have been better Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is still an awesome movie and the ending doesn't take away from that at all!This movie is so great that every person in the world should be able to see it because it is definitely worth the time it takes to see it.".

Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors Capra manages to reach into each of our chests and wrench almost painfully at our heartstrings.Jefferson Smith James Stewart 'It's A Wonderful Life' is a young enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state but is known throughout it most especially by the young boys of the region as an unsung hero. Head of the Boy Rangers Smith has a love of his country and of nature once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire singlehandedly. After the unexpected death of a current Senator Governor Hubert Hopper Guy Kibbee is forced to choose a replacement. Whilst his corrupt political boss Jim Taylor Edward Arnold urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children awarding the job to Smith.Smith arrives in Washington excited and idealistic no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position. He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator Joseph Harrison Paine Claude Rains 'Notorious' a highlyesteemed man who was once great friends with Smith's father. Unbeknownst to Smith however Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make certain compromises. Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boy's camp at Willet Creek which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality an act that will serve nobody but the powerhungry Jim Taylor. When Paine's cynical secretary Clarissa Saunders Jean Arthur informs Smith of these plans he determinedly attempts to speak his mind only to be quashed by the almighty Taylor Machine.Frank Capra who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners 'It Happened One Night' 1934 and 'You Can't Take It With You' 1938 once again proved his undeniable genius something he would continue to do throughout his filmmaking career. One oftencited example involves the romanticallyawkward Smith's second encounter with Paine's beautiful daughter Susan Astrid Allwyn. Rather than focusing on faces as would be the typical style for such a scene Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smith's hat as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it. This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial closeup ever could!Finally James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young idealistic Smith in one of his first critically recognised roles. The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection. For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak. As we witness Jefferson Smith ragged and exhausted determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much much further. He is not just shouting at the Senate but he is shouting at the people he is shouting at his country he is shouting at us. And we are right there alongside him quietly urging him along.".

But I forgot how much I love Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life one of my all time favorites and how much I love Frank Capra. Well obviously I ended up falling in love with this movie too. Of course it's not a typical movie like we'd see in theaters today. I'm not sure why people rate it based on that. Old movies should be treated with more respect! They didn't have the technology that we did now and the most advance things they could do were corny montages.  Really I found a lot of things funny in this movie that shouldn't have been. but I tend to laugh more than anything life is just better that way The boys in the entire movie were hilarious. They were just...so strange. And for some reason it was okay for angry politicians to ram their huge truck into the boys' car. And it was okay for Jimmyboy to run around the streets punching people. But in the end I believe those parts made the movie more enjoyable!The music the acting the directing..it was all top notch in my opinion. Well the music was a bit too patriotic at times but that was very appropriate. Jean Arthur was very cute and played her role quite well. And for some reason I fell in love with Claude Rains voice..which means I fell in love with his character. I had to convince myself that there was some good in him and I was right. The story was just fine. a lot better than a lot of movies around today! oy! We went over the corniness...and the plot may have been a bit predictable but I really wanted it to end well. Good needs to defeat evil in the end. And sure the ending may seem a bit abrupt but what can they say after that? All is well! A very good movie. I'd recommend it to ANYONE..you might just be surprised. hey can you believe it? I really hate history and I enjoyed this movie!".

Of course it's not a typical movie like we'd see in theaters today. I'm not sure why people rate it based on that. Old movies should be treated with more respect!

It reinforces qualities that many of us have lost along the way idealism strong unshakable belief never quitting honesty and commitment. Today patriotism and American values have taken on another connotation. They have become the property of the right wing. But there isn't anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith which are different from what is being expressed today.Is anyone today as idealistic as Mr. Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money I sadly have to answer that I don't think so. In the real world as Court TV has taught us things don't work that way. Is anyone as corrupt as Senator Paine and Jim Taylor? Sadly I'd have to say probably. Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes. Have they? Definitely.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a fantasy but it's a fantasy that uplifts us and reminds us of what we could be and like Jean Arthur says in the film maybe being jaded isn't such a good idea all the time.James Stewart had the role of a lifetime and he was perfect. Homespun intelligent boyishly goodlooking his career and tremendous popularity even today speak for themselves. His filibuster scenes are incredible passionate and strong. We were lucky we had him as long as we did. There will never be another. Jean Arthur was fabulous in her role as a streetwise assistant who finds something to believe in. Claude Rains as the unlikable weak Senator Paine gives a powerful performance. The bad guys  and Capra always makes sure they're real bad  were all great. As for Harry Carey the sympathetic speaker you want to hug him. A fantastic job.Frank Capra knew how to make movies. The pace is swift the story strong and the scenes tense and exciting.

If truth is art then Capra fails not to entertain but as a truth teller. Capra is one of the first message directors. In this movie he goes against the Washington establishment political hacks and powers behind the throne. The sad fact is that nothing has changed because human nature has not changed. Capra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance. The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra. Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person. And because he is not real and the story is not reality. If this movie was considered a comedy so be it but critics have had 60 plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil. Stewart's character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not the best candidate for the job. Nothing unbelievable in that  but Smith's character is stretched beyond belief. To become a US Senator you must be at least 30 years old. Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a 15 year old. With no wife no girl friend he acts like a 15 year old when introduced to mature women. Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others is also the behavior of an adolescent. Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty. It is not. Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dope.Somehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all. And discovers love and gets the girl in the end. If you like vintage syrup this movie is right for you. Just remember its just a movie and in real life the bad guys usually win.".

When their party man is rejected they select the allAmerican Jefferson Smith reasoning that he will be too overawed and just do what he is told.  At first Smith does just that but then his plans to build a boy's camp on the site of the dam Paine is pushing through congress makes him realise that Paine is pushing a bill through for the benefit of Taylor's business.  A new boy with high ideals of democracy at this level Smith takes action but can he overcome the crooked political system that is controlled by Taylor?Apparently when this was first made it was accused of being antiAmerican in it's depiction of congressmen as anything except honest God fearing men of the people.  Nowadays it is more likely to be the case that the depiction of only ONE politician as in bed with business' or remote from the people' makes it look like a fantasy.  But it is a fantasy  an ode to the American Dream.  Smith is an honest lad who is picked for Congress holds to it's ideals with a childlike wonder and overcomes anything that is unAmerican'. As a story it works well in a sappy type of way.  For me there was a little too much awe and wonder at the American system but I suppose it comes with the territory.  The actual political games are enjoyable if a little simplified and the final 20odd minute filibuster is enjoyable despite not quite ending with the punch I was hoping for.Stewart plays his idealistic American boy well and his wide eyed wonder never fails to work.  Jean Arthur is good as the tough city girl won over by his honesty and charm' and her sassy way helps liven some of the duller spells.  Rains and Arnold are good in their roles as politician and businessman who bought the vote.  The whole cast do well but it is Stewart who sets the tone with his awe and wonder  good but maybe could have been toned down a little to reduce the sentimentality that comes up every time he reads the bill of rights.Overall this is a good film.  Typical fantasy stuff from Capra but heart warming in a way.  It probably suffers little bit because it is hard to accept that politicians are basically good peoples.  Where it's a wonderful life' was uplifting because it was about human nature this didn't have the same impact because I don't believe that politicians are like Smith in anyway watching Bush and Blair stampeding through the UN with total disregard for democracy took some of the shine off this movie.  Still a good movie though.".

	schema:reviewBody "The theme of one man being able to combat the ways of a longestablished system is not a new one. In fact man versus machine is one of the oldest forms of conflict in cinema but this is a different kind of machine this Taylor Machine. When a young naive and idealistic man by the name of Jefferson Smith James Stewart is placed as a pawn in the United States Senate he is honored and humbled by the job set out before him. He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country and even more so his people. In Jefferson Smith we see everything that is good and wholesome in America. One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes. He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator. However the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions. Jim Taylor Edward Arnold and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine Claude Rains have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor. Smith's dream of building a national boy's camp is shattered by Taylor's scheme to build a dam in the same area. The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith accusing him of fraud. Shamed Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant Clarissa Saunders Jean Arthur inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal.James Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith the young passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear. Jean Arthur's performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewart's inspired intensity a feat that I feel he accomplishes. The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie not just because of James Stewart's relentless performance but because it has quite a bit to say. It is a statement declaring that ideals are stronger than the pages they are printed on and that it is our ideals and the spirit through which we see them realized that allows one man to topple the machine.".

Not the best propaganda for the system if you think about it. It is hard not to see this as the Senator's selfish fight for an isolated issue with an absolute disregard for the general whole.

After all it is only a movie and its intentions are unquestionably good.

Better yet it is Frank Capra with James Stewart. Can we get any more clich? Oh wait. The main character is a Jefferson Smith. Bribery corruption conspiracy lies and deceit. It is all here. Shady deals ulterior motives. In other words politics. In case it was not already obvious I am not very political. But guess what? In all the above ways yes this is like all those other films. But it the most important ways it is not. What makes it different? In one word Stewart. Sure the clever writing the directing the supporting cast are all assets to the film. But he makes this film. His character's name is in the title after all. Through his heartfelt performance as Jefferson Smith the audience is inspired even the most cynical of us might find ourselves beginning to really like this country appreciate what we have today that our ancestors did not and maybe even believe that we can make a difference by getting involved in politics. His naivet is practically excruciating at times. His first glance at the White House can be compared to a little kid in a candy store. His first evening exploring all the monuments along and around the National Mall is shown in montage form with patriotic backgrounds music. Cheesy yes. But somehow it was not as bad as it sounds. As he an everyday man tries to acclimate himself in the world of politics each blunder brings new laughs. His awkwardness in palpable and his character lovable. Eventually of course he must learn the truth that it does not really exist in the government. We all cheer for this everyday Smith as he tries to pave the way for all the little guys. As far as high school or even grade school education goes this should be on a list of required viewings. Along with School House Rock's classic How a Bill Becomes a Law of course. I would have loved to learn about government the Senate bills and filibusters this way.  Spoilers  Sadly it was the ending that brought the greatest disappointment. It was extremely sudden and cheap. After all that determination and rallying from Smith after how far Paine was willing to go to condemn the man he supposedly felt was like a son to him after all his stubbornness to do the right thing he gives up and confesses everything on the Senate floor? Highly unlikely. Even worse it cheapens all that Smith has done.".

	schema:headline " Romantic homage to male beauty";
	schema:reviewBody "BISHONEN Mei Shao Nian Zhi LianAspect ratio 1.851Sound format Dolby DigitalInspired by a scandal in the Happy Valley area of Hong Kong in which a wealthy playboy was found to have taken thousands of photographs of police officers posed in various states of undress BISHONEN is nothing less than a romantic homage to male beauty Stephen Fung plays a handsome prostitute whose vanity is breached after he falls in love with an equally attractive young cop Daniel Wu who is closeted from his oldfashioned parents Kenneth Tsang and Chiao Chiao and wary of forming new relationships due to events in his recent past events which finally catch up with him in the worst possible way.Directed by photographerturnedfilmmaker Yonfan BUGIS STREET PEONY PAVILION this unusual film was actually promoted as a spectacle for female viewers though the narrative is defiantly Queer in tone and construction and unfolds with all the melodramatic excess of a 'Harlequin' romance. While Yonfan's script and direction may seem hopelessly naive to some Western viewers his painterly eye uncovers the beauty in HK's urban sprawl as well as the physical attributes of the actors themselves and some of the images of languid young men are genuinely intoxicating. Terence Yin HOT WAR plays an aspiring pop singer who leads Wu astray from an old boyfriend Jason Tsang during a long flashback sequence explaining Wu's melancholy demeanor prompting a number of oblique references to actorsinger Leslie Cheung whose suicide in 2003 ended the long career of one of HK's most beloved gay icons. In fact Yonfan uses the milieu of HK's sexual 'underworld' to comment on the former colony's clandestine gay scene and the ways in which it has been downplayed or hideously stereotyped by an overtly conservative media. Gay fans of HK cinema have always relished the voluptuous splendor of Asian film stars Bruce Lee Alexander Fu Sheng Andy Lau Nicholas Tse countless others and the homoerotic undercurrents which fuel hundreds of tough guy action movies and sensitive dramas despite what some blinkered western critics would have you believe BISHONEN drags the implication out of its closet and exposes it to the clear light of day.Many scenes are unscripted andor shot guerrillastyle on the streets of HK and while some of these vignettes are rendered inconsequential by unskilled actors the script's emphasis on the redeeming power of love is both heartfelt and charming. However the closing scenes  in which a leading character makes a tragic error of judgment  will strike some viewers as regressive and unnecessary though the situation is entirely believable in the context of Eastern sensibilities. Shu Qi SKYLINE CRUISERS THE EYE 2 plays the only significant female role in the movie a lesbian who acts as a gobetween for Fung and Wu and the movie is narrated by Brigitte Lin famous for the sexually fluid roles she has played in countless movies HK film critic Paul Fonoroff also appears in a brief cameo role. Along with Wong Karwai's HAPPY TOGETHER 1997 this was one of the first HK films to depict gay sex in an explicit manner though some of the supporting players are clearly uncomfortable during moments of supposed intimacy. However Wu has no such inhibitions He's stripped to his underwear on numerous occasions revealing a beautiful gymtoned body and shares a couple of detailed sexual encounters  a memorable shower scene with Yin followed by a climactic makeout with Fung  which represent milestones in HK Queer Cinema.In a country where careers are often made and unmade overnight Fung and Wu have since become major players on the HK movie scene. Both were educated in America Wu had only a rudimentary grasp of Cantonese when cast in BISHONEN his first movie and while both were selected by Yonfan primarily for their looks they give strong performances in complex difficult roles Fung's character remains sympathetic despite his narcissism while Wu is a haunted tragic figure. Fung  the son of former Shaw Brothers actress Sek Yin  is quite simply gorgeous beyond belief and his subsequent films including blockbusters GENX COPS THE AVENGING FIST and MY SCHOOLMATE THE BARBARIAN have assured him a place in the pantheon of HK teen idols though his cool insouciant beauty was never captured with more grace or allure than here. He turned director in 2001 cohelming the multiepisode HEROES IN LOVE before going solo on the wellreceived comedydrama ENTER THE PHOENIX 2004 in which he cast Wu as the gay son of a dying Triad who resists his father's criminal legacy. Of the two however Wu is the more accomplished actor another teen sensation whose career has encompassed everything from commercial juggernauts PURPLE STORM NEW POLICE STORY to intimate 'Arthouse' entries BEIJING ROCKS NIGHT CORRIDOR and he's gained a reputation for playing sexual outsiders in unconventional films earning him a sizeable gay following throughout SE Asia.NB. The HKEnglish title BISHONEN is actually a Japanese word which translates as  what else?  'beautiful boys'.Cantonese dialogue".

	onyx:emotionText "BISHONEN Mei Shao Nian Zhi LianAspect ratio 1.851Sound format Dolby DigitalInspired by a scandal in the Happy Valley area of Hong Kong in which a wealthy playboy was found to have taken thousands of photographs of police officers posed in various states of undress BISHONEN is nothing less than a romantic homage to male beauty Stephen Fung plays a handsome prostitute whose vanity is breached after he falls in love with an equally attractive young cop Daniel Wu who is closeted from his oldfashioned parents Kenneth Tsang and Chiao Chiao and wary of forming new relationships due to events in his recent past events which finally catch up with him in the worst possible way.Directed by photographerturnedfilmmaker Yonfan BUGIS STREET PEONY PAVILION this unusual film was actually promoted as a spectacle for female viewers though the narrative is defiantly Queer in tone and construction and unfolds with all the melodramatic excess of a 'Harlequin' romance. While Yonfan's script and direction may seem hopelessly naive to some Western viewers his painterly eye uncovers the beauty in HK's urban sprawl as well as the physical attributes of the actors themselves and some of the images of languid young men are genuinely intoxicating. Terence Yin HOT WAR plays an aspiring pop singer who leads Wu astray from an old boyfriend Jason Tsang during a long flashback sequence explaining Wu's melancholy demeanor prompting a number of oblique references to actorsinger Leslie Cheung whose suicide in 2003 ended the long career of one of HK's most beloved gay icons. In fact Yonfan uses the milieu of HK's sexual 'underworld' to comment on the former colony's clandestine gay scene and the ways in which it has been downplayed or hideously stereotyped by an overtly conservative media. Gay fans of HK cinema have always relished the voluptuous splendor of Asian film stars Bruce Lee Alexander Fu Sheng Andy Lau Nicholas Tse countless others and the homoerotic undercurrents which fuel hundreds of tough guy action movies and sensitive dramas despite what some blinkered western critics would have you believe BISHONEN drags the implication out of its closet and exposes it to the clear light of day.Many scenes are unscripted andor shot guerrillastyle on the streets of HK and while some of these vignettes are rendered inconsequential by unskilled actors the script's emphasis on the redeeming power of love is both heartfelt and charming. However the closing scenes  in which a leading character makes a tragic error of judgment  will strike some viewers as regressive and unnecessary though the situation is entirely believable in the context of Eastern sensibilities. Shu Qi SKYLINE CRUISERS THE EYE 2 plays the only significant female role in the movie a lesbian who acts as a gobetween for Fung and Wu and the movie is narrated by Brigitte Lin famous for the sexually fluid roles she has played in countless movies HK film critic Paul Fonoroff also appears in a brief cameo role. Along with Wong Karwai's HAPPY TOGETHER 1997 this was one of the first HK films to depict gay sex in an explicit manner though some of the supporting players are clearly uncomfortable during moments of supposed intimacy. However Wu has no such inhibitions He's stripped to his underwear on numerous occasions revealing a beautiful gymtoned body and shares a couple of detailed sexual encounters  a memorable shower scene with Yin followed by a climactic makeout with Fung  which represent milestones in HK Queer Cinema.In a country where careers are often made and unmade overnight Fung and Wu have since become major players on the HK movie scene. Both were educated in America Wu had only a rudimentary grasp of Cantonese when cast in BISHONEN his first movie and while both were selected by Yonfan primarily for their looks they give strong performances in complex difficult roles Fung's character remains sympathetic despite his narcissism while Wu is a haunted tragic figure. Fung  the son of former Shaw Brothers actress Sek Yin  is quite simply gorgeous beyond belief and his subsequent films including blockbusters GENX COPS THE AVENGING FIST and MY SCHOOLMATE THE BARBARIAN have assured him a place in the pantheon of HK teen idols though his cool insouciant beauty was never captured with more grace or allure than here. He turned director in 2001 cohelming the multiepisode HEROES IN LOVE before going solo on the wellreceived comedydrama ENTER THE PHOENIX 2004 in which he cast Wu as the gay son of a dying Triad who resists his father's criminal legacy. Of the two however Wu is the more accomplished actor another teen sensation whose career has encompassed everything from commercial juggernauts PURPLE STORM NEW POLICE STORY to intimate 'Arthouse' entries BEIJING ROCKS NIGHT CORRIDOR and he's gained a reputation for playing sexual outsiders in unconventional films earning him a sizeable gay following throughout SE Asia.NB. The HKEnglish title BISHONEN is actually a Japanese word which translates as  what else?  'beautiful boys'.Cantonese dialogue";

I'm not quite sure what I was expecting but it exceeded whatever those expectations were.More than anything else I was very moved by the story insomuch as how it unfolded and how the actors carried the film in both their physical motions basically how they carried themselves and simple raw emotions love lust revulsion.The film was not glossy but rather chose an almost realistic if not surreal background which complimented it incredibly.  Much of it flowed quite smoothly and served to captivate the audience as much as the actors themselves.Those of you wondering about the plot now that I've got all that out of the way a male prostitute is roaming the streets of Hong Kong one day and exchanges looks with another young man who is shopping with someone who might be his girlfriend.  For the next hour and 40 minutes the relationship between the two men develop expand to include other characters another male prostitute a Pop singer a rather unusual photographer and ultimately explore how are ultimately involved with each other.This film doesn't exploit gay sex by showing needless amounts of it nor does it reduce it along the way.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.The DVD comes with Director's Commentary of which I unfortunately don't understand a word of Cast Information Production Information an interview with the director some post card still shots a photo collage and a couple of short films.  The Video CD if anyone is interested also contains a film cell.My Rating is an 8".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes the cinematography of this movie is welldone the musical soundtrack is fine and as others have pointed out the main characters are male and indeed may be described as beautiful and as eye candy. But make no mistake these are gay characters and their stories are gay ones. So if other reviews haven't made that abundantly clear this one is now doing so.That said and despite what some other reviewers may have lead you to believe if you are expecting to see really well done love making scenes that are natural and truetolife you're going to be disappointed. The male on male love making shots for the most part are made up of fumbling gestures. Rather than actual kissing there is an awful lot of what I would call neck nuzzling you know that's what you do when you can't stand to place your lips on those of another human beingbut instead spend moment after moment grinding your face in the crook of that person's neck and shoulder. But wait there is one endoffilm scene between our two main characters in which actual lip to lip kissing does occur.....and it is exciting. Fortunately for the undoubtedly embarrassed actors however the script does call for a quick interruption to the proceedings doesn't that always seem to happen?.I have a tip for those of you who wish to proceed in purchasing this title on DVD I honestly don't especially regret doing so and you can maybe check out some place like yesasia. Here's that tip the subtitling into English of what is spoken in this film perhaps a Chinese dialect such as Cantonese is I believe the poorest I have ever run across. Silly things for the most part which detract mightily from the film's story example the subtitle is meant to read From dusk to dawn but instead shows across the bottom of the picture as From dust to dawn. And there is a lot of this type thing. Too bad because our leads Wu and Fung were either born andor partially raised in the US one even attending the U. of Michigan. The film makers should have paid these guys a little extra and had them take care of the subtitling. If I were a wannabe star I'd even have done it for free.".

	schema:headline " A movie that touched hearts";
	schema:reviewBody "I really don't understand how this movie is a failure. The story is wellorganized the music is awesome and the castings are goodlooking. The story focuses on Jet's lovelife in particular and gay world in general thru 4 main characters Jet Sam Ah Ching and K.S who are all connected with each other somehow. The message from the movie just could be perceived that the love between people of the same sex is just as strong and fervent as normal male and female love or maybe even stronger. The movie just wants to tell us about a homosexual love to show us what lays beneath the seemingly disgusting caresses and kisses between two men are true feelings from every beat of their hearts. But they can not be free to live with their true feelings because of social prejudice against gay and duties with their family. The contradictions in their minds could not be easily justified so gaythemed movies usually have an unhappy ending with one of the two seeking for death as a solution an escape. Moreover the movie also portrays a dark rubbish world of hustlers with extreme disgrace and even pain in their hearts and bodies. If you view this movie with your ready bias against gay people or just attach too much importance to some of its trivial things then you could definitely not perceive its message. No matter what criticism it may receive I really think this movie could touch hearts.".

	onyx:emotionText "I really don't understand how this movie is a failure. The story is wellorganized the music is awesome and the castings are goodlooking. The story focuses on Jet's lovelife in particular and gay world in general thru 4 main characters Jet Sam Ah Ching and K.S who are all connected with each other somehow. The message from the movie just could be perceived that the love between people of the same sex is just as strong and fervent as normal male and female love or maybe even stronger. The movie just wants to tell us about a homosexual love to show us what lays beneath the seemingly disgusting caresses and kisses between two men are true feelings from every beat of their hearts. But they can not be free to live with their true feelings because of social prejudice against gay and duties with their family. The contradictions in their minds could not be easily justified so gaythemed movies usually have an unhappy ending with one of the two seeking for death as a solution an escape. Moreover the movie also portrays a dark rubbish world of hustlers with extreme disgrace and even pain in their hearts and bodies. If you view this movie with your ready bias against gay people or just attach too much importance to some of its trivial things then you could definitely not perceive its message. No matter what criticism it may receive I really think this movie could touch hearts.";

It's about a love story of homosexuals men.Well the film has some sad situations that a love story between two men had never been perfectly showed before. It also treats in second plan the HK situation about homosexuality. Some narrated parts of the movie focus the spectator on the characters' feelings and the overall story is simply based on people's love. Some roles greatly contribute for the storyline highlights for Shu Qi which is almost the key of the film filling it with portions of suspense and surprises. The movie also talks about family honor respect luxury crime... And although the main roles played the story is transmitted in a such great way that most part of time you won't even notice the main characters are homosexuals.This was one of the first homosexuals movies I'd seen and I must admit it's truly a good one. It really leaves on us a sensation to be a true life story that love really moves humans.And contrasting to many of the annoying American love stories this movie has the incomparable Asian or Hong Kong spice.Too bad it hasn't been released in most west countries yet I think only in Germany. I hope one day to have it on my collection.".

The actors are beautiful and stunning eye candy of course but with good solid acting behind the pretty faces. Being beautiful is often a curse.  People often cannot see beyond the beauty to see the substance.  There is substance behind the characters as they were written and substance behind the actors performances.  The story is a sweet and beautifully filmed love story with a wonderfully appropiate score. If you were once beautiful or if you have ever been truly in love you will really love this movie.

The movie is based on a true story partly when a society playboy DID take numerous photographs of serving young Police Officers many of whom worked in the Happy Valley Police Station on HK Island  I read the Press reports in 1995 and I had a flat a stone's throw from this police Stn. I recognised indeed frequented many of the bars and cafes featured in the film and met Terence Yin KS in the film in Staunton's Bar in Central on HK Island and he kindly scribbled his autograph for me in 2001. The street Life of the Territory is lovingly filmed by the director Yonfan whom I saw often in HK and choice of actors ideal excepting the cameo role by the Western film critic. Daniel Wu does well in his role of Sam showing his unhappiness when required and his young modesty and loyalty to JetStephen Fung rumoured in the 90's to be bisexual in HK when he felt he should be but Jet was immature and realised too late he did love Sam and was for a time loved in return. It accurately portrays gay life in HK preHandover and the background music is haunting. This film will forever be for me my memento of my happy years in HK and the many friends I knew then and may well be others who are gay and were based in the former Colony. Finally in some ways it is a film about a lost love and a missed opportunity for a deep and lasting love over fleeting sexual encounters and the superficiality of many gaybi relationships. Come the end of the film I really was choked up. The subtitles are well enough done and not the distraction referred to by another reviewer here  definitely buy this DVD for a romantic film in a romantic city setting and a period of Time now gone.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a redundancy to say it. Chow Yun Fat is one of icons of the Hong Kong Cinema before the Handover the accorded devolution of the famous Britannic colony to the Chinese people in 1997. He worked intensely in TV and in the silver screen at the early years of the 1980s but the fame seemed to evade him. It was A better tomorrow directed by John Woo in 1986 the film that finally did the trick for him. The Story of Woo Viet is a rare film of 1981. There is no fancy gunplay in it no choreography with guns or with martial arts. It is a harsh movie centered in a Vietnamese refugee Chow Yun Fat that after a hazardous escape in a precarious boat full of illegal immigrants from Vietnam arrives to Hong Kong looking for a chance to reach the United States. But things go awry and during an scale in Manila Phylipines a criminal gang kidnaps his newfound girlfriend with the intent of exploiting her as a prostitute. What follows is the desperate intent of Woo Viet to rescue his lover. The two women in the movie are also well known in the Hong Kong Cinema. Cherie Chung Chor Hung plays the love interest of Chow Yun Fat. She also was a relatively obscure actress in 1981. Soon this situation was to change and Cherie was become one of the brightest stars until her premature retirement in 1991 due to her change of profession she married and became a full time housewife. The other woman in the story was Cora Miao an interesting and serious actress who was reunited with Crerie Chung and Chow Yun Fat in the Shaw Brothers film Women 1985 and previously only with the prolific Chow in the drama also produced by the Shaw Brothers Love in a Fallen City 1984. At the helm of the Story of Woo Viet was Ann Hui On Wah a very renowned director in the Honk Kong and Chinese Cinema. Her most recent work was The Golden Era 2014 the chronicle of the brief and tragic life of the writer Xiao Hong. In conclusion the Story of Woo Viet is a good drama. And for fans of the stars working on it is a must see. Pity the DVD edition I saw was very old and the source material was poor.".

The latter these days are marred by moral equivalence sanitisation and excessively balletic theatricality with battle scenes looking like firework displays filmed in slow motion as the orchestra swells to a cheesy crescendo. This film by contrast is infused with an industrialstrength dose of Russian cynicism. It's refreshing to see a lack of PC cant in its depiction of a genuinely evil enemy. For once it has a realistic portrayal of the religion of peace with peaceloving Islamic terrorists peacefully beheading civilians for internet decapitation videos and leaving their victims in a particularly peaceful state. When they're not welshing on deals or slaughtering the infidel they're settling scores with each other in interclan blood feuds. However unlike older American  British war movies which weren't made by leftists the nominal good guys on the Russian side are incompetent corrupt and unmotivated. The battle scenes are very realistic neither sanitised and bloodless nor baroque selfindulgent slowmotion Peckinpahesque spectacles. They are gory but not overly spectacular or thunderous heroic in the abstract but sordid. Civilian casualties are inevitable somewhat regrettable but unavoidable. It's particularly relevant to see the effete whining hypocritical Pilgeresque Englishman demanding human rights from those who spit at the concept anguishing over the deaths of civilians travelling with the terrorists then putting the whole party in danger with his wild shooting.In refreshing contrast to Hollywood the acting is excellent and the plot is tight yet unpredictable. The denouement had me laughing out loud for the way it highlights the hypocrisy of everyone in dealing with the reality of war. The cinematography is magnificent especially in the mountain tops and steep valleys. The jeep being rolled down the steep gorge was a particular highlight.".

It's particularly relevant to see the effete whining hypocritical Pilgeresque Englishman demanding human rights from those who spit at the concept anguishing over the deaths of civilians travelling with the terrorists then putting the whole party in danger with his wild shooting.In refreshing contrast to Hollywood the acting is excellent and the plot is tight yet unpredictable. The denouement had me laughing out loud for the way it highlights the hypocrisy of everyone in dealing with the reality of war. The cinematography is magnificent especially in the mountain tops and steep valleys. The jeep being rolled down the steep gorge was a particular highlight.";

It is true that the firefights seem dull and even anticlimactic however that is the whole beauty behind them. They didn't need to be sugar coated by big explosions and slowmo deaths instead opting for a more realistic approach. Were some of the weapons real?

Aleksei Chadov as Ivan put in a great performance and all other elements came together to make good entertainment and a rare look at the Chechen situation.This is probably one of the most realistic films I've seen gorewise.

That's where they meet captain Medvedev Sergey Bodrov Jr and Ivan Ermakov Aleksey Chadov. Medvedev is wounded and very strict but Ermakov seems to have adjusted and is even helping out the Chechen gang tribe? leader with computers.When Chechen leader  Aslan  learns that he can't get any money he let's the British man go home and get two million pounds to buy out his fiance. As a gesture of generosity he lets go Ermakov.The Brit  John  is trying to get the money and Ivan experiences a postwar life for a Chechnya veteran in his town  no money no work ill father. Somehow John who was kicked out by every Russian official finds Ivan and begs him to help him get his fiance out. Ivan has nothing to lose and he agrees to back to Chechnya...The movie This is certainly one of the if not THE best movies of Aleksey Balaganov. The story that intertwines lives of Russian soldier Chechen barbarian bandit and totally not ready for the war as it is British civilian. As always there is a very deep meaning in every dialogue every scene and even every look of every character. The music like in many other Balaganov's movies is mostly popular Russian and some Ukranian songs that emphasize each act and add more emotional content to it.Perhaps the movie will shed some light on the situation in Chechnya and the West will finally understand that you can't negotiate with these people and you can't let them have what they want because it's never enough for them because they are different. If you're polite with them they think you're weak  that's the main idea of Balaganov.John  Ivan why do you keep beating this man? Ivan  Because this is the only way he will understand. kicks the prisoner Faster! Enjoy the movie. It's a rear quality movie about war.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aleksei Chadov who plays the double part of Ivan a Russian soldier as well as narrator does a splendid job on both counts. Voyna is one of his early films and I believe he will be much sought after as an actor in future Russian films.This is an interesting film because in the latter half we get a glimpse of life in Chechna something that has been pretty rare among Westerners. The film tends to give the Russian point of view of the continuing conflict in that area although there are a few gibes against the Russians in authority. One Chechnan makes a strong comment when he tells Ivan...You are fighting because you were drafted into the army. We Chechnans are fighting because this is our homeland.The Chechnans are depicted as very cruel and calculating Muslims. When they take prisoners they hold them in underground dugouts and demand large sums of money for their release. Unfortunately for the prisoners who are kept in the most unsanitary conditions their respective governments will not submit to terrorist demands. That means they are left to their own resources and escape seems almost impossible.One of the prisoners is John a British actor who was captured in neighbouring Georgia making a film with his fiance Margaret. The Chechnan captain agrees to give John his freedom for a couple of months to find 2 million American dollars as ransom money holding Margaret in captivity as security. Ivan accompanies John on his search for help.Their frantic search for the money takes them to the embassies in Moscow and London. It's a race against time and they have no idea how Margaret is faring in her underground prison.The final scene is one of guerrilla warfare in which a number of pressing matters are resolved. There are many gory scenes in this film during which some viewers may wish to close their eyes but I suggest they stay with it to the end.".

For instance he talks about corruption and incompetence in the ranks of the MVD ministry for internal affairs roughly comparable to the home office in charge of the repression in Chechnya instead of the regular army since this is considered an internal matter by the Russian government. He also drops some allusions to the question of the neotsarist elites in Moscow disconnected from the overwhelming majority of the population and a few other such politically incorrect matters.However the crass caricature of Chechen bandits with the IQ of your average German grunt in saving private Ryan and the oriental wickedness of old FuManChu paperback villains should not be seen as anything but a measure of the mindless hatred for Chechens that permeates the whole of Russia.I happened to work as an interpret for asylum seekers in France for about one year including quite a lot of refugees fleeing Chechnya both Russians mostly soldiers or members of mixed families and Chechens. It does not require a lot of efforts to get a better picture of the situation than a bunch of people too different to come to term with as I had the utter displeasure of reading in another review on this very site.The fact that a director known for its ironic point of view on the current state of affairs in Russia could not help but reproduce these hateful stereotypes in a movie dealing with one of the most atrocious war currently raging on the planet and which is still dragging on to this very day should be an occasion to measure the gravity of this conflict instead of a reassuring comfort for cheap xenophobic thoughts.If you want to see what a first degree modern Russian war movie looks like you could give a go to Zvezda IMDb reference httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0326450  also issued in 2002. Sort of a WWII propaganda movie shot in the 21st century that would make John Wayne in Iwo Jima look like a yellowlivered defeatist. Alternatively try to watch the video clip of the hugely successful song dava za from the Lube band to have a taste of the average representation of this conflict Russia tries to build to rationalize the horrors committed in this country. I think having another go at Vona after such kind of propaganda masterpieces could be a far more enlightening experience.Well of course if you are the kind of patriotic freak ready to gobble such glorifications of war as long as it makes you comfortable about where the bad guys live just forget about all I wrote and enjoy the gore.".

This movie is as onedimensional as they come Chechens are evil Russians are corrupt Westerners and the press are hypocritical Russian army is incompetent so it is up to our hero armed only with a shotgun to take upon himself the Chechen war vojna.

When I saw this film first time at its release in Moscowit didn't make me question about political correctness or authenticity of all events. It seemed so realistic. It left me even the impression that it was not at all a propaganda but rather a antiwar film like Deer Hunter.Recently when I watched it second time I noticed that such impression was only an effect triggered by the composition of the scenariomusicas Russian lyrical films of late 60s and 70sa little sad folk song is introduced some concrete situationIvan came back from the front to his hometown and meets old friendstalks about dead classmateswho were killed not by Chechens but by Russians before war then goes back to the front to help people whom he knows. So Balabanov has not only excellent skill of directionbut also a good knowledge of World and Russian cinema history. Thanks to these skill and knowledge he could make a filmwhich can give another impression than the story itself contains. The storyin factis mainly about young Ivan's heroic and sincere behavior in a lot of difficult situations. All events are told by him and only make him a nice brave and sincere Russian ManMuzikinto which he was made in War.He is cleversinceretactful and hansom. I would not have asked whyif Margaret had fallen in love with him not with Captain Medvedevwhich Bodrov Jr. plays so colorlessly. Brother and Brother 2 were contemporary fable and fairytale with real social background and individual views on itbut this time he show nothing new or unique. Well Voynait is much better than Zvesda with its oldfashioned demonstration of patriotism.But if he really wanted to show that War make a lad into true Manthe film is not only too simple but rather worse than more minimalbut more deep in meanings Blokpost by A.Rogozhkinor more simple but more sincere 9ya rota by F.Bondarchuk.".

John is told by the Chechen leader Aslan that he was two months to raise 2 million dollars for the release of his companion Margaret otherwise she will be gang raped and beheaded VOYNA is a very strange film . Reading the above premise you can be forgiven for thinking it's going to be a dark gloomy thriller and if I tell you the opening scene features a Russian soldier getting his throat slit and another being decapitated this will no doubt reinforce your opinion that it's ultra violent but that's not really how it works out . John and Margaret are a couple of touring actors appearing in Shakespearian plays and this film has a feeling that it's the theatre of the absurd . This however doesn't mean it's an exceptional film and quite often is as implausible as the worst Hollywood action blockbusters One point people on this page have picked up upon is the score which seems to belong in another film but I do remember many years ago seeing a hard hitting documentary about the first Chechen War called THE BETRAYED that showed gut wrenching carnage and battle scenes from the front line with the most inapporpiate Europop soundtrack playing over the action and one wonders if this influenced Aleksei Balabanov and he's trying to be ironic ? Whatever the reason it's slightly intrusive and interferes with the mood of the film Actually that's the other more major failing of the movie and the tone is very uneven and is slightly perplexing . It's probably fair to say this is a black comedy featuring the absurdity of war . After seeing people getting tortured and beheaded by the Chechens John is released and Ivan decides to help him and we see a quest where they run in to many colourful characters . But even then you find yourself asking if perhaps Balabanov could have pushed the boat out with a bit more insanity and fatalistic cynicism . Some scenes are implausible and sit in an uncomfortable manner with scenes that seem deadly serious and one wonders what point the director might be making ? At the end of the day VOYNA is a slightly unsatisfying film . It does hold the attention about a conflict that remains relatively unknown in Western Europe and just does enough to hold your attention but at the same time you'll be confused as to what the director is saying about this particular war".

	schema:reviewBody "MARGARET is and has been a troubled movie  sophisticated examination of one girl's post traumatic transformation as part of a larger point about how one's notion of importance is dwarfed by the larger worldview. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan and shot in 2005 as a threehour film the movie has remained on the shelves since its completion in 2007 over legal problems and finally is available for viewing in a 150minute version. Though it has flaws it contains some of the most sophisticated dialogue and philosophical points about where we are in our society today that the editing glitches become secondary background noise in a compelling film. The title no one in the film is named Margaret references the Gerald Manley Hopkins poem 'Spring and Fall to a young child' which is quoted at the top of this review.MARGARET focuses on a 17yearold New York City highschool student Lisa Anna Paquin who feels certain that she inadvertently played a role in a traffic accident that has claimed a woman's life Monica Allison Janney Lisa was chasing a bus whose driver Maretti Mark Ruffalo ran a red light because of Lisa's distraction trying to discover where the Maretti bought his cowboy hat. Monica dies in Lisa's arms while asking for her daughter also named Lisa we later learn Monica's daughter died at age 12 from leukemia. Lisa at first feels sorry for Maretti thinking that if she tells the truth Maretti will loose his job and his family support. Lisa's actress mother Joan J. SmithCameron encourages her to not give accurate testimony to the police a decision Lisa follows and spends the rest of the film regretting and in making attempts to set things right she meets with opposition at every step. Torn apart with frustration she begins emotionally brutalizing her family her friends her teachers and most of all herself. She has been confronted quite unexpectedly with a basic truth that her youthful ideals are on a collision course against the realities and compromises of the adult world.The world that Lisa occupies includes teachers  played by Matt Damon who crosses a forbidden line when Lisa seeks his advice as the only truly adult man she knows Matthew Broderick whose class discussions over literature are brittle and acerbic and deeply disturbing  her introduction to adolescent needs and physical incidents at the hands of John Gallagher Jr. now of The Newsroom fame Paul Kieran Culkin  her relationship with her needy single mother Joan whose newly dating Ramon Jean Reno her contact with the deceased's friend Emily Jeannie Berlin  brilliant and the deceased's only family  all in an attempt to somehow set things right but Lisa admitting that she is as responsible for Monica's death as is Maretti. But the world outside can't cope with anything but financial compensation as the resolution to Lisa's angst.There are many other characters brought to life by some VERY fine actors and the stunning musical score by Nico Muhly includes moments at the Metropolitan Opera where we actually get to see and hear Christine Goerke as Bellini's Norma singing 'Casta Diva' and Rene Fleming and Susan Graham singing the Barcarolle from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffman allowing the opening and closing of the film to be accompanied by a quiet guitar piece as well as proving Muhly's very highly accomplished music to underscore the moods of the film. The cinematography by Ryszard Lenczewski underlines the tension  form the imagery of slow motion crowd movement in New York during the opening sequences to the stabilization of important encounters between the characters. A lot is said and screamed and the level of communication and actions by Anna Paquin's Lisa alienate the audience at times but the film makes some very solid statements about how we are acidly interacting or not connecting in our current state of society. That deserves attention. The film requires a lot form the audience but in this viewer's mind it is well worth the time. Grady Harp".

Scenes run on and on without advancing the story. Scenes are cut without reason. This film is badly in need of editing. Margaret is a very long movie with very little story to tell. The story wanders everywhere. It is essentially a story about a 17year old woman Lisa Cohen who is partly responsible for the death of a pedestrian in New York City. The heroine played by Anna Paquin is annoying from the beginning when she is caught cheating on her math exam by her teacher played by Matt Damon. He indulges her belief that she is entitled to do so.Later that day she distracts a bus driver played by Mark Ruffalo in order to find out where he bought his cowboy hat. Instead of watching where he is going the driver kills a woman in the crosswalk. The woman dies in Lisa's arms. She lies to the investigating officer at the scene and reports that the bus had the green light. She later experiences the discomfort of guilt.The rest of the film involved this young woman making a nuisance of herself to pretty much everyone she meets. She changes her story. She wants to meet the family of everyone involved in the tragic death. She wants the bus driver fired. She wants to move to California to live with her father. She has sex for the first time without really knowing her partner. She tries to have sex with her teacher at school. She argues with everyone. Jean Reno adds contrast to the ensemble. He plays a nice interesting man who injects a little reason and depth to the story so you know he has to die unexpectedly so that there are no agreeable people left in story.The script is about unhappy ethicallychallenged unpleasant people bickering about morality about Israel and Palestine about whatever and then there is psychobabble. These people go after each other at the slightest provocation. At some point a civil lawyer is retained. The lawsuit makes no sense. The involvement of the heroine who was partly responsible for the death in every aspect of the suit goes beyond incredible. The beneficiaries of the suit lie about how much they liked the dead woman. The lawyer encourages this. There are speeches about morality made by people aren't very moral. It is a long long movie that makes you wish you were hit by the bus instead.".

The acting is exceptional even relatively small parts played by actors such as Matthew Broderick Matt Damon Mark Ruffalo and Allison Janey showcase both the actors' own remarkable abilities as well as Lonergan's attention to detail. It is Matthew Broderick's character who is the only one to utter the movie's title as he recites a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins. J.

	schema:reviewBody "On the day of its cinema release Kenneth Lonergan's longgestating drama was the most successful film in the UK. Problem was it only opened on one screen. The story of Margaret's production is likely a fascinating story in itself not least because of Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker's input into the final edit which was presumably a return favour for Lonergan's work on the screenplay for Gangs of New York. But I'll focus on the fascinating story that Lonergan has told with this film.Ostensibly the tale centres on a New York schoolgirl named Lisa Anna Paquin defining her young adulthood just as she defined herself in childhood with The Piano who inadvertently causes a fatal road accident. What follows is the emotional aftermath fought outwardly with her mother as a moral and ethical war wages within her hormoneravaged body.The performances are excellent throughout particularly Paquin and J. SmithCameron as the daughter and mother caught in gravitational flux. Jean Reno gives fine support as the sadsack Ramon while Matthew Broderick delivers the poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins that provides the film's title while suggesting the entire life of his character by the way he eats a sandwich. It's that kind of film. I recently wrote a review of Winter's Bone which I described as an antiyouth movie. Margaret could be a companion piece in this regard cautioning against the brighteyed naivety of youthful independence and promoting the importance of family. Like Winter's Ree Lisa is a lost soul unlike Ree Lisa is not someone we admire. But she is always in focus Lonergan expects not for us to like her only to understand her. In maintaining this focus Lonergan himself achieves the admirable weaving a narrative whose minute details and labyrinthine arguments mirror the broader existential vista against which they are dwarfed. Margaret goes deeper than Winter's Bone delivering something pleasingly unexpected a kind of Sartrean modern fable about the isolating nature of subjectivity. Like her actor mother on the stage and like us all in our semiwaking lives Lisa is the main player in her great opera. She performs the social functions that enable her to cling to a sense of belongingness but something gnaws at her soul. And when after the accident she seeks some kind of meaning she is met at once by indifference before being seduced by those very institutions that make indifference normal. Nothing in the material world satisfies Lisa nothing can match her aspirations. The suggestion here I feel is that our despair emerges from the disparity between that which we hope for and that which reality can deliver. No wonder it took so long to find its way to a single UK screen a threehour existentialist play is a tough sell. Ten years after the towers sank to Ground Zero Margaret joins There Will Be Blood The Assassination of Richard Nixon and for some Zodiac in the pantheon of modern classics that map the American psyche in the post911 world.".

There are a lot of scenes that flow really really nicely into other scenes that might not have to do with the main plot line but seem to belong in the movie all the same. I can kind of see why the writerdirector had trouble trimming it even at two and a half hours its hard to tell where or what to trim since the main plot line of the movie isn't really the point so much as all the establishing things that contribute to Lisa's mood and state of mind as the movie progresses. i think If you're reading this you probably already know the main plot lineteenage girl Lisa causes massive bus accident resulting in a single death and spends the rest of the movie both breaking down emotionally and trying to right what she feels she did wrong. the accident is really really not entirely her fault but she feels enormous guilt just the same as she should Anna Paquin gives an incredible performance herei don't just mean that Paguin's performance is really emotional which it isor that she feels like a real life teenager here so confident in her rightness so prone to outbursts when her rightness isn't so right i mean that Paquin's performance really pretty much completely singlehandedly holds this entire jumble together into one coherent narrativeand for that she's almost like Kenneth Lonnigran's equivalent to Ben Gazzara here. We follow her as she runs into all sorts of people and we follow her thru all of her mood swings and somewhat pointless arguments that she picks with some of these people and completely well reasoned arguments that she picks with others...she's the kind of well intentioned but guilt racked protaginist you would expect to find in a novel or a play or maybe a really good ongoing TV seriesbut definitely not a film with a definitive arc which is what makes her character that much more surprising.The film really did call to mind some of John Cassavettes' films in both its rambling yet always moving forward but never exactly straight forward narrative and the many many set pieces consisting of minute characters just talking....not to mention all the natrualistic scenes of Lisa just hanging out in her element. meaning in school with friends arguing with her mom etc Movie is very very dialog heavy and yet somehow it never comes across as trying to strongarm you into a specific point of view at least until the last half hour or soas its main character eventually and forcefully takes one on of her own.This is a movie that for all of its strengths has plenty of weaknesses in it as well. For one thing I'm not sure what the heck Jean Reno is doing here exactly. I'm only slightly less curious about what the heck Matt Damon is doing here also. was he supposed to be Lisa's moral compass? because his character doesn't really make any sense really. If there's one character who seems like he should have had more screen time it would have to be him i'm not enitrely sure why we keep cutting back to Matthew Broderick who outside the scenes of him moderating English class debates ?!?! doesn't seem to have much of a character to play. i'm not entirely sure the ending justified the extreme buildupi'm also not sure how realistic that ending decision actually is either but i'll let that go just because the movie had to have an ending. Even tho I enjoyed the constant cutting back to Lisa's mom's storyline J Smith Cameron is pretty good here too i should point outi'm not even sure all of that was necessary to tell Lisa's story so thoroughlyeven if the relationship between the mom and the daughter i think is supposed to be the backbone of the movie...and yet with all of these questionable elements just kind of thrown on in there one on top of the other like they're all so tightly wound together that it would be hard to pick one off without feeling like something was missing i should add the movie does remain really quite watchable right up until the endanchored very nicely by the excellent work of Anna Paquin so really that's a feat just by itself i think. This is a film that will be overrated by some and too easily dismissed by many others...yet this definitely is a challenging film and one that i think should make a pretty good civics lesson to some high schoolcollege students in the years aheadprovided schools are still teaching civics in the years ahead.".

	schema:reviewBody "The travails involved in getting this movie released at all are well enough known by now that the fact that it is a flawed masterpiece shouldn't come as a surprise. Above all it is a masterclass in how to write dialogue. Virtually every character is given a credible and compelling voice from the bus driver to the lawyer from the mother's suitor to Lisa's boyfriend. As the father of a daughter now in her early 20's I can say that Lisa Cohen's character is as realistic a portrayal of the insecurities and selfrighteousness of female adolescence as I have seen. All aspiring screenwriters should be forced to watch this movie and then be given a 3hour oral and written exam before being allowed to put pen to paper or finger to keyboard.The acting is also superb. The feel is more of a stage play an ensemble piece than a film. Perhaps the fact that one of the characters  Lisa's mother  is a stage actress struggling to support her daughter is partially responsible. But you can tell that this team of seasoned actors relished the opportunity to stretch out with an intelligent wellwritten script and a supportive director.The only flaw in Margaret has already been well expressed by others. The film does meander and while I recognize that this is partly the point of the exercise there are times at which you long for a more conventional and taut storyline. I would gladly have spent more time in the company of these welldrawn articulate and interesting people. Maybe next time HBO wants to do a miniseries it will let Kenneth Lonergan loose on a story rather than subject us to another preachy wordy effort from Aaron Sorkin.".

	schema:headline " Lollygagging with Lonergan";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a review of You Can Count On Me and Margaret two excellent films written and directed by playwright Kenneth Lonergan.Released in 2000 You Can Count On Me stars Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo as Sammy and Terry two siblings whose lives have been affected by a family tragedy. Sammy lives alone with her son Rudy Rory Culkin whilst Terry's a drifter who lives on the road. When Terry moves in with the duo he begins to form a bond with Sammy's kid. Sounds formulaic? It's not. Lonergan dodges clichs like crazy conveys a certain emotional complexity and delights in subtly setting up and then overturning expectations. In this regard Terry is initially portrayed as a delinquent with no gifts responsibilities or direction. Sammy meanwhile is portrayed as a strong steadfast stable Mom who has life by the reigns. Cleverly however Lonergan questions these narrow assumptions. Terry begins to reveal himself as a perceptive guy becomes a surrogate father to young Rudy and reveals various talents. Sammy meanwhile unravels before our eyes. Both Ruffalo and Linney turn in excellent work. Ruffalo consciously mimics a young Brando but is more wounded more inwardly tortured. Like most of Ruffalo's characters his Terry is a quiet sexily melancholic guy. Linney meanwhile paints Sammy as a bristly tightly wound woman. Both characters engage in rituals of denial burying their pain engaging in flights of fancy and never discussing things directly.More ambitious than You Can Count On Me is Lonergan's Margaret a deliberately lurid melodrama. The film stars Anna Paquin as Lisa a precocious teenager who lives a life of privilege in New York City. When Lisa distracts a bus driver Mark Ruffalo this leads to a traffic accident and the death of a young woman. From here on Lisa attempts to get the bus driver incarcerated pursuing an idea of justice that's designed to expiate her guilt though unconsciously she desires to draw attention to her own crimes. The film abounds with complex little moments. Lisa appears like a rude idiot in some of her school classes but like a passionate intelligent girl in others. She appears sexually mature and confident in some sequences but hopelessly inexperienced in others. A mercurial force Lisa purses everything with a sense of vengeance though her roiling emerging sense of self is also frequently humbled as she spends much of the film dealing with her own insecurities limitations and nagging conscience. Lonergan thus manages a strange juggling act Lisa the hurricane Lisa the mouse. He then applies these wild polar shifts to other characters. One kid for example played by Kieran Culkin seems cool as a cucumber until we learn he's sexually incompetent. School teachers Matt Damon and various other adult characters are given similar treatments.Elsewhere the film centres on Lisa's beleaguered single mother a successful stage actress. Lisa attacks her mother for attending boring Opera productions in which stupid people just want to prove how loud they can sing without realising that she herself embraces an operatic vision of life. For Lisa Lisa is the centre of the universe Lisa's dilemmas matter Lisa's trapped in a grandiose web. Lonergan thus has Lisa's daily troubles and emotional catharses  indeed the whole aesthetic of his film  echo the operatic form. He then mirrors Lisa's operatic selfcentredness with the quieter more mature worldviews of older characters.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a review of You Can Count On Me and Margaret two excellent films written and directed by playwright Kenneth Lonergan.Released in 2000 You Can Count On Me stars Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo as Sammy and Terry two siblings whose lives have been affected by a family tragedy. Sammy lives alone with her son Rudy Rory Culkin whilst Terry's a drifter who lives on the road. When Terry moves in with the duo he begins to form a bond with Sammy's kid. Sounds formulaic? It's not. Lonergan dodges clichs like crazy conveys a certain emotional complexity and delights in subtly setting up and then overturning expectations. In this regard Terry is initially portrayed as a delinquent with no gifts responsibilities or direction. Sammy meanwhile is portrayed as a strong steadfast stable Mom who has life by the reigns. Cleverly however Lonergan questions these narrow assumptions. Terry begins to reveal himself as a perceptive guy becomes a surrogate father to young Rudy and reveals various talents. Sammy meanwhile unravels before our eyes. Both Ruffalo and Linney turn in excellent work. Ruffalo consciously mimics a young Brando but is more wounded more inwardly tortured. Like most of Ruffalo's characters his Terry is a quiet sexily melancholic guy. Linney meanwhile paints Sammy as a bristly tightly wound woman. Both characters engage in rituals of denial burying their pain engaging in flights of fancy and never discussing things directly.More ambitious than You Can Count On Me is Lonergan's Margaret a deliberately lurid melodrama. The film stars Anna Paquin as Lisa a precocious teenager who lives a life of privilege in New York City. When Lisa distracts a bus driver Mark Ruffalo this leads to a traffic accident and the death of a young woman. From here on Lisa attempts to get the bus driver incarcerated pursuing an idea of justice that's designed to expiate her guilt though unconsciously she desires to draw attention to her own crimes. The film abounds with complex little moments. Lisa appears like a rude idiot in some of her school classes but like a passionate intelligent girl in others. She appears sexually mature and confident in some sequences but hopelessly inexperienced in others. A mercurial force Lisa purses everything with a sense of vengeance though her roiling emerging sense of self is also frequently humbled as she spends much of the film dealing with her own insecurities limitations and nagging conscience. Lonergan thus manages a strange juggling act Lisa the hurricane Lisa the mouse. He then applies these wild polar shifts to other characters. One kid for example played by Kieran Culkin seems cool as a cucumber until we learn he's sexually incompetent. School teachers Matt Damon and various other adult characters are given similar treatments.Elsewhere the film centres on Lisa's beleaguered single mother a successful stage actress. Lisa attacks her mother for attending boring Opera productions in which stupid people just want to prove how loud they can sing without realising that she herself embraces an operatic vision of life. For Lisa Lisa is the centre of the universe Lisa's dilemmas matter Lisa's trapped in a grandiose web. Lonergan thus has Lisa's daily troubles and emotional catharses  indeed the whole aesthetic of his film  echo the operatic form. He then mirrors Lisa's operatic selfcentredness with the quieter more mature worldviews of older characters. Reserved bottledup and more generous than Lisa these are characters who have learnt what every teenager eventually learns you are not the centre of the universe. Other people matter. But Lonergan also sympathises with Lisa. Her private operas also matter. From these contradictions then spring various exchanges about antiSemitism and so forth. In Margaret everyone has their own opera they just approach the soundstage with different levels of jadedness.Incidentally the film's title refers to the person addressed in Gerard Manley Hopkins' poem Spring and Fall.

	schema:reviewBody "For me it was more of a stressful experience than sitting and enjoying  a movie.  The cast boasts Anna Paquin of True Blood fame Hollywood heavyweight  Matt Damon Jean Reno from Leon and Matthew Broderick. I've got a real  soft spot for Broderick because of Election and Ferris Bueller's Day  Off is one of my favourite films but even the presence of the  righteous dude couldn't redeem this film for me. Mark Ruffalo is a  favourite of mine too Shutter Island The Kids Are Alright Eternal  Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Ruffalo Damon and Broderick are  scarcely in the film though.  It's really all about Lisa a hormonal teenager who seeks to satisfy  her insatiable desire for conflict and drama by pestering all of the  people who were involved or affected by a horrific bus accident that  she witnessed. Paquin gives a powerful and convincing performance  throughout so you can't really blame her for the films failure. You  can't simply blame the fact that the character is especially detestable  either  we've seen antiheroes and super villains time and time again  in cinema and they can be some of the most engrossing characters to  watch.  The film's problem is that it focuses entirely on this highstrung  volatile bitchy adolescent as she goes about a mundane course of  daytoday life seeking attention and rubbing people up the wrong way.  There's no real point to all this. The conclusion resolves to say  nothing more than she's probably like this because of her age and she  doesn't get along with her mum or something.  Margaret is nothing more than a character study of a stereotypically  hostile obnoxious teenager. There's no clear controlling idea it  wallows in ambiguity and the attempts to reference Shakespeare are  laughably pretentious. It's too long entirely stressful to sit through  and has no real payoff at the end.".

The girl behind me as I left the theater didn't like it telling her friend I just couldn't stand Anna Paquin's character. The screenplay is deft at shorthanding idiosyncratic complicated personalities with naturalistic dialogue. It also helps that every role in the film including almost every minor part is cast with a top notch actor. But for all the big Hollywood names my props go to J. SmithCameron for a theatergrade performance scaled down to fit the intimacy of a close up shot. The movie explores the milieu of affluent teenagers attending an upscale school in New York City and one of the other reviewers here is right in saying it resembles a French film in that it takes an mature approach to depicting adolescents showing them as smart complicated sexual uncertain. Most mainstream reviewers seem puzzled as to what they should think about it. I think it's over their heads the elliptical dialogue heavy character driven narrative style as well as the lack of an easy simple takeaway moral seems to have befuddled them. Maybe we should rope in some theater critics' opinions instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Margaret has 2 especially good things going for it. One is that it's written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan who did such a good job with You Can Count On Me. The latter had sharp incisive perceptive dialog which was at times laughoutloud funny. I didn't find myself laughing very often while viewing Margaret but the dialog was just as sharp.The other great thing in its favour is that it has Anna Paquin. I thought she was outstanding as the young child in The Piano but haven't been overimpressed by anything I've seen her in since. Until Margaret that is. The way she folds and involves the viewer into her exceedingly complex character was terrific reminiscent of Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone.The film itself is long sometimes quite slow but totally involving. I watched a couple of hours thought I'd watch the rest the next night then 10 minutes later turned it back on to watch the final hour. During most 90 minute films I'm checking my watch to see how long there is to go so this was a sure sign of how good a movie Margaret was.I'm not sure I fully understand the movie. All of the characters are frail and their flaws easily come to the surface which makes sympathizing with any of them too much somewhat difficult. But I guess that is the point  they're real people like the rest of us. The child Curtis is probably the most sympathetic character. He's ignored by his mother dismissed by his father and seems to exist only as a source of irritation to Lisa. I guess that's a real situation too.Margaret is a thought provoking film that probably warrants a second viewing all 3 hours of it  gulp to pick up on its subtleties and nuances. I gave it 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK I am not particularly proud of it but I had such a boring experience watching this thing I actually created an account just to post this review.This movie is awful. I just can't believe that anyone could have actually enjoyed it and get something out of it.It is one of the most boring overplayed pompous movie I have ever seen. It is just a pathetically elongated drama who tries very very very hard to be a metaphorical display of big obnoxious pseudointellectual themes seasoned with an overdose of teenagers hormones and unhappiness.

Problem is Shakespearian drama without the drama is just a boring overrated portray of a troubled teen.I suspect the intentions of the filmmakers were to make the viewers think oooh poor thing it must be hard to live after such a trauma yes it is difficult to grow and make lifechanging decisions etc. instead I just wanted the main character to throw herself under the next bus.I waited desperately for something interesting to happen for a twist that would make this whole nonsensical agitation more than a big waste of time but no.

I just can't believe that anyone could have actually enjoyed it and get something out of it.It is one of the most boring overplayed pompous movie I have ever seen. It is just a pathetically elongated drama who tries very very very hard to be a metaphorical display of big obnoxious pseudointellectual themes seasoned with an overdose of teenagers hormones and unhappiness.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films which have so much heart that their flaws hardly matter. The film's main character is a young woman no angel herself who is confronted with the hypocrisy of the adult world in the aftermath of a traffic accident. That sounds like a recipe for a conventional and sentimental morality tale but this film is anything but that. Instead it pits its young protagonist against a circle of elders who have in their different ways accommodated themselves to life's hard realities. She holds on tenaciously to what most of them lost long ago her passion and rage and a burning desire for justice. But along the way she makes her own compromises and her victory if that's what it is is both hardwon and deeply equivocal.This film shares with director Kenneth Lonergan's previous film You Can Count on Me a gentle and amused but unflinching view of human nature. The vision here though is much darker. The film tends to proceed on the assumption that conflict in human relationships must erupt sooner or later in confrontation and this results in a film with a somewhat episodic structure and rather a lot of shouting matches. The film nevertheless wins our trust by caring enough not to fob us off with easy answers or easy cynicism. It does not even give us a particularly sympathetic heroine to identify with only a flawed human being who will have to come to terms with her mistakes like everyone else. A film like this wouldn't work without individual and ensemble acting of the greatest intensity and honesty and that's what it has. The title by the way is a reference to a Gerard Manley Hopkins poem that is quoted in the course of the film. Another poem comes to mind the one by Yeats that goes But I am old and you are youngAnd I speak a barbarous tongue.".

That's because it was filmed in 2005 and got held up in postproduction. Even so it doesn't feel dated. The main themes hold up really well and are told with unusually frank terms. Many people really are just greedy and selfish at heart.The key event happens early on and in a way can't even be mentioned here. But it's safe to say that Paquin who's character is called Lisa Cohen at first takes a false stance in a moment of crisis and compassion. But the truth of the matter eats at her and against the rising tide of people who prefer the lie she becomes increasingly principled. In the end it is almost everyone who is morally corrupt even in his own way her teacher.There is one lurking problem to the movie that really hurt it. One is the way the initial crisis is filmed with Mark Ruffalo as a bus driver. It is exaggerated and makes the circumstances leading to tragedy unlikely just when the rest of the movie depends on likelihood. Since this is the lynchpin of everyone's reactions later on it matters rather too much to ignore. But the rest of it from the main plot and Paquin to the various subplots including a romantic affair her mother has and some political conflicts about ArabIsraeli relations and the 911 events is all really sharply delineated and well acted. And it's written with a good ear for dialog. It simply makes sense. The fact that there is no silver lining here and that people are shown so obviously ugly below the surface is harder to do than you might think. All admirable stuff.".

The acting script and cinematography are incredibly realistic and the story is intelligently presented without being overly artsy or highbrow.My take on it After witnessing and being an unwitting participant in a tragic bus accident bright promising but very frenetic NYC high school senior Lisa Cohen finds it harder than ever to find connection with anyone around her. Ironically this prevents her from understanding why everyone around her has the same problem. As she says herself during one of the numerous altercations with her rising Broadway actress mother People don't relate to each other. . . They're totally disconnected. On this subject there are a lot of people screaming at each other here and they usually don't even recall how the screaming began. They always stop screaming before it gets really tiresome but the fights are crucial to the theme of people just acting out with no attempt to understand or empathize. The very fine acting and dialogue prevent MARGARET from descending into what it could have been A hackneyed soap operaNew York melodrama of the sort we've seen plenty of times before.I found Lisa harder and harder to take as the film progressed. Sometimes it seemed that she should be a little less of a selfish drama queen but again this negative development may be deliberate on the part of the creators and helps pose the question of who's really crazy and who's really sane.There is a slow steady tension to this film plenty of interesting stuff happens and there are all kinds of meaningful subplots. It often seems to meander but everything's relevant in the end. Yet MARGARET is driven more by its various themes than it is by plot or character. I like it because it's so different from most current films in fact it's the first recent film I've seen that I'll probably want to see again. Nevertheless people who just want to be entertained without having to sit back and analyze what they're watching will probably not want to sit through 2.5 hours of this.".

	schema:headline " Attentionseeking teenager goes through death mortality and innocence";
	schema:reviewBody "Margaret took years to get to us seemingly even longer to play out but tells a story so poetic and heartbreakingly real that you couldn't imagine it any other way. Lisa Anna Paquin is a teenager she's lost in her own world by her own misguided arrogance but she must come to terms with death and the true nature of a tragic accident.The film starts with Lisa in high school determinedly getting her way even though she probably doesn't deserve to. Nonchalantly waiting 'til class is over and wearing a skirt too short she saunters her way to the front where her math teacher Mr. Aaron Matt Damon chastises her for her poor grades. But with a slightly flirtatious tone Lisa settles the matter with a supposedly shared understanding that it's okay because math won't factor into her future.Later Lisa sets out to find a stylish but functional cowboy hat in the middle of New York City. She is unsuccessful until she spies one on the head of a boyishly handsome bus driver Mark Ruffalo and jauntily jogs beside it determined to get his attention to both find out where he got his hat and also to quench a teenage girl's desire of just getting his attention. She succeeds he drives through a red light and kills a pedestrian in the process.Lisa immediately feels the pain guilt and remorse and tries to ease the woman's passage into the afterlife. The film then becomes a character study of a teenage girl determined to get past the pain and aftermath of a tragedy caused by a simple accident. The fascinating parts of this film involve how our lead character becomes less sympathetic but more fragile while remaining equally reckless.Questions about the cause and nature of mortality are raised and most interestingly what are the moral and immoral ways to respond to it. The film's title comes from the poem Spring and Fall Margaret Are You Grieving? written by Gerard Manley Hopkins in 1880. Margaret is a child who must come to terms with the loss of her innocence.  And yet you will weep and know why. Now no matter child the name Sorrow's springs are the same. Lisa's English teacher Matthew Broderick recites this poem to the class. Lisa is at times a typical teenager bent on having things her way always having her point heard. But now the shaky foundations which her arrogance is based on begin to crumble and we don't know and she doesn't know if she's still innocent or where she lost it.The shortened released version of Margaret clocks in at over two and a half hours edited down from the threehour director's cut. But because of the universal tale of life and death that it tells it needs the length. It doesn't have a simple plot and Lisa is not a simple character. It can definitely seem errant with its uneven editing but that's probably going to be an expected outcome of 6 years' worth of legal and creative battles going on behind the scenes.Broderick and Ruffalo reteam from Lonergan's previous indie success You Can Count on Me 2000 but don't expect any actor to show more range or emotion than Anna Paquin. Everything goes through Lisa.".

But now the shaky foundations which her arrogance is based on begin to crumble and we don't know and she doesn't know if she's still innocent or where she lost it.The shortened released version of Margaret clocks in at over two and a half hours edited down from the threehour director's cut. But because of the universal tale of life and death that it tells it needs the length. It doesn't have a simple plot and Lisa is not a simple character. It can definitely seem errant with its uneven editing but that's probably going to be an expected outcome of 6 years' worth of legal and creative battles going on behind the scenes.Broderick and Ruffalo reteam from Lonergan's previous indie success You Can Count on Me 2000 but don't expect any actor to show more range or emotion than Anna Paquin. Everything goes through Lisa.";

One thing I've noticed reading reviews is that those who have the former opinion invariably describe Lisa Cohen a phenomenal Anna Paquin in negative terms unlikable unsympathetic even reprehensible. Whereas I spent much of the movie weeping tears of empathy for the grief she was in.So the question is if when you were 17 a stranger had died bloodily in your arms and you believed you were partly responsible for her death how well would you have handled it? Apparently a lot of people can't make that leap can't ask themselves that question. Folks that is a trauma that could easily give you PTSD. Lisa's reaction is quite different she starts to do things.The ubiquitous description of this film by those who don't think it's a masterpiece is unfocused if not downright incoherent or a mess. This is clearly an opinion offered by people who are not aware that every waking moment of Lisa's life must be colored by the accident. There's no lack of focus at all when you see every scene through that lens.Make no mistake Lisa doesn't handle things well or admirably. She's 17 and a bit spoiled and in general wholly unprepared to shoulder such a burden. But she wants to do the right thing and at times is painfully selfaware that her best efforts are hurting others. In other words the more she tries to make things better the worse she makes it. That makes her plight all the more tragic.This is one of the most powerful narratives in the world one that can blow your head clean off. You've got to ask yourself one question how much empathy do I have? Well how much?".

You have a choice between putting up with this for 2 12 hours or 3 hours depending on which cut you're watching.Seriously how could this movie get any stars much less accolades of Masterpiece! and Brilliant!? It's boring as hell and is like reliving all of the worst most aggravating most awkward and banal parts of being a teenager with none of the good parts to break up the monotony. The accident scene is the best in the movie. It's highly dramatic and full of feeling. Once that scene is over just do yourself a favor and turn the movie off. There is no exploration of the main character's feelings about the accident no personal crisis no selfrealization. She just goes on with her life except now she's more of a pain in the ass. If you just can't pass that up you could experience the drama yourself by picking a fight with your own kids and at least that would be more entertaining and relevant than watching Anna Paquin do it. And don't get me wrong I like Anna Paquin. But as starstudded as this cast is nothing can save it from the fact that this movie just isn't about anything. Some reviewers wrote that it's an accurate portrayal of life as it iswell who wants to watch that?! Why don't I set up a video camera in my living room and people can watch 3 hours of me playing video games talking on the phone and scratching my butt? I'm sure that would be very lifelike and realistic too but frankly most of life doesn't make a good storyand neither does this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mitsuo Yanagimachi's Godspeed You! Black Emperor 1976 is these days more famous for having inspired the name of the celebrated Canadian postrock band than for actually being seen by audiences as a great film in its own right. However if you are at all interested in Japanese cinema and by extension Japanese culture then it is really the kind of film that is worth tracking down. Though admittedly most current available versions of the film feature quite poorsubtitling the themes of the film and the relationships between the various characters are all fairly easy to understand regardless of such limitations with the film really being more about the mood and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers as opposed to any notion of complicated plotting. If you can get behind this approach and appreciate the film for its exciting sense of energy urgency confusion and defiance  all central to the lives and interactions of these various characters  then you'll be able to enjoy the film as a purely visceral experience.In terms of style Godspeed You! Black Emperor is typical of the lowbudget streetlevel productions of the Japanese New Wave of the late 60's and early 70's shot in highcontrast black and white with obvious cinmavrit like influences and a cast of young stars that seem suitably intense and charmingly inexperienced. The approach to the film adds to that rough rock n' roll protopunktype appeal of the production with the film standing as something of a Japanese precursor to Quadrophenia 1979 depicting the workings of a genuine subculture  in this instance the bszoku biker gangs that came to prominence in the 1950's and evolved throughout the subsequent two decades  and the evocative creation of a grey and hopeless world of flat blocks suburbs and backstreets where this rambling youth drama plays out. It is also sensitively rendered in regards to the characters  illustrating their hopes dreams and ambitions  not to mention their various interweaving relationships and the sense that the escape and freedom presented by the thrill of riding a motorcycle through the late night streets of Shinjuku is really as lifeaffirming as anything else imaginable.Beyond the obvious curiosity value for fans and admirers of the now iconic band Godspeed You! Black Emperor is a window into a particular time in 20th century Japanese history with the general attitudes of the characters their defiance and sense of rebellion all being characteristic of the country before the economic rebirth of the following decades. The depiction of the country's youth and the general behavioural system as documented in the film is easily as fascinating as that depicted in a film such as 'If...' 1968 which presents a similar sense of generational defiance and the need for escape as well as offering a similar window of experience for those of us that missed that particular time and movement. Not only that but Godspeed You! Black Emperor can and should be seen as one of the truly great rock n' roll films with the timely soundtrack combined with the scenes of group banter and those endlessly fascinating shots of the snakelike convey of motorcycles  with headlight glaring out in pristine black and white as they parade through the slumbering city  defining the film as something completely iconic and completely unique.".

It's a highly interesting raw and phenomenally executed look into the playful early years of Bosozoku culture a massive and nearly forgotten Japanese youth phenomenon of the 70's and 80's. This film puts you right in the middle of it's joyful and mostly harmless beginnings. The debut of the award winning director Mitsuo Yanagimachi it was filmed in black and white to save money but this does not take away from the style and cinematic value of this film. There is so much to love about this movie The artsy and humorous still photographs that were inserted the excellent Japanese 70's rock n' roll soundtrack the highly personal glimpse into the public and gang lives of the youthful and adorable members and the genius I mean GENIUS cinematography. They must have had dozens and dozens of cameramen following these guys around day and night and it definitely shows. The film focuses on a single motorcycle gang called the Black Emperors and it's members many of whom are no older than 17. The first half of the film focuses on Decko one of the leaders who is struggling with his parents after being arrested for vandalizing a taxi and is in danger of having his license suspended. The rest of the film focuses on the other younger members and their personal lives inside and outside of the Black Emperors as they ride through Tokyo at night drinking vandalizing bridges dancing in the streets and trying to look cool. It seems like the general goal of these gangs was to have as good of a time as possible while looking as cool as possible and having the most members on bikes. They constantly brag to each other about how homeless and badass they are but we see after the cameras follow them home that they outside the gang most of them are normal Japanese kids living with their parents so there's also this make believe aspect at play in the gangs. There really is a lot to this film. It's artistic stylish dark raw happy and even violent. A lot of people complain about the incomplete nature of the English subtitles and incoherent story. I don't think these people realize that what they are watching is 100 real. No scripting no acting. The subtitles are dense where necessary and scarce when not but most of the important parts are fully subtitled so that the viewer can understand what is happening. The only thing I would change about this film is the period it was filmed. The early 80's was the peak of the Bosozoku movement and was much more gritty violent and AKIRAlike sometimes serving as a training ground for low level Yakuza members. This is the beginnings of Bosozoku culture when the gangs were more like social clubs than street thugs but this is also a highly interesting world to see in this film. If you like documentaries do yourself a favor and watch this film. I could talk about it for days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so it was a band that ushered the title into the cultural lexicon originally though it was a Japanese film about teen bikers. I'm not familiar with the band instead I come to this in my quest for New Wave images images that catch cinema unawares. Especially Japanese New Wave which usually resonates closer to the heart of things.Yasuzo Masumura brought the stuff to Japan having probably been exposed to what was going on at the Left Bank while studying in Italy and Oshima nourished the seed. From there it grew unexpected roots. In Europe it was about a simple rejection of old values the old Europe of thinking and theater and thinking in terms of it a grand stage subjectobject duality high purpose revealed by conflict.In Japan the youthful energy tapped deeper though into ancient soul. The rejection of traditional appearances the peeling of all manner of charged ritual and rigorous formalism strangely perhaps inadvertently brought them to the essence of that old tradition. Asymmetry deliberately broken balance abstraction hinted at by imperfect forms all these were discovered anew with newfound immediacy.The rejection here is emblematized by the biker gang one of many called the Black Emperors. Looking at these teenagers goof around they are a much tamer version of what the Hell's Angels were earlier who it should be noted went on to real gang rapes and real murders but whose formation was after all cinematically inspired The Wild One with Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin.But at core we find the same idealless nihilism the same gratuitous appropriation of swastikas the same tribal ceremony of male aggression there is mention of the elders who founded the group venerated as ancestral chiefs the same massive rides meant to strike terror at the decent folks that Hunter Thompson describes in his book about the Angels. More importantly the same alienation of jobless aimless young people here seen loafing in Shinjuku with too much time and energy and nothing to create. Harmony Korine would love the sense of itinerant recklessness. Kenneth Anger the chrome fetish and boyish impertinence.More poignantly yet it's Western culture that provides the inspiration the whattorejectfor. They write Black Emperors in English instead of kanji as though meant to equally offend good graces as the swastika between the two words in the logo ironically a Buddhist symbol. They all smoke rigorously like movie characters out of Godard. As the mother recites her mantras and counts her prayer beads the son in the next room cranks up loud rock'n'roll beats on his turntable.In music we find another suitable analogy to this. It's what punk rock was at the time youthful expression as an abrasive middle finger aimed everywhere. This is an important film in what would eventually become a punk cinema the No Wave as it were of Sogo Ishii and Tsukamoto some Miike that would no longer tap into an ancient soul and would have no burning reason to reject what it did with so much exuberance. I think one because of the other.Some of these contrasts may be easy a lesser catchier documentary would purport to tell a story through them build up to something. But here? Here there is time inbetween. A sense of transience of a now often mundane unmediated by cinema without fear of past or anticipation of future. Or an emptiness of identity waiting to be filled. Nothing comes out of this venture eventually except that they venture out to vent again. The long procession of bikes lined up on the road ready to move off at the end strangely looks like a kanji of headlights painted on a scroll of Zen calligraphy that points the 'middle road'. Something to meditate upon perhaps.".

Looking at these teenagers goof around they are a much tamer version of what the Hell's Angels were earlier who it should be noted went on to real gang rapes and real murders but whose formation was after all cinematically inspired The Wild One with Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin.But at core we find the same idealless nihilism the same gratuitous appropriation of swastikas the same tribal ceremony of male aggression there is mention of the elders who founded the group venerated as ancestral chiefs the same massive rides meant to strike terror at the decent folks that Hunter Thompson describes in his book about the Angels. More importantly the same alienation of jobless aimless young people here seen loafing in Shinjuku with too much time and energy and nothing to create. Harmony Korine would love the sense of itinerant recklessness. Kenneth Anger the chrome fetish and boyish impertinence.More poignantly yet it's Western culture that provides the inspiration the whattorejectfor. They write Black Emperors in English instead of kanji as though meant to equally offend good graces as the swastika between the two words in the logo ironically a Buddhist symbol. They all smoke rigorously like movie characters out of Godard. As the mother recites her mantras and counts her prayer beads the son in the next room cranks up loud rock'n'roll beats on his turntable.In music we find another suitable analogy to this. It's what punk rock was at the time youthful expression as an abrasive middle finger aimed everywhere. This is an important film in what would eventually become a punk cinema the No Wave as it were of Sogo Ishii and Tsukamoto some Miike that would no longer tap into an ancient soul and would have no burning reason to reject what it did with so much exuberance. I think one because of the other.Some of these contrasts may be easy a lesser catchier documentary would purport to tell a story through them build up to something. But here? Here there is time inbetween. A sense of transience of a now often mundane unmediated by cinema without fear of past or anticipation of future. Or an emptiness of identity waiting to be filled. Nothing comes out of this venture eventually except that they venture out to vent again. The long procession of bikes lined up on the road ready to move off at the end strangely looks like a kanji of headlights painted on a scroll of Zen calligraphy that points the 'middle road'. Something to meditate upon perhaps.";

	schema:reviewBody "lex de la Iglesia's As Luck Would Have It features in supporting roles Salma Hayek and Carolina Bang two of the most ravishing and talented Spanishlanguage actresses to ever grace the screen. Most viewers are well aware of Ms. Hayek who has aged gracefully into Hollywood's demeaning motherghetto for actresses over the age of 35. Few know of Ms. Bang who was the centerpiece of de la Iglesia's last film the criminallyinsane The Last Circus. Both command the screen with old school Hollywood glamour and mature sexuality and yet neither manages to obscure the machinations of de la Iglesia's sharp media satire. This as Queen once sang long ago is a kind of magic.Jose Mota is Roberto a onetime ad exec who hasn't had success in many moons. Unbeknownst to his supportive wife the couple are in dire financial straits Roberto long living off the reputation gained from an old Coca Cola slogan. Reduced to begging and groveling at his former bosses' knees Roberto soon realizes he has no job prospects. The cosmic joke of the film unspoken seems to be that Roberto seemingly bottomed out without a natural talent for advertising and whatever reputation he has garnered was a fluke. The irony of course is that these callous suits lack what the enterprising Roberto brings to the table courtesy of his Coke tagline the spark of life.Despondent Roberto flees to the location of his honeymoon with his wife where one absent minded misstep lands him on his back seriously injured but conscious. Lying on his back Roberto maintains his motor skills but he cannot move. He is impaled a sharp nail sticking out from the ground embedded in his head. Cops descend but none dare to pry him loose until medics provide a diagnosis they could remove Roberto from the nail but if he is pried loose in the wrong direction he will die. The story of Roberto's misfortunate circulates now attached to the circumstances. Soon a media circus erupts over his captive state reports circulating that his career had been failing and that he may have attempted suicide. The location de la Iglesia picks is not unintentional all parties involved realize he's fallen on somewhat sacred ground a landmark of sorts where Roberto's freedom could involve desecrating ancient ground. From Roberto's perspective as we see various onlookers and media outlets observe the area he occupies is shaped very much like ancient Coliseum bleachers. He has become the star of his own show the story of his death Ancient Romestyle. Wife Luisa Hayek eventually descends though she is soon swarmed by the vultures of the press among them Ms. Bang. As Roberto moves in and out of lucidity they fight over exclusive access both to an interview with him or her. The ghoulish lengths they'll go to procure official footage and soundbites overwhelms Luisa one reporter openly muses on a much higher cost for an interview if he were to die.De la Iglesia's setup hearkens back to Ace In The Hole but with a much more humanist bent with his life on the line Roberto immediately starts thinking dollar signs knowing the cynicism of the media can be exploited to finally give he and his wife the life that will please her. But Luisa is the film's heart and this attitude pierces her as she fights against the reporters' obvious interest in Roberto's possible death. De la Iglesia in the middle of what some may consider a careerlong roll continues his commitment to stark realistic humanity in heightened blackly comic situations. The absurdity of Roberto's predicament while handled with good humor is played with an entirely straight face  his argument as to whether Brad Pitt or George Clooney in a movie adaptation is as much a product of his pop culture cynicism as it is about his hopeful recontextualization of this unlucky scenario. There may be no boogeyman in sight but de la Iglesia uses Hitchcockian music cues and camera angles to emphasize the morbidity of Roberto constantly being moments away from death with surrounding onlookers subtly rooting for his demise. Mordantly funny and sharp as a razor As Luck Would Have It is one of the treasures of the Tribeca Film Festival.".

I find the similarities in both movies interesting in the way that some people will exploit either themselves As Luck Would Have It for gain or let someone exploit them A Star is Born for the same reason whether or not you realize that it's happing at the time.Here's two totally different movies with a similar theme. Reality TV does it all of the time in today's age but it's been going on since the dawn of humankind. There's no real reason why I wrote this but the was my observation.".

It was as a string of pearls a string of scenes so perfect so smooth in their sequencing that with the help of an impeccable photography and admirable soundtrack we got spell bounded from the beginning of this splendid movie to its brilliant ending a pathetic story almost unbearable to watch.Unbearable to watch thanks to the forceful interpretation of our protagonist couple Luisa Salma Hayek and Roberto Jos Mota who all of a sudden find out how tough and painful life can become in a matter of seconds.Roberto's desperation to find a job after months of fruitless interviews is the Gordian knot that plunges him and us into what will become a major film. The script construction is peerless as is the interpretation of every actor involved in the complicated choreography very difficult to film of this gem of a movie all encompassed by the hand of this genius Alex de la Iglesia.Only at the end of the projection we get the subliminal message given at the start of the movie behind the cast names and credits with takes that seem to be only background texture... and they tell you the whole story. Our string of pearls has a gorgeous diamond clasp. It loops the string with a superb finale showing us how deep is Luisa's love for her husband Roberto. It couldn't have had a better ending.".

There are moments of sadness but some of them could have been made a lot worse.The story isn't unique neither is The Notebook but it is executed in a way that makes you feel as though you're watching something new. Channing Tatum is the lovable beefcake reminiscent of Marky Mark and Amanda Seyfried is cute delivering well executed dialogue. And I did actually think they had good chemistry despite what other reviewers have said. Channing's John is an army boy who had a lot of issues growing up so you can't expect him to be overly forthcoming with his emotions.Richard Jenkins gives a great performance as the father and even Henry Thomas is likable as the neighbour I must be the only person in the world who hasn't seen E.T. so I didn't recognize the name at first.To me this was acted out a lot better and even structured better than Twilight New Moon which I assume is meant to appeal to the same audience. I know to some that isn't saying much but perhaps our expectations are a bit high these days. If you want to see a sweet love story with likable characters then you might just enjoy this film.".

I don't hate this type of film but I had heard mixed feelings on Dear John there were those who said it was touching and others who said it was too clichd. Well after been blown away by The Notebookbook and movie I saw Dear John. After seeing it I don't think it is as good as The Notebook but it was surprisingly good in my opinion. The characters are clichd and the beginning was a tad too fluffy for my liking while there are some pacing issues. But while the book is better having more depth and emotional punch I was surprised at how touching Dear John actually was. The story is nice and believable enough and there is some decent scripting. The direction is good too while the cinematography and scenery are breathtaking and the score beautiful. Channing Tatummy sister kept raving at how hot he was and Amanda Seyfried are great and are believable together while Richard Jenkins is heart breaking as Tatum's autistic fatherI immediately sympathised with him as I have real problems with communicating with people and feeling comfortable around people and places I am not familiar with. I also liked the ending it was ambiguous but also clever and subtle and I think an improvement over the ending of the bookthe book's only weak link. In conclusion touching and well made definitely worth a peek. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "In the spring of 2001 the Sergeant of the Special Forces John Tyree Channing Tatum meets the medical student Savannah Curtis Amanda Seyfried while surfing in Charleston during his leave and they immediately fall in love for each other. They spend a couple of weeks together and Savannah meets John's autistic father Mr. Tyree Richard Jenkins and John befriends her friend Tim Wheddon Henry Thomas. When the enlistment period of John and his platoon ends there are the attacks on the World Trade Center and John and the other soldiers decide to reenlist for two more years. John corresponds with Savannah until she stops writing and two months later Savannah tells that she will get married. I had great expectations with Dear John based on the previous works of the Swedish director Lasse Hallstrm. The beginning is nice with Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum showing great chemistry in a pleasant romance. The reenlistment of John Tyree is acceptable based on a troubled moment of his country. However the attitude of Savannah getting married with an older guy without any motive is inconsistent with her conservative profile and incoherent with the whole plot and destroys the so far good romance turning into a silly and disappointing soap opera. The terrible commercial last scene is corny and awful. My vote is three.Title BrazilQuerido John Dear John".

I don't know how I would have understood what was going on in the movie if I hadn't read the book.

That said there were a couple of scenes where the dialogue was sweet and funny. I also enjoyed the music but that may be because I'm a huge fan of acoustic. Also the scenery was absolutely beautiful. Not to mention Channing Tatum's body pretty much the only thing worth my money. As far as acting goes Channing Tatum was the stronger one in this film. While I'm still personally neutral about my opinion on Amanda Seyfried I found she's done better. She may be better off with comedy or musicals. And Richard Jenkins was lovable as always. If you've read the book don't expect anything similar to it. I can't point out a single scene that even resembled that of the book. Part II of the book especially was almost nonexistent. You will definitely be able to pick out the noticeable differences between the book and the film.

Throughout the movie was very slow moving and not very exciting but there were a couple emotional parts! So far the only people I've asked that did like the movie seem to be the younger ones 1215. This movie is definitely NOT comparable to The Notebook like some people have been saying. It was nothing special so I wouldn't watch it again but I'd say it's good for a chick flick night. Another one of those movies like that looked SO much better on the commercials.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Special Forces Army Sergeant John Tyree Channing Tatum is home on a twoweek leave from Germany. He meets Savannah Amanda Seyfried after he dives into the ocean to retrieve Savannah's purse that had fallen off the pier. John is smitten by Savannah and falls in love at first sight. Savannah is a college student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is on spring break and is helping build a house for Habitat for Humanity. John joins in with Savannah to help build the house. Along the way a budding romance occurs and Savannah falls deeply in love with John. As she is about to go back to college she promises to write John overseas during the next 12months until he returns to her after completing his enlistment. Their love is put to the test when John reenlists after the 911 attack.My Comment Dear John tells the story of what happens to young lovers when time and distance from each other begins to test their true love. Over the next several years they write love letters to each other telling everything about themselves. As time goes by Savannah finds another who needs her more than John even though she still loves him. She writes John a final letter saying goodbye. This is one story that happened many times during WWII and is still happening to our current soldiers today. Our brave soldiers are sacrificing their lives and some of them come home to heartbreaking consequences as a result of the war. That is why this story seems so real to the audience. The movie will make you laugh cry smile and relate to the characters. Women will like the movie because they can stand in Savannah's shoes. Men will like it because they know that it is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all. The story is truly touching with all of life's ups and downs. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are very good in their roles along with Richard Jenkins as John's father. Screen Gems Run Time 145 Rated PG13 610".

I had never really given any thought about how good or bad it might be because it was a night out with friends and I was unconcerned at the moment. Eventually we started to watch the movie. At first it was just dull. I mean I know it was trying to build up the characters and establish a good story line but I was a tad bit uninterested just because the characters were so plain at the time. Though it does set up things rather well it lacks in any really high appeal from the moment it comes on the screen if that makes sense.Anyway on to the rest of the movie. Though there were times when I was very interested it just overall was nothing special. The performances by each individual actor were extremely questionable. For instance Channing Tatum was unable to display any real sense of emotion except for maybe two scenes in the entire movie and Amanda Seyfried seemed like it was just too big of a role for her to play. While they both didn't do so hot separately I have to say the chemistry between them when they were on set together was believable intense and undeniably noteworthy Certainly the best thing about the movie in my opinion.I do give Dear John a decent and satisfactory rating for it really strived to be a poignant and strong film even though it fell a little short and I was moved at times by the feelings Channing and Amanda expressed into their characters though all together their performances were eh. It was interesting and entertaining and I enjoyed it... lightly. With all that said it again falls short of being rewatchable with it's extreme dullness throughout and lack of powerful independent likable performances. Not anything special but certainly not anything bad and I recommend you don't watch it with high expectations because you'll be very disappointed but if you're not an extreme critic and you're just looking to blow some time or are extremely hard up for Channing Tatum shirtless you can and will enjoy this in some way.".

Maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie but I thought it was so dull compared to the book.

Within the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other !. But he has to go off to war and she has to go to college. They do but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 911 happens. He wants to reenlistshe wants him to stay home. What will they do? Hysterically bad romantic drama. The leads ARE attractiveTatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body he's introduced walking shirtless out of the water after surfing...but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries...but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it me and a friend of mine were fighting hard NOT to laugh out loud at some of the romantic dialogue at the beginning. It was just HORRIBLE. For the first hour or so I was either bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous romance. Then after that first hour tragedy kicks in and I must admit had me in tears. However the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that you're crying with death funerals and meetings with people breaking down in tears. How can you NOT cry? This would have worked if the acting were better. Tatum's face never changes expressionnot ONCE! He always had a blank look on his face. Seyfried was a LITTLE better but not much. To make it worse Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on screen at all! They barely looked like they liked each other let alone love each other. There was some beautiful photography of the Carolinas but this is a boring and stupid romantic drama. A 1 all the way...and I usually love silly romantic dramas like this!".

I have hated a lot of movies I do not hate this one but I rally really really did not like it. In fact I disliked it so much that I had to write a review. So. NB! This review contains SPOILERS do not continue reading if you do not want to know what happens. This movie absolutely made no sense at all. The only good part was the emotional scene with John and his father otherwise this was just completely crap. I mean what? What happened?!? For starters as a man who has worked in the military for several years if you find yourself in a combat situation where someone is firing bullets at you you NEVER just stand straight up like John did when he got shot! Yes he was hurt during a combat situation and that is sad but did it have to happen like that? It was just so meaningless! And WHY did she even break it off? I didn't understand it the explanation was just so lame! I can understand that she wanted to be there for Tim and Allan but we never got any indication that there were any romantic feelings there so why marry the guy? Couldn't she just BE there without the marriage? Looking at the film as a whole the character development was nearly nonexistent and I never cared for any of the characters. The script was bad and the time jumps were even worse. It was hard to keep up with how many years had gone by and the story just made no sense.As a side note I also find it highly unlikely that she did not know what happened with Johns dad. I will say it again none of this made any sense!I have been in a long distance relationship where my man was employed in the army and shipped off to distant and terrifying places. I never knew what was happening and I was always scared for him. This was 45 years ago and I was hoping that this film would touch upon some of the things that I felt and that I know my honey felt. But Dear John just did not cut it! They did not capture any real emotions except maybe the scene with John and his dad and I am deeply disappointed. I am a moviecrier I cry a lot when I see emotional films but THIS film only made me angry with all the lost potential. This was just not worth seeing. My review had more emotions than this film. 110 and really not recommended at all.".

It felt real and it really hit home for me because It felt like true love to me. Some movie buffs might find this movie to be too corny or rather contrived but I'm a sucker for some good romance a rare bird as far as guys go. The story was very well done and held my attention throughout. But what really made the movie for me was the chemistry between Tatum and Seyfried. Channing isn't the world's greatest actor but he showed a lot of promise here. I also found the war scenes to be quite realistic and well done even if there wasn't very many. I went into Dear John. Thinking it was gonna be your typical Romdrama that they seem to put out these days. To my surprise it's fairly intelligent romantic and wonderfully emotional I enjoyed my time with it.Performances. Channing Tatum still has work to do but he was actually solid here for the most part. He had a few wooden moments with that somewhat annoying blank expression on his face but his effort was clearly there. He's growing up. Amanda Seyfried is delightful in her role. We are able to feel for her character and become very attracted to her charming ways. She was especially good near the end. Richard Jenkins was the heart of the movie for me. His autistic performance was truly a sight to behold and I really did feel for him. His hospital moment with Tatum was heartbreaking and heartfelt. Henry Thomas is excellent as the goodhearted yet Weaslish Tim.Bottom line. Dear John was a very pleasant surprise for me. It's just a very nice romantic movie that I think even guys like me could get into if in the right frame of mind. Grab your wife girlfriend or whatever love interest you have and enjoy.810".

So I was looking forward to this tale of an Army man named John Channing Tatum falling for a college girl named Savannah Amanda Seyfried. There were also some compelling supporting characters in John's father Richard Jenkins and a neighbor friend of Savannah's named Tim Henry Thomas who can still deliver years after his breakthrough as Elliott in E.T.. Now I've only just found out about the changes from the novel but while watching the movie I was emotionally enthralled by the whole thing and for the most part I was satisfied by what I saw. Also how cool was it to see Ms. Seyfried sing and play guitar to her own composition here especially after her recent stint in Mamma Mia!

	schema:headline " Dear Nicholas Dear Lasse thanks for giving us such a lovely film!";
	schema:reviewBody "John Tyree Channing Tatum is on leave from the U.S.Army's special forces. It is the summer of 2001 and he has returned to his father Richard Jenkins and home on the Carolina coast. On the beach one day a group of young adults are horsing around and a purse falls in the ocean. It belongs to beautiful Savannah Amanda Seyfried and she is upset over its loss. Without hesitation John dives into the water finds it and returns it to her. She is happy although one of her companions a male with an interest in Savannah is less than content. Nevertheless from that moment the two begin a tentative relationship. John tells Savannah that he will be out of the army in about a year and asks that she wait for him. Although they only share a few kisses the young couple are in love. However they part vowing to write to each other often. Complicating things is the fact that John's dad is autistic relating poorly to the community and so is the son of Savannah's attractive neighbor Tim Henry Thomas. Savannah communicates well with each of them but John does not. Then 911 occurs and John feels he must reenlist knowing his unit needs him. On a very brief leave Savannah and John spend a few precious hours together. But then John is gone. What does their future hold? This is surprisingly a most lovely film and worthy of praise. A story that could have been melodramatic and trite is instead genuinely moving. The cast is quite nice with Tatum and Seyfried making a fine couple while Jenkins and Thomas deliver especially notable turns. The scenery costuming production values and Nicholas Sparks' tale are good as well. Most importantly Hallstrom mixes things up and uses some very interesting camera shots and scene arrangements to deliver a film of great style. Dear viewer don't think this is another teen flick with little to offer for the general public. On the contrary most fans of romantic drama will find it enthralling.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.'  a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space who is stranded on earth and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life the difference between good and evil and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant it turns out is a weapon who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious and timely gun control message but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering albeit somewhat blunted by the ending.  The animation is gorgeous Michael Kamen's score is perfect and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed the word is getting around about what a magical film this is and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.  See it now so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did.".

It respects the audience's intelligence it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz and best of all it balances fantasy well science fiction with believability.  I think Warner Brothers animation has outDisneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean understated animation.  What a concept!The story is deceptively simple Iron Giant falls from the sky at the dawn of the Space Race and befriends a young boy.  But within that framework we get a double story one for the grown ups and one for the kids but the message is essentially the same one paranoia and violence begets violence. I appreciate very much as others who have commented that no one burst into incongruous song and that there were no cutesy animal sidekicks.  I should add that there were no clever yet implausible plot twists nor were there any stock characters.  The bad guy gets a little overheated true but he is never the embodiment of all things evil.  The townspeople are your average small town Americans not bumpkins.  Mom is well momish caring but neither shrewish nor prone to whimpering outbursts.  And our hero is plucky but not annoyingly precocious.A BIG plus for this film is how well it weds the computer animation to the handdrawn animation a feat that the Big Mouse hasn't mastered yet.  Even as recently as Tarzan it is glaringly apparent what parts are computer graphics and which aren't and the contrast is very distracting. The Iron Giant makes a virtue of streamlined animation that draws your eye to the beauty of its color and motion.It was a very VERY distinct and unusual pleasure to be treated to a film such as this.  Give us more . . . please!".

Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eyepopping moments but there are also scenes of great wonderment pathos and humour that only topdrawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues another huge break from Disney.  No scene is wasted in this film either every set piece even the really funny ones helps either to establish the world of the movie or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.The Iron Giant is funny exhilarating and touching as well.  It's sad to see it failing at the box office as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully though wordofmouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  Repeat as necessary.P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing this movie I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent funny touching and visually superb and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A computeranimated or B based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best Americanmade children's movies I have seen in a decade 8.510.0Now I'm a 17yearold who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends critics and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird director of The Incredibles a personal favorite. After watching it I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children and herself watch this.The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s smalltown America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodnessknowswhere. He befriends the robot while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend. This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are welldone and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly though is the animation which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are welldrawn especially the Giant who through terrific design lifelike movements and clever small touches i.e. the eyes seems both alien and human imposing and childlike. Furthermore the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so wellcomplimented by the animation. The script written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies it is still very original and clever.One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie the main moral of the story about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up including standard sentimental climax does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident and his ultimate message about heroes variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles is relevant and sincere. However I do have to say that the secondary moral about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist the government agent and the military are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie the second of which I do not deny I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America with jokes as well as valuable lessons about duck and cover and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.On a final note I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard but more importantly it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember including Bambi closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did.".

	schema:headline " An Absolute Wonder Which Cherishes Its Influences  The Best Animated Feature Ever !";
	schema:reviewBody "Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids but are still very watchable even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is to put it mildly incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.This is a movie with a heart the size of the title character.  A gentle gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy.  The kid has a single mother voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston and he is just looking for a friend whether it be a squirrel or even a 50 foot tall machine.  The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T.  One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth.  E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth.  Here it is animated and almost just as effective.IRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine.  The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth.  Liveaction scifi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of dangerous alien life and our efforts to destroy it.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons.  Ultimately the characters in that classic learn from the extraterrestrial being and realize the dangers of the ABomb.  It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.A beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great handdrawn film.  Here we see both handdrawn imagery coupled with a computergenerated iron giant.  The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally mixed with the 2D action surrounding him.  There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment.  At one point he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink.  I guess robots must blink too.  Enough analysis.  I loved this movie.  It is ranked 81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason.  Not only is it escapist fantastic entertainment for kids adults and seniors alike it is an animated picture like no other.  It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO the commentary of 1950's science fiction and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel.  Do not miss this enchanting flick.RATING ".

I've seen it several times and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.Analytically I find the animation incredible.  The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic not because of incredible drawing well actually yes the way the characters are drawn and animated is incredible.  From the jerking swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation.  The backgrounds are wonderfully lush and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is.  I love animation and I love good looking landscapes so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.I admire analytically most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film the season sublty changes from fall to winter the characters are always doing something even if they aren't directly in focus the best adlibbing a director could dream of I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense also the duck and cover sceneYou know I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that very few can do that to us but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.The animation and expression of emotion in the giant who is a computer graphics animated character a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions.  There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions.  The director Brad Bird I think should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life.  The giant was very organic and fluid always animated and extremely alive without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.It's hard not to give away details when you write a lot but thankfully I haven't really given anything away.  I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with big or small and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship love and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded enriching thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade.  I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment.  I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me.  Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie.  Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie.  I've shown it to a LOT of people college students mostly of all races and religions with different prides and prejudices the result amazingly always seems to be the same I have some after movie comments here and I quoteWow!  That was NICE! That was SO...GOOD! That giant is crucial dog! It was good...yeah...I liked it! and Dang man that joint TIGHT!.  If you actually read this review all the way that's nice. Now forget everything I bumbled about and go see this movie that way you can spent less time writing your own review than you did reading mine.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Good Fun For Anyone";
	schema:reviewBody "It's nice to see an elegantly crafted piece of animation come out of America.  How did they manage it?  The writing is great the animation is excellent and the voice acting is superb.  I don't think I've liked an English animated film this much since The Plague Dogs.  The film doesn't talk down to it's audience and instead tells a simple story very well.  My only complaint would be that Hogarth is somewhat of a smartalec at times but I guess this is the era of Leave it To Beaver.Many of the situations are standard moviefare the exlax in the food the helmet on the bed but it's nice to see them in an animated film for a change.  As an anime fan the realism of the movie didn't impress me as much as the quality of the writing voice acting and the music and sound effects.  I particularly remember the sound of the power lines snapping and the musical score building up to the climax of the film.The character design for the giant is excellent it's amazing how they could draw out very subtle emotions without noticeably distorting the face.  I bawled like a baby near the end.Finally most importantly for me there are NO CHEAP LAUGHS in the movie. One of the best moments in the movie for me was when Hogarth is running through the woods and he slams his face into a low branch.  The theater full of kids raised on recent Disney crap bursts into laughter but wait there's no stupid sound effect he's not hopping back up to his feet instantly with a ridiculous lump or distorted face or little birds flying around his head he's still on the ground ... and what's that coming out of his nose.. it CAN'T BE.. it IS a trickle of BLOOD.  The kids and parents quickly cease their laughter.  I couldn't stop smiling because I knew then that like me they actually cared about the character on the screen and frankly that doesn't happen very often.Tarzan was a small step in the right direction and near the end of the long path beginning with that step is The Iron Giant.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's nice to see an elegantly crafted piece of animation come out of America.  How did they manage it?  The writing is great the animation is excellent and the voice acting is superb.  I don't think I've liked an English animated film this much since The Plague Dogs.  The film doesn't talk down to it's audience and instead tells a simple story very well.  My only complaint would be that Hogarth is somewhat of a smartalec at times but I guess this is the era of Leave it To Beaver.Many of the situations are standard moviefare the exlax in the food the helmet on the bed but it's nice to see them in an animated film for a change.  As an anime fan the realism of the movie didn't impress me as much as the quality of the writing voice acting and the music and sound effects.  I particularly remember the sound of the power lines snapping and the musical score building up to the climax of the film.The character design for the giant is excellent it's amazing how they could draw out very subtle emotions without noticeably distorting the face.

	schema:reviewBody "Having to compete with Disney Dreamworks and Pixar Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters including the giant were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.Brad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon marks his feature film debut and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement part satire and part family fare but contains more substance then most children's films containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston works late shifts at a local diner his father has been killed presumably in combat as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade finds himself lonely and misunderstood.On a stormy night a mysterious object crashes off the coast which to Hogarth's surprise and everyone's for that matter is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy he befriends the behemoth stashing him away in a local scrap yard who the owner voiced by Harry Connick Jr. is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed a federal agent brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.The scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious one sequence after the giant loses his hand which can walk on its own once severed our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement but don't let this turn you off either.Bird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained issues such as morality and death and explores the human gift of free will as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.The Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999 if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world or any dare I say it beyond this Earth.Read all my reviews at httpwww.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all an outstanding film that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 1010 Bethany Cox".

Perhaps Hogarth is portrayed as too obvious a scamp and Kent is too overthetop in his zeal but the subtlety in the Iron Giant's limited movements and vocabulary more than make up for it. In any case this is an animated film  we should expect cartoonish characters right? Perhaps it was the total lack of cutesy animals doing Disneyesque songanddance numbers but I found myself noticing the acting of these characters. Don't worry I snapped out of it soon enough...Unlike some I didn't see TIG as a slam against militarism. In fact the General here nicely voiced by John Mahoney shows a considerable amount of balance. Rather the film is about personal growth and change respect for life values and the bond of friendship. This side of the film works so well that the Giant's utterance of one word  Superman  toward the end of the film sent me searching for the tissues. word of advice keep them handy.Do yourself and your kids and watch this film. Appropriate IMO for ages 3 and over including adults!.".

I was a bit disappointed though that the giant didn't have more to say. It would of been nice to know were he came from and why. I had no idea at all that the voice of the giant is Vin Diesel! I would never of thought that he would do anything like this. Just goes to show how many actors are typecast. I got quite tearful at the end especially when the giant says his last line about being Superman. I mean this is ludicrous! A grown woman crying over what is basically a cartoon!!! Maybe a sequel to this film could happen?If you haven't seen it yet please make an effort to do so.".

At least I like to think so.The giant is drawn not by a human animator  instead it is a threedimensional model created in the computer. The computer then renders' the 2D image according to directions. The resulting figure is assembled in a scene that has handdrawn human characters. In a very real sense this character of a robot is acted by a robot while the human characters are acted' drawn by humans.As with all cartoony films the voices are what you really see' so far as the drama. But in terms of the images  which is what all film experiences are about  what you really see is a conflict among the religions of animators very much like what you see on the screen. That it is set in a precomputer but postnuclear age  that the lines drawn are not ones of coexistence but of good and evil  says a lot about Bird's take on all this. A very intimate and effective film on filmmaking. Probably shouldn't be on IMDB's science fiction' list though.".

Maybe they could have made the moral more reasonable i.e. gun's can be good if used defensively but I guess that would have  spoiler alert!!  made the ending far less dramatic   a blast from one of the robot's lasers would probably have sufficed.I saw Iron Giant a few weeks after release and the theater was sadly almost empty.  Wordofmouth and critic reviews have been very good so I guess we would have to chalk it up to poor marketing.  Hope this doesn't sour Hollywood on an alternative to the standard Disney formula.Its no Beauty and the Beast but I would still give it a solid 7.510.

There is really not much you can say about it except to wait until it comes out on Netflix and even then it will hard to watch. Honestly I can't believe that after the movie company watched this movie they had the nerve to release it. In my opinion this would hurt your reputation as a Film maker more than helping by a long shot. There is a considerable difference in the quality of this Scary movie and the others none of the original cast appear in the movie and it seems to be based mostly on paranormal activity the set becomes very stagnant. My son said that the actual paranormal activity was funnier. My son loves the Scary movie brand he said this one would give the franchise a bad name and he would give it a 2 if he could.This is a good reason to use Pirate Bay. The public is certainly being ripped off by paying for this kind of crap.Anyone who gives this movie a positive review should be suspect.

I'm not sure exactly what went wrong with this one but I enjoyed the last 4 a lot more. Given that the 4th one was reaching a new level of stupidity it was still 10x more funnier than the 5th. I regret paying 10 to watch this. This is the 2nd time in two weeks that I have made the mistake to pay money to see a stupid movie that ended up making me completely question why I go to the movies. Hollywood needs to wake up. Just because you can charge people money to see a movie doesn't mean you should. Certain movies do not belong at the movie theater and this one should have been on that list. The director should have never let this movie leave their studio and for the sake of all of the actors someone there should have stopped this movie from being produced. Again  I enjoyed the first 4 but I am now done with the Scary Movie saga. Enough is enough this is just insulting. You can easily tell that even the highest paid actors like Charlie Sheen and that chick from Modern Family put on a massive layer of suck in their roles. Are we all getting that lazy now days that we are going to record ourselves doing a horrible job posting it to the world and expecting money to come rolling in? I think the writers of Scary Movie should delete this one and make a new Scary Movie 5. The next one that comes out will only be watched on DVD.".

I had read reviews and knew it was bad but being so infatuated with film and theater I actually wanted to see the movie to diagnose exactly what made it so horrible. Insult me if you must but I have a lot of free time on my hands and I love all kinds of movies.I'm not gonna lie I went into the theater with the hope that on some slight chance I would enjoy the film. Wrong. The movie was so boring and tasteless that I was actually distracted with my phone for some parts during the film which is of the utmost rarity for me. The horrible acting and line delivery dried this film out so much that I don't know where to begin. Ashley Tisdale was definitely not as good as Anna Faris was and obviously everyone will compare the two. I hate to admit it but Mac Miller Snoop Dogg and Katt Williams all could have made audiences laugh with the material they were given but were just too dry. Admittedly there were some very rare parts of the movie that had a somewhat witty humor to it but it was only once or twice and weak at that. The rest of the stupid slapstick humor was just so lame and dragging. Slapstick humor should stay within the PG level of humor for the kids. On that note the movie had overly crude and just STUPID sexual humor that was just stupid and weak. Even hard R teenage sex comedies are more sophisticated than this. I laughed maybe one time and it wasn't even a laugh. I kinda exhaled sharply while smiling. Overall there was almost no sophisticated or witty humor horrid acting and it was all just plain bad. So yes the reviews are correct it was horrible. The only reason I give it a 3 instead of a 1 was because hundreds and hundreds of people put months and months of work into an 85 minute piece of what they thought was art and giving a movie a 1 or maybe a 2 is too disrespectful to the art that is film. But then again this movie is pretty disrespectful to the art that is film as well.".

The latest instalment in the series of lazy spoofs not including some unforgivable side projects including Date Movie and Epic Movie this film offers virtually nothing to its audience insulting their intelligence for an hourandahalf with perhaps the worst collection of blatantly uninspired and recycled gags ever put to celluloid.The film's horrendous excuse for a plot centres on a suburban wife Ashley Tisdale and her dimwitted husband Simon Rex moving into a haunted house with their possessed adopted children. From there the film brings its staple of parodying the biggest blockbusters of the last few years but does so without a semblance of relevance creativity or wit. It says a lot about the film that the only halflaughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan sharing the opening scene an incredibly stupid and borderline cringeworthy but inexplicably entertaining chuckle at their fall from grace. It's all downhill from there though as the rest of the film plays out as a series of unconnected set pieces seen literally hundreds of times before. Often such an unappealing movie is still able to salvage some hope by suiting itself for a target market but it is hard to see any audience group from 15 yearolds to stoners defending this abomination.One would have to drink Lindsay under the table smoke copious amounts of bud with Snoop Dogg andor Lion and snort pure tiger blood with Charlie to even come close to drawing any semblance of enjoyment from this disaster. An imminent sweep of this year's Razzies doesn't seem like ironic punishment enough for one of the worst films ever made.There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsisiprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication I'd also love to hear from you.".

In addition to that it's dumb meanspirited and in poor taste and I think you're going to agree with me about that even if you like stuff that is in poor taste. I mean this is basically an exploitation film for weed and gangsta rapobsessed 13yearolds. It covers all the bases sex scene involving clowns and ponies sex scene involving pool cleaning machines dildo collections being found by small children things getting stuck up dogs' anuses a scene featuring Snoop Dogg or Snoop Lion or whatever he insists that people call him now and a giant blunt etc. Wow this is multiplex entertainment in 2013?I saw the first Scary Movie and thought it was pretty amusing in places. I'm also a huge fan of totally absurd slapstick comedies like Airplane and the Naked Gun movies. What is it exactly that makes this film so awful where the others at least on some level succeeded? I can't think of any way to explain it except this watching Scary MoVie is the film equivalent of eating White Castle sliders for an hour and a half washing them down with a gallon of Mountain Dew topping it all off with seven pounds of cheesecake and then doing the Mentos and Coke thing featured in this film incidentally so you can projectilepuke the stuff you just ate all over your friends who were expecting it and think it's funny. Truly honestly that's the caliber of stuff you're going to subject yourself to for 90 minutes if you insist on watching this.The movie tries to make fun of Inception Black Sawn Evil Dead etc. but it seems to me that you have to actually be smarter than something if you want to effectively make fun of it. Instead they should make a movie that makes fun of all the Scary Movie movies. Honestly they should be pretty easy targets. This movie does not have the minimum level of intelligence required to comment about anything at all. The best it can do is make peehole jokes and try to get the audience to laugh at monkeys flinging poo at the wall. No it's really not funny.I'm racking my brains trying to recall if there was anything at all good about this film. I do remember laughing at a couple of the gags. That sex scene with clowns and ponies was actually somewhat amusing  there I said it. I'm afraid this review is going to come off the wrong way because it sounds like I refuse to watch stuff that pushes boundaries of good taste. Hardly man. I even liked Videodrome which Roger Ebert called nauseating. The real problem is that this film uses boundarypushing as an excuse to be stupid. In reality it's about as intelligent as a stoned middle school dropout incidentally the only type of person I can imagine enjoying this.I was about to start getting depressed about the state of the world given that this kind of obvious dog dookie is considered entertainment but it doesn't seem that other people found it all that entertaining either. I watched at least two couples walk out of the theater before the end of the film so ultimately I'm concluding that there's probably some reason to have hope about the future of this planet. Thanks Scary MoVie! Not that there's anything to be thankful for except that no one actually came up to me and hit me in the head with a shovel while the film was playing. They'll probably include that in part six.".

I can't even compare it to any other movie because its not the bad jokes that make this horrible.... its how it was made. There are some occasional Black Swan parody moments that actually are indicative of what a parody should be and are shockingly presented well. However that is probably a minute out of the film. Characters appear with no explanation of who they are and then almost never seen again. Most of the dialogue in this film is ADR and a lot doesn't even match the mouth of the actors. Also a large percentage of this movie is basically fast forwarded which is supposed to be funny or the characters driving in an obviously fake model toy car. Everything is just thrown at the screen just as much as feces is thrown at a wall in this movie with no plot. You get the feeling that half of the movie was replaced with newly made footage which they just shoved in there without trying to put it in a cohesive way. It comes across as an exercise in poor filmmaking at its finest. A truly horrible excuse of film that should never have been released in theaters. The Weinsteins should be embarrassed. The only way this could have been remotely watchable is if they stuck with an entire Black Swan parody. Nothing here feels like you're watching a film. Incredibly poorly done and edited. It's so bizarre. There is an entire scene with pool cleaners having sex with each other. I don't even know what I just watched. So this is not a godawful movie because the jokes are horrible which they are it stands out as almost an achievement in one of the most horribly put together theatrical releases of quite some time.

All I will say is KEEP YOUR MONEY this was 15 that I could have spent on something worth while. I actually spent more time looking at my watch than I did the movie because it was just that awful. Malcom Lee you must really needed the money because this movie sucked!!! I am so used to seeing very funny skits with the previous scary movies. In my opinion this movie series has been going to the dogs ever since the Wayans Brothers stop contributing to the funny nature of this series. Also the movie is more sexual in content than I would have liked and I really believe it should have been Rated R instead of PG13. The acting is very poor in this movie and you would think with the actors that were involved you would have expected it to be very humorous. I cant tell you how long the movie was because after an hour I just couldn't take it anymore so my wife and I walked out of the movie.".

Also the movie is more sexual in content than I would have liked and I really believe it should have been Rated R instead of PG13. The acting is very poor in this movie and you would think with the actors that were involved you would have expected it to be very humorous. I cant tell you how long the movie was because after an hour I just couldn't take it anymore so my wife and I walked out of the movie.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Scary MoVie";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought after some days of hectic work I'd pick the funniest film on release this week to laugh my rear off but unfortunately Scary Movie 5 turns in a disappointing form with the Wayan brothers abandoning their franchise for A Haunted House instead. Despite having David Zucker in a writing capacity this installment seems finally to have run out of steam in its longrunning franchise one which took the horror films in between them and give them the spoof treatment. And the lack of material shows despite the seven year absence having to touch nonhorror films as well given the wafer thin content upon which to draw inspiration from and to make fun of.And you would think that their crowning glory having the two Tinseltown folks who can't seem to get out of trouble and the wrong side of the limelight  Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan  would be a tad interesting but it's not. Both look like they were in it for the paycheck and couldn't care less to ham it up a little.

	onyx:emotionText "I thought after some days of hectic work I'd pick the funniest film on release this week to laugh my rear off but unfortunately Scary Movie 5 turns in a disappointing form with the Wayan brothers abandoning their franchise for A Haunted House instead. Despite having David Zucker in a writing capacity this installment seems finally to have run out of steam in its longrunning franchise one which took the horror films in between them and give them the spoof treatment. And the lack of material shows despite the seven year absence having to touch nonhorror films as well given the wafer thin content upon which to draw inspiration from and to make fun of.And you would think that their crowning glory having the two Tinseltown folks who can't seem to get out of trouble and the wrong side of the limelight  Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan  would be a tad interesting but it's not. Both look like they were in it for the paycheck and couldn't care less to ham it up a little. The jokes they partook in were really bad with absolutely nothing to laugh at or about and if they were to think they have a second career as comedians they just might want to think again given their lack of comic timing.No spoof of any horror film today would be without the Paranormal Activity style of video cameras being mounted almost everywhere with the playback naturally being remotely hilarious especially when people tend to miss the whole point of what they were hoping to see.

	schema:reviewBody "Look I'm not going to sit here and try to explain and justify my enjoyment of the first four entries in the longrunning Scary Movie series. It's trash in every capacity plain and simple. Cynical trendy trash that only seeks to quickly capitalize on whatever is new or hip with filmgoing crowds through only the most base and lowestcommon of denominators. Not a single film in the franchise could be called art. And yet... I get a kick out of them. Particularly the second and third films which were actually very amusing. They may be trash but they're fun trash. Enjoyable trash. Entertaining trash. Trash with a charming cast and just enough chuckles to make them worth a go on a slow rainy day at home. Yeah you'll feel your IQ dropping during some of the stupider moments of those previous films but they were never so bad as to be offensive or outright dismissed. Then there's Scary Movie 5. ...whelp this series was fun while it lasted I guess.I'll level with you. This is one of those very rare occasions where even trying to force myself to watch a movie in order to be able to write a fair and balanced IMDb review I just couldn't. I honestly was unable to. I had to start skimming through because the film was making me angry. Furious even. How could a series that was honestly never more than just silly broad parody fall so hard so quickly? It's shocking just how aggressively unfunny and tedious a film this is. Even by the midway point of the opening scene a brutally prolonged Paranormal Activity parody involving Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to make a sex tape the humor had been completely sapped and it was running on fumes.And this downward spiral only continued with each passing scene every awkwardly contrived popculture reference and all the nonsensical attempts at lampooning thenrecent releases. Essentially a melding of Mama Paranormal Activity the rebooted Planet of the Apes series and Black Swan with a smattering of plot elements from other major films the storyline is a fundamental mess with only the most tenuous of connections to string together the constant barrage of shockingly dead on arrival humor. Yes you could argue that the fourth film's combination of Saw The Grudge and War of the Worlds was messy and contrived... but at least it tried. This one can't even muster up the energy to do that.Story goes that the production was a bit of a mess with upwards of half the film being hastily rewritten reshot and reedited during last minute pickups barely two months before release without the participation of original and solely credited director Malcolm D. Lee. And it shows. Badly. Even giving it the biggest cut of slack I can it feels like a mishmash of several different visions and just stinks of a perplexing combination of apathy and desperation. I have a feeling you can tell which scenes were reshot and which were in the original version as the tone and feeling will radically change from scene to scene. Some scenes feel like soulless attempts at patching together jokes whereas others feel like everyone was trying... way too hard. And as a result it comes off disjointed and honestly just uncomfortable to watch.Even the return of Simon Rex in a starring role after his turn as a supporting character in the previous two films albeit as a new character here can't save this trainwreck... and I'm one of the people who actually really enjoyed his work in those films as the lovable goofball. Then again he's the only returning costar of any previous films with series leads Anna Faris and Regina Hall the two beating hearts of the entire series having long since jumped ship. So I don't know what I expected. If the franchise film can't even attract the attention of its own lead cast members and instead has to upgrade a smaller supporting cast member to be the new star it's usually not the best of signs.While it may not be quite as condescending and grating as say... a Seltzerberglevel parody there's just no salvaging any laughs here. It's a confused contrived unfunny and even uncomfortable experience trying to watch Scary Movie 5 and try as I might... I couldn't do it. It's up there with Going Overboard and Fat Slags The Movie as one of the most inherently unwatchable comedies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.I really have no other choice but to give Scary Movie 5 a tragic 1 out of 10. It's a shame.".

Chow supplies the gang with guns to prove he is one of them' however as the job approaches a special unit of the police begins to close in on the gang and put Chow at risk.I didn't watch this film because it was the inspiration for Reservoir Dogs. No I watched it because I'm a big Chow Yun Fat fan and I'm watching some of his films to get me in the mood for BulletProof Monk.  This film is a really good introduction to Hong Kong style the focus is very much on the style without too much in the way of underlying currents and such.  For information Reservoir Dogs really only focuses on the final part of the film whereas Longhu Fengyun covers longer story where we always know who the cop is.  This takes away a little bit from the thrills but the film makes it up with style.Everyone has cool sunglasses the direction is slick and the action moves quite well.  The final standoff is good but generally the film is quite exciting and moves along smoothly.  Chow Yun Fat is a great star and here he shows why he is such a big star.  He has emotional depth yet is comical and likeable he is tough and an action star but yet he is not some distant musclebound hunk that is outside of reality.  The rest of the cast are all good but it is difficult to judge performances when it is all subtitled I find it hard anyway however there are no weak links.Overall this is a stylish thriller from Hong Kong.  It is stylish but doesn't fall into the HK formula with slowmo and such.  Don't watch it because you're a Tarantino fan  watch it because it's a solid crime thriller in it's own right.".

	schema:headline " Ringo Lam's gangster thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Ringo Lam's perhaps most famous and influential film is this CITY ON FIRE from 1987. It was Quentin Tarantino's inspiration for his Reservoir Dogs 1992 and Quentin wanted to express his admiration and passion for Hong Kong film makers and their films by updating Lam's themes for his debut film. Reservoir is definitely not any rip off like some have suggested it a tribute. Chow YunFat plays cop Chow who has traumatic past as he betrayed his criminal friend to the police force. Danny Lee plays criminal boss Fu whose gang is terrorizing the town with numerous robberies and the forthcoming big robbery of a jewelry store. Chow and Fu become friends as Chow's mission is again to go undercover to Fu's gang and give details to the police about the robbery so the criminals could be arrested and sent to jail. Unfortunately Chow notices it is too late to undo what he's done again and again he finds himself betraying a friend but this time the results are more horrific.The theme of the film is friendship and loyalty between two people at opposite sides of the law. Chow and Fu start to like each other and more importantly Fu starts to trust Chow who in this case isn't a trustworthy friend. The end scene again is pretty harrowing as Fu learns the truth and Chow gets to know the price. Two years later Danny Lee and Chow YunFat would play similar roles in John Woo's The Killer 1989 in which Lee is the cop and Chow the criminalkiller. These themes are very usual in Hong Kong action thrillers in which people love and value their friends and are ready to die for them.  City on Fire is pretty gritty and violent gangster depiction and the finale in the storehouse is the film's most memorable and stunning segment. The lightning and blue color is used to the maximum effect and it gives the kind of punch only Hong Kong cinema seems to be able to give. Never have I seen such a strong use of atmospheric smoke and blue than in these Hong Kong films and the finale of CITY ON FIRE is as gorgeous looking as the scenes in Danny Lee's true crime thriller Dr. Lamb 1992. CITY ON FIRE however suffers a little because of weak characters and that especially Chow isn't too well written and doesn't act as believably as possible. For example the difficulties he has with his girlfriend are not handled too carefully as we don't know does Chow love her and want to live with her or not. Occasionally he seems to be in love with her but then he may leave her waiting for him hours and seems not to understand what she's so sad for. Their relationship should have been more carefully and deeper written. Also the scene in the restaurant when Chow informs about his willingness to delay their wedding because of his mission is almost unbearably cold and unemotional as the girl visibly suffers and cries inside and doesn't even get a proper answer or reason for this from Chow. Not very well written scene at all.Also I'm little irritated by the fact that the gunshot wound in the stomach is depicted so unpainfully. Tim Roth suffers the whole Reservoir Dogs's running time with a bullet in his stomach and that is definitely a realistic depiction of such a horrific result of violence. In CITY ON FIRE the character without spoiling just sits there and holds his tummy a little and seems not to bleed or suffer at all. There should have been little more realism as was in Tarantino's film. Otherwise the brief gun battles and acts of violence are realistic and not glorified when bullets hits a person he most likely dies as in real life too. CITY ON FIRE isn't a so called bullet ballet film with huge amount of gun play action and the violence in CITY ON FIRE is brutal and remorseless and never without its consequences.I give CITY ON FIRE 710 and it is still very remarkable film because its interesting themes and the gorgeous atmospheric finale which should be seen in big screen because this film like many others suffers and loses its power when seen on video and small TV screen. Ringo Lam is among my favorite Hong Kong directors and his real unbelievable masterpiece FULL CONTACT 1992 starring again Chow finally established him among the greatest Hong Kong directors and in the action genre at the same position with John Woo.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ringo Lam's perhaps most famous and influential film is this CITY ON FIRE from 1987. It was Quentin Tarantino's inspiration for his Reservoir Dogs 1992 and Quentin wanted to express his admiration and passion for Hong Kong film makers and their films by updating Lam's themes for his debut film. Reservoir is definitely not any rip off like some have suggested it a tribute. Chow YunFat plays cop Chow who has traumatic past as he betrayed his criminal friend to the police force. Danny Lee plays criminal boss Fu whose gang is terrorizing the town with numerous robberies and the forthcoming big robbery of a jewelry store. Chow and Fu become friends as Chow's mission is again to go undercover to Fu's gang and give details to the police about the robbery so the criminals could be arrested and sent to jail. Unfortunately Chow notices it is too late to undo what he's done again and again he finds himself betraying a friend but this time the results are more horrific.The theme of the film is friendship and loyalty between two people at opposite sides of the law.

John Woo's films and his subsequent transplant to Hollywood is probably the most publicized outcome of the phenomenon but there are other more obscure directors and films that have guided some of today's action film success stories.Ringo Lam is a contemporary of John Woo and it seems that his 1987 film CITY ON FIRE  was an inspiration if not outandout ripoff source material for Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS. Tarantino certainly borrowed heavily from the film lifting several key plot points and even action sequences. It seems that Tarantino's talent lies not in originality but in his ability to tell a story in a nonlinear fashion as evidenced by his reworking of various elements into a tale told in flashback and implication. Chow Yun Fat the ubiquitous star of the John Woo films A BETTER TOMORROW THE KILLER and HARD BOILED plays Ko Chow a layabout petty criminal railroaded into service as an undercover agent for the Hong Kong police by the aging almost washed up Inspector Kwong Sun Yueh. A ring of jewelry thieves had perpetrated a brutal wellplanned robbery of a prestigious store in a Kowloon highrise. Under pressure from his superiors and in the middle of a professional rivalry with a younger inspector Kwong resorts to using Chow as a creative final option. Equipping him with all the trappings of an arms salesman he lets Chow loose to find out the identity of the robbers through his underworld connections. After surviving a gangland initiation of sorts Chow gains the trust of the robbers and is even befriended by the most brutal of them Brother Fu Lee Sau Yin. The gang invites him on its next project robbing a gold shop in the downtown jewelry district. Meanwhile when he's on his own he works out female trouble with his sometime girlfriend and dodges teams of police sent by the younger inspector who is unaware of his undercover status and suspects him of arms trafficking.The robbery goes down as planned except the store alarm is pressed and police who were already staking out the jewelry district rush to the scene. Fu slays police in their squad cars with far more brutal relish than Harvey Keitel. Temporarily eluding the police the robbers and Chow rush to their hideout an abandoned warehouse. There they argue about how to split the spoils and who among them might be a police informant.  All of this culminates in a hail of bullets as the location of the robbers' den is found out and they are surrounded by a virtual army of police.Lam has crafted a somber realistic actioner which would be slightly above average by American standards. It has a little less style than a John Woo film and is certainly less violent almost anything is less violent! but covers essentially the same territory. One can readily pick out what Tarantino culled from this film and it has a way of clarifying his creative process in that it is possible to see how he molded it into RESERVOIR DOGS using his own sensibilities.".

	schema:reviewBody "To anyone who's taken a few steps into the wonderful world of internet film discussion the title City on Fire should set alarm bells ringing due to its unfavourable connection with Reservior Dogs. Unfavourable because people now seem to be incapable of judging the film on its own without referring the Chow Yun Fat as The Mr. Orange guy. So this film has a sort of Holy Grail status amongst Tarantino's critics which tends to mean its faults and individual merits go equally overlooked. So I'll do my best to review it from a neutral perspective.As always Chowy is great quality in the lead role with a much more detailed character than Tim Roth had argh!. He maintains the effective heroic bloodshed chemistry with his frequent co star Danny Lee that would be used most notably two years later in Woo's The Killer. The rest of the cast are perfectly fine as they dance around the two stars and Lam's direction avoids the OTT va va voom of his later works such as Full Contact staying suitably restrained for the fairly bythenumbers plot. However the action is what Lam is usually noted for and he handles the gunplay here very effectively with his usual stylish skill.At times the film feels like it's weighing itself down with too much baggage mainly with the romance between Chow and his fiance. However this ultimately serves to up the tragedy of the final scenes and make Chowy's character seem a lot more human than the roles he is most noted for in the west such as Hard Boiled's Tequila.Overall City on Fire may not standout in the careers of anyone involved however it is an effective enjoyably action drama. And to the question everyone asks while it may lack discussions about Madonna and Steeler's Wheel numbers at its centre it has a beating heart something that seemed to be lost in translation when Tarantino made his breakthrough hit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm gonna try to keep my comments relatively brief this is a huge point I'm trying to come across with and direct them at the issue of Quentin Tarantino's with Avary Reservoir Dogs not at my opinion that City on Fire stands as great film of noteable orginality.This is about a relationship which exists between two films by different directors from different backgrounds solely because Tarantino 'borrowed' ideas from Ringo Lam.After seeing Reservoir Dogs for the first time many years ago I was blown away.  You have to give it to Tarantino he was in the right place at the right time and Reservoir Dogs blew everything that was going on in American cinema at the time out of the water.  There is no denying that through film enthusiasts who saw Pulp Fiction and then later sought out Dogs that a whole new generation of directors and writers came out of the wood work inspired by his work and tried to imitate what they came to praise as an icon of cinematic originality in what would be come a pop culture of new wave gangster films.However that is where in my opinion praise of Tarantino should stop. Sometimes I think people get confused between two things.  Those two things are being a obsessive film enthusiast and being an original artist.  I think that one problem in my opinion although many may not agree with the general film watching public and many producers is that they have not been exposed to much of foreign cinema let alone most of the independent films which gain huge followings but go unnoticed by the general public and therefore someone who markets an idea properly be it original or not can get away with taking someone else's idea which was truly original but not immensly popular and turning that into success or even in some cases a cult film.  The latter evokes some laughter on my part because having a cult film being based on the original work of another cult film really says something about the audience who follows such an unoriginal film without trying to truly discover its roots.Now does this take anything away from Reservoir Dogs or City on Fire for that matter?  No.  I believe that generally most who will see either film will and should for that matter go on to enjoy both films to the extent that they are impressioned by them for their originality and substance without caring about these 'minor details'.However after seeing both films and actually taking them for their worth I believe that it is clear in what classes either enthusiast or artist to put Lam and Tarantino in.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm gonna try to keep my comments relatively brief this is a huge point I'm trying to come across with and direct them at the issue of Quentin Tarantino's with Avary Reservoir Dogs not at my opinion that City on Fire stands as great film of noteable orginality.This is about a relationship which exists between two films by different directors from different backgrounds solely because Tarantino 'borrowed' ideas from Ringo Lam.After seeing Reservoir Dogs for the first time many years ago I was blown away.  You have to give it to Tarantino he was in the right place at the right time and Reservoir Dogs blew everything that was going on in American cinema at the time out of the water.  There is no denying that through film enthusiasts who saw Pulp Fiction and then later sought out Dogs that a whole new generation of directors and writers came out of the wood work inspired by his work and tried to imitate what they came to praise as an icon of cinematic originality in what would be come a pop culture of new wave gangster films.However that is where in my opinion praise of Tarantino should stop. Sometimes I think people get confused between two things.  Those two things are being a obsessive film enthusiast and being an original artist.  I think that one problem in my opinion although many may not agree with the general film watching public and many producers is that they have not been exposed to much of foreign cinema let alone most of the independent films which gain huge followings but go unnoticed by the general public and therefore someone who markets an idea properly be it original or not can get away with taking someone else's idea which was truly original but not immensly popular and turning that into success or even in some cases a cult film.  The latter evokes some laughter on my part because having a cult film being based on the original work of another cult film really says something about the audience who follows such an unoriginal film without trying to truly discover its roots.Now does this take anything away from Reservoir Dogs or City on Fire for that matter?  No.  I believe that generally most who will see either film will and should for that matter go on to enjoy both films to the extent that they are impressioned by them for their originality and substance without caring about these 'minor details'.However after seeing both films and actually taking them for their worth I believe that it is clear in what classes either enthusiast or artist to put Lam and Tarantino in.";

Chow Yun Fat performance in the movie tops the one he gave in A Better Tomorrow1986 as he gives his character a sense of doomed loyality.  Ringo Lam wanted to depict violence in City on Fire1987 that was much more realistic then that seen in John Woo's groundbreaking gangster classic. Danny Lee gives one of his best performances in one of his few roles as a non police officer.  One excellent scene in the movie is the jewel robbery that ends with Fat's undercover cop taking a bullet for Danny Lee.  The film deals with an undercover cop who is sent to catch some thieves but finds that there is more loyality among the thieves then the Poice.Fat's Character seems to be tormented with guilt over the betrayal of a friend in a previous undercover job and this has an effect on his current case.  This guilt turns to be a big reason to why he would take a bullet for Danny Lee's character. This along with John Woo's The Killer1989 would be one of the best team ups in Hong Kong action Cinema.  Resevoir Dogs1992 was influenced by Long Hu Feng Yun1987 almost scene for scene in the same way that A Fistful of Dollars1964 would be accused of ripping off Yojimbo1962 scene for scene.  One scene that both movies contain is the Mexican duel near the end of the movie.  One difference in the two films is that Danny Lee's character survives in City on Fire1987 while the same character in Resevoir Dogs1992 played by Harvey Kitel is killed off at the end of the movie.".

	schema:headline " No frills raw undercover cop story";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a no frills undercover cop story directed by Ringo Lam. With an average budget the film tells its story quite tightly with fine performances. Chow Yun Fat stars as the undercover policeman who is also having relationship problems. Danny Lee pops up as the jewel thief who will basically befriend chow as the system pushes them closer together. Yueh Sun Stars as an older cop who has lost his son years ago in the force and is bending the rules to have Chow undercover.I think Ringo Lam takes inspiration as much from French New Wave cinema as he douse from Hong Kong. The simple shooting style at times like documentary captures whats he needs and he is just concerned with making it all happen for the camera with settings and performances that ring true for the lens. Films like Un Flic and Le Samorai from French director Jean Piere Melville may have been the inspiration for Lam's raw simple style. This approach is effective.We all know what film it ended up inspiring and Ringo Lams comparisons with his contemporary John Woo Rather than ad to the subject dominance of the former I will just comment on the latter in That Woo only made one film better than this and it was The KIller. Despite Woo's amazing and influential style he doesn't tell perfect stories. City On Fire has a story that keeps you interested in what will actually happen. The dramatics of this picture are excellent. The performances all good. The characters are all concerned about their own situations and feel them all. The film is occasionally quite funny. Chow has a bit of a gift for comedy that transcends language and cultural barriers. This film and Lam's other film starring Chow Prison On Fire always amuse me in their moments.I was taken by this film. I cared about Chow and his vice like position. His impatient girlfriend complicated job going undercover and being followed by another police unit as if a criminal are situations closing in on him. Chow Yun Fat is a wonderful actor to watch. He can make you laph with his dances wooing woman and can entrance you with his glare when he means business. There are some wonderful long takes in this film that lets chow bring you into his character. In his roles of cops and killers he makes you sympathetic. A gift to the genre.Ringo Lam brings many of his regulars together to make a class production. You will recognise some of the cast if you have seen his other films. I figure he didn't have the permission to shoot on some of the locations and it informs the shooting style undercover in itself. Cameras lens poking out the window of a moving car to shoot the characters on the street. He just gets this film made. He has a pretty decisive vision. I have read you have to be tough directing films in Hong Kong. The schedules are busy the budgets are low and the Authorities are strict. You have to be able to improvise and break the rules. Take risks like they do with stuntwork.The script is way above average for a Hong Kong cop drama. This is a character driven film with less emphasis on action. A solid 80's picture. One of my favorite films from Hong Kong.".

The On Fire series also includes Prison On Fire 1 and 2which also star Chow Yun Fat and School On Fire. Roy Cheung appears in all four films and in this installment he is an overzealous cop at odds with Chow Yun Fat's character Ko Chowwho is an undercover cop infiltrating a gang of violent jewel thieves. Chow Yun Fat gives a scathing and electrifying performance of an undercover cop who's life and career is on the edge of collapse. From his strained relationship with his girlfriend to his reluctant undercover work with Danny Lee's gang and dealing with Roy Cheung's group of cops following and chasing him all over Hong Kong. Ko Chow is a cop with a lot on his plate trying to make everything work and stay alive in the process. In a rare appearance as a criminal Danny Lee is great as a charismatic but violent jewel robber with a code of honor. He and Chow Yun Fat have great chemistry and work well here and a year later in John Woo's classic The Killer. Make no mistake City On Fire is also a classic. Ringo Lam along with John Woo are ace filmmakers. Their styles are different however. Ringo's style is generally darker and rooted more in reality. John Woo is more over the top with a larger emphasis on action. Chow Yun Fat worked frequently with both directors giving amazing performances for both parties. City On Fire is a very well made and brutal film and if you enjoy gritty crime thrillers I give City On Fire the highest recommendation.".

Okay so let me start by saying that I had seen most John Woo films such as A Better Tomorrow The Killer etc httpwww.imdb.comnamenm0000247?refnvsr1director. before hitting this film. And those films were too damn good. They were so good that it made this film nearly no competition. Secondly I want to state the one fault of this film that has also become a major problem for action movies overallDrama. Okay so a certain amount of drama is necessary for a film. Take the drama in Die Hard or A Better Tomorrow. These films feast on their own drama to survive. However City on Fire unnecessarily introduces a feminine character who Chow YunFat must take as a bride.This problem is very vividly seen in South Indian action films like Thupakki httpwww.imdb.comtitlett2187153?refnvsr2. I'm not saying these films are necessarily bad I am just stating that the pace and tension of these films are blown apart by silly unnecessary drama.City on Fire is otherwise a great film having it's remarkable plot extend to one of the greatest films of all times Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.".

People question Tarantino's originality because of this film but other than the similarities in the ending gunpoint scene and the 'undercover cop' story their different movies entirely.City on Fire focuses on one man and only one man we follow his struggle through the intensity and risk of being undercover and the slightly less focused point of balancing work and relationships. Yun Fat Chow is again outstanding from the Hong Kong cinema I have seen there is no one quite like that man and in City on Fire he really does show that he is a leading man and not a supporting one. His performance is up their with Hard Boiled and that is saying something.One thing Hong Kong crime thrillers seem to do so well is music and action and City on Fire really does mix the slow paced relaxing jazz with the powerful action and grittiness of the characters and plot.It's no wonder Tarantino got his 'inspiration' from this film because its a good watch with strong acting from the lead roll and also captures Hong Kong perfectly especially the underbelly of the crime world. If you're put off by subtitled films then don't be because you're missing out on great cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first I thought that this movie was a little slow but the problem was that the recording was quite bad so it pulled the quality of this movie down. It is quite slow in parts and is very different from the namesake Prison on Fire. Where as Prison on Fire is an action film City on Fire is a thriller. The dark setting the jazz background music gives the feel of New Orleans and the movie come across as Film Noir.An undercover cop is killed in a jewel heist and another deep undercover cop is asked to infiltrate the gang and help the police stop them. The cop unfortunately already betrayed somebody that he was watching. He had built a deep relationship with this person but he had to betray him because it was his job. As such he has decided against continuing as a police officer. Unfortunately his supervisor does not want him to resign yet and convinces him to go on one more assignment.This movie is a cops and robbers movie with a twist. With the robbers it is one last job and that is it but the big job always fails and ends up dead. In this film the robbers know that there is never going to be any last job they are going to be doing it until they die. Instead it is the police officer who goes on that last job.As usual the police officer is struggling with his relationships. Instead of him wanting to do his job he would rather leave his job and spend time with the woman that he loves. He continues chasing her during the movie but if his job does not interrupt their relationship his family does. He is also under pressure from the other police departments who either do not realise or do not care that he is an undercover cop. Rather they think that he is corrupt and want to deal with him appropriately.Though he tries to pull out of the scene and settle down he keeps on being dragged back in. This is his fatal flaw the fact that he lives a double life a life that is dangerous if others discover this double feature. If the criminals discover that he is a cop then he is likely to be killed.There are a number of interesting ideas in the movie. One is that the criminal knows that he will always be a criminal. The more money he gets the more he will spend and the sooner he will need to commit another crime. One criminal claims that he does not hate cops because it is their job to go after people like him. As such he will not hate the police officer for his job but rather treat him as another working man. He earns his living by robbing jewelry stores while the police officer earns his living by arresting criminals.City on Fire is a dark tragic movie that looks at the pain of the life of an undercover cop. Here the life is not glorified but rather dirt real. It is a style that I wish to be influenced by because of the stark reality that the film portrays. A stark reality that people hide behind the illusion of television and a reality that is broken open in movies like the Truman Show and Edward Scissorhands.".

But is it?...not exactly.Pokemon 2000 is entertaining but it could have been more. Among the things that it lacks are the sense of a journey the ethereal ambiance of the first pokemon feature as well as the antagonistic sense of menace which Mewtow provided. On the other hand Pokemon 2000 is probably a better film for a mass audience because there is more action and humor but those alone do not make it the great adventure it promises.Unlike the first movie this one feels a bit short given the type of premise one hero must save the world from destruction. Naturally this hero is Ash. In the movie however he does not do anything so incredible. It felt to me like any other character could have been the hero because if you get the help of an almost invincible legendary pokemon like Lugia you don't need much skill. If this had been a slightly longer story with a little more adventure Pokemon 2000 would be a worthy film but it's probably good enough for young Pokemon fans.".

Even the short Pikachu's Rescue Adventure made more sense than Pikachu's Vacation in the first movie.  I know what you all may be thinking he is probably just some kid who just wants to brag about how good Pokemon is but the fact is... I'm 20!  I can legally walk into a Rrated movie!  But I would prefer walking into this delightful feature because sometimes with all the horror and boring overdramatic films out there it feels good to see a cute  funny animated film with a lesson to be learned at the end which I'm not going to spoil for you.  I highly recommend this movie because nowadays we all need to feel like a kid to release us from the stress!  So until a third movie comes out I'll watch this one some more!".

I'm not saying that you WILL hate it just that you've DECIDED that you're going to hate it no matter what just because it's Pokemon.  Current Pokemon fans like me and I'm 30! or more openminded moviegoers will probably like Pokemon 2000.I was glad that Kids WB decided to go with a more theatrical score for Pokemon 2000.  Although I would have preferred that more of the Japanese music would have been left in I think that the orchestral music was more fitting than the bubblegum pop that permeated Pokemon The Movie.Like most people I liked Pokemon 2000 more than Pokemon The First Movie probably because of the overall brighter feel.  I personally loved the first U.S. appearance of one of my favorite new Pokemon the flowery Bellossom.  There are points of the movie that I felt could have been expanded on but overall Pokemon 2000 is a fun ride.".

While I lean towards neither one I have indeed liked all the main films Pokemon 14 and find them all very enjoyable kids films. This one surpasses the other three by a milestone however. Not only is this movie a good Pokemon movie or a nice kids film it's just a very great and fun film over all in my sincerest opinion.First of all the story is quite honestly beautiful to boot. I know that might not bide with some but truly the whole idea of the legendary Pokemons Articuno Moltres Zapdos and Lugia creating a mass destruction that of course our one and only chosen one Ash can stop and how all the characters interact with the story is amazing. There are eyecatching action scenes as well as gorgeous animation settings the best being the scenes near the climax at the three legendary bird islands and the ocean waters that Lugia resides in. It's all very breathtaking regardless of whether you like the movie or not.While all these films are extremely childish in terms of dialogue what more could you expect? It does the job it's supposed to and does it well. Even the villain is sinister enough to get by and makes you feel empathy for the Pokemon he sets out to conquer. The score of Lugia's song is also a very soothing and wonderful score that overpowers even the whole film simply beautiful. In any matter the movie entertains. I like all of the settings mostly The islands are all unique in their own way and stand out. The villain's blimp is elegant and the new characters in this film besides the main Ash Brock and Misty are all very fun the most fun of all supporting characters in the movies.Basically if you liked the first the rest contain exactly all the other attributes except they all vary in terms of professional tact. Like I have stated this one takes all the characteristics of the Pokemon series to the highest they can go and I am not ashamed to admit how much I enjoy this film and have watched it more than once willingly. This movie shows what faith and determination can accomplish all the films do and I am proud to own this on oldtimey cassette and won't stutter to say I put it in lay back and let myself go from time to time.".

The animation in this movie is smooth and colorful and at times there's so much happening onscreen that you could miss a funny incident happening aside from the main theme of a scene.The characters go through several experiences which could lead to them being redefined a bit in the TV series. Team Rocket has a larger role in this film than in Pokmon The First Movie which I'm sure will delight many Team Rocket fans. The major villain in this film by not being incredibly evil but by being so singlemindedly greedy wanting one thing without any concern for the consequences his character shows that good and bad isn't always so clear cut. The characters despite their simple appearances are quite complex when you take a closer look.The soundtrack to the movie may not seem so remarkable but the Weird Al Yankovic song Polkamon is refreshing and the instrumental score stands out as aboveaverage.The film stands as an entertaining addition to the Pokmon universe. It dares to be original and though many people automatically detest it because it's popular it stands to help popularize Japanese animation in the U.S. so that it and movies like it won't simply be pushed aside as kid stuff.".

I had to see it and it's incredibly well done.  So which one do I like better?  Truthfully I don't know.  Mewtwo Strikes Back had heart and this one has a ton of adventure.  Of course since this one is still about five months from being released in the US I won't summarize it but I will say that Misty has a little competition.  You'll see what I mean.  Those of you that didn't like Mewtwo Strikes Back might like this one better.  It has a great storyline very likeable characters and a beautiful music score.  Hopefully this time Kids WB will do better in the translation and keep the original music except of course for the theme song.  However looking at their start on this movie naming it Pokemon the Movie 2000 the future for this dub doesn't seem very promising.  Hopefully they know what they're doing this time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have always enjoyed pokemon from the animated series to anything else. So as you can guess this movie was for me and maybe many others really great. The movie starts out with a typical minimovie starring Pika chu and some of the pokemon he is friends with. And in this adventure the whole pokegangas I will call them for now end up falling down some giant hole in order to rescue their friend Togpei. Anyways we see bunch of new pokemon that have yet to be seen and some real cute dance scene performed by the Bellossom and other accompanying pokemon. Thenfinally the group finds the lost togepi with a nest of exeggcute who have become very attached to him and won't let him go. Then suddenly tragedy hits as a huge eletrical storm breaks out and the pokemon must work together to keep the exeggcute nest safe. Finally the storm ends and it's time for our pokegang to go home. But before that we get to see the lost brother from the exeggscute nest be returned by a random Chansey and they evolve into Exeggutor. Yep get it exeggcute  execute exeggutor executor Well I will admit this part of the movie is nice and cute. But I will have to admit not having the narrator like they do in most of these minimovies is kind of nice. it allows the pokemon to speak for themselves through their actions.Now for the actual movie I personally loved the majority of the movie despite how bad the jokes were. I love seeing Ash at age ten being a strong and impetuous braggart that he can be still pull off actually saving the world. And yes I know that Misty can be very bland even for a female character. But I love seeing a likable female character. She may not scream girl power per se. But she is the ten year old girl in all of us. In this movie she does the typical female protagonist thing where she hides her true feelings from the male antagonist. I like the part where she says He is a boy and he is my friend. But he is not my boyfriend. But she does change towards the end and goes to help Ash when the other female costar offers to do it. Next the members of team Rocket I like them in this movie because they do actually help and was funny how they actually get some recognition compared to the other movies. Even though they do supply the majority of the bad jokes. Nowmy rating for this movie was a seven because I could see how hard they worked to get the sheer awesomeness in the artwork and the music was great. And I have to admit that seeing movie that was not CGI or had a bunch of adult innuendos put in it was nice. Now my only complaint I had with it was the generic anime style action to it. It was the power of oneness to all of it. And the message was kind of confusing. It was between the environmental message and the the power of one. And it kind of seemed the movie was making a decision between whether of the two go with. And finally what was with having the collector make that statement toward as if we were going to see him again. Well that it for this week. See ya!".

The writing storyline and animation are all markedly improved from The First Movie and it really does feel like a cinematic experience. The only thing wrong with it at all is that the Pikachu short film seemed like an excuse to show off some new Pokemon without having much of a real reason it's still good though. Now if you haven't read countless summaries already here's the plot in a nutshell...Wiiiieeeerd stuff is happening all over the world. Climates and temperatures are changing at an alarmingly rapid pace sometimes going from summer heat to snow in under a minute! The cause of this is a Pokemon collector who is trying to capture the four elemental Pokemon Zapdos Articuno Motres and ultimately Lugia. His wicked misdeeds are causing nature to go completely out of whack and it's up to Ash Misty Tracey and Pikachu to find the Elephant In The Room and set things right again.Even from a summary it's apparent that Pokemon 2000 is more than an extended episode of the show. In fact even without the short it's still easily feature length and that's more than can be said for The First Movie which had a runtime of 74 minutes. It may not be an edgeofyourseat unpredictable story in the vein of Inception but it's a satisfying and entertaining one. This is helped along by the dialogue which is some of the sharpest I've yet seen in Pokemon. There are many memorable bits in here not few of which involve Team Rocket.In conclusion I recommend watching it even if you're not a diehard fan of the series. Unless Pokemon Heroes knocks my socks off I think it's safe to say that 2000 is the best of the bunch. Oh and before I finish this review I want to whine about something. Once again there is either no widescreen version available on video or it's very hard to find. Boo Warner Bros BOO.".

Although I would have preferred that more of the Japanese music would have been left in I think that the orchestral music was more fitting than the bubblegum pop that permeated Pokemon The Movie.Like most people I liked Pokemon 2000 more than Pokemon The First Movie probably because of the overall brighter feel.

	schema:headline " This is a sad time for Pokemon fans";
	schema:reviewBody "I figured that it's about time I let this one out.  Pokmon fans are suffering in America these days.  Why?  Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies.  As far as the series goes they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television.  So what is their problem when it comes to the movies?  Honestly now I have seen all three Pokmon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies.  They are all enjoyable and fun to watch.  And after seeing Pokmon 2000 in theaters I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts.  The way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters.  It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB extreme sarcasm there and created this crap.possible spoilers from here onWell I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.  My first gripe with this came with no narration.  I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokdex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai they just cut the narration all together.  This wouldn't have been a problem except for one thing.  Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end?  Possibly the fans but I'm sure not the parents.  Then there's the theme song.  I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one.  The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children.  It was fun and enjoyable.  This one nauseating.  Now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana.  Nice music fun to watch.  That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the Pokmon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary.  Oh and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath.  You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are.  Basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But I haven't touched on the worst of it yet.You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power.  For some unfathomable reason I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB.  My thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well.'  That in mind I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said You will believe that one person can make all the difference.'  With the way they said that at every turn I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version.  Then comes Nintendo Power in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature 'The Power of One.'  At that point I became a bit more uneasy.  The Power of One?!' Not a good sign.  However I still kept some of my false faith.  Big mistake.Sitting in the theater I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk.  I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.  I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing repeating it over and over like in MSB.  However it did more damage than anything else in this movie.  First of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash.'  Ah hah.  So Ash is the chosen one?  Whatever.  In the Japanese version the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokmon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time he's the chosen one.  A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia.  Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokmon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia.  In this one Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash.  In the scene where they're flying back to the main island Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence not that Ash is going to make all the difference.  Overall in this category Ash wasn't really the one person' that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the way.A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking.  Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one.  Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection started with a Mew card?'  Ugh.  Even worse Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held.  Why didn't you put them in Pokballs when you caught them?  This is like caging them to be displayed.'  Much different from whining about him thinking Pokmon are things to be collected like stamps.  If there were any real redeeming values in this they came from Team Rocket.  Some pretty funny lines.  Not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well that was officially the last American Pokmon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable.  I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well.  Forget you Kids WB and 4Kids. You have forsaken me for the last time.".

I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokdex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai they just cut the narration all together.  This wouldn't have been a problem except for one thing.  Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end?  Possibly the fans but I'm sure not the parents.  Then there's the theme song.  I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one.  The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children.  It was fun and enjoyable.  This one nauseating.  Now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana.  Nice music fun to watch.  That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the Pokmon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary.  Oh and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath.  You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are.  Basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But I haven't touched on the worst of it yet.You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power.  For some unfathomable reason I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB.  My thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well.'  That in mind I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said You will believe that one person can make all the difference.'  With the way they said that at every turn I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version.  Then comes Nintendo Power in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature 'The Power of One.'  At that point I became a bit more uneasy.  The Power of One?!' Not a good sign.  However I still kept some of my false faith.  Big mistake.Sitting in the theater I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk.  I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.  I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing repeating it over and over like in MSB.  However it did more damage than anything else in this movie.  First of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash.'  Ah hah.  So Ash is the chosen one?  Whatever.  In the Japanese version the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokmon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time he's the chosen one.  A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia.  Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokmon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia.  In this one Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash.  In the scene where they're flying back to the main island Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence not that Ash is going to make all the difference.  Overall in this category Ash wasn't really the one person' that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the way.A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking.  Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one.  Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection started with a Mew card?'  Ugh.  Even worse Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held.  Why didn't you put them in Pokballs when you caught them?  This is like caging them to be displayed.'  Much different from whining about him thinking Pokmon are things to be collected like stamps.  If there were any real redeeming values in this they came from Team Rocket.  Some pretty funny lines.  Not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well that was officially the last American Pokmon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable.  I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well.  Forget you Kids WB and 4Kids. You have forsaken me for the last time.";

The romantic side of the story is really emphasized in the scene where Misty is trying to wake Ash up  this shows that she really cares about him. I think that Ash and Misty really love each other though they are always denying it. In this movie Ash once again proves himself to the world by showing us what he truly is  a hero. He is brave selfless always ready to help others in need and cares very much for his friends who are always by his side giving him strength. This particular movie really brings out the heroic side of Ash and that's what makes it so great.

Why? cause it's projected towards kids but these movies and cartoons are really good and alot more complicated than meets the eye. that's one thing i love about em. Pokemon 2000 just proves that.The animation of this movie is really cool it's like the shows but they're improved at the same time. A big step above the first pokemon movie I think. The plot is definately alot more in depth too.  The disappointing thing about the first movie is that mew and mewtwo fought but it wasnt a battle we were expecting so the action wasnt exactly what we hoped for. However in pokemon 2000 that's one thing i love the action and adventure is great! Team Rocket and Ash even come to team up to help save the world which is a nice idea put in there. Seeing team rocket always doing the same thing does get a little redundant. My favorite part in the movie is when ash has to get across the ice with lugia protecting him to get the last sphere. I thought that whole scene was well made and was just awesome to watch. The score of the movie makes it really good too. Very catchy and intense score I think. No one would ever say that a pokemon movie is oscar worthy but when it comes to just being enjoyable and fun pokemon 2000 is definately up there. I would hope that pokemon never died down if they kept delivering movies and shows like this.The whole misty hiding back her feelings about ash thing is kinda cute in the movie it always make me wonder if they'll ever have a thing or not. heh anyway this movie gets an 1010 no matter what i think.  I still have to see pokemon 3 i look forward to it though. Look more forward to Pokemon 4 i only hope that it is released in theaters.".

I thought that whole scene was well made and was just awesome to watch. The score of the movie makes it really good too. Very catchy and intense score I think. No one would ever say that a pokemon movie is oscar worthy but when it comes to just being enjoyable and fun pokemon 2000 is definately up there. I would hope that pokemon never died down if they kept delivering movies and shows like this.The whole misty hiding back her feelings about ash thing is kinda cute in the movie it always make me wonder if they'll ever have a thing or not. heh anyway this movie gets an 1010 no matter what i think.  I still have to see pokemon 3 i look forward to it though. Look more forward to Pokemon 4 i only hope that it is released in theaters.";

Marine Staff Sergeant Nantz Aaron Eckhart who was about to retire is reassigned to a new platoon. The platoon flown by chopper to the forward operating base at Santa Monica Airport is being led by a new 2nd Lt. Martinez Ramon Rodriguez. They are sent on a mission to rescue some civilians who are trapped at the police station within alien territory.

If you want to watch a really well thought out film with lots of character development and interesting subplots this is not the film for you. If you want to watch a bunch of U.S. Marines beat the tar out of invading spacefreaks then this is the film for you. From when we first encounter the aliens to sometime in the middle the movie is a nonstop thrill ride. Stuff explodes aliens get splattered humans get burned by lasers. In case you didn't already suspect this film is very violent. Although there isn't a lot of blood there are certainly a lot of deaths. The action is unpredictable and zany. One minute everyone will be walking somewhere between point A and B the next they're crouching behind burned out cars and houses as aliens pour ungodly hellfire onto them from above. The special effects were also quite good with the exception of a couple bad animations here and there. That being said the movie suffers when it slows down. The dialogue is poorly written and delivered decently but not well. Aaron Eckhart however did a wonderful job as a stony faced marine staff sergeant who keeps a cool head when under fire. Most of the storyline is pretty standard war moviealien invasion stuff. You know when after a bunch of fighting everyone gets discouraged and then the leader gives a big motivational speech and the inspirational music plays and everyone feels heroic. So don't expect a masterpiece of modern cinema expect alien guts and lots of shooting and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.".

Sure if you evaluate it on the same scale as District 9 it sucks. But if you just wanted to see an awesome action movie this is the movie for you.Yes there was no character development. Yes the plot is a zillion years old. So what? I wasn't looking for those things. Now and then it's nice to go see a movie with mindless action. 100 of this movie was mindless action. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy it. Compare it to a movie like The Losers or ATeam where the movie tries to build up some characters and an original plot and fail miserably.I would also like to add that there are some nice original points to this movie. For once the aliens are not infallible. I get pretty tired of the ohlawdwehitthemwithnukesanddidn'tkillone type of alien movie popularized by Independence Day. There is no magic bullet in this movie the aliens die from bullets and you have to take out the command and control center to do serious damage hey just like in a conventional land war!. I also thought this movie was a decent depiction of a realistic military response to an alien attack. Everyone mobilizes surrounds the landing zone and combat ensues when they are attacked. Pretty simple.I also see complaints about camera style. I honestly didn't even notice. It didn't seem any worse than say Black Hawk Down.So I give this movie 810 on my action movie scale. If you were planning on evaluating it on the thoughtfulworkofart scale you must not have seen any of the trailers.".

Without spelling it out or drawing a diagram the audience and the marine platoon we are following are immediately deployed into Los Angeles for reasons they do not know. Soon we learn that indeed Aliens are landing off the shore of LA and killing everyone on the beach. The platoon we are following is sent on a mission to get some survivors from a gas station several miles from the coast. Generic movie ensues.The film is shot like Bourne with epilepsy. I'm 21 years old and not too old to follow the action on screen its just really really annoying when 80 of the shots are extremely herky jerky closeups. There is not a single steady shot in the entire film. Not one. The intensity of the effect wears off right after the first alien is killed. After that the movie spiralled downhill deep deep into the realm of the clich. I'm going to name a few character's roles that are in this film see if you can recognize them from other films you've seen. Experienced hardened leader who gets a new platoon. Young officer straight out of officer's school who can't handle the action. Bad ass chick who can shoot. Soft and sweet nurse who gets picked up along the way. An Asian guy a black guy a white dude from the south and a rookie make up the main part of the platoon. There is a scene where tension is high and its just a damn dog making noise. Start to see where this is going? This movie had some good things going for it. Its use of silence was well done. The blasting boom of the gunshots were startlingly realistic. The alien spacecrafts are awesome. The aliens themselves are pretty cool. Its just that the screenplay is terrible. SOOOOOO clich in every way. This is your standard war movie just with Aliens. The ending is just as clich as the rest of the film. Don't fool yourself into thinking it will actually be difficult to beat the aliens. 0 thought involved.Hopefully Mr. Liebesman has better luck with the final product of Clash 2 than he did with this. Everyone I saw the movie with thought it was pretty bad. Movies like this that I totally enjoyed District 9 Cloverfield Avatar somewhat City of God cinematography and Blackhawk Down.

	schema:reviewBody "If you are really looking to waste two hours of your precious life then feel free to give this piece of crap a try. It's awful... just awful. The production company is called Original Films which is ironic because there is absolutely nothing original about this movie in any way. It is clich after clich. From a marine who wants to retire being called in to a one last job scenario to a kid loosing his father and begging please wake up over heavy synthetic violins. It's awful... just awful. There is no objective no plot no story nothing but flying bullets and lowfi dancing CG aliens. With the high budget of this movie you'd think that they could at least afford good looking CG. The animation and special effects in Terminator 2 were far superior... and that was made in 1991... 20 years ago!!There's a simple game you can play with this movie. Whoever falls asleep first wins. Yes it's that boring.But what is really depressing about this is the fact that Aaron Eckhart is a fantastic actor. It is a real mystery why he chose to be a part of this misguided production. He wasn't bad in this movie either but given the fact that there was no story no character development and soulkillingly lackluster dialogue even his finely tuned chops weren't enough to make this movie entertaining.".

	schema:headline " This is an unoriginal primitive and mindless recruitment video for the Call of Duty and MTV Generation";
	schema:reviewBody "Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz Aaron Eckhart is an ageing soldier who is set for retirement. In his previous tour of Iraq he was one of the only survivors in his unit and speculation surrounds what happened to his men. When an alien invasion strikes the Earth however he is brought back into the action to help lead a group of young and inexperienced soldiers. One of them is set to be married and another is expecting the birth of his child. As the rest of the Earth seems to be defeated Los Angeles remains as one of the last posts. With the help of some civilians including a father and son a veterinarian Bridget Moynahan and also TSgt. Elena Santos Michelle Rodriguez the unit works to clear out the city moving towards an extraction point before the area can be bombed out. Calling Battle Los Angeles the equivalent of a video game would be giving it too much credit. Jonathan Liebesman's irredeemable scifi action film is the antithesis of 2010's Monsters. This is an unoriginal primitive and mindless recruitment video for the Call of Duty and MTV Generation. The soldiers here armed with high powered assault weapons don't so much act as scream grunt speak and backslap each other in a bid to look and sound cool. Take note of pop singer NeYo's casting and Michelle Rodriguez as a hardened fighter. Big stretch. But video game enthusiasts would be better served sticking to the virtual battlefield because the shabbiness of this picture is one of its few surprises. Shaky cam makes an unwelcome return here with framing so ridiculously tight in the opening stages that the camera seems to be attached to the actors' heads. Later battles are dismally over edited with rapid fire cutting that the film is indecipherable about who is being blown up. Forget about characters or development because by the first gunfight the scriptwriter already has too. There is no urgency or tension as we have no one to barrack for. As a viewer you're expected to catch flies as you admire explosion after explosion after explosion. The entirety of the film save for some painfully rushed and clichd exposition is made up of overlong battle sequences and standoffs. Moments of sacrifice and 'you go on without me' pleas are unmoving and do little to compensate for the lack of narrative. Restricting the perspective of the film to a single military unit also means that there is little conception about the rest of the invasion. Only brief news headlines on the televisions give minimal information like how the aliens are scavenging our water. Point being the film seems more interested in being loud rather than in the science the aliens or even the human reactions. The cynic in me suggests that you see very little of the aliens up close because of how unconvincing they are. From afar they look like they're made from scrap metal. Try not to laugh as Nantz carves one up like a Christmas ham looking for a weakness. What makes this more poisonous than other incompetent action films is the increasing transparency of the film's promilitary agenda. Along with the compassionless violence the message seems to be that you're never too young or too old for the military. Luckily Eckhart has a face made out of granite because it must be the only way he can keep it straight when spouting embarrassing propaganda like 'marines don't quit' and telling a little boy 'I need you to be my little marine'. I found that and Battle Los Angeles success at the US box office it debuted at number one to be scarier than any alien threat. Be afraid. Be very afraid.".

	schema:headline " A familiar tale with a bit of a stylistic twist";
	schema:reviewBody "The alien invasion film is certainly nothing original. Recently and upcoming I can think of no less than 4 film and TV versions of this basic tale. Battle Los Angeles doesn't bring anything new plot wise to this scenario. In fact it operates on the thinnest of plot and some very underdeveloped characters. The only somewhat unique aspect at least for an alien invasion story is its gritty you are there aspect filmed in a handheld jerky thick of the action style. This isn't revolutionary either but Battle Los Angeles does manage to squeeze some momentum out of its running length.As mentioned above Battle Los Angeles' plot can be summed up rather succinctly Aliens land on Earth throughout the globe including near Los Angeles. This alien force operating with ground forces begins to overrun the various cities they arrive at and LA is no different. A squad of marines led by Staff Sergeant Nantz Aaron Eckhardt is dispatched to attempt to retrieve possible civilian presence from a Santa Monica police station behind the front lines of the fighting. They encounter heavy resistance and must find a way back to their forward operating base while keeping the civilians under their protection and themselves alive.Battle Los Angeles is obviously influenced visually by movies such as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan in the staging of its action. Much of the film is photographed with handheld camera moves the focus constantly whipping around disorienting both the characters and the audience. While the technique is hardly unique it does work to a degree in Battle Los Angeles bringing a different approach to a familiar plot. This isn't about scientists trying to figure out what the aliens want or politicians wringing their hands about the big decisions in the midst of an alien onslaught. Battle Los Angeles keeps its focus exclusively on the soldiers in the thick of battle presenting the action in a noholds barred manner. It is refreshing at least from that perspective to see a harderedged more realistic take on this material.On the other hand Battle Los Angeles is a bit weak on the character front. The most development is given to Sergeant Nantz who had just recently returned from a tour in Iraq where lives were lost and many assume he was to blame. This plays into several moments in the film influencing other characters regarding the decisions he makes during the events of the story. Beyond that aside from a few obligatory references to someone's relative or background none of the other characters see much development. Physically they are different enough to stand out from one another but they are all mostly blank slates. There isn't complete detachment from the audience several moments have some resonance emotionally but not as much as if the filmmakers had taken some time to flesh the people out a bit more.Battle Los Angeles also suffers from being a bit overlong and it's relentless action oriented approach means that a lot of similar scenes play out over and over again Marines trapped in combat things don't look good a character makes a choice or sacrifice they manage to subdue their attackers and then the film moves to the next scene in this same format. There is also little or no development of the alien menace. Snippets of television coverage featuring scientific experts fills in a little of the backstory to them but it is mostly incidental. However Battle Los Angeles is not created in that style it is about the action going on with the marines in the thick of it and stays in that mode.Aaron Eckhardt proves again his ability to sell a character and he imbues Sergeant Nantz with a vigor and a degree of weariness that you buy into. Most of the other actors do a decent job of making us believe in these people as Marines in the thick of combat. A few recognizable names take roles including Michele Rodriguez as an Air Force tech who joins up with the Marines and Bridget Moynihan as a civilian they are trying to protect but neither has much to work with in regards to their characters other than to look tough or scared respectively.Battle Los Angeles is certainly no masterpiece. It doesn't deviate much from the alien invasion template in regards to the broad strokes of its plot and the style it was filmed in has been pioneered by other films. That being said the film is engaging enough and applies its style to a source material in a way that at least gives a different perspective on a familiar narrative framework. That doesn't make for a tremendous film but not one that is completely in need of avoidance by the filmgoing public.".

	schema:reviewBody "From watching the TV trailers for this film I was expecting a pretty fast paced alien invasion action flick. If I judged films on this alone it would get full marks. However I was left feeling quite left down by this film.The overabundance in cheesy lines frankly annoying camera work and massively predictable scenes could have been forgiven if this film had been a b movie as that's what we have grown to expect from that genre. Also despite the film being quite action packed from the getgo I found that it dragged on and on and definitely could have been better if it was at least a halfhour shorter.To expand a little on the camera work it is very jumpy with jerky motion and features repetitive amounts of fastzoominreallyclose style effect which is OK in some situations but it does get massively overused in this flick. Another overused effect is the lookingdownthescopetryingtofind anenemy effect. By midway in the film I wish I had actually started counting how many times this view was used as I'm positive it was in doublefigures. I know these effects can add to the feeling you're there with the heroes but when it's just the same effect of looking down the sight at some smoke and concrete rubble looking for shadows over and over again you tend to get put off it quite quickly.The SFX are ok. There is a heck of a lot of it in the film as you'd expect given the plot and whilst some of the models are quite well detailed and could pass as believable some of them are frankly amateurish  especially when zoomed in on for instance you can clearly tell that some of the 3d metal work is simply textures on a flat surface which offer no depth or moving light which ruins the scene for you as you can't help but notice it's a model rather than some alien hardware.Talking about the script now I cannot convey to you just how much cheese is spouted by the actors in the film. I swear you can even see the anguish on Aaron Eckhart's face as he reels out yet another corny predictable and frankly unrealistic oneliner. It honestly gets to the point where you're laughing at just how bad it gets at some points. It is extremely B movieish which would be fine IN a B movie. However this film is touting itself as a mainstream high budget serious action flick where this sort of poor script writing shouldn't be found. In films like Independence Day where they inject humour light heartedness and a don't take it seriously ambiance throughout this script may well have worked  even been quite funny. But sadly this is putting itself in with films like District 9 Alien angleand Black Hawk Down Close combat  Brotherhood of men angle and it really isn't in the same league as either.Which just leaves the plot which sadly is overly predictable and doesn't offer much in respect to tension suspense or twists but instead gives predictability repetitiveness and sadly nothing new. Whilst it is constantly moving forward and rarely breaks from the action you can't help but feel that the film starts to drag.To summarize if it was a B movie it would have been a pretty darn good one. However since it's touting itself as a Action Thriller I'm afraid it doesn't rate highly once you compare it to other offerings in the same genre  even if you go back ten years!For those of you that do want to see it I strongly recommend waiting for the DVD release to come out then be discounted before buying.".

	schema:headline " Did The Aliens Exterminate The Editor ?";
	schema:reviewBody "Everyone described this film as BLACK HAWK DOWN meets ALIENS and who am I to contradict public opinion . One thing I didn't notice in the reviews was similarity to the John Wyndham novel The Kraken Wakes . Meteors land in the ocean and very quickly alien incursions attack the coastline . One criticism of Wyndham's criminally underrated novel is that if an alien race was this advanced then there's no reason for them to be hostile down to evolutionary psychology . In simplistic terms a civilization alien or otherwise would have to evolve beyond petty tribalsitic squabbles and pool their resources in to conquering physics and mastering interstellar travel . In other words an advanced civilization should in theory be a non aggressive race not bent on conquest This is speculation of course because there's no evidence that there's life on any other planet and the novels of John Wyndham are quickly forgotten as the laser bolts fly and the aliens emerge from the sea . This is a pity because I was expecting a bit more mystery and suspense allowing the story to breath before the aliens were revealed . It's still not really a great loss at this point because I was still very impressed by the epic scope and spectacle as the marines fly to Camp Pendleton via helicopter dodging airbursts caused by the aliens . As the action then takes place as a ground war in the ruins of LA I was reminded to a certain extent of BLACK HAWK DOWN . The problem after the initial fighting however is that the scale and scope stops and started reminding me of any Michael Bay film you care to mention Goodbye epic scope and scale we had when the marines were airborne and hello to close up and elliptic editing done via shaky cam . One can understand director Jonathan Liebesman trying to do a scifi blockbuster in a realist style but we've seen too many films with  blink and you'll miss it  type editing and you'd think with the utter contempt that many movie fans hold Michael Bay in you'd think most directors would avoid this style rather than constantly embrace it  but no they still continue as if it's part of their job remit . Would I cynical in thinking in this case it's too disguise the fact that the aliens aren't all convincing if you look at them longer than a nanosecond ? Hmm CGI and blink and you'll miss it editing . You spend tens of millions of dollars on a movie and you don't bother hiring an editor or a screenwriter . Remind me why Hollywood producers live in big mansions with a swimming pool while there's so many people with potential living in poverty ?This is a the type of film like WORLD WAR Z that constantly gets pumped out by Hollywood where there's a germ of a good idea in there somewhere that blossoms in to a big headache inducing mess that makes for a great trailer but doesn't have any substance to sustain it for two hours . Obviously any idiot can be a Hollywood producer but it takes someone of relative intelligence to analyse if they want to spend money watching films like this at the cinema just because the trailer looked good . I'm glad I didn't spend money on a cinema ticket to watch this".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since District 9 a whole new door has been opened to alien and scifi films everywhere. It seems like that was the film it took to inspire people to go back into the genre and we were cursed with Battle L.A. I think I nearly had a seizure after leaving the movie theater my friends and I could barely stand our heads hurt so much. I mean the shaky cam effect we can handle to an extent but this was just a horrible story. Believe me when I say that the critics are right on this one. I honestly don't understand how there could be one positive review on this movie because it's ugly it's stupid and it's such American propaganda. Seriously every 5 minutes there is some kind of Marines Rule! speech being thrown at you. I can tell you that they failed because my friends and I agreed that if this were to ever happen in real life we would just join the army and do the thinking for the marines who shoot first and ask questions later. There were so many flaws with this film that I don't even know where to begin but I will tell you about the story first as hard as some moments were to follow as they wouldn't stop moving the camera every 2 seconds.On August 11th mysterious objects thought to be meteorites crash into Earth's oceans near several major cities including LA. These objects are revealed to be spacecraft containing hostile extraterrestrial forces. U.S. Marines arrive in LA to defend against alien ground forces and assist in the evacuation of civilians in preparation for a bombing campaign. They learn that the alien force consists solely of ground forces at the moment with no air support to speak of the USAF plans to commence saturation bombing of the Santa Monica area. The platoon's mission is to rescue civilians from an LAPD police station within three hours. As they advance through the city they are ambushed by aliens and suffer casualties. Eventually the combined team reaches the police station finding five civilians but now must try to escape the city alive before the bombing happens.Like I said between the propaganda of trying to get you to join the marines there were so many problems with this film it wasn't funny. First off we are being invaded by aliens wouldn't you want to capture one of the aliens and study them and find out why they are attacking us instead of just shooting them? I guess with this sick video game generation it's get more points vs. intelligence. Secondly then when they capture an alien to find out how to kill it since they're not going down with one bullet two characters literally go through layers and layers of their armor and skin and took over 15 minutes to find what was their weakness then all of a sudden after that killing the aliens with a gun seemed to be no problem. Thirdly we go into the ultimate clichs of screaming HooHaw! Marines! with every war clich that you could imagine. Just take District 9 meets Full Metal Jacket and you have Battle L.A. Fourthly this film was way too long and dragged on forever I try so hard to make it through a film but I was extremely tempted to walk out on this one. And fifth who the heck where these characters? We go through everyone so fast that we barely know who they are and don't care when they die or get injured since honestly I don't care about them! This was an awful movie and was way over the top filled with clichs bless you if you made it through this mess in the theater because I should go over to the director's house and hit him over the head with the script until he has the headache that his movie gave me.110".

	schema:headline " A solid action adventure that delivered what I expected.";
	schema:reviewBody "Battle Los Angeles is a cross between Cloverfield handheld camera and Independence Day aliens landing on earth. It stars Aaron Eckhart as Staff Seargant Michael Nantz who having lost his platoon on a previous assignment files paperwork to leave active service for a while but a call that meteors are landing all around the globe which turns out to be aliens throws him back into the mix. The aliens want to eradicate the human colony for the resources of water which helps in some way it's never properly explained to power their ships and mechanical bodies. Nantz becomes part of a new platoon who includes second lieutenant William Martinez Ramon Rodrigeuz Cpl. Jason Lockett Cory Hardict Cpl. Nick Stavrou Gino Anthony Pesci Cpl. Kevin Harris Neyo surprisingly whom I didn't even recognise until his name flashed up on the credits! and TSgt Elena Santos Michelle Rodriguez. They go to rescue any civilians in Santa Monica who are trapped in a police station and escort them out where also they find where the command module of the aliens ships that controls everything is and try to destroy it.That's it really and what is part of my criticism the story is very basic with no real twists which also does contain some plot holes. Also there is no characterisation for any of the main characters who are as thin as cardboard the film follows the usual formulaic structure with every stereotype you could imagine with the types of characters involved like the new guy who wants to impress and the guy put in charge of a new platoon after losing his old one etc. The script as well is truly dreadful with all the clichs and cheesiness you could expect. But the thing is I was expecting this as this is your typical America saves the world trashy film.I also expected other things that would be positive for this movie and it delivered. The action was exciting and well choreographed the best action sequence being on a freeway whilst the platoon try to save the civilians there was enough suspense and tension throughout added by the great music and general pace of the film the special effects of the aliens and their ships was impressive the acting was surprisingly good even with the awful script. Aaron Erckart convinced as a marine leader with Michelle Rodriguez and Cory Hardict delivering solid supporting performances. The biggest strength I would say though is that it was excellently shot and edited. The handheld camera added to the authenticity of the situation and never was too shaky though there were a few scenes where it was hard to make sense of what was happening but generally it was perfect. Not everyone will like this film those expecting anything then what I resembled of a decent script and story will be sorely disappointed and even the handheld camera as pointed out by certain reviewers on here will irritate some people who may complain it's hard to see anything and that would be right in some respects. Battle Los Angeles wasn't perfect with a story we've all seen so many times before but if your looking for good action special effects and reasonable acting it does deliver. For me I would normally have given this film a five or six out of ten but the acting and camerawork was a bonus and enough to tip it into a seven. Also there were more positives for this movie than negatives which worked in the film's favour. Enjoyable action adventure that delivers solidly. A great effort.".

The aliens want to eradicate the human colony for the resources of water which helps in some way it's never properly explained to power their ships and mechanical bodies. Nantz becomes part of a new platoon who includes second lieutenant William Martinez Ramon Rodrigeuz Cpl. Jason Lockett Cory Hardict Cpl. Nick Stavrou Gino Anthony Pesci Cpl. Kevin Harris Neyo surprisingly whom I didn't even recognise until his name flashed up on the credits! and TSgt Elena Santos Michelle Rodriguez. They go to rescue any civilians in Santa Monica who are trapped in a police station and escort them out where also they find where the command module of the aliens ships that controls everything is and try to destroy it.That's it really and what is part of my criticism the story is very basic with no real twists which also does contain some plot holes. Also there is no characterisation for any of the main characters who are as thin as cardboard the film follows the usual formulaic structure with every stereotype you could imagine with the types of characters involved like the new guy who wants to impress and the guy put in charge of a new platoon after losing his old one etc. The script as well is truly dreadful with all the clichs and cheesiness you could expect. But the thing is I was expecting this as this is your typical America saves the world trashy film.I also expected other things that would be positive for this movie and it delivered. The action was exciting and well choreographed the best action sequence being on a freeway whilst the platoon try to save the civilians there was enough suspense and tension throughout added by the great music and general pace of the film the special effects of the aliens and their ships was impressive the acting was surprisingly good even with the awful script. Aaron Erckart convinced as a marine leader with Michelle Rodriguez and Cory Hardict delivering solid supporting performances. The biggest strength I would say though is that it was excellently shot and edited. The handheld camera added to the authenticity of the situation and never was too shaky though there were a few scenes where it was hard to make sense of what was happening but generally it was perfect. Not everyone will like this film those expecting anything then what I resembled of a decent script and story will be sorely disappointed and even the handheld camera as pointed out by certain reviewers on here will irritate some people who may complain it's hard to see anything and that would be right in some respects. Battle Los Angeles wasn't perfect with a story we've all seen so many times before but if your looking for good action special effects and reasonable acting it does deliver. For me I would normally have given this film a five or six out of ten but the acting and camerawork was a bonus and enough to tip it into a seven. Also there were more positives for this movie than negatives which worked in the film's favour. Enjoyable action adventure that delivers solidly. A great effort.";

	schema:reviewBody "War movies depicting a group of soldiers against overwhelming odds are nothing new. For generations moviegoers have been treated to cinematic recreations as well as new scenarios of fighting units in combat. Usually these films follow a typical formula that includes the tough and gritty commanding officer the naive new soldier the one with a woman and children waiting at home and one who has difficulties with combat. In the new movie Battle Los Angeles a new twist is given to the formulaic troopsincombat picture which produces a mixed bag of results.Aaron Eckhart stars as Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz a 20 year Marine who after losing men on a recent mission has decided that it is time for him to leave and has filed his retirement paperwork from the corps. While completing a training exercise Nantz and a squadron of Marines at Camp Pendleton are activated for what they are told is an evacuation mission in order to clear Santa Monica and other area residents from a swarm of meteors which are scheduled to hit just off the coast.Nantz is assigned to a new commanding officer who like the men in his unit is wary of Nantz as many believe that he got his men killed in his last assignment. Despite the misgivings of the new lieutenant he agrees that Nantz offers a wealth of experience and should be just fine for a simple evacuation assignment.However during the mission briefing the Marines are informed that the meteors that are hitting off the coast of major cities around the world contain metallic centers and that this is very likely an invasion from an unknown force. While the Marines are deploying an otherworldly fighting unit emerges destroying everything in their path as they moved inland from the coast line. Unsure what they are dealing with the military decides to carpet bomb the city in order to contain the alien threat and give Nantz and his unit three hours to enter the combat zone and evacuate civilians from a police station.While the movie is for the most part the standard soldiersatwar film which substitute's aliens for the usual enemy forces the strength of the cast and the solid action and special effects help the movie overcome many of its shortcomings. There is little character development in the film and scenarios that were introduced in some of the characters' back stories early in the film were given little to no chance to develop once the shooting started.I also had an issue with some of the tactics in the film. While it may seem nitpicking there were a few scenes where the soldiers didn't follow logical courses of engagement until later in the film. I have had only the most basic of combat instruction from my brief time in the Air Force yet I can think of at least four scenarios in the film where the unit failed to use the most logical options available in their combat situation. Of course any film dealing with an alien invasion is sure to have plot holes and yes I can quibble about the Air Force waiting three hours to bomb a heavily overrun area when containment would have been priority one in not allowing a hostile force that much time to entrench itself.That being said it was an interesting and entertaining film. The enemy was sufficiently mysterious and dangerous enough to hold my interest and had me rooting desperately for the troops to rise up and strike back at the enemy. Michelle Rodriguez does fine supporting work in the role of an Air Force Tech Sgt. who may have the key to turning the tide of the battle. Eckhart is solid as the gruff but caring staff sergeant is equally strong and his unit of young corporals including RB singer NeYo are believable.Director Jonathan Liebesman knows the core intention of this film is and in doing so provides enough action to keep the audience entertained throughout. despite some issues with pacing and plot. While it doesn't have the epic feel of Independence Day Battle Los Angeles is a film that provides enough entertainment to make it one of the better alien invasion films ever made and one that I certainly would not mind seeing revisited in a future sequel.3.5 stars out of 5".

You won't find any brainsucking aliens in this movie or U.S. presidents in fighter jets or Microsoft viruses infecting the alien mothership or aliens suddenly catching the flu and dying off soon after the attack. Because what I mean by being very grounded is the opposite extreme. It's not a movie about aliens it's a movie about Marines at war and while they are fighting aliens there is nothing particularly alien about them when it comes to battle  they're just tougher to kill. Therein lies the realityflaw aliens able to travel from another star presumably and swarm our planet shouldn't be using ballistic firearms they'd be using something a lot more deadly and advanced.

Even as a shakycam movie it wasn't nearly as hard to watch as just a few minutes a Michael Bay movie. It's like all the cameramen these days have Parkinson's.And yet despite that I gave it 7 stars out of 10 here which is pretty high and I suppose I did that for a couple of reasons. One it was the most superior alien invasion movie that's been done to date. It divorced itself from the ideas behind Independence Day War of the Worlds remake The Day the Earth Stood Still remake and Skyline and tried to deal out allout destruction without any over ambitious science fiction ideas or savetheearthfromhumans propaganda. I appreciated that although I wished there was more SciFi and less Marines. Aliens struck a much more satisfying balance between the two and had better plotting better pacing and a cooler foe.Two while the movie didn't take a lot of time to develop characters the actors were strong performers that felt tangible and empathetic. I felt I was there with them and that's where a lot of genre movies fail. They felt more like real people than actors playing people from a memorized script.But as a science fiction movie about alien visitation not necessarily war it's way way down on the interest list.

	schema:headline " This is not a bad movie if you take off your critics hat";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all this is NOT a movie about Colombia. The producers may have failed on representing it but this is not the POINT of this movie. It's an action movie about a girl from Colombia and that's pretty much it regarding Colombia. Don't get all frustrated with it. Here's my quick review 1  Trailer I wanted to see this movie mostly based on the trailer which I found catchy. Action and sexy Zoe Saldana sells it all. Still I went on a cheap night because I wasn't convinced this would be worth the full price entry. What you see in the trailer is what you get. A lot of action left to be seen and overall it's a good intro to the movie.2  Cast  Characters Ahhh Zoe Zoe! It's hard to watch her rather than just stare at her. She delivers a pretty solid performance in this movie. She goes all around sneaking up the bad guys and taking them out in creative and yet plausible ways unlike Angelina Jolie in Salt 2010 where her 100 pounds character takes out multiple 250 pounds guys in fist fights. The supporting characters are your typical Mexican Colombian in this story! guys that pretty much do nothing other than holding guns outside a villa and sipping on drink and cigars. Generic police guys fill the rest of the cast but I found Callum Blue quite enjoyable to watch.3  Plot  Story I think the story is so generic that the little twists added to the script makes them even more surprising. You always feel like you know the next move but most of the time something unexpected happens. Unfortunately the script as a whole is a bit sloppy and poorly paced. I didn't get bored at all in this movie and though the intrigue isn't much catchy it was enough to keep me interested. There are many laughable moments mostly intended which is fun but the drama is really cheesy.4  Theme  Genre As an action flick this one stands right. It isn't a melting pot of car crashes and explosions out of nowhere. There is plenty of action and a good mix between Hollywood fireworks and realistic fights. The camera angles and editing sometimes get confusing but in some scenes they really add something cool to watch.5  Overall Appreciation Alright let's face the obvious. There is no Oscars material here. This will get MTV Teen Choice Awards at best. It's a cheap night movie that is entertaining to watch and where you should not expect a classic in cinema. Did I appreciate it? Yes! Is it good? Not bad. I give it 6 out of 10 for Zoe Saldana good fight scenes and cinematography. Too bad the supporting characters cheesy drama and poor script kills it a bit.".

	schema:headline " Your runofthemill EuropaCorp action flick";
	schema:reviewBody "If there is one French director the nonFrench general public knows about it's Luc Besson. Even if the name means nothing to you chances are you've heard of the films he's had a hand in. Among his most famous films are Lon The Professional which introduced American audiences to Jean Reno and Natalie Portman Nikita which has been remade into an American film and two American TV shows so far and The Fifth Element which nearly 15 years later remains one of the most famous sciencefiction films as well as one of the 10 most expensive French films.At the dawn of the new millennium Besson started his own production company EuropaCorp which in the last ten years or so has funded its fair share of diverse movies both in the French and English language. Nevertheless Europa as it's known in short is best known to mass audiences for its numerous highoctane mediumbudget action films most of which are written or cowritten by Besson himself often with Karate Kid screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. Among these are the Taxi Transporter and District B13 series of films Wasabi Taken From Paris With Love Danny The Dog also known as Unleashed Bandidas Kiss Of The Dragon Yamakasi Crimson Rivers 2 Hitman... Through these films Besson is also responsible for introducing the world to Parkour which seems to have taken over action cinema in the past 5 years and even making its way to films such as Step Up 3D.Colombiana is another product from Besson's action film factory. The story starts in 1992 in Bogota where some mob guy Don Luis orders a hit against a former associate of his who he considers has betrayed him and naturally his whole family. Only young Cataleya Restrepo escapes the bloody shootout during an intense Parkour chase what else? and manages to reach her uncle in Chicago to whom she swears that she'll become a hitman and avenge her family. Fastforward and enter Zoe Saldana as adult Cataleya as the rest of the film takes place strangely enough in 2007. With her uncle's help Cataleya has indeed grown up to be an awesomely skilled contract killer having performed 22 jobs in 4 years. However she signs each of her kills with a message destined for her real prey making her one of the FBI's most wanted. When the FBI decides to divulge her serial killer status Don Luis and his men know what's up and all hell breaks loose.Much has been said of the film's similarity with Besson's Lon and Nikita with many people musing that the film could just have well have been a sequel to Lon with Natalie Portman's character all grownup and kicking butt something fans have been dreaming about for years. Now I haven't seen Nikita but while there are similarities between Lon's Mathilda and Colombiana's Cataleya the two films are definitely not on the same level. Colombiana is really your typical runofthemill Besson action production which is really not a bad thing. It is not in the toptier of these films where I place films such as Taken and Danny The Dog but still a perfectly entertaining romp.Viewers concerned with director Olivier Megaton due to the perceived lack of action in Transporter 3 his previous film need not be concerned. The action here is almost nonstop pretty much to the detriment of plot. While the story has potential and could make for a film with a lot more depth whatever plot is here is minimal to the max recycled clich and basically a hodgepodge of all previous hitmanrevengeontherunfromthelaw films you've ever seen. There is absolutely zero character development whatsoever and if you didn't know that Cataleya's parents were murdered by Don Luis you would have no idea why any of the characters are doing what they're doing. I'm not exaggerating the Transformers films heavily criticized for this reason have more character development.But lack of plot depth isn't really a negative here. More depth would have certainly made it a better film but Colombiana is still entertaining as a simple straightforward dumb B action flick. Like all EuropaCorp films production values are topnotch. The expected Parkour chase is kept fresh by having it unfold with a child. Zoe Saldana gives a great physical performance and spends a great deal of time flitting in and out of vents and the various hits shown in the film are all quite cool. The other actors also do fine though Michael Vartan's character has very little purpose and is actually barely in the movie. Also this might be the only movie you'll ever see in which toothbrushes are used as weapons.In short know what to expect from Colombiana which literally means Colombian woman by the way and you'll enjoy it fine. It's a straightup action movie no more no less very low on plot high on action that falls straight into the heap with the scores of other similar Bessonproduced films though it doesn't possess the touches of humor that most of his other productions have. In comparison to the other hitman movies of the year it's superior to The Mechanic but way inferior to Hanna though it contains a lot more action than Hanna which shouldn't be seen as an action film. This is no Lon The Professional 2 fans can keep hoping that Besson and Portman work that one out at some point interestingly Megaton is first in line to direct if that movie does happen.".

Didn't exactly end up that way.With some of the names behind this film I was surprised at the abundance of cheesy bad guys predictable scenes and flat supporting characters. The only thing that moves this story along is Zoe Saldana herself with her tremendous presence on screen and beauty which is breathtaking. She's very believable as a stonecold assassin especially the way she sneaks and crawls around with ninja like precision.It's too bad they couldn't place Zoe and her character into a better storyline and provide her with stronger support. Without giving away the ending there's also a final fist fight scene in the end which looked like it was filmed and edited by two highschool kids. Isn't this 2011? The technology there was very lacking or done in poor choice.I still would recommend seeing the movie as its not badbad and there are some cool kill scenes but I wouldn't qualify it as a mustsee. The movie is somewhat groundbreaking only for the fact we have a Latina female as the lead role in an action film hopefully this finally opens to the door for other darker skinned actresses in similar roles which has been long overdue.".

Saldana will probably come a long way after this in terms of action roles and it's nice to see an actress who can act as well as kick ass. Lennie James is a bit on the didgy side with an accent that sometimes sounds like a drunken person at an Indian restaurant doing a bad impression of the waiter.

	schema:reviewBody "Zoe Saldana is a star on the rise she's strong beautiful intelligent and a decent actress. Time to test her star meter as she takes the lead for the first time on her own in an action film. In Hollywood it's rare to have an action movie staring a female you need a good actress to take the lead in order for it to be taken seriously. But my boyfriend really wanted to see this movie because he just adores Zoe I think he just has a good crush on her but it was his turn for the rental. We watched it a couple nights ago and to my surprise without any knowledge of the film prior to seeing it I really did enjoy this movie. I'm a little surprised at the rating as this is a better movie that I've seen for a while at least for 2011. I thought Zoe made a great action star she was tough sexy and brought a lot to a typical story.Fabio a gangster and drug runner has a meeting with Don Luis to pay off his remaining debt and leave his employment. Fabio however knows that Don Luis will put a hit out on him for leaving with a valuable item that he holds and wants a small disk with valuable information on the drug lords so he rushes home to prepare his wife Alicia and his young daughter Cataleya. Fabio hands Cataleya the item that Don Luis wants telling her not to lose it and to give it to the Ambassador telling her that it is her passport. He also gives Cataleya an address in Chicago. She then uses the business card her father gave her to get into the U.S. Embassy and goes to the Ambassador's office. In exchange for this they give her a passport and a small amount of cash and fly her to Miami. She goes to Chicago after and meets her uncle Emilio who teaches her how to become one of the slickest killers. She grows into a strong woman who eventually goes in above her head going into a personal revenge plot on her parent's death.The story may be predictable but I liked the way it was handled over all. The action scenes were very tight and exciting. I loved that first scene with Cataleyna in the jail cell it was very clever and almost reminded me of Catwoman the way she was just sliding her way through things. One thing I wished they would have talked about more was her feeling so lonely it's a very brief conversation she has with her lover when he asks what she feels every night and it's never touched on again. She goes through this tough time as a child and it was just like to see her as an adult was more about the fighting and not the struggles she faces at times. But the actors did a good job much credit to the man who played her uncle Cliff Curtis who had excellent chemistry with her. The film does need to explain more with the story but I felt that this was still a good movie with it's action and characters. Zoe is a good actress and I can't wait to see her more in the future.710".

It brings an other way to direct movies which works at the international Box Office. Thanks Luc Besson. But this society do not product always good movies. In fact they often product the same kind of films  simple action movies.So what about Colombiana?This is so cool ! This is really entertaining. Of course the script is very simple but it works. It is exactly in line of all the Europacorp productions but this one is pretty cool !Zoe Saldana is really good for this role. She is beautiful and she kicks ass. The movie is well directed except for one fight where the plans are linked too fast and we cannot really see what is happening.Colombiana is a really dynamic film the actions sequences are not boring yes it is paradoxical but it happens sometimes I love you but I am thinking about you Michael Bay.If you want to enjoy a good action movie you can watch without doubt this one !".

	schema:reviewBody "There are times when Colombiana almost works but that's not good enough. The film stumbles in some ways that actually surprised me. For an action film Colombiana is inexcusably lumbering. Its rhythm is all over the place sometimes it's beautiful sometimes it's broody but most of the time it's just kinda boring.I really like Zoe Saldana even though her body is a better actress than she is. She moves like a ballerina and fights like an anorexic tiger and she even achieves mild success in playing drunk comedicly in a campy sort of way. It's too bad that most of the film demands little of what she's good at and more of something that requires an actor. Colombiana is burdened by too many scenes of poorly written overexpository dialogue and false emotion. In a way the vast bulk of the film becomes a build up for the climax. We know where we're going but it's how we get there that is important or so they say. I think if the pay off was better it might've helped the movie a little as well but no. the Climax feels rushed and loud and almost devoid of excitement.Another thing worth mentioning is that Colombiana is one of those films where the hero gets from a to b using either coincidence or methods that are kept from the audience which is frustrating. I love the fact that in one moment Zoe has mere seconds to escape a garage turns to the air vent and the bolts just happen to be loose enough to unscrew with her fingertips. Columbiana left me with a feeling of shock. It's not a complete failure but it doesn't end up delivering what it should have. It's almost a popcorn movie where the audience eats popcorn to stay awake. I can't say I recommend it.".

Colombiana is a spectacular action vehicle led by Saldana as an assassin out to exact revenge on the men who brutally murdered her family. The story is familiar revenge territory but I liked the characters and their dedication to meet their goals. The police always behind the tail but still one step behind the killer. There's some blistering action throughout the opening is quiet yet tense as Cataleya purposely enters a prison and sneaks around narrowly avoiding detection. The villa scene with the pool sharks is very stealthy and stylish but the finale is where the showdown really starts as gunfire wildly chaotic explosions and violence break out in spectacular style Olivier Megaton's fast cut editing is just breathless and I love the sunbaked cinematography. This is one of my all time favourite films Zoe Saldana is pure talent in the role convincing as a killer yet innocent and sweet. Amandla Stenberg is absolutely brilliant as young Cataleya whose performance opens the first twenty odd minutes Stenberg is a little revelation and a thrill to watch as she evades gunmen and goes on her own journey. Yet another marvellous female led action movie that delivers fierce action and a solid storyline bolstered down by exceptional performances.".

There is a lot of tense music throughout which creates a good atmosphere.The action is extremely fast paced and done in an over the top style there's a lot of fightingkilling mainly at the finale some of which is very brutal. The dogs in the van is a particularly memorable scene. The story develops at a nice pace and the film overall offers a bit more than I expected. I as the viewer really liked Cataleya as we saw her develop a lot throughout the film. Amandla Stenberg is fantastic as young Cataleya. The film really heats up when we are taken 15 years on and Zoe Saldana takes over. She is absolutely superb in the role of the stone cold assassin out for revenge. She's got the looks moves  style.

	onyx:emotionText "Colombiana  A young girl witnesses her parents getting killed and is determined for revenge in the future. The plot is simple and very easy to follow. There is a lot of tense music throughout which creates a good atmosphere.The action is extremely fast paced and done in an over the top style there's a lot of fightingkilling mainly at the finale some of which is very brutal. The dogs in the van is a particularly memorable scene. The story develops at a nice pace and the film overall offers a bit more than I expected. I as the viewer really liked Cataleya as we saw her develop a lot throughout the film. Amandla Stenberg is fantastic as young Cataleya. The film really heats up when we are taken 15 years on and Zoe Saldana takes over. She is absolutely superb in the role of the stone cold assassin out for revenge. She's got the looks moves  style. If you don't take the film too seriously then it will be enjoyable. Overall Colombiana kept me entertained from start to finish. A very good action flick. 810";

	schema:headline " An entertaining revenge thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "When ten year old Cataleya's father 'retires' from his job as a hitman for a Colombian drug lord he knows he and his family will have to get away fast. He isn't fast enough though and Cataleya is left an orphan fleeing for her life. Before he died her father gave her an address and a memory card her passport to a new life in the United States. Once in the states she heads to her uncle in Chicago hoping he will help her in her mission to kill those responsible. He makes her go to school and the next time we see her fifteen years have passed but her desire for revenge hasn't dimmed. The first target we see her take out is in police custody locked in an apparently secure jail cell. She doesn't just kill him she draws the outline of an orchid on his chest and it is at this point we learn that this man is far from her first victim and the FBI led by Special Agent James Ross are searching for the killer not for one moment thinking they are hunting a woman.As this film was written by Luc Besson it isn't surprising that it reminds many people of his films 'Nikita' and 'Leon' and while I don't think this was as good as those films it is still entertaining. Zoe Saldana does a solid job as protagonist Cataleya although unfortunately the character isn't all that sympathetic when she isn't killing people for revenge she is doing it for money and being fairly sadistic in the process. Lennie James is also good in the roll of Agent Ross not an action man but a thinking detective. Michael Vartan also features although he is somewhat underused as Cataleya's love interest Danny Delanay. While the characters aren't too well developed and the situation is rather clich it is still an entertaining film as the action moves at a good pace and was pretty exciting without being overly gory. Overall I'd say if you like action led thrillers and aren't looking for anything too cerebral to pass a couple of hours you could do a lot worse than this.".

He begs Cataleya for information about herself at just about the same time as the audience. There's a giant gap of 15 years time between Cataleya's arrival in America and her present day activities. Without any onscreen training the jump in the character feels undeserved as do her relationships. Cataleya is simply already with Danny. The guys she's after are hardly worth mentioning since all parties are isolated.

This shouldn't be a surprise as both films are written by Luc Besson nor should it be a shock that the earlier film is far better in large part due to tension and bonding. The amount of action that must take place off camera to maintain the PG13 of this very tonally serious film is heartbreaking.

	schema:reviewBody "I am actually a little bit embarrassed to admit that I even watched this movie. It was cowritten by Luc Besson of Leon The Professonial fame so I let myself get sucked into it. Live and learn. The movie is about Cataleya a young girl who witnesses her parents get murdered by a drug cartel in South America. Cataleya escapes and flees to the United States where she meets up with her Uncle who trains her to be an Assassin. Eventually she seeks revenge on the people who murdered her parents.Basically this is the same plot as Leon The Professional and about a 100 other movies. It reminded me of ORen Ishii's back story in Kill Bill Vol. 2. You know the whole sequence that Tarintino does as a cartoon? Yeah that's this movie only sucky. I should mention that I enjoyed Zoe Saldana in the lead role in this. I think that she did a lot with very little to work with. If you had to force me to come up with a reason to watch this movie that would be it. Otherwise Colombiana is largely derivative mess of a movie. There are some scenes in this film that are just laughable. For example at one point Cliff Curtis who plays the uncle pulls out a hand cannon in the middle of the street and shoots at a passing car multiple times. The driver now presumably dead crashes the car in front of a slew of onlookers. Cliff Curtis then proceeds to have a conversation in the middle of the street with young Cataleya about the benefits of going to grade school. Eventually after several minutes they just walk away apparently nobody has noticed them. You get 108 minutes of that. Don't waste your time with this movie. If you want to see a great example of this genre that brings some freshness and originality check out Hanna an underrated and great movie from last year.".

Although he is not directing this film he wrote the script and produced it and more important infiltrated into it some of the stylish and cynical touch which is characteristic to his best films. By providing a feminine character that descends from comics Laura Croft comes to mind in many of the sequences with a realistic life story and placing choreographic and well directed action scenes in the dire atmosphere of the drug wars Besson took a bet. A bet which he won with the help of a not so experimented director Olivier Megaton which makes me believe that his hand may have been also behind the directing exercise as well.The first few minutes prepare the ground by showing how the parents of preteen girl Cataleya are murdered in her native Colombia and how she finds the way to the US to find her uncle a more than honorable mobster in Chicago and achieve the dream of becoming a professional killer to revenge the parents' death. 15 or so years later she has become that killer and has more than 20 corpses in her CV just that all of these are bag guys which she kills just to draw the attention of her object of revenge. All these seems very unrealistic and so they are  pure comics stuff. However this film is much more than a comicsinspired action film.Part of the reason Colombiana works can be found in the excellent rendition of the environment and the careful buildup and precise acting of the supporting characters. I especially liked the one of the FBI agent played by Lennie James an actor used much and well in TV series Jericho was one of them. The best acting however belongs without doubt to Zoe Saldana. The greenish thin girl from Cameron's Avatar used here her real face and body and all is to the benefit of the viewers. The combination of the incredible the hero the action scenes and credible the accurate landscape and social environment a script line that makes sense works well and I need to credit again Besson for making sure all corners are carefully rounded. The ending leaves hope for a sequel and I hope rumors about Colombiana 2 are true. There are rumors also about Avatar 2. As I know Hollywood there are chances for both sequels to come to reality and for once it would not be a bad thing.".

	schema:headline " Violent Spaghetti Western filled with thrills  frantic action  grisly killings and lots of shots";
	schema:reviewBody "Offbeat Western about a strange but deadly gunfighter and taking on a nasty bandit called Aguila and his hoodlums . The movie contains gunplay action Western  chills  and bloody spectacle . Unknown to anybody else but himself  no one knew the stranger  not the band of killers he destroyed o the woman he ruined . The Stranger Tony Anthony arrives in an abandoned village where he witnesses the massacre of Mexican soldiers by a heinous bunch commanded by Aguila Frank Wolff . The Stranger threatens Aguila to denounce him if he does not accept to let him take part in the robbing of a shipment of gold carried by a group of Unin soldiers to deliver the Mexican army . The scheme is a success but when The Stranger claims his due of the theft  he gets a good punches instead . But The Stranger is not the kind to get trapped so easily. Tempt him  whip him  brand him  break him  but makes damn sure the stranger doesn't crawl out of town alive  .The film packs violence  shootouts  high bodycount  and it's slowmoving but when take place gunplay results to be fast moving and quite entertaining . Acceptable Spaghetti Western  it follows the Sergio Leone wake  including closeup  zooms  choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . Tony Anthony is very fine giving even some cynic touches  he ravages the screen  he shoots  hits and run and ultimately takes the law on his own hands . The Stranger is caught and there takes place the ordinary Pestaggio in which protagonist receives hitting  punches  beating  knocks but he manages to escape with the gold  then the bandits who want his skin chase him . This movie gets the ordinary Western issues such as avengers antiheroes  violent facing off  quick scenes and exaggerated baddies . This is a good Spaghetti Western with some moments genuinely entertaining if you can avoid thinking too much . It's an improbable blending of standard Western with pursuits high bodycount and though sometimes minimalist turns out to be quite amusing . Made on a fairly middling scale with passable set design  adequate photography filmed in Elios studios and evocative musical score . Screenplay with interesting premise about a 'strange gunfighter'  it follows a similar plot to classic For a fistful of dollars . It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the starring Tony Anthony and his enemy Frank Wolff who steals the show as a sensationalistic villain . The notorious Spaghetti actor  Tony Anthony  is good in his usual tough as well as silent role and he starred some decent Westerns . Anthony did work for many years on Spaghetti Westerns some with coproduction company LupoAnthonyQuintano Production . He produced and starred in two 3Dimensional movies both of which enjoyed a modest theatrical release . After making various films  Anthony effectively retired from the movie industries . In addition  a nice casting full of usual Italian secondary such as Fortunato Arena  Aldo Berti  Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia as Aguilar henchman and the beautiful girls Jolanda Modio and Gia Sandri as Maruca . Special mention to Raf Baldassarre in his ordinary role as a cruelly baddie  he is terrific  and bears a hysterical and mocking aspect  subsequently he would play similar characters . Appropriate cinematography by Marcello Masciocchi  but is necessary a perfect remastering  being the copy a little washedout . Rare musical score plenty of strange sounds  whistle  shouts voices in Morricone style  it was composed by Benedetto Ghiglia .The motion picture was well realized by Luigi Vanzi as Vance Lewis . Direction by Luigi is finely crafted here he is more cynical and violent and also inclined toward humor and packs too much action . Vanci is a craftsman who makes a nice camera work with clever choreography on the showdown  fighting  moving shootouts and bemusing scenes . Vanci directed a trilogy about The Stranger starred by Tony Anthony  they are the followings  A Man a Horse a Gun or The Stranger Returns with Daniele Vargas  Marina Berti  Dan Vadis and again Raf Baldassarre  and The Silent Stranger with Tony Anthony Lloyd Battista Kenji Ohara  Raf Baldassarre  this third film Tony journeys to Japan intent on returning an ancient scroll to its rightful owner . Furthermore  other films directed by Ferdinando Baldi in which appears Tony Anthony in similar character are Get mean and Blindman. A stranger on town is an outlandish  surprising and uneven story but will appeal to Spaghetti Western aficionados . Rating  6  riotous Western in which there's too much action and violence and excitement enough".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie rocks! Tony Anthony is the other man with no name. He is great in this movie. His performance is every bit as good as Eastwood in A fistful of Dollars but he'll never get as much recognition because he's not a squarejawed prettyboy like Clint. Frank Wolff is also in top form in this film as usual.This is sort of a minimalist spaghetti western. The story is simple but great. It never gets boring. There is very little dialog and that works well in this film giving it an ultracool vibe without being too slick. Yes there are a few small similarities to A Fistful of Dollars but it is by no means a copy of that great film as some other reviewers might have you believe. This movie has a personality all its own and the situations here are very different.The music score is incredible. It manages to be great and very stylish in a spaghetti western sort of way without owing anything to Ennio Morricone. It is really quite memorable and original and one of the few nonMorricone scores that would be worth owning the soundtrack to.There's lots of great lines and cool action in this movie. Tony Anthony really takes a licking and keeps on ticking. One of my favorite parts involves the lovely Gia Sandri as Maruca a butch looking for the 1800's SM babe. Anthony kills her by using her fetish to his advantage. I also love how Frank Wolff's great line I'm a fair man comes back to haunt him later. It's classic stuff all the way.If you like spaghetti westerns you've got to see this one!".

Tony Anthony really takes a licking and keeps on ticking. One of my favorite parts involves the lovely Gia Sandri as Maruca a butch looking for the 1800's SM babe. Anthony kills her by using her fetish to his advantage. I also love how Frank Wolff's great line I'm a fair man comes back to haunt him later. It's classic stuff all the way.If you like spaghetti westerns you've got to see this one!";

Jeah there are just a few sentences spoken in this one but that's not a big problem. However when there are dialogs they are great funny and full of sadism. The story is not that spectacular but the actors are doing their best. Frank Wolff armed with a machine gun shoots shoots and shoots. However he is not able to stop the strangerTony Anthony. And Tony takes revenge with his sawedoff shot gun. Moreover Un dollaro tra i denti has a wonderful music score by Benedetto Ghiglia.Just breathtaking. This is definitely not a bad spaghettiwestern. Let's say an underrated masterpiece. But keep in mind you have to see it UNCUT. Otherwise it will be really boring.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was familiar with this film's reputation long before I finally saw it and am amused to be impressed with what it finally turned out to be. A few years back I purchased Roger Ebert's I Hated Hated Hated This Movie a collection of his zero star bomb reviews of stuff that failed to pass even minimal muster with him. A DOLLAR BETWEEN THE TEETH was reviewed under it's Americanized title A STRANGER IN TOWN and Ebert fled the film twice with the same kind of revulsion I feel when encountering fruit.I can sympathize with him This is an ultracheap mean spirited nearly artless little study in applied bad taste  nihilism masquerading as a cowboy movie for grownups. It doesn't even have a particularly involving musical score the one thing that the Italians usually managed to get right with their Westerns. The first thing our star gunslinger encounters when entering the seemingly deserted town the film takes place in is a dead body. Then he beats the sole patron of a saloon to death with a tequila bottle and the movie never gets any friendlier.The star is one Tony Anthony an actor I had never heard of before and with my cynic's attitude about European genre entertainment the natural assumption was that Tony Anthony was a pseudonym. It isn't. He stands about 5'9 looks like he may have been a boxer at one time and speaks with a Brooklyn accent. His blond hair dye isn't fooling anyone but he knows how to take a beating like Brando. By studying Anthony's IMDb reference page one learns that he made about a dozen movies during his career and was an advocate of the 3D revival of the early 1980s that resulted in Friday THE 13TH PART THREE with it's 3D popcorn popping effects and the infamous spear to the eye. Anthony made three Stranger films this one being the first and with or without Mr. Ebert's acquiescence they have amassed a bit of a cult following due to their unremitting brutality grim overtones and nihilistic deadpan remorselessness for being morally bankrupt.Just like Tony Anthony himself  at least on camera  so it makes sense that the films managed to resonate with some viewers. They are honest about their intentions. One of the misconceptions about the fascination with Spaghetti Westerns is that audiences become enamored with their overtly arty  superficially poetic nature. That may be true but the fondness I feel for Spaghetti is more rooted in a dislike for the traditionalist approach to making Westerns which usually have a moral centerpoint. As such it is fascinating to find one that quite literally has none Nobody in this movie is heroic or noble there is no justice or redemption only a bunch of filthy sweaty drunk bloodthirsty bastards fighting it out in some dusty nowhere for a couple of sacks of gold.I find the honesty to be delightfully refreshing. Here at last is a Western about lust greed hatred contempt All of the reptilian aspects of the human psyche glossed over by the traditional approach with it's pap sentimentality laughable romantics and lunkheaded attention to detail. By contrast A DOLLAR BETWEEN THE TEETH is stripped of all but the bare essentials needed to tell the story which is gleefully ripped off from FISTFUL OF DOLLARS lock stock and smoking barrel.But on the ultra dirt cheap. Almost all of the handguns seen are modernday police revolvers and you can see the department store blue jeans labels on some of the costumes. There are maybe four locations used in the film and two are outdoor locations easily recognizable from ten dozen other Italian made Westerns. The two others are collections of ramshackle buildings in a wonderful state of disrepair that are probably no more than a few hundred yards away from each other in real world terms. Yet here they make up a little universe of their own sort of like how the Holodeck on Star Trek is always the same room no matter what it is programmed to look like. Throw in a couple of sand pits filmed from various different angles and a totally minimalist music score comprised of only those elements needed to propel the action forward and we are talking about a pared down work that reminds me more of the artwork of someone like Sol Lewitt or Mel Bochner than anything Sergio Leone may have produced.One name jumps out at me from the production credits Allen Klein. It is indeed the same Allen Klein who was brought in to save The Beatles from bankruptcy in 1969 and after thinking about his connection to the film things started to make a bit more sense. He and Tony Anthony must have been acquaintances of some kind and for whatever reason Klein put up the money to make this film  probably hoping to cash in on the surprise box office success of FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and the other Leone favorites. In 1967 you literally could make a movie like this in a place like Italy for about 15000 or so provided you had industry people who perhaps owed you a couple of favors or were enamored by the clients associated with you i.e. The Rolling Stones and I can quite literally see this as a filmed investment scheme with Tony Anthony fronting the project for Klein.However it came about the movie was made and as an object lesson in low budget filmmaking it is a fascinating if somewhat ghoulish little production that somehow against the efforts of no less than Roger Ebert has managed to withstand the test of time. It's an awful film to be sure but you do have to sort of marvel at it's insistence to be not just in bad taste but in the worst taste possible.710".

After a beating he escapes with the gold and is pursued by the gang......Whilst there are obvious similarities between this movie and the Dollars Trilogy  in particular a Fistful of Dollars  this is an enjoyable film in its own right. It lacks the class of Leone and the cool of Eastwood but Anthony and Director Luigi Vanzi never tried to mimic these aspects concentrating instead on the action and violence. Indeed Anthony's Stranger never appears invincible and remains likable throughout what is a very simplistic story.The star of the show however is Frank Wolff  a man that does not know the meaning of a bad performance. Based largely on Volente's Ramon Aguila is equally as barbaric but just a little more clumsy. And a fair man!. Of course! There is very little dialogue in the whole movie playing on the clich of what we or I imagine more realistically what the general American audience of that time expect from a Spaghetti Western. Quite intentionally. The fact that there are few words puts great pressure on the quality of Benedetto Ghiglia's score  which thankfully stands up to this task.All in all A Stranger in Town makes up for what it lacks in class and story with entertaining characters and good fight sequences. The beginning sequence where the Mexican soldiers are led into town by a group of singing monks  who soon cast off their robes and reveal themselves as Aguila and his gang  immediately persuades the viewer that this will be an enjoyable film. The final confrontation between the two main stars is equally as effective.It is not and doesn't pretend to be one of the greatest Spaghetti Westerns.

	schema:reviewBody "Tony Anthony which you may know as the titular character of 'Blindman' probably is the most feminine of all SW antiheroes and still one of the coolest. He's just so damn relaxed that the coolness comes naturally there's little of that typical affectation on his part. He is a slouch stoic but not stilted he's wearing a pink shirt has bleached blond hair and there's no sign of any homophobic tendencies when he shoots a baddie who falls into his lap he doesn't react with either irony or macho behaviour to ensure us how masculine he is. After he got beat up badly he rescues a woman who later wordlessly rides on a horse with him on the back of the horse and her in front him holding on to her hips to not fall off but not in any sexual way. In the sequel 'The Stranger Returns' he's even carrying around a parasol for much of the running time. I find it funny that its movie poster even asks the question Is he interested in women?Despite all that he's a real badass who most of the time is unquestionably more skilled and smarter than any of his enemies. There's no doubt he'll prevail in the end and we still care we'd even care if he hadn't been beaten up see sequel which is a scene that most SWs have to make us care about our antihero because most viewers tend not to care about characters who have the upper hand all of the time. It's worth to note that Tony Anthony more than most stars of a movie not only shapes his own character but apparently the films as a whole as a producer and writer. Ever since this film he always starred in the movies he played in that guy wouldn't play second fiddle to anyone.Dialogue in the film is EXTREMELY sparse although it doesn't have more action than your average SW. After the first 15 minutes there is a section in the film that is the most essential to the plot and it has the most dialogue. Cut away that 10minute section and the complete dialogue adds up to maybe 20 lines. The main music theme rocks melancholically and is catchy arguably it's a bit overused but this never bothers me in a film if the tune is good. The additional score arrangements are also effective but the film doesn't shy away from silent sections either. Certainly there's nothing special about the film except that it WORKS it's just a lot of cool fun. Every bit as good as the surprisingly enjoyable sequel.".

Basically he gets captured again beaten up narrowly escapes again and then backtracks to the abandoned town for the big showdown making it pretty obvious the low budget only two real locations both abandoned towns. The ending is pretty weak and sloppily executed so his outwitting' of the bandits throughout the town doesn't really come off very cool or smart.One thing is for certain they didn't have to pay the voice dubbers or dialogue writers very much because for a solid twentyfive mins of the film when he arrives at the bandit hideout there are only a handful of sentences spoken for the duration and it becomes agonizingly dull and the soundtrack theme so annoying you want to strangle the composer.A Spaghetti Western curiosity in that it was successful enough to spawn two better sequels. I'd say Stranger in Town is for completists only.".

The ending is pretty weak and sloppily executed so his outwitting' of the bandits throughout the town doesn't really come off very cool or smart.One thing is for certain they didn't have to pay the voice dubbers or dialogue writers very much because for a solid twentyfive mins of the film when he arrives at the bandit hideout there are only a handful of sentences spoken for the duration and it becomes agonizingly dull and the soundtrack theme so annoying you want to strangle the composer.A Spaghetti Western curiosity in that it was successful enough to spawn two better sequels. I'd say Stranger in Town is for completists only.";

The Stranger keeps hidden and manages to watch everyone even a woman who is a bisexual woman who has a man named Aguilar Frank Wolff and a young girl with a baby.

When I first saw shots of this film on the site I was a bit apprehensive that Tony Anthony could actually pull off being a hero in one of these films. Then I bought the film off Amazon along with its sequel The Stranger Returns. At first I couldn't get into Anthony. He reminded me of a Mob informant from Jersey on TV crime dramas from the 70s rather than a cool and calm spaghetti western hero. But when he gets the living daylights beaten out of him and goes on the rampage my view changed. I have to say this is one of my alltime favorite films along with its sequels and the immortal 'Blindman'. It's no Leone work that's for sure but it has its own unique quality. It's simple and violent and I think that's all that really matters. If you're looking for something like Unforgiven or Open Range move on.

In the original text Monkey was captured by the great lord Buddha and entraped under the 5 Fingers Mountain Hand of Buddha for 500 years where he was tamed and then saved by the Longevity Monk.In the movie adaption he was appointed the protector of the Longevity Monk but strayed from the path of holiness when he fell in love with a demoness and tried to sell out his master the demons believed by eating his flesh they would gain immortality. Monkey was eventually captured and was to be destroyed when his master intervened begging for his disciple's mercy and sacrificing himself to save his disciple. The Goddess of Mercy then decided to send the Monkey 500 years forward in time to live a life of sufferings as a mortal before passing judgement.The story comes in 2 parts and has to be watched together to be fully understood the 1st part had quite a cliffhanger going on.

As a mortal he attempted to resist his fate and change his future as an immortal he tried to forget his mortal longings and focus on his mission.

	schema:headline " Watched a Downloaded Copy with Crap Subtitles. Still Great!";
	schema:reviewBody "First off let me say that I watched this movie not under the best circumstances. I downloaded it from Piratebay and was watching it on my Media Player when I realized within the first 2 minutes that the subs were awful. There were many English typos and because of that it seemed to be a poor translation. HOWEVER the acting was so good and the scenes so good that even with rudimentary dialog that is to say basic translations it still made me laugh quite a lot and I can't remember when was the last time I enjoyed a movie THIS MUCH! It's been SO long! This must be one of my favorite movies. Top 10 at least. Maybe even top 3 if I dare say so but the problem with saying so and with saying it is absolutely one of my favorites and it is is that I am not sure many others will understand why it is one of my favorites or will even care to understand. It is one of my favorite movies for a number of reasons. Let me tell you why.1 It kept me in suspense. I am familiar with Goku the monkey king and how he was mischievous and had to pay penance for his sins and play a good guy for a while to gain freedom or whatever. That is as far as my knowledge of Goku the monkey king goes oh and I know he is supposed to have a circlet and lance and was reminded of that later. Big deal right? Wrong. This movie told me a story I have never been told before and kept me wildly guessing and entertained throughout! It is like a fairy tale. A very good fairy tale to movie translation. A very good play of sorts. What I enjoy about it the most is that I went into it not knowing what to expect. I thought it was about Buddhism? hello? but instead it was about....Well. It's hard to put into words. Read my first sentences about what I knew of the story of the monkey king. That much in this movie is still true. However there are many things I did not know that this movie tells and because my life is so boring and most things predictable that is to say most movies video games have predictable plot lines this was a movie with nice twists and turns that got me to be interested in storytelling and cinema again. And boy did it get me interested again in a big way! I am in awe with how good the writers must have been the original writers that is to say who came out with the skeleton of this story because there is some wild stuff in here.2 This movie is surprisingly funny. Actually I had another 2 and 3 in mind as to why this movie is one of my favorites but forget them both. Oh yeah! It reminds me of the wild and wacky stuff I used to watch as a kid in it's creativity! Namely the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. If you're a 90's kid like me and grew up on that show you may actually love this. It's similar because there is martial arts and funny bad guys and action scenes in this. Also the special effects are old school with makeups and costumes none of that CGI stuff. I can appreciate the old ways because it doesn't really detract from the story or acting here and that is what's strong.I suppose people may give this a 7 or 8 instead of a 10 maybe even worse but I am not too concerned about that. I know why others may not like this because it's too foreign or they are too busy to appreciate it's intricacies or they don't find it funny whatever the reason someone may not like this maybe they have heard the story differently and have a preconceived idea of how it should be who knows but I had fun watching this and that is why I watch movies to begin with. To have fun. To forget life for a bit. Watch it if you want to be entertained and are not scared of Chinese films as an American or if you can laugh at silly faces voices and remarks.".

	onyx:emotionText "First off let me say that I watched this movie not under the best circumstances. I downloaded it from Piratebay and was watching it on my Media Player when I realized within the first 2 minutes that the subs were awful. There were many English typos and because of that it seemed to be a poor translation. HOWEVER the acting was so good and the scenes so good that even with rudimentary dialog that is to say basic translations it still made me laugh quite a lot and I can't remember when was the last time I enjoyed a movie THIS MUCH! It's been SO long! This must be one of my favorite movies. Top 10 at least. Maybe even top 3 if I dare say so but the problem with saying so and with saying it is absolutely one of my favorites and it is is that I am not sure many others will understand why it is one of my favorites or will even care to understand. It is one of my favorite movies for a number of reasons. Let me tell you why.1 It kept me in suspense. I am familiar with Goku the monkey king and how he was mischievous and had to pay penance for his sins and play a good guy for a while to gain freedom or whatever. That is as far as my knowledge of Goku the monkey king goes oh and I know he is supposed to have a circlet and lance and was reminded of that later. Big deal right? Wrong. This movie told me a story I have never been told before and kept me wildly guessing and entertained throughout! It is like a fairy tale. A very good fairy tale to movie translation. A very good play of sorts. What I enjoy about it the most is that I went into it not knowing what to expect. I thought it was about Buddhism? hello? but instead it was about....Well. It's hard to put into words. Read my first sentences about what I knew of the story of the monkey king. That much in this movie is still true. However there are many things I did not know that this movie tells and because my life is so boring and most things predictable that is to say most movies video games have predictable plot lines this was a movie with nice twists and turns that got me to be interested in storytelling and cinema again. And boy did it get me interested again in a big way! I am in awe with how good the writers must have been the original writers that is to say who came out with the skeleton of this story because there is some wild stuff in here.2 This movie is surprisingly funny. Actually I had another 2 and 3 in mind as to why this movie is one of my favorites but forget them both. Oh yeah! It reminds me of the wild and wacky stuff I used to watch as a kid in it's creativity! Namely the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. If you're a 90's kid like me and grew up on that show you may actually love this. It's similar because there is martial arts and funny bad guys and action scenes in this. Also the special effects are old school with makeups and costumes none of that CGI stuff.

	schema:headline " The Funniest and Absolutely Epic Comedy in the Chinese Fantasy Genre.";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt in my mind that Stephen Chow is a true master of mixing surreal comedy romance and drama in most of his films that he has written and directed. But hold on he didn't write or direct this film that was made way back in the mid 90s! But it sure feels like a Chow directed film. In fact Jeffrey Lau wrote and directed and this is my first introduction to his films. It seems to me that Stephen Chow may have learnt much from Lau when directing his later movies and indeed style of comedy. Its just so similar but even the deserved global success of Chow's Kung Fu Hustler and Shaolin Soccer can't topple Lau's crowning achievement of this glorious comedy fantasy epic.But you do have to attune yourself to their style of comedy. At times the comedy is rather Naked Gun style but the BIG difference is that with a Naked GunAirplane style movie you are never emotionally involved with the character's journeyfates. This is a real epic Chinese fantasy adventure chock full of side splitting comedy drama time travel love triangles deceit tragedy and old school wirework martial arts. Not many movies can boast such a varied concoction and even fewer can pull it off in such a knockout cocktail. Close comparisons for me are Zu Warriors and A Chinese Ghost Story.The story actually moves at a breakneck speed despite the fact it is drawn out into a 2 part epic saga. Chow is at his very best in his dead pan Buster Keatonesque comic timing and furthermore gives an emotional underlining subtext in his performance much akin to the great Charlie Chaplin classics.The comedy is inventively laugh out loud but always rooted to the storyline and never stooping low for a cheap laugh. The storyline is set firmly in the Chineses mythological realm of gods and demons and apparently extracting a chapter from a famous Chinese story called Journey to the West putting its own spin on things. Its not a flawless movie though and one cannot expect it to be with such an ambitious premise and so much elements thrown in. While the first part of this epic is the more comedic the second part begins with a somewhat convoluted progression of the storyline and becomes quite confusing with too many women involved in a long multiple women juggling segment. It is my only gripe however.I personally would also have loved to see more of the arrogant fun and cool Monkey King persona but I can understand that more of him may not have served the story pacing well. Pity though as the Monkey King is a really fun character here than I've seen elsewhere including the fun Monkey Magic television series.My review covers both parts of this film as a whole. So in a nutshell this is a vastly entertaining sidesplittingly funny fast moving emotionally driven Chinese fantasy epic. And I will now be seeking to watch more Jeffery Lau films as well as Stephen Chow's early movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Chinese Odyssey Part One Pandora's Box is a fantasy martial arts extravaganza like A Chinese Ghost story. Just to give you an idea what to expect. The main character is Stephen Chow. He plays The Monkey King and Joker. Joker is The Monkey King reincarnated who doesn't know of his past life. It is through these roles where Stephen Chow shows his versatility as an actor. If you have seen some of his movies than you know what to expect. He always tries to combine humour martial arts and drama. Maybe for some the humor will be a bit over the top. But Stephen Chow's humour is very visual and will appeal to many viewers. A few scenes made me laugh so hard I almost choked. I even dare to say that some scenes in this film outclass Kung Fu Hustle when it comes to comedy. And that one was hilarious. I liked how during these scenes the actors maintain straight faces and are very serious about what they are doing. You know like they did in the Naked Gun film series. To me that makes all of it even funnier. Another thing I liked that the comedy does not come at the expense of action. Of which you will have plenty of. Most of the martial arts is done with wire works though and in combination with fighting demons this is done beautifully. The special effects may look a bit cheesy compared to CGI to some but are very enjoyable because most of the effects are used creatively. I personally prefer effects done this way since it shows that sometimes all you need is a little imagination to create movie magic. And Pandora's Box certainly is magical. In fact it's a fairytale you can enjoy over and over again.".

So it's great Mr Lau are talking and presenting this sort of themes in his personal and interesting own way but the movie is not for everyone. His extreme fantasy takes the viewers far away from reality it's all very distant like some alien world. The plot and the characters are very confusing sometimes this unbelievable environment seems artificial and doubtful so the movie has no real impact no meaningful influence it's like grabbing water with hand.

	schema:reviewBody "What an insane thing this is! The story of cinema has been written from a predominantly Western point of view this first hundred years. Were it to be evenly told somehow this would be in a short list of cult classics you have to see for sheer bonkers imagination.It's rooted in a Chinese classic about the Buddhist monk who brought back the first scriptures from India but that's just the springboard that supplies the context and characters of legend it has as much actual history as the Pythons' Holy Grail does about medieval times.Everything at first takes place in some remote outpost where a mysterious woman walks into the company of a petty thief and his gang. That night characters are revealed to be Devils the woman changes into a giant spider. Immortals and supernatural beings show up through both films. The hero is a scoundrel who gets beaten all the time and set on fire in that marvelous way Hong Kong has of mocking cool.There's time travel and a story about being incarnated as the Monkey King of legend meanwhile the famed Buddhist monk is shown to nag everyone with legalistic obtuseness. Illusory magic puts characters in each other's bodies. Half of it makes no sense at all but strangely it somehow does. A Bull King with his army comes stomping into the scene. Now and then it erupts in flying wuxia remarkable gliding and leaping through colored smoke. A battle takes place inside someone's body slashing through arteries!It's all as crazy as anything the Pythons and AbrahamsZucker did as devilish as Army of Darkness. It's drawing from its own Chinese folk tradition of course about ghosts immortals and magical belief. It begins with Guanyin this is the boddhisatva of compassion in Buddhism facing off with Monkey because Monkey can't stand the monk's nagging and wants out from the mission.How revealing to watch it with a Marvel comparison in mind who have many of the same stuff mythic beings gods and demigods where everything has to be laboriously explained. Everything here just springs from air shapeshifts in and out of illusion. Characters come and go with no obligation to some overarching purpose or feels like it. Self is malleable a matter of illusory disguise a foolish invention the story gives rise to so proper in a Buddhist context.Another context sees the women in control the men as dufuses. Men and women change bodies changing the social dynamics. Self being illusory anyone can be anything a devil of vast powers turn into just a girl in love. Yet the central tenet in the story is the pining for deep love.I could barely make sense of it but what I could hold onto is sweet and layered. The hero travels through time to save his loved one until he loses himself. But it seems that was someone he started to love out of duty to a story he made up because he said he was who she was waiting for Monkey. Being lost he meets another girl who is his true love and turns him into that person. There's body swapping at this point and she becomes possibly a Pigheaded henchman. His being torn between dutiful and true love is surreally transmuted in a scene with dual marriages supposed to take place.By the end we have veered off into a cosmic showdown where the sun is tethered close and burns everything up. And then we return to normative reality. The Monkey King has to resume his place dutifully in the journey of fantastic mythadventure while his mortal self stays behind with the love of his life. Parting illusory from real.This is taking whimsical nonsense as your dharma teacher.".

Throughout his journey Joker encounters magic spells and mythical creatures while finding a way to cram in Chow's trademark slapstick humour.One element that sets A Chinese Odyssey apart from Chow's standard fare though is its willingness to showcase raw emotions. Although his satirical humor in widely appreciated few of Chow's films are known to put aside screen time which depicts its characters as emotionally relatable to.Thankfully A Chinese Odyssey serves as something of an antiChow project. It allows its viewers to sympathise with Joker's ordeal. It's a step away from the accidentprone heroes who are there for the single purpose of enticing a few chuckles. Demonstrating his humanity throughout the film Joker nonetheless manages to deliver without sacrificing the fanfare that made Chow a household name.Too often we're offered films which veer towards one extreme.

It's one of those films that's beloved by Chinese viewers for the whimsical stylistics and endless humour but something gets lost in translation for those of us in the West I found this one of Chow's weakest productions. The whole thing feels low budget with a single torchlit cave setting and it has little to do with the original novel. Instead Chow plays his usual 'joker' character running around after dominant women. The emphasis is very much on sight gags and character interplay but none of it is remotely funny and the sight of actors mugging endlessly gets a bit much after a while. There are some fun fantasy elements to the story with monsters and giant spiders turning up but overall this is a lacklustre exercise.".

I could sit here and kick the heck out've it for not being faithful to the game which hooo boy it isn't but then all I'll get is a bunch of people going It's Tekken The Movie NOT Tekken The Game!.So I'll review it as a simple action movie. The plot was thin the character motivations were practically nil and the fight scenes were shot with far too many cuts. The acting ranged from over the top to poor.Interestingly for a movie that did not in any way respect the storyline of the game it went out of it's way to include homages to it. Hell entire characters were in it for no more than that. Anna Williams didn't have a fight or indeed even a line! She existed for no other reason to name drop and to wander about in her underwear. While we're on the subject of the Williams sister's what the heck is wrong with Nina's face?!? I have no idea if this is true but it looks like it's been constructed in the operating theatre apologies if it wasn't but DAMN.They also managed to incorrectly spell Cung Le's name in the credits.Not for Tekken fans as they'll get angry not for action movie fans as they'll get bored.".

It's much more serious than DOA and I still like that one better but that's mostly because of its allout trashappeal and because the fight choreography is a million times better. In Tekken many fights look like training exercises many cuts can't hide that you're not watching one fight but many separate actions. Plus there are some shots that are supposed to look dramatic or cool but the just look badly done.But all in all it's mildly entertaining it does look more expensive than it was the cosplayfactor is bearable and some ideas in the fights are nice to see. I would never buy it but for rent it's entertaining 90 minutes of mindless fun.".

I'm as surprised to be saying that as you probably are to be reading it.It probably helped that the bar is so low for video game adaptations and that the last such movie I saw was King of Fighters which was awful to an absurd degree. Tekken can't help but look good in comparison to that. It helps that it makes at least an effort to keep some of the story and characters from the games while offering frequent decent if not great fight scenes. The overuse of flashbacks gets a little old but that's a much more minor issue than I was expecting Tekken to have. I have to mention that Tekken looks pretty good with some impressive sets and a slick highbudget veneer. The main actors are adequate with John Foo as Jin being a capable fighter and believable enough as an earnest and ultimately goodhearted guy. Kelly Overton doesn't have a lot to do other than look hot in her greatly revised role as Christie but she's infinitely qualified in that particular area. She does okay in her action scenes too. Ian Anthony Dale is appropriately villainous as Kazuya and everyone else is at least acceptable.Tekken is basically just another fighting tournament movie placed in a video game setting. But that's all it really needs to be. The story is simple and straightforward and I think that's a good thing. Keep in mind that this isn't supposed to be a 100 accurate adaptation of the game and it'll probably entertain you.".

I didn't take any notice of the 'goofs' that were listed on this site while I was watching the film. Characters were imitated to a decent quality and the action was quite solid. But I feel what most critics are forgetting is that yes a 'good movie' requires a good plot..or so that's what the critics seem to believe.. This is based off a FIGHTING game. A fighting game that also focuses more on fighting than story. So you shouldn't expect much more from a movie based on just that. To sum it up I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't actually take my word for it.. In fact don't take any critic's word for it. I know from personal experience that only you will know whether you will enjoy a movie or not. People have different opinions and this is merely my opinion. I would be interested in an opendiscussion about this movie anyways though POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTI WANT A SEQUEL! I feel like there's a love triangle going on that needs to developconclude in the next movie. Also I want to see more fighters..especially devildevil jinogrejinpachi.

The writers of this movie did the best they could to pick out the story of Tekken. What people do not understand is when a movie is made they can take liberties with the story because it is Based on characters not carbon copies. I enjoyed this film from beginning to end some of the writing was bad and some of the actors could have been betterMovies now a days have the same issue but you have to realize most of the actors in this film are actual MMA and martial artists. I liked how they changed things around to make sense of it all especially for those who will be fresh to the story of Tekken. The fighting was top notch Jin was likable you really felt like he was an ordinary Joe. I loved the fact that the film was left open watch after the credits. This movie to me has a wonderful replay value almost like Kickboxer on crack. All you fans need to get your heads out of your A and enjoy the movie for what it is.

The Acting wasn't too great However the fight scenes make up for that as when the fighting kicks in you completely forget about the Acting. The film is highly Watchable and good entertainment. I Personally would of given it a 7 if there was more back story on each individual character and there was more original cast.. example.. why is raven in it and not hwoarang grrrHowever the film in my opinion is far better than street fighter the legend of chunli and not as good as MK.. but it's exactly like the game's which is good.".

Love between Christie and Jin?I think that such a movie should first be released with the story based around the group of fighters THEN maybe releasing movies with more details on a character's profile. Like Xmen's Wolverine movie if you know what I mean. The movie being immediately based on 1 character's profile was not a good idea in my opinion.People new to Tekken will not get much interest to the story after watching this since the mostly attracted crowd was people who actually had an idea of the original story line.It was a good film to look forward to but the story was highly sped up. I hope a sequel will follow with more character profiles as almost every posted review has asked for And also the fans would appreciate one of the most classic characters in the movie. Give us Roger!!!! pOther than that I would like to mention again that the fight scenes were awesome especially the highly matched fighting styles with the game for all those fans out there seeing their favorite characters in real life action.

However if Tekken conjures for you visions of some handsome underdog hero fighting against grizzled hunks and scantilyclad women attempting motions of kickboxing and kickingass you are on the right track.And you may even be taken up by the action in Tekken. At least for the first half of the movie.Mainly the movie is about a handsome and rebellious Jin Kazama Jon Foo who gets reluctantly drawn into the Iron Fist tournament organised by the mighty Tekken Corp. Jin learnt to fight from his mother Jun Tamlyn Tomita who also warns him to stay away from Tekken and the Iron Fist tourney! Of course one thing leads to another and Jin finds himself in the highlypublicised tournament where he must fight contestants twice his size and having triple his experience. These are heavies like the 'bionic' Bryan Fury Gary Daniels and Russian contender Sergei Dragonov Anton Kasabov. No prizes for guessing if Jin would tip the odds.And oh yes he also meets curvy femmes like Christie Monteiro Kelly Overton and Nina Williams Candice Hillebrand who provide the requisite teaser and eye candy. In the course of his battles he learns the truth about himself! With fastpaced action brief dialogues and some dazzling fight sequences one can easily get taken away by the Tekken action even if they are ludicrous and downright incredulous. The plot is predictable even with its twist involving Jin and chief villain Kazuya Mishima Ian Anthony Dale and his father Heihachi CaryHiroyuki Tagawa. Indeed the narrative barely helps to sustain the action sequences  and the fighting scenes get repetitive and stale in the second half of the film.But then with a secondrate cast of relative unknowns it is unrealistic to expect anything more than the visual delights of DOA. What we can be thankful for is that director Dwight Little has kept the flick within 90 minutes and does not show too many bloody and gory scenes yes some videogame enthusiasts may find Tekken tame.VERDICT For fighting game fans and adrenaline addicts.  by LIM CHANG MOH limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " for a tekken fan...my two cents worth";
	schema:reviewBody "Before watching the movie I had high hopes that i'd get to see my favorite characters in action and true enough it didn't deliver..unfortunately for me but then again some parts of it were worth a fourth of the disappointment. First off it was a bit confusing to see characters from different timelines all come together in this particular set and it was kind of heartbreaking to even note that Hwoarang Paul Michelle Julia and Xiaoyu were not even in it considering they already included Raven Steve and Christie plus Eddie too. The story was kind of hurriedly narrated and no followups for the other fighters that were mentioned...sort of like they were just there for the sake of being in the tournament. It centered mainly on Jin and the rest appeared to be more like supporting backdrops of that sort. It would have had more spice if they at least allowed the other characters to have more than just kicking and punching roles. On the plus side the fight scenes though short and fast were satisfactory and did away with the fancy lightmeup hits and supers. It made the movie look more in tune with the real martial arts portrayed. The basic moves were there and well the final strikes were a bit....tame for a fight to the death effect. All in all it's entertaining to watch since it's Tekken after all and it's not everyday that people get to watch live action renditions of their favorite console games. My only gripe is that my favorite character was not in it unfortunately Ling Xiaoyu at your service and it would have been more interesting if there was a particular solid timeline that the story arc related to and not just put everyone in a big melting pot.".

The world is owned by corporations each of which as a competitor in the IronFist fighting tournament.

Very very entertaining with very good fighting scenes. It also stayed very close to the video game complete with the pickafighter sections. The downfall of this movie is the same problem with all video game movies though. When the movie is just the oneonone fighting sequences like the game has it is very strong and fun to watch. When it tries to add a story aspect and a plot is where it begins to drag. But the filmmakers knew this I think and the movie never strays too far from the tournament aspect for too long. Overall much better then I expected and knowing it's a video game you will have certain expectations going in. I give it a B.Would I watch again?  I actually might.Also try  Muay Thai Fighter".

It's still enjoyable with fastpaced background music. But the fights took place on very badly decorated arena.Of course there were many stupid things in this movie. When Jin was attacked inside his room Christie Monteiro can't even break the door by force! She has to break the window with something nearby and then open the door using handle? What a lame way! These first class fighters are supposed to have great power in their muscle.The characters didn't perform their signature moves on the game. Where's that dragon uppercut used by the Mishimas including Jin? I didn't expect that the fighters will emit lightning fire etc from their body like that in the game but at least please use their original moves in the game.This movie will disappoint you either you're fans of the game or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why such a bad grade? Let me start off by telling you that I am a real fan of the Tekken series. Don't get me wrong the movie was ehhh OK but it was not Tekken.The story of the movie does not fit in the time line of Tekken series. There have been 6 tournaments so far  the movie does not adept any of them but mixes up everything  makes a huge mess out off it. Everything is just misplaced. For example Jun Kazama Jins mother dies in Tekken 2 Miguel Caballero Rojo joins Tekken 6 to avenge his sisters death Sergei Dragunov entered Tekken 5 to infiltrate Mishima Zaibatsu Lab Eddy Gordo enters Tekken 3 to find the murderer of his father etc.In Tekken every character has hisher own purpose of entering the tournament. In the movie the actors didn't even know what they were doing there. NONE of the actors fitted the shoes of their characters  I'm not talking about the resemblance. I could care less about the resemblance cause I know it's damn near impossible to look like a fictional character. For example Kazuya Mishima is a good person turned bad after the Devil Gene took over him he only wanted one thing ever since kill Heihachi Mishima  Jin Kazama in order to get full power of the Devil Gene Codename Raven is a spy who was ordered to infiltrate Mishima Zaibatsu etc.If you are interested in the story of Tekken you don't have to play Tekken games. Just surf to httptekken.wikia.comwikiTekkenWiki  you'll know what Tekken is all about.So I mainly hate this movie cause it doesn't bring Tekken it just brings a random action entertainment flick. It's not as if Tekken storyline is a masterpiece or anything. It's just like going to 5 restaurant ordering a chicken  getting some KFC on your plate. Not as if KFC is bad it's just that you're not getting what you've ordered thats all. You get the point?".

The story may not have been that great but you think about it its hard trying to establish a story entwining 40 or so fighters in the entire franchise. The acting may not be great but they are trained stuntmen and martial artists. The sets were cool the costumesmakeup were great except for Heihachi his hairdo was a mess. There were some moments that had me scratching my head in disbelief but I'm not going to complain. Thats what nitpickers do and I'm not a nitpicker. My only disappointment is that some of my favorite fighters weren't featured. Like Hwoarang King and Lili. Thats all I have to say. Its no masterpiece nor as good as MK but I recommend this to anyone that enjoys Tekken or martial arts. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright first things first I'm a huge Tekken Fan and I've been playing the games since Tekken 2 but this doesn't mean I'll just judge this movie blindly and purely based on the video game series. But! Let me just get some of the issues off my chest which I encountered while watching the movie mainly it's the character background and character relations which ticked me off a bit examples being Anna and Nina Williams being rivals ingame while in the movie they don't seem to mind sharing a partner together for under the sheets if you catch my drift  Another thing is Christie while they surely got the looks right aside from the Brazilian background they made her completely unrelated to Eddie actually Eddy! they even replaced her fighting style. Last example were the Jacks I sparkled with excitement for a bit when I heard the 'Jacks' were coming instead of giant muscular robots however I found averagelooking goonies with guns.Altho certain characters did match I especially found Brian Fury and Eddy Gordo quite matching to the game versions both in looks and fighting moves which was good. Miguel on the other hand I forgot how he's called in the movie didn't leave much of an impression.Now to get to the actual movie if I look at it while removing all the game references it's a pretty decent movie with plenty of action and a decent soundtrack. I'll leave the indepth story for the other reviewers so I'll just note a few general things. The movie was fastpaced overall enjoyable to watch the main character is motivated to fight while sadly this is found lacking with the other tekken fighters. It also had it's share of teasingfanservice in the form of naughty scenes which are pretty common in every action film these days. To give my final judgment about Tekken to get back at the titlesummary I think it's a Tekken movie for nonTekken fans because due to all the lorebending they've done to the original storyline there's not much left for the Tekken fans to relate to except the names and some character looks. Literally every character in the movie has a contradiction with the game and since nonTekken fans won't notice these I feel it's more appropriate for them to watch the movie instead of the regular Tekken fanbase as the fans will mostly scratch their heads and watch the movie with a big frown on their faces.Well that's about it for my first review hope you enjoyed the read!".

The acting isn't as bad as independent movies usually deliver. The characters are twodimensional and all the main characters were adorned with minimal background stories that blended in well with the movie in other words they didn't feel forced just so you can know the characters better. Also unlike other movies that start off from one setting and then jump to a luxurious islandmansioncastle etc. this movie maintains its dystopian vibe from beginning to end maintaining the reality of its world its inviting you in. Compared to the games there were a lot of disappointments. The characters dress like they do in the games yet none of the actors are physically similar to them nor do they talk like them. Also some important characters Heihachi Kazuya Nina were extremely reduced to a disappointing level while others Christie Steve Raven were needlessly emphasized. The movie actually manages to grasp your attention but halfway through it spans out of control and the final fight was a major disappointment. I will also say that I'm glad some core characters like Paul Phoenix Lei Wulong and Hwoarang were left out it's better to leave them untouched than to ruin them.All in all the movie might have had more credit if it changed the title and the names of the characters. In other words it didn't need to be a Tekken adaption. One could easily come up with a movie based around a tournament without disappointing a lot of gamers because let's face it most of the people that watch these types of movies are gamers.".

From the perspective of somebody who has never played the games before this would in fact be a good film. However from the perspective of somebody who has played the games... I found myself saying omg what are you guys doing this isn't how that happened almost every 5 minutes in this film. I guess I now know how those guys who say The book was better feel. A lot of the Tekken characters in this movie where completely out of character compared to the character they portray in the gaming world. Like I said though I can see how someone who has never played the console games could enjoy this movie. Aside from all that the content of the film as story progress wise was forced. The action is what made up for that downside. With all that being said as a loyal Tekken fan. I either hope A. They make an anime movie out of Tekken that sticks true to the roots or B. Does this movie some justice in a Hollywood remake. They're going to need to take a completely different approach if they want to attract the interests of the hardcore fans.".

A lot of the Tekken characters in this movie where completely out of character compared to the character they portray in the gaming world. Like I said though I can see how someone who has never played the console games could enjoy this movie. Aside from all that the content of the film as story progress wise was forced. The action is what made up for that downside. With all that being said as a loyal Tekken fan. I either hope A. They make an anime movie out of Tekken that sticks true to the roots or B. Does this movie some justice in a Hollywood remake. They're going to need to take a completely different approach if they want to attract the interests of the hardcore fans.";

Of course it's nowhere as good VG adaptation as Mortal Kombat 1995 fighting game or Silent Hill if thinking about all Vg movies in general but it's better than Dragonball Evolution Street Fighter SF Legend of Chun Li and DOA Dead or Alive. In terms of faithfulness it's not really to my liking as a Tekken games fan that they changed much of the story around  but I'm not too surprised since it's being done to a lot of VG movies such as Resident Evil films and the Hitman movie which just borrowed elements from the games such as Heihachi Mishima is Dead quote from Tekken 5 Devil Gene vaguely implied with the quote Curse of the Mishima Bloodline Fights were pretty entertaining though I wish they would have shown the actual fighting styles that match with the actual styles stated for example in the movie it states Raven does Ninjitsu and Dragunov does Sambo but they're not using those styles at all Heihachi's fighting action was way too limited interrupting Jin's fight with Yoshimitsu to save Jin and that's it and Anna didn't fight at all in the tournament she does attack Jin in the darkness with her sister Nina but it's very short and hard to see cause they fight in the dark. Alsofinal fight between Jin and Kazuya was very disappointing  I was very let down by how short and how weak they made Kazuya he slashes a worn out Jin on the chest but when Kazuya himself who isn't even worn out gets slashed by his own axe in a little cut it's game over? Jesus. One of the highlights of the film would be Ian Anthony Dale's acting as Kazuya some people may be more familiar with his role as Scorpion in MK Rebirth. He did surprising well in this role and I could see his as Scorpion in a upcoming MK film though I don't want it to be Rebirth. There are some corny lines such as Eddy's come on boy! and some really annoying moments such as those two punks cheering on Jin on his final fights they were as annoying to me as those hackers from the Transformers movie. Also Christie's socalled romance with Jin really didn't convince me either though I do have to admit Overton is very hot. Anyway I relatively enjoyed the movie like when I watched Resident Evil films and Hitman film but I guess I owe it partly due to setting my expectations pretty low before watching  and it keeps me thinking could they have done a better job with bigger budget? And if the director and his team were someone like Joey Ansah and his crew for SF Legacy short film what would it be like?".

I was already fantasizing about my IMDb review saying how I was expecting crap and found a gem.Of course that only lasted for the first half of the movie. Afterwards attempts to make the movie follow a script budget concerns and other movie politics made it all fall into the gutter of action movies when the cardboard villain must come into focus and be honorably defeated by the hero. I call bullshit. If the movie would have continued in the same style as the first half of the movie where heroes meet on the battlefield of the arena and wither win or lose it would have been a decent even good film. Instead hair gel and bad villain lines polluted the ending and turned it into another crappy video game movie. Why?!?!?Summary Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa should have asked for a fortune in payment for the silly hair style of his character probably something taken from the video game Tekken that I have never played. The main character looked like a combination of Jean Claud van Damme and the vampire from Twilight. The hot chick that is the focus of his male desire gives him a kiss after being totally easy but she denies him any... ahem... action. He returns to his slum where a girlfriend that actually wants and accepts sex awaits him. That part was artfully realistic. Tamlyn Tomita is still hot as hell even if she keeps playing roles of moms that have to die. Kelly Overton mimics some decent fight moves even if her only purpose in the movie is to look good.After thoughts I wonder what would have happened if the hot girl would have actually had to participate in the tournament and fight Jin and then the father grandfather angle actually been used in a royal politics manner... a good script maybe? Why did Raven a black guy with white clothes and white hair?! An albino raven maybe? What hair gel company sponsor this movie?Bottom line watch 45 minutes of the movie. Stop. Fantasize about what cool movie this could have been. That is the only way to enjoy this film.".

Brutal fights diverse cast of characters sexy women great use of music and a cool story. It's awesome that CaryHiroyuki Tagawa is in this movie having previously played as Shang Sung from Mortal Kombat.I'm not sure why some people didn't like this movie adaptation. I'm sure I did. This is good oldfashion tournament fighting and I highly recommend that you check this out. MORTAL KOMBAT!!! Oh sorry wrong game.".

Little has a little wiggle room as to how the characters are fleshed out. Familiar names such as Bryan Fury Nina Williams and Kazuya Mishima are there but there are subtle differences between many of the characters that unfortunately leave fans of the game scratching their heads.The main protagonist of the movie is Jin Kazama a young man living in the Anvil a slum area encircling Tekken City. After a jack raid which results in the death of his mother Jin decides to enter the Ironfist Tourmanent to get at the man who he believes is responsible Heihachi Mishima. His training given to him by his mother and presented in flashback moments as he fights his opponents in the arena allows him to progress through various battles against the likes of Miguel Rojo and Yoshimitsu leading up to the final battle against the Tekken Champion.Like any decent movie there are twists and turns that keep people interested from beginning to end and the majority of the cast while being relative unknowns are reinforced by those we do know such as CaryHiroyuki Tagawa Tamlyn Tomita and Gary Daniels.Overall this movie is very solid and certainly a much better attempt at bringing the game world to the silver screen. I expect to see much more in the future from many of the actors and actresses in the years to come.".

But it still had the story of the iron fist tournament being held every year  where Jun dies and Jin seeks revenge on whoever killed her.Actors  Acting The acting was pretty decent Jon Foo did a good job playing as Jin and Luke Goss as Steve Fox sure he doesn't look exactly like him but he had his attitude. Christie didn't look Brazilian but DAYUM still hot just like in the game. I only noticed that the only characters that spoke a different language were the Tekken Force and Jun while everyone else was speaking English.Fighting Scenes the fighting scenes were the best bit about the movieof course it was pretty good but they could've done way better such as replacing the beating the crap out of the guy with the characters signature moves as the finishers such as Jins Avenger and Laws Flips.Characters Where to begin well lemme rap up that the so called JACKS are the TEKKEN FORCE I don't know how the director got mixed up with that one but he probably didn't play tekken force Anyways I was heaps impressed with the characters costume design such as RAVENS COSTUME dayum if it was like they took him of the game and slapped him on to the movie. I don't remember Jin having a girl friend but I do remember Xiaoyu having a crush on himshe wasn't even in the movie!!!. Jin had his tekken 6 gloves and tekken 4 pants it was pretty awesome seeing the 2p costume again but they should have added the devil gene in his story...Overall the movie was pretty good but not great it was missing all the important characters such as Jins rival Hwoarang and their roles. The fighting scenes were great but could have used the signature moves and no need for the weapons. The story should have had ogre in it cause his the reason why Jin gets the scar on his left arm. Worth Watching?I suggest watching the movie if u like game movie remakes such as Resident Evil.PS. I do mention Jin a lot because he is my favorite character D".

The only things they are keeping from the game are some of the clothes and hairstyles. If you would review it as a fighting movie it would be bad as well cause the fighting is non existent.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie for any true Tekken fan is a slap in the face. The storyline is all messed up the characters just do not fit Cung Le as Marshall Law? Hell no and Jin sounds British. The acting was horrible Heihachi looked nothing like Heihachi and Kazuya and Jin both had more honor and respect than Heihachi ever did. Heihachi with a heart? Kazuya A rapist? Just uncalled for.As far as anyone saying that they were entertained with these fights you are probably a fan of the WWE. Even though fake at least a lot of movies go the extra mile to showcase some sort of realism to the strikes whereas in this movie the kicks punches and insanity done are miles from the areas that had been struck.Save yourself the time people as far as video game movies are concerned I would rather watch Bloodrayne or Far Cry. Both of which were horrible.".

The only thing that was similar to the game was the character looks and they did not even get that done well. 2  there is no background to the characters being shown for example the whole world is fallen in to corruption but how? Jin is suddenly the son of Kazuya but when did it happen? Jun Kazama fought in Iron Fist when? Steve Fox knew Jun Kazama how? lots of things they could have added to the movie to make it better even though it was not related to the game storyline as many Tekken game players here would have realised very easily. 3  Character moves was a major issue personally as lots of people that have played the games would have realised that the characters have some pretty nice moves when fighting the point of the movie is to make people want to play the game but the movie just showed some moves that more or less anyone would be able to do.4  The movie does not even state when the story is taking place but with Dragunov appearing i would suggest it is during Tekken 6 probably or Tekken 5. But the stage suggests it to be Tekken 4. Jin entering the tournament now suggests it to be Tekken 3 but then Kazuya appearing with a scar now suggests it to be Tekken 4! Wow this is getting really confusing!5  The companies that are involved hugely are Mishima Zaibatsu G Corp. Mishima Zaibatsu lead by HeihachiJin takes over when Heihachi was announced Dead in Tekken 5 and G Corp lead by Kazuya.The game has a very impacting story with the character relationships the entire Mishima family more or less hate everyone. Kazuya hates Jin and Heihachi Heihachi hates Jin and Kazuya Jin hates Kazuya and Heihachi. and then Anna and Nina both hate each other. Heihachi is the rapist not Kazuya although Kazuya is evil deep down he does have a soft side from which Jin was born. Heihachi has 3 sons 2 of which are biological and 1 being an adopted son. The movie although it was slightly impacting the story did not really meet the standards of the game but it was better than the Street Fighter 2009 movie but the best Fighting game adaptation in my opinion would be Dead or Alive and Street FighterVan Damme as they had good fighting as well as story but i do not know much of Dead or alive as i have not played the game.So overall i would say watch it and make your own judgement on it as most people that have played the game would not find the movie enjoying. But if you would rather see a better storyline than the movie then i would suggest in playing the Tekken 6.".

I wasn't sure myself if a story around Confucius would be able to entertain me for 2 hours but it surely did! It's a fascinating and emotional story about the later years of Confucius played by Hong Kongactor Chow Yun Fat. It's shows the man behind the myth.I was very impressed with Chow's acting. I knew he was a great actor but this role is another milestone in his career. His Confucius is warm and gentle and you really feel his emotions.

	schema:reviewBody "The most controversial and dramatic thing about this movie happened offscreen in midJanuary. Many Internet users and related groups called for a boycott of the film when it was reported that China had ordered 2D versions of Avatar to be pulled out so that more people would watch Confucius. However due to low attendance for Confucius and the high demand for Avatar the Chinese government reversed their decision and allowed Avatar to remain on some 2D screens in China. The movie was to mark the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China and Confucius' 2560th birthday.Yes this is after Mao Zedong's Red Guards condemned the ancient scholar and destroyed his family cemetery and temple in his hometown of Qufu. Ironically one of Confucius sayings is that an oppressive government is more to be feared than a tiger.The first half of the movie traces the rise and popularity of Confucius played by Chow Yun Fat in the state of Lu during the Spring and Autumn Period where he is known for his fair and just ideas about running the affairs of the state. He is promoted from town mayor to minister. However his ideas and practices break with tradition and anger the ruling families. An example is when he saves a burial slave from being entombed alive. He incurs the wrath of the rulers of the surrounding kingdoms by tricking them into giving back seized territory without any violence.The second half circa 497 BC shows Confucius and his disciples in exile wandering about for years and getting chased away by the locals.As you can see from the paragraphs above the first half of this twohour film is more eventful and interesting than the second. There is a gripping war sequence about the storming of a fort that recalls the action in Red Cliff. And that's about it for the action fans.Chow rises to the occasion as the calm and collected Kong Qiu the revered teacher whose philosophy and views helped to revolutionize some states in China. When political jealousy and fears about his influence send him into exile the scenes get repetitious and languid. This is punctuated with a subplot about Nan Zi Zhou Xun consort to the Wei king who respects the wisdom of Confucius. However her magnetic appearances are brief and almost cameolike leaving most of the second half as prolonged and protracted scenes of Kon Qiu's wanderings and sufferings.Technically this US23million production looks rich and even stunning at times. Cinematographer Peter Pau of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fame captures the period and locations in all their glory and helps to put us in the right mood and atmosphere of the times.Confucius is not a lost cause. It just looks longdrawn messy like too many cooks having a hand at the broth.  LIM CHANG MOH limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

It is not Braveheart or Patton since it is not filled with thrills and spills but you don't watch The Last Emporor of Kundun for the action you watch them for the splendor and the drama and splendid drama Confucius certainly delivers. Chow Yun Fat achieves a command performance as the gentle commoner who uses his wit and wisdom to quickly rise up in political ranks only to be exiled for his outsider ideology. Chow Yun Fat has come a long way since his two fisted gunslinging John Woo days and his decision to sacrifice another opportunity that would have made him part of a more popular project in order to participate in this rich cinematic experience demonstrates his high integrity and his love for his heritage. Like Spartacus or Ben Hur this movie is colorful gorgeous engaging and huge. The costumes are as awe inspiring as those of Cleopatra and the only thing it is missing is a thick font Technicolor at the end because this film is so reminiscent of the great days of biopic film making. Yet some of the music and camerawork reminds of the history of low budget Chinese films as well which adds to the nostalgia of Confucius and makes it a more fun to watch. Confucius is grand.

It tries to stay close to the historic tales and records in describing Confucius' life so it could come across as lacking in CGI action but I think it helps rather than hurts the film.I MUCH prefer this epic to Red Cliff the dialogue is much more intelligent and believable and the acting is much better. It also dispenses with clichs that John Woo is fond of with the exception of a couple of scenes.As it is a biopic there isn't much of Confucius' teachings depicted but more about political unrest and intrigues.Don't over analyze this  sit back and enjoy a great historic epic with beautifully created CGI scenes.It is much more enjoyable than what its solemn subject matter would suggest.".

Unless they're not fans of Asian films or fake posters with motives against the film's makers? But I am so glad I decided not to believe their reviews. First of all Yun Fat Chow is not going to turn down a major role in Red Cliff to be in another biostory type film not just as amazing. And this film was far from long  drawn out. If you're a fan of most popular Chinese epic films than you'll love this! Every camera shot was gorgeous as with the costumes. It's rare to find present epic Asian films that aren't tastefully shot anyway. The color was stunning and the interpretation of the classic tale was unique with plots that never disappoint. Xun Zhou was as beautiful  cunning as she was in Painted Skin which I watched 4 x's lol. With all the characters the actors each held such a powerful presence. It's very tough to develop any character singularly while you have so many important characters with their own mythos and chronicles but each actor really held up professionally! The amazing battle sequences  periods of war were not drawn outthank God. And formations strategies  clever weapons take centerstage in the first major confrontation with Confucius advising the King.Confucious is a solid film that is both a mega blockbuster and quality filmmakingOne of the best films ever...epic complex realistic emotionally engaging and unforgettable".

One thing is for sure as an established actor you almost couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role. Not saying there aren't other talented guys Tony Leung Andy Lau and more but it seems Chow Yun Fat was the right choice because he is also known in the West and because he can act too of course.The story moves along nicely we also get quite a few action scenes thrown our way. There is a lot of drama and also a few nice resolutions. Some of the teachings get shown and you can see that most people had great respect for the master back then too. Which of course makes it almost impossible to believe some of the things that happened to him. They seem to be very particular when it comes to dates but I'm sure they were creative in the times in between. A nice little movie but I think if you want to know more about him you'd be better off reading a book.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like Socrates who was a near contemporary Kongzi Confucius died without committing his own thought to writing  at least any that survived. It must be gleaned from the Analects which was probably put together within a century after his death and contains sayings of his as his disciples remembered them. But the Analects often says nothing about their context. When and why were each of these aphorisms spoken? The film Confucius was conceived as an answer to this question.Confucius is essentially a string of episodes that follow the chronological sequence of known events in the career of Confucius which was certainly less than spectacular or successful on the surface. Each vignette is punctuated with certain aphorisms and climaxes with one deemed particularly important. Some if not most of the episodes are purely products of the imagination for example the initial one that has Confucius harboring a human sacrifice fugitive though the sage was said to be opposed to the practice. I didn't buy the context for the aphorism about the dearth of men who would rather pursue virtue than women which was spoken in a somewhat diffident reply to the tempting consort of the king of Wei played deliciously by the fetching Zhou Xun and delivered with undue seriousness. I would have preferred to see it treated as a humorous yet thoughtprovoking oneliner as it could also be rendered I never met a man who liked virtue as much as sex.In the process of telling its story the film tries to impart the basics of the sage's philosophy which almost invariably ends up appearing insipid or ceremonybound in textbooks. A good example is the key concepts of li and ren which are touched upon in the film. Li is usually translated ceremony or etiquette and ren something along the lines of love of man but both evade a firm grasp by the modern mind even with commentaries. In my understanding Confucius devised nothing less than a social technology. He came to the conclusion that people and countries could prosper if they figured out how to manage every relationship properly. Li could be viewed as the codification of proper behavior in relationships  man  wife ruler  subject teacher  student parent  child etc. etc. And ren the infusion of real feeling that prevents li from devolving into stale and empty formality as Confucianism as a whole eventually did. But such expositions are not amenable to the film medium in the first place and the movie is not going to help out those who know nothing of the big C in this department.Sprinkled into the blend now and then are spectacletype interludes with CG works and warfare. I found these merely distracting. They serve to convey the troubled wartorn times I suppose but that is thin grounds indeed for their admixture. I doubt the crowd hankering to see action is going to put Confucius on its mustsee list anyway.Despite the flaws Confucius is a gallant attempt. It surely cannot be easy to make a flick about a philosopher or thinker in any culture  as opposed to Biblical characters whose wonderworking and fiery prophesies lend their stories to cinematic treatment. Confucius in contrast simply espoused a creed that was humancentered for its time divinityfree non violent and lowkey. Not much material for cinematizing there. Chow YunFat absolutely carries the movie and it is a real pleasure to watch the whole spectrum of emotions that cross his face over the course of the roughly two hours. I also liked the touches of ancient life  the music of zithers and bronze chimes the costumes of nobles and commoners the pottery the oxcarts and chariots. Could have been even slower and more thoughtfocused as far as I am concerned. I came away regretting that director Hu Mei had not ventured a context for some of the more enigmatic sayings. I guess that means I was left wanting more  and that is saying something too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chow YunFat left John Woo's epic Red Cliff in part to star in this biography of the great philosopher. The film is set up as a memory play of sorts with the great man looking back on his life.I'm going to do something that really won't make any difference if you see the film I'm going to tell you the whole plot. There is a reason for this so bear with me. Confucius is a commoner who rises to mayor of a town. He's so successful at using his philosophy to run the town he is sent up the ladder of success. However his achievements break with tradition and annoy the various ruling families he has the gall to save a burial slave from being entombed alive. He also annoys the various rulers of the surrounding kingdoms by using his cleverness to win back lost territory without any violence. However he eventually he annoys his benefactor who sends him into exile. He then wanders about for many years before he he is allowed to return home where he assembles his book of wisdom.See how exciting that paragraph was? Thats how exciting the film is as a whole. Yes there are some battle scenes and much great verbal sparring but for the most part nothing much happens. Actually once he's turned out very little happens other than Confucius and his followers wander the country for years. They annoy the local leaders and are forced to move on while his philosophy takes hold. Its not unwatchable but it really makes you wonder why you're watching this or what made anyone think that this was going t be exciting to an audience. Its lots of gee isn't the master great and such. it get dull real fast. It doesn't help that the film is filled with subtitles to explain the where the when and the who of events. Its not just at the start where it's helpful to get things going its all through the film and it makes the film feel as if its a shorter version of some huge epic tale. I kept wondering what I was missing was something other than people sitting around thinking deep thoughts happening in a place just off the screen and if so why wasn't I there.I'm picking on the film and its really not fair since its not a bad movie its just an over long and somewhat bland one. I'd wait to see this as a rental I'd say wait for this to show up on cable but I doubt that will ever happen outside of Asia. Not a disaster but on the other hand not really an exciting film after the first half hour or so.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps I'm mistaken but I had my expectations set on Confucius the film being a tale of the man himself one of the greatest and earliest philosophers and thinkers that had vast influence over a number of ideologies today including the system of ethical governance. The trailer had suggested that besides being a learned man he's quite the military strategist as well like a precursor to Zhuge Liang which of course is way off the mark as far as I'm concerned.It seems like director Hu Mei had been influenced by a number of war films set in Ancient China from Battle of Wits to Red Cliff and had been inspired to do her own even if it had to involve Confucius. Good thing though she didn't put the philosopher played by Chow Yun Fat into a suit of armour but rather starts off the narrative focused on his ascension to enviable political positions starting with the Law Ministry before being Acting Interior Minister for the state of Lu.A tale of two parts the first half danced along the narrative tread of political intrigue with court official envy and being the favourite adviser of the ruler laying the groundwork for some serious rivalry and treachery to be dished out especially when a talk of alliance with another state goes awry if not for a Plan B up in the sleeves to bail them out of trouble. But hold on was Confucius ever a politician to begin with? I do not know but it didn't matter much as there were glimpses of how his mind ticked with discussions of ideals and ideas with his disciples being some of the highlights that one would have come to the movie for.The second half though was a let down. Unappreciated and driven away Confucius starts his selfexile and together with a small group of dedicated disciples whom we know very little of save for their names and titles appearing on screen and most given extremely limited screen time they wander around the film from city to city and very much echoed the sentiments of the viewer  when will they settle down and get themselves into some serious classroom teaching? It's a pity that this section of the film decided to focus on how frail and aged Confucius had become with the passing of time but little more. Pacing seems a little hurried as well especially when dealing with subplots involving his disciples with resolution being only a few minutes after.Even Zhou Xun's cannot save the show as she's given a combined screen time of not more than 15 minutes thereabout to turn on her charm as the consort of a kingdom that Confucius and his disciples pass through. In other words a flowervase role that completely underutilized the talents of this wonderful actress. Chow YunFat cuts an imposing figure of Confucius and probably had what it takes in the first section before the weak storyline in the later half muted his performance as a senior citizen with major issues to address for himself and his disciples the first being the basic theories of Maslow in getting food and shelter for his followers.I figured I would have enjoyed a film about Confucius more if it had taken a more in depth look into his character his inspiration his influences that goes just beyond the churning of learned disciples to execute their likeminded philosophies and of course having all these done more through the narrative scenes rather than through intertitles which tell a lot more than the film itself. I think one is better off digging out Confucius epics of old than to watch this spruced by version with very fake looking CGI.".

I do not know but it didn't matter much as there were glimpses of how his mind ticked with discussions of ideals and ideas with his disciples being some of the highlights that one would have come to the movie for.The second half though was a let down. Unappreciated and driven away Confucius starts his selfexile and together with a small group of dedicated disciples whom we know very little of save for their names and titles appearing on screen and most given extremely limited screen time they wander around the film from city to city and very much echoed the sentiments of the viewer  when will they settle down and get themselves into some serious classroom teaching? It's a pity that this section of the film decided to focus on how frail and aged Confucius had become with the passing of time but little more. Pacing seems a little hurried as well especially when dealing with subplots involving his disciples with resolution being only a few minutes after.Even Zhou Xun's cannot save the show as she's given a combined screen time of not more than 15 minutes thereabout to turn on her charm as the consort of a kingdom that Confucius and his disciples pass through. In other words a flowervase role that completely underutilized the talents of this wonderful actress. Chow YunFat cuts an imposing figure of Confucius and probably had what it takes in the first section before the weak storyline in the later half muted his performance as a senior citizen with major issues to address for himself and his disciples the first being the basic theories of Maslow in getting food and shelter for his followers.I figured I would have enjoyed a film about Confucius more if it had taken a more in depth look into his character his inspiration his influences that goes just beyond the churning of learned disciples to execute their likeminded philosophies and of course having all these done more through the narrative scenes rather than through intertitles which tell a lot more than the film itself. I think one is better off digging out Confucius epics of old than to watch this spruced by version with very fake looking CGI.";

Indeed there are set pieces that look a little contrived with the purpose to impress but overall this is a solid piece of moviemaking. As to the question of historic accuracy I am in no position to comment.Roughly in three parts the first comprises the establishing scenes on the background of Confucius's political days when he looks a lot more like master military strategist Zhuge Liang in John Woo's Red Cliff 2008 than the iconic teacher that has shaped the culturalphilosophical history of China. At the middle is the action show piece of a famous battle he engineers certainly well made but not particularly memorable with so many spectacular movies that went before. The final part tells how exiled from his homeland by the warlord he well served Confucius embarks upon the part of his life with which most people identify him a teacher followed by a group of loyal students in a way actually not unlike Jesus of Nazareth.CHOW Yunfat is always a fascinating actor to watch. His distant relative ZHOU Xun exactly the same Chinese surname but spelled with different dialects is of course the darling of today's Chinese movie screen but unfortunately has an almost cameo appearance. Overall this movie will earn your respect with the serious solid effort from all concerned but not capture your heart with anything particularly brilliant.

This film wouldn't even last five seconds against Judge Judy.Here is what I learned from the film Confucius would have made a perfect litigant for Judge Judy's binding arbitration 'make belief' court being sued by his wife for back child support and breach of contract by his 'students.' The film portrayed Confucius as a 'bum'as Judge Judy would saywho abandoned his wife and children after becoming unemployed. He then meandered all over the feudal kingdoms of ancient China turning down job after job for the next few decades or so while taking on more students to service him even when he had no funds or resources to see to their education. In his defense Confucius say I want to change things! However other than the fairly common desire to see an end to the perpetual conflicts between warring principalities that characterized the Spring and Autumn Period it is not entirely clear in the film what specific changes he wanted to affect or how his teachings were going to bring about those changes. In fact other than dispensing one liner fortune cookie wisdom when did he actually 'teach' in this film? Now let's put this film into context. As the PRC's communist ideological framework crumbles under the reality of its free market political and economic reforms the postsocialist Chinese state 'rediscovers' once banished Confucian ideals as a way to attempt to realign its political authority with a moral authority reunite the disparate social and political elements of Chinese society and distinguish the uniqueness of its modernization from Western industrialized countries. But even as a propaganda film meant to promote social values that would reconcile the PRC's authoritarianism with market capitalism this film fails. It fails because the story was badly scripted and delivered by an overdramatic acting style reminiscent of the last generation of period Chinese films. It's not smart or stylish but is desperately trying to be in order to reach a new generation of Chinese moviegoers who would rather be stupefied by films like Avatar instead of being stupefied by films like this.Two stars for the women in the film  the only aspect of this film that was not profoundly irritating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chow Yun Fat gives a great performance as the sage adviser to his kingdom. Confuciusism is based upon the teachings of Confucius himself with his literal way of explaining peace through politics and philosophy as well as many forms of poetry and mathematics. Yet he was exiled out of Lu because of his idealism of tearing down three major walls which house both nobles and commoners became a dangerous reality. His own king realized the implications of leaving themselves vulnerable to enemies which in turn got Confucius exiled to wander for years in the vast open lands. Leaving behind his wife and family at least to keep them from the dangers of the plains. Yet in the frustrations back home in Lu the king then comes to his own realization that sending his only true adviser was a mistake. So he sends out many patrols and reconnaissance teams to bring back Confucius to the turbulent times. I like this movie for its brilliant history about the only man other than Ghandi to stop the killing without using violence. Although Confucius himself accepted the invitation to come back home he did however refuse to be involved in any politics what so ever. His teachings became a mainstay to future students who believe that pacifism is more powerful than using brute chaos. The old adage is the pen is mightier than the sword. Chow Yun Fat gives his most powerful performance to date with this film and I would like to see him in another of such great leaders and scholars of the times. The music was top notch as well as the CGI battle scenes using thousands of soldiers which engaged in battle. Forgivness is the breath of life and seeing two friends make up is worth more to see it rather than reading it. Excellent movie. I highly recommend this to anyone who still believes that peace is the ultimate winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review Although this movie is full of fast subtitles I really enjoyed this epic biopic about a man who stuck to his morals to the end. The acting is superb from Chow Yun Fat and the authentic scenery was brilliant. The only problem that I really found with the movie is that I lost the plot after a while. I didn't really know who was who and what they were fighting for. With that aside I did get caught up with the emotional side of the movie and the relationships that Confucius had with his trusty disciples. Personally I didn't know anything about Confucius before seeing this movie so I was intrigued with his epic journey from his early 50's until his death at 73 years old. The whole political side of the film went way over my head but I was still able to enjoy the emotional journey. The director brought different elements to the project which will give you mixed emotions throughout the movie so it definitely gets the thumbs up from me. Enjoyable!RoundUp This is the first international movie written and directed by Mei Hu and she really did pick the ultimate legend to portray. As Confucius isn't worldwide known this movie did go under the radar but Chow Yun Fat's popular name pulled in audiences. Its definitely a movie that I would watch again but I would need a dubbed version so I wouldn't have to concentrate on the fast subtitles.Budget NA Worldwide Gross 18.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biographydramahistory movies starring Chow YunFat Xun Zhou Jianbin Chen and Quan Ren. 610".

Enjoyable!RoundUp This is the first international movie written and directed by Mei Hu and she really did pick the ultimate legend to portray. As Confucius isn't worldwide known this movie did go under the radar but Chow Yun Fat's popular name pulled in audiences. Its definitely a movie that I would watch again but I would need a dubbed version so I wouldn't have to concentrate on the fast subtitles.Budget NA Worldwide Gross 18.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biographydramahistory movies starring Chow YunFat Xun Zhou Jianbin Chen and Quan Ren. 610";

	schema:reviewBody "It is five hundred years BC and China is made up of many warring kingdoms in one the Kingdom of Lu a mayor has been recognised by his ruler because of his compassionate ways and the peace in his town. For this he is promoted to the position of Minister of Law and he is soon showing the same compassion and wisdom on the national stage the man is Kong Zi better known in the west as Confucius. His rapid rise doesn't please everybody though the noble families don't like the fact that this commonborn man is being treated as an equal and see him as a threat and the enemies of Lu see him as somebody who must be removed before they can conquer Lu. In a confrontation with the Kingdom of Qi he manages to secure victory without bloodshed despite being drastically outnumbered. This leads to further promotion and his enemies within Lu decide he must go. Forced into exile Kong Zi and his followers wander through neighbouring lands as conflict increases ultimately they are almost starving but they won't abandon their leader and his teachings.I'm surprised that this film isn't better known it may not have the gravity defying martial arts of better known wuxia films but it does have some solid action scenes and the title role is played by Chow Yun Fat. He does a fine job in the role the rest of the cast were unknown to me but also perform well. As with other Chinese historical films everything looks stunning and is stylishly filmed. Not knowing the history of the time I can't say how accurate the film is but it is an entertaining story with highs and lows joy and tragedy. Overall if you are a fan of Chinese cinema I'd say this one is definitely worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Kong zi and Confucianism";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie Kong Zi reflects how the Confucianism was developed and consummated in ancient China by describing the whole life of Kong Zi. Based on the benevolence righteousness courtesy wisdom and trust Kong Zi created Confucianism in china. The Confucianism has reflected significant influences to every generation of Chinese people since it was created. From the perspective of Confucianism it is practical in daily life. The key of Confucianism is to adjust people's behavior and mindset. Confucianism can set clear guide for ethics and courtesy to restrict people's behaviors and to make the society stable. One of the key ideas in Confucianism is courtesy. In the movie Kong Zi reflected the importance of courtesy from his daily behaviors. For example whenever Kong Zi went to visit the king of country Lu Kong Zi completed the whole process of a standard courtesy of Confucianism Thrice kneeling and nine times bowing. In front of the palace Kong Zi needed to kneel down with three bows. After entered the palace he kneeled down with three bows again. Finally after he saw the king he needed to repeat the process one more time. In total he needed to kneel down three times with none bows. This courtesy is a typical noble courtesy. Moreover in the scene of taking dinner the courtesy was also strict. All people needed to wash hand firstly. After that they could not make any noise in the dinner. They should sit straight and chewed the dinner slowly. This courtesy for dinner is still applied in china today. At 19' Kong Zi was proposed a toast by his student. Kong Zi lifted his two hands to take the bowl from his student to show his respect. At 96' Kong Zi and his students shared the only one bowl of soup. This scene reflects the courtesy of giving precedence to other people. Another typical courtesy is to make an obeisance by cupping one hand in the other hand before own chest. Kong Zi applied this courtesy to show his respect to people before they had a chat. To show respect to people from different hierarchy this kind of courtesy is reflected in different ways. The diversified courtesies to different people reflect that the strict hierarchy and courtesy take place at same time in Confucianism. For example when Kong Zi was competing with Jisun in an archery game Kong Zi proposed a toast to Jisun because of the requirements of courtesy and hierarchy. At 70' students kneeled down and bow to Kong Zi firstly. After that Kong Zi also kneeled down and bowed to his students immediately. This scene also reflects that the courtesy and hierarchy are both important in Confucianism. Benevolence is one more important idea in Confucianism. In this movie Kong Zi gave a clear expression to benevolence by overthrowing a bad tradition. Ancient Chinese got used to bury living people with dead people to show respect to the dead people. Kong Zi led a revolt to against this bad tradition. He insisted that every people should not take other people's life at will. Kong Zi had a wellknown word about the benevolence People who are actuated by Confucianism should realize the benevolence even sacrifice themselves. Moreover in the scene at 108' Kong Zi taught his student Zi Lu that they should quit from the country because the government officers did not apply benevolence as a guide to manage the country anymore and the country became unstable. Kong Zi also exhibited the significance of persistence to people who practiced Confucianism in daily life. When he was restricted in the place between country Chen and country Cai his students and him were tormented by hunger more than couple of days. However Kong Zi asked his students that they should not gave up Confucianism for any reason. This idea is also known as people should insist their faith and should not be bended for poor and power. The persistence is also reflected from people's loyalty to the king in the country. In the scene at 11'30'' Kong Zi did not cooperate with other people to replace the king of country Lu. Kong Zi believed that loyalty was a basic and critical requirement to people. Feudal code of ethics is another important idea proposed by Kong Zi in Confucianism. When Kong Zi was in country Wei he taught the king that the leader of a country should apply feudal code of ethics to educate his people. This scene reflects that the education of feudal code of ethics is critical to stabilize a country from the perspective of Confucianism. Furthermore when Kong Zi was spreading the ideas of Confucianism in country Song the king and other people of country Song cut the tree that was applied by Kong Zi to shade the sunshine because people did not believe in the feudal code of ethics at the moment. They just wanted to drive Kong Zi and his students out. This scene reflects that the feudal code of ethics in country Song was extinct. At 108' Kong Zi's studentZi Lu was dying. Zi Lu insisted to adjust his hat to a proper position before died. These scenes exhibits that the feudal codes of ethics are important to both of the country and individual people Confucianism. At the end of the movie Kong Zi told his students before died future people can understand me through this book however future people can also misunderstand me through this book. In my opinion future people reflects all people who know or are getting to know the Confucianism. The me indicates all ideas in the Confucianism. The book exhibits people's diversified perceptions of the Confucianism. People who really understand the ideas in Confucianism can practice these ideas in daily life and gradual become as the people who can benefit other people and whole society. On the other hand people who misunderstand the Confucianism believe that these ideas are only applied for the leaders to control the country and manage their people.".

Sure he has a truckload of writings by the time he died but did the movie ever go into what he actually had written? Sadly no.It was a joy for me as an American to see the beautiful countryside the scenery is magnificent.There is no love story in this movie except the love his disciples have for him and vice versa and the love he and his disciples have for their country.

But despite very capable and creative direction a hooky theme song and score and the presence of Hilton's winning smirk the film is a dud.Hilton plays a notorious bounty hunter Lord who with his burly sloppy sidekick Bull Walter Barnes in a Jack Blackstyle role aims to discover the location of a missing fortune in gold. Horst Frank is the hotheaded young man that stands against them.If you were to make a list of the pic's assets you'd think wow must be great There is an intriguing mystery to the story as the heroes must decipher various arcane clues and enlist the help of a longmissing crippled girl. The title song Walk By My Side by Francesco DeMasi is supremely infectious and repeats throughout in a variety of forms notably plucked on an electric bass guitar. Carnimeo's varied camera setups feature numerous unusuallycomposed and visuallyarresting shots and interesting pointsofview. Hilton is sarcastic and charming. Barnes is goofy and funny in a Bud Spencer sort of way. Still the picture bored me to tears in each of two separate attempted viewings. I was made so catatonic the first time around I stopped halfway through and tried again from the beginning on another day. No Luck. If I had to put my finger on it I guess I'd say there is a distinct lack of dramatic tension andor action on hand. We seem to follow Lord leisurely from from one scenario to the next never sensing any danger import or panic to what's happening. The very few action sequences are of that most boring variety The Shootout. Is there anything less exciting than two teams of gunmen firing at each other from darkened buildings? In several such scenes here various pistoleros crouch behind their hiding spots peek out and fire crouch back down again maybe somebody does an overly dramatic fall ... you get the idea. Furthermore these scenes are usually edited such that there's no perspective on who's shooting whom from where adding to the viewer's dissonance. Let's have some some action guys! A chase on horseback a fistfight a daring escape a dramatic leap from a building a tense river crossing ... stuff that makes the runtime fly by not just fill the time.By no means a failure you may like this film if you are specifically locked in to Hilton's particular charm or can forgive its clockstopping dullness. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. 5 out 10 stars C.".

Hilton plays his typical gunslinger but he doesn't wear anything black. In fact he wears a white hat and he carries one sixgun on his hip. Barnes wears a Confederate jacket a brown derby and totes a doublebarrel shotgun. When he reloads all he need do is open his jacket and it is lined with loops galore for his shotgun shells. Together Hilton and Barnes are as good as Terence Hill and Bud Spencer except they don't argue with each other. Judge Thomas Warren has summoned them to find a cache of Confederate money hidden in town. Literally there is never a dull moment as this pair fends off advances from the villains and the body count slowly mounts into double digits as they do their best to kill our heroes. It doesn't hurt matters that one of Garnimeo's frequent collaboratorsthe prolific but gifted Tito Carpi wrote this memorable Spaghetti western with another genre stalwart Enzo G. Castellari who wrote the masterly Any Gun Can Play and the Franco Nero classic Keoma. Helmed with skill by Garnimeo written exceptionally well by Carpi and Castellari The Moment to Kill benefits immeasurably with Return of Halleluja lenser Stelvio Massi who always seems to set up his cameras in the best place for each scene. Mind you Massi would come into his own as a director of actioneers about the police. The beauty of The Moment to Kill is its numerous gunfights at either day or night and the way that Carnimeo stages them so that Massi's cinematography and Renato Cinquini  Ornella Micheli's editing compliment each other. The best Spaghetti westerns never ran out of varmints for the heroes to plug and somebody is already ready to spin around and throw up their hands The Moment to Kill when the bullets riddle them. Alberto Boccianti's production design and Stefano Bulgarelli's art department contribute to the success of this western. There is a chilling scene where several hooligans terrorize a crippled woman in a wheel chair and the camera setups vary to give the action multiple perspectives. Although it isn't a major Spaghetti the town and the sets don't look like a ramshackle sagebrusher. The Moment to Kill qualifies as one of the better lowbudget westerns.

The Moment to Kill is undoubtedly one of the most dull westerns I've ever had the misfortune to watch and the film is made all the more disappointing by the fact that it could have been good! The story is certainly derivative but similar ones have lead to great westerns before and after this film. Basically we focus on a pair of gunslingers Lord and Bull that go after some treasure with only a book and a young crippled girl to go on. The film is very dark but I don't mean in terms of the plot I mean in terms of the picture a lot of it takes place at night and I often found myself wondering exactly what was going on. The story gets boring very fast and this is mostly due to the tepid relationship between the central characters. George Hilton takes the role of Lord but mostly looks bored and he is joined by Walter Barnes as his partner. The two look odd on screen together and it doesn't work very well. There are not many noteworthy scenes and even the many shootouts get boring before long. All in all I wouldn't recommend this film to even the biggest Western fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made by one of the makers of Mondo Cane this is a biting attack of not only his partners but also on the genre itself.The film begins as a film maker and his party end up stranded in the desert. All seems lost and everyone begins to show sign of dehydration. Ghoulishly the film maker begins to film everyone's last moments or not because its discovered that the stranding was staged to get footage for the next mondo film. From that point on the film becomes a world trek as the film maker pursues a girl and attempts to get the next great sequence. It all ends in Viet Nam during the height of the war.Its not hard to guess that the film is a nasty jab by director Paolo Cavara at his Mondo Cane codirectors who had just run into trouble about a killing that appears in their Africa Addio since much of the film is a quest to film some one die on camera. Ultimately this film is a mixed bag. While I have no doubt that much of what is shown is the way things were done it often comes across as the pot calling the kettle black with mondoesque sequences appearing within the fictional frame work. While I honest believe that Cavara disavows his Mondo days I think he would also love the success that his former friends briefly met as kings of the Mondo world. Reservations aside this is a very good movie in its own right and should you come across it you should see it especially if you've ever watched a Mondo movie and wondered how it was done.".

People there were absolutely shocked with fantastic skill of Paolo Cavara. All the people in the Palace stood up and applauded to the Director who was present together with some other people who participated in the film. Applause was endless but at least more than half an hour. It was evident for everybody who saw the film competition program that this film was 1. I was extremely surprised several days later when I knew that this film got NOTHING. Six months later I was present at a lecture in a small town 150 km from Moscow at a lecture of a film critic about this film festival. He told a fantastic story. When the film selection commission received this film for the competition program at a very last minute they unanimously decided that this film will win and the jury later also considered this film 1. But the Cuban delegation USSR and Cuba had very complicated relations at that time with Cubans because of their friendship then with Mao in China protested. They said that the events in Vietnam had been shown in a wrong way. And their protest was satisfied. Thus we lost a fantastic director because in case of his victory his destiny might be glorious. Now I cannot find this film anywhere. Your site is fantastic because you HAVE information on this rare almost forgotten film.".

There's enough twists and turns to keep you guessing at the real nature of the evil. The breakout star is Emily Alyn Lind who is so adorable that you want to reach into the movie and rescue her yourself her plight not helped by her somewhat inconscient father who encourages her friendship with an old dead guy if it means directions to hidden treasure. His commitment to his daughter is only outweighed by his commitment to their hapless rescue dog.The two female leads are nicely balanced. All the women in this 'see dead people' and it's how they handle it that is the crux of the film their conflicting reactions and opinions driving the plot forward as the truth is revealed. This is obviously low budget shots of the forest using various filters providing the atmosphere the gore is minimal and the special effects fairly low key but enough here to give you a tingle even if it's only the fact that Mr Gordy really did appear to Heidi and he gets his photo in the end credits.".

She embraces the role straightfaced with an air of authentic innocence.The Haunting in Connecticut 2 Ghosts of Georgia is a good supernatural tale that should have been released in theaters like its predecessor. There are nice twists to the story the acting is good and the scares are genuinely creepy. Maybe it's selfish but I was looking forward to seeing the movie on a big screen in a quiet atmosphere where it could have my full attention.

	schema:reviewBody "For a standalone sequel The Haunting in Connecticut 2 Ghosts of Georgia could have been far more worse. The film had some freaky visuals a few oldfashioned frights and decent enough acting and an appropriate atmosphere to fit the mold. I think the title should just be Ghosts of Georgia because the film has no relation to the first movie and it's not even based in Connecticut it seems obvious that was a cash grab decision. This new story is purposively based on actual events about the Wyrick family and even has a made for TV. Reenactment film called A Haunting in Georgia which I haven't seen but I'm interested now. The backstory on why this paranormal disturbance is happening was dealt with in a non hardhitting way and wasn't effective. The storyscript just has several gaps and flaws that holds the film back and wasn't genuine or believable.The performances were decent but not great. Abigail Spenser plays Lisa Wyrick a mother and wife who is struggling with a passed down gift of seeing and speaking with the dead her sister and daughter also seem to have this suppose gift. Abigail was the highlight of this lackluster horror film and carries most of the weight and but the script limited her performance. Chad Michael Murray plays the father Andy Wyrick and gives a pretty bland performance and doesn't have much of a part. Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica fame plays the sister of Lisa Joyce Wyrick who also has the gift of seeing the dead. Katee gives a lively performance but like Chad's character there wasn't much to her role even though she has one of the more memorable moments in the film which involve needle threads coming out of her mouth. Emily Alyn Lind plays Heidi Wyrick the young daughter of Lisa Wyrick who starts to show signs of contacting the dead. She surprisingly holds her own as she plays one of the key roles in the film. All in all the performances were OK but their script lacked depth and charisma.Director Tom Elkins who is also the editor of this film and the first one as well as the editor of a couple of other horror films most notably the superior sequel to White Noise White Noise 2 The Light. Tom seems like a gifted editor but as a first time Director he has some learning to do as this horror film looks like it should be on ABC family. The just wasn't a solid direction to this film its subject matter should have been more powerful. Writer David Coggeshall has only written for television shows before like the short lived Watch Over Me series. The elements of a good ghost story is there because of the true story aspect of the film but David Coggeshall didn't put it into good use and created something uninspired and vague.Overall forget about the beginning of the movie's title and just go with Ghosts of Georgia because it's not a sequel to The Haunting in Connecticut it's a completely different story. It was neat at the end credits to see a picture of the actual family on which this film is based on. Their true story is probably far more interesting and terrifying than the actual film being presented. The film had tiny moments of creepiness and intrigue with grotesque imagery but the pacing was slow it was scare free for the most part didn't take advantage of the backstory and was mostly an unoriginal affair. An unnecessary and pointless sequel that isn't really a sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Claiming to be based on a true story The Haunting in Connecticut 2 follows a young family who have just moved into a new home in Georgia. Not long after their arrival the daughter Heidi Emily Alyn Lind begins to see people in and around their home. One ghost who seems to be extremely menacing is Mr. Gordy who is discovered to be the last inhabitant of the home. The family also learns that their house was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. The stationmaster who lived there saved the lives of many slaves but was discovered and killed. As the ghosts become more threatening and begin getting physical it is only a matter of time before Heidi is hurt or even killed.This film can be described in four simple words. Dumb title good movie. I had extremely low expectations for Ghosts of Georgia. DirecttoVOD horror movie sequels are usually pretty bad as it is but with a first time director I definitely didn't expect much. Luckily I can say that I was very pleasantly surprised. By no means is this a great movie but it is certainly enjoyable.The plot is actually pretty original and very creepy. The most impressive part is the fantastic backstory. I loved the way it used a part of American history to serve as the backstory. The flashback scenes were pretty welldone but the nonstop camera cuts got old after a while.The acting is pretty impressive given the type of movie. Abigail Spencer's character is very annoying but her acting is pretty good. Chad Michael Murray was... well he was Chad Michael Murray. Katee Sackhoff definitely brought a lot to the movie. She was a comicrelief but was also very serious when needed.However the most impressive performance was by Emily Alyn Lind who played Heidi. Just like Megan Charpentier in Mama Lind carries Ghosts of Georgia. It is important to have a good child actor especially when they are on screen almost the entire time and Lind doesn't disappoint. She really effectively conveys how terrified she is without going over the top.Director Tom Elkins does a pretty solid directing job especially for his first film. While the direction is a little rough around the edges he did a better job than most would. For the most part Elkins managed to keep a high level of suspense. Unfortunately most of the jump scares were aided by sudden bursts of music. Plus the constant switching from black and white to color at the end got annoying and nauseating very quickly.Overall The Haunting in Connecticut 2 Ghosts of Georgia was an aboveaverage horror sequel with many exciting twists and turns. The movie managed to keep my attention the whole time and I would've watched it for another hour. It's not a great movie but it's fun and that's all I care about. I will be looking forward to a sequel especially if David Coggeshall comes back as the writer.bobbysmoviereviews.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " My Review Of Ghosts Of Georgia";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghosts Of Georgia follows a young family starting out in a new home with not a lot of money but plenty of land and love in a small town in Georgia. It is a place steeped in history as the family soon learns. As part of the Underground Railroad. Soon paranormal events begin to unfold as the family settles in with most of the activity centering around the gifts of the female members of the family. The story is sold as a sequel to the original film of the same title but is a completely stand along event with no correlation. It is one of the most famous haunting cases in the paranormal investigative world and also one my favorite creepy tales. Ghosts Of Georgia was the directorial debut of Tom Elkins who worked on several other movies about ghosts.The film stars Abigail Spencer Chad Michael Murray Katee Sackhoff and Emily Alyn Lind all of whom give a pretty standard performance except for Emily who played Heidi. Her performance was far exceeding of the standard capabilities and almost showed the young actress to possess talent like such actresses' as Chloe Moretz or Dakota Fanning.I wasn't expecting much going into this film mostly due to the ridiculous title of the picture but I actually enjoyed the film. There was the basic elements here to be far more scarier but where held back by standard effects tricks that now plague paranormal movies almost to the point of making them boring. Yet at moments I felt actual suspense and eerie tension as more dramatic scenes unfolded into real chilling events. The setting and story was creepy and the film version held a far more haunting presence than what I originally imagined from the actual story. The film veered from the true paranormal case with a more morbid dark representation of the evil spirit haunting the land as well as the family. The action sequences were produced well creating a relief from the mediocre dramatic moments that tended to case me to drift off. I found Ghosts Of Georgia to be a far better ghost flick it's predecessor and think the film could have gained a better reception from audiences had they not gone with the title. This film had a great set up acceptable acting plus all the expected moments of creepy chilling paranormal activity. It isn't going to be a movie that really scares the hell out of anyone over the age of ten but it is a great movie about a haunting. The only downside was the very end after the amped up climax that felt way to hallmarky coming off completely cheesy and made for TV. I would tell people to see it and expect a better movie than The Haunting In Connecticut or The Apparition but don't expect the same amount of fright that you get with The Amityville Horror or even Grave Encounters.".

This has nothing to do with New England at all just a blatant attempt at making money off the name. Shame on Hollywood. OK movie family moves into a haunted house really haunted by the number of ghosts that are seen and the usual plot ensues. The writers busted out the book of clichs that every haunted house movie contains. So of course the mother Abigail Spencer can see dead people and they are pretty much everywhere. He daughter also apparently has this ability as well speaking with a Mr. Gordy throughout the movie. Problem is this movie plods along through all the plot and throws in a few scares to keep the viewer happy or bored take your pick. Well all of a sudden the movie tries to get all serious on you but by this point it is far to late. I have to say the acting was done well enough to make you actually care about the family so at least they took the time to develop the characters which is a plus. The daughterEmily Alyn Lind is adorable but mark my words if you watch this from beginning to end you WILL despise the name Heidi it is only yelled about 500 times in this movie. The FX and cgi are horrendous to the point of laughable and a complete distraction to the story that is trying to be told. The based on a true story thing hype is so far fetched to reach connecting this movie to the Wyrick haunting is also laughable. If you liked the first one you may get something out of this maybe. I found this to be more or less how to piss off the audience and the writers said let's start with the movie title and leave everyone wondering why the movie takes place in Georgia exclusively. Fun fact the movie was filmed in New Orleans so they couldn't even do justice to Georgia either. 3.710 IMDb 4.8 ?".

A ghost pops up within about 2 mins of the opening and then throughout the entire film....constant....relentless flickering ghosts shot for some reason in sepia. It wasn't enough to have one person who can see these ghosts either. No we are treated to all three lead female characters having persistent visions for the entire 1hr 40mins. To claim this is based on a true story is almost insulting. To start with the true Wyrick story is a typical kid sees ghost affair not particularly chilling or true for that matter. By the end of this film it's nothing more than a ridiculous monster flick with the character played by Abigail Spencer running and squealing around a standard creepy cellar filled with shock horror all manner of taxidermy and about 20 ghosts in tow.The concept of the underground slave railroad run by the evil taxidermist station master is a baffling plot line which completely ruined the film. God knows what they were thinking.The acting from the little girl Emily Alyn Lind is about the only redeeming feature. Chad Michael Murray was completely pointless giving an unconvincing and lacklustre performance. The rest of the cast were okay nothing spectacular and of course 90 of the cast were mute ghostly types who just stand about in corners looking over people's shoulders with a pained expression and pointing into the woods.AVOID.".

It did make me jump was very jumpy in places one of the better story lines. However the little girls acting was better than anyone else.

Who wouldn't love a story about a little girl that sees ghosts? I loved the story because it in and of itself was scary. Mr. Gordy Khan Lon The faceless hooded figure were all creepy and made for an entertaining story. Then when A Haunting did their movie about the family in the early 00's I loved finding out more about the story. Jordan talking to little girl ghosts Heidi continuing to see the hooded figure the terror they felt was all compelling. This iteration of the story is just nonsensical nothing from what I have heard read or seen about the family and their trials had ANYTHING to do with the underground railroad. Even the interview I heard with them on Darkness on the Edge of Town made no mention of the events in this film. It is 90 fiction and the scares they try to sell you are cheap in comparison to what you could get if you watched the Haunting film on the same topic. This is just another case of Hollywood making a movie and fictionalizing a reportedly true story watering it down or altering it so it bears no resemblance to the one that the fans like me sincerely love. Just like The Haunting in Connecticut I found this to be almost laughable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me begin by saying this is the worst horror title since I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.In this true story two psychic sisters and a psychic girl in the sense that they see ghosts relocate not from Connecticut to a former Georgia plantation with one sister's redneck husband who is some sort of police officersecurity guard. Each of the women begin having visions of ghosts presented in the typical paranormal reality show manner black and white slow motion fast motion random shots of insects shots of mouths agape. The girl's mother for a woman who sees ghosts is at first surprisingly hostile to her daughter's notions that there is an invisible man living on the property.The property turns out to have been an underground railway station run by a morally dubious station agenttaxidermist and as anybody knows all taxidermists are evil. The townspeople including the pastor are well aware of the property's history but in spite of the South's obsession with this time period and the fact that the lot was abandoned for twenty years no one has excavated or explored the property or hauled off its historic artifacts. The ghosts attempt to communicate a dastardly secret to the girl and this inspires the zombiepoltergeistdemon ? station agent to emerge from hiding and wreak havoc in his underground chamber which was lying in plain sight waiting to be found.This has some promise as a ghost story but could have been condensed into a half hour reality show using the same shots and techniques meaningless dates are presented to lend accuracy just like in the shows. The acting is a bit forced especially the accents and Chad Michael Murray's attempt to butch it up as a backwoods redneck. Clichs abound as all haunted house families there is a piano that is only played by ghosts meaningful stuffed animals and dolls Victorians a preference for baths over showers a preference for long flowing robes among the women. Some of the most realistic elements of the story are the most farfetched. I've already mentioned the historical artifacts waiting to be found but the redneck father seems far more a danger than the station agent when he tears out of his house with a gun tracking his daughter or drives crazily through the woods in the dark without looking behind him.The ending has clearly been exaggerated and we are left to wonder how much has been a hallucination especially since the mother was already revealed to be on medication for mental illness or accurate ghost visions if you prefer. Apparently the real family left the property a few years after the events here I wonder why they didn't use the ghost story and the historical monuments to build tourist attraction.".

	schema:headline " Shame on Lionsgate  Gold Circle  Wyrick Family";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not the first time the Wyrick story has been brought to mass audiences. The ghost story shared a threepart episode of Unsolved Mysteries in February 1989 and Virginiabased New Dominion Pictures added its 94minute IMDb viewerrated 6.4 version in 2002. Both accounts made an effort to respect the source material in delivering an atmospheric ghost story with an overtone of the grave. So with that in mind my question for the Wyrick family is as follows ...Why have you not denounced this Hollywood boondoggle as a farce? How can you let Lionsgate  Gold Circle and its goofy screenwriter David Coggeshall claim that the film is based on a true story? How can you let them display photos of your family at the conclusion of the film? I would identify all the ways the film deviated from the real story but it seems absurd to mention Lisa Wyrick's ability to see dead people she has none in the same paragraph as a resurrected taxidermist who lured runaway slaves into his dungeon masquerading as a station point for the Underground Railroad. The real Wyrick story is in no way rumored to be connected to the Underground Railroad. But hey the crawl spaces in the Snedecker home A Haunting in Connecticut were not stuffed to the gills with corpses either. How can anyone claim to like this albatross? Seriously. A corpse or ghost of a corpse abducting and assaulting the living? This is no longer the Wyrick story. This is no longer a GHOST story. This is now Creature from the Black Lagoon. I would have laughed at all the liberties taken with this story if something vital wasn't truly lost to these disrespectful clowns at Lionsgate  Gold Circle. There is evil about this Lionsgate story but its the ticketmaster and not some fabricated station master at the root of it. Evidence of ghosts is hard enough to come by that when we do encounter compelling stories with certain kinds of validity we need to preserve their integrity  not use them as the jumping off point for some wildly fantastical nonsense designed to heat some pools in Tinseltown. Make no mistake  hack horror writer David Coggeshall took a ghost story that received significant attention from world renown scientific investigators and turned it into The Evil Dead. There's a special place in hell for people like him probably the same level where Woody Allen put the inventor of aluminum siding in Deconstructing Harry.And if the hack job wasn't enough the film did not even deliver scares. How much elegance  how much high art  can we expect from a film given the most clumsy title in Hollywood history? Usually when you decide to contort yourself in whatever way is necessary to piggyback off another film it's usually a critically acclaimed or commercially successful film. A Haunting in Connecticut was neither. In fact a documentary film company from Suffolk Virginia is more celebrated for its version of the Connecticut ghost story than the Lionsgate Hollywood studio. Ghosts of Georgia is as connected to A Haunting in Connecticut as the 2002 academy awardwinning Chicago was to Woody Allen's Manhattan.And this was no joy to watch. It was made tedious by the constant labored efforts to tickle our startle reflex  efforts that are purely mechanical in nature the images themselves were not interesting or scary. We're treated to our first CGIgenerated apparition just 10 seconds into the film and from there it's nonstop ghosts. How a film manages to turn a phenomenon as exotic and controversial as ghosts into common termites is beyond me. Anyway congratulations on the paycheck. Horror films like this are relatively inexpensive to make nowadays and the profit margin must have good even after coaxing just a few million at the low end of the IQ scale into the theaters. And from what I understand Gold Circle is set to destroy yet another New Dominion psychodrama titled The Diabolical which will be renamed A Haunting in New York.".

It was made tedious by the constant labored efforts to tickle our startle reflex  efforts that are purely mechanical in nature the images themselves were not interesting or scary. We're treated to our first CGIgenerated apparition just 10 seconds into the film and from there it's nonstop ghosts. How a film manages to turn a phenomenon as exotic and controversial as ghosts into common termites is beyond me. Anyway congratulations on the paycheck. Horror films like this are relatively inexpensive to make nowadays and the profit margin must have good even after coaxing just a few million at the low end of the IQ scale into the theaters. And from what I understand Gold Circle is set to destroy yet another New Dominion psychodrama titled The Diabolical which will be renamed A Haunting in New York.";

They could have just as easily made it exactly like how the show portrayed it and would still would have been just as good...much like how they kept the story line somewhat intact with The Haunting in Connecticut where it was more on the lines of being 2530 fictional.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not really sure why they called this movie The Haunting in Connecticut 2 when all of it takes place in Georgia other than to tie it to the equally not scary The Haunting In Connecticut from a few years back but my best advise is to pass on this one until you can see it for free on cable because you will get more scares out of this story on cable on Destination America. We were pleasantly surprised when this story began and the little girl started talking about seeing a Mr. Gordy and realized that this story was based on a haunted house story we saw on the Destination America series A Haunting. Sorry to report the episode on A Haunting is twice as scary as this clunker with probably a tenth of the effects budget. Abigail Spencer is pretty good as the mom who sees dead people and it's good to see Katee Starbuck Sackhoff in something other than Battlestar Gallactica but this movie generates almost no scares and builds virtually no tension. And once you get to the meat of the back story and it tries to get all serious you're just left with little to be afraid of. So take a pass and check out A Haunting for more frights and a much more realistic story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to begin with questioning the 4.8 rating that the film has om IMDb at present. As a fan and viewer of all things horror this movie stands above the norm. The film for some reason is a sequel to 2009's The Haunting of Connecticut but has no connection in story and characters other then being based in the same state. I believe that if they had come up with an original title and cast a known actress in the lead this film would have thrived in the box office.The four actors cast as the Wyrick family were all excellent. Chad Michael Murray demonstrated why he should be a film lead in the future acting the credible role of a father and husband while still looking good without the usual posturing and posing that many actors from similar age and TV back grounds have in the past Van Der Beek Adam Brody Shane West. Katee Sackhoff was her usual terrific self hot and funny and playing a down to earth character which as much as I like her tough chick roles is one of her strengths. Abigail Spencer was also terrific as a mother and wife suffering from visions and denying her family gift curse. The most exceptional was Emily Alyn Lynn. She looks and plays the character of a girl about 7 but is an incredible actress never sickeningly cute never over acting never annoying but genuine and likable. The story is supposedly true at the end you even see the real life characters! and is relatively enjoyable. As usual I was wondering why they didn't just move but this was then actually voiced by a character. There is the expected twists but while expected if was done in a measured way not ridiculously contrived or unconnected to the story. You kind of expect it but it doesn't disappoint.The visual style used to present the ghosts is typical but not over done so you get surprised and jump without the visual taking you out of the movie. Director Tom Elkins is not a name I recognized before but will certainly look for in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Fuji TV's popular crime drama Unfair first debuted on Japanese TV in 2006 it was a much welcomed return to the type of hard boiled keiji detective drama that used to dominated the airwaves in the 70s. While nowhere near as long lived as such Japanese classics like Taiyo Ni Hoerou Howl At The Sun GMen '75 Tokusou Saizensen Frontline Investigation and the landmark Seibu Keisatsu Western Police series Unfair made it's mark by introducing Japanese audiences to a decidedly different type of strong female police detective character.Based on a mystery novel series by Hata Takehiko the series followed the exploits of top Police Inspector Yukihira Natsumi Shinohara Ryoko who was a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police force's elite Homicide division and the daughter of a slain high ranking Police Investigator. While she had a distinguished career as a police officer and detective her brash and sometimes unconventional approaches to police work often got her in trouble with her conservative superiors. Her troubled past had also caused her much pain and resulted in the breakup of her marriage and estrangement from her 5 year old daughter. Yet her exceptional talents sharp mind and striking good looks made her a force to be reckoned with.The drama series lasted for about 11 episodes and was soon followed by a special Unfair The Special  Code Breaking  Angoukaitoku Unfair The Special  Code Breaking Crytoanalysis. The series was very much in the same style and attitude as the sensational FOX series 24 and it was with much anticipation that I looked forward to this big screen movie version. Unfortunately perhaps my expectations were too great and Unfair The Movie rather disappointed with it's subdued action unexciting tone and surprisingly manipulative storyline.The movie takes place after the events of the TV special. Yukihira's life has settled back down to normalcy and she is making some headway in improving her relationship with daughter Miho albeit there is still some emotional distance. Thing go to hell when a failed assassination attempt is made on Yukihira's life but instead kills Yukihara's babysitter and severely injures Miho. Miho is rushed to nearby Toyosu Hospital where coincidently an influential Police Chief is also being treated in an unrelated matter. While Yukihira and her boss Saiki Jin Eguchi Yosuke investigate the attempt on Yukihira's life a group of young thugs take siege of Toyosu Hospital taking control of the facilities. They soon release all of its personnel and patients but hold the Police Police Chief for ransom. Miho is also still in the hospital having taken refuge during the initial takeover.As is quickly becoming a tired clich inept Police bureaucrats including Assistant Police Director Irie Osugi Ren make a number of dumb mistakes trying to take charge of the situation. They send a large contingent of their best Special Response Team members SAT  Special Attack Team to infiltrate the hospital only to see them seemingly wiped out by the youth gang in short order. They also refuse to relinquish to the gang's demand of almost 8000000000 yen in Police holdings and assets in exchange for the Police chief's life. In response the gang rather coldly executes the chief on televised video and next threatens to unleash Bubonic Plague cultures stored in the Hospital's disease control center to create a deadly pandemic in the heart of Tokyo.Yukihira desperate to get her daughter back decides to infiltrate the hospital on her own. With frequent partner Mikami Kaoru Kato Masaya in tow the two enter the hospital to save Miho and stop the gang.They soon discover that things are not all that they seem as they find that the gang is comprised of rogue members of their own Police Force and are being led by a former SAT CommanderPolice Academy Instructor Goutou Kuniyaki Shiina Kibei. Tired of the corruption and lack of leadership of the Police Department he has decided to rebel against the establishment and has recruited a number of Police Acedemy recruits as well as Yukihira's former friend and computer expert Hasumi Anna 80s JPop singeractress Hamada Mari to join his cause. Can Yukihira and Mikai stop this army and save Tokyo? Who was behind the assassination attack on Yukihira and how does it fit in with Yukihira's past?The screenplay by TV series scribe Sato Shimako Eko Eko Azaraku  Wizard of Darkness borrows elements liberally from Michael Bay's The Rock but doesn't give us much to get excited about. The story is rife with tired genre clichs sappy dialog and an almost too painfully contrived plot.I was particularly surprised by series director Kobayashi Yoshinori's almost anemic sense of storytelling her which was in stark contrary to the TV series. Shinohara Ryoko is definitely the big draw here as beautiful detective Yukihira and the producers know and exploit it. There is no shortage of the stunning Shinohara in wet blouse gun in hand and pouty expression mugging for attention. The saving grace for the film however is Eguchi Yosuke. While mainly known for his likable TV JDorama roles he plays a decidedly different character here who we can't really figure out or pin down. Is he in league with the villains or is he on Yukihira's side. His role is the most interesting aspect of the movie and I wish that had been played up more in the movie similar to what was done in Infernal Affairs.Shiina Kibei's Goutou had the potential to be as good of a character as Ed Harris' General Hummel character in The Rock but wasn't given much chance to shine as was Hamada Mari's treacherous character. While I wasn't expecting something as good as other deka movies like Abunai Deka Sukeban Deka or Odoru Daisosasen I certainly wasn't expecting the movie to disappoint so much.".

His role is the most interesting aspect of the movie and I wish that had been played up more in the movie similar to what was done in Infernal Affairs.Shiina Kibei's Goutou had the potential to be as good of a character as Ed Harris' General Hummel character in The Rock but wasn't given much chance to shine as was Hamada Mari's treacherous character. While I wasn't expecting something as good as other deka movies like Abunai Deka Sukeban Deka or Odoru Daisosasen I certainly wasn't expecting the movie to disappoint so much.";

The sets and costuming were well done to the extent that they did not detract from film. i.e. There was nothing strange that would distract the viewer from accepting that the hospital was indeed a hospital nor were there any gross violations of cinematic convention. Naturally the bomb was disarmed seconds before detonation. If it went off how could the picture continue without a lead? And did you ever notice the leads good andor bad guys never die from the first shot  only the bit players. Back to the main premise  could this film be any worse? Yes but if it were any worse I cannot imagine anyone willing to continue watching. It's just bad enough to entice you into thinking It's gonnagotta get better.

Merv and I think you should lose two stars just for naming a character 'Merv' is like watching a infomercial host doing a bad Bill Clinton impression.  He's so lifeless it's funny.

Ten years back they break up in Japan and lead new and separate lives in Italy. But whilst Aoi has found a new beau Junsei fails to fall out of love with her. Fleeting nearmisses and real encounters pass by as they discover what was really behind their relationship to start with and make their own decisions in the end.Calmi is a beautifully set film with the magical backdrop of Florence as its central setting. With additional scenes set in Milan and Japan it really did feel an international movie.However the film lacked the innovation we come to expect from an independent film. Sure there were a few fine moments of direction and cinematography especially many of the aerial and distance shots but there was nothing that really took your breath away.The storyline itself was much the same. Enough to keep you interested well written and nicely timed flashbacks but nothing that really surprised you. In a way you might have thought the story was a bit magical in that you couldn't expect it to surprise you. The characters also lacked a little depth not really allowing you to explore them. The film really didn't make you think too deeply at all.One of the most annoying aspects about Calmi is the soundtrack. Unfortunately I felt the choice of using several tracks from Enya's Paint The Sky With Stars was overdone and was often used in parts of the film where the music just didn't fit. There are pluses however where Enya wasn't used and the classical pieces did fit in well.I could go on summarising all the faults of the movie but I feel that it would be overcritical since I'm would be setting extremely high standards. Indeed I would like to stress that I did enjoy this film and it did engage some of my own emotions. There were some scenes where the acting was very good. I was impressed by the acting ability of Takenouchi having not seen before and also that of Chen.However I am disappointed that the film really didn't try enough to escape the boundaries that we associate with mainstream pictures and show us something more stunning to the eye. But I do offer it applause because ultimately it is a fine movie.".

The movie goes back and forth with flashbacks as to how the couple met and developed their relationship.The movie was too long at two hours and four minutes as it could have been done in a shorter period of time but hey glacial pace is a trademark of Japanese cinema. The setting in Italy is great and so is seeing scenes of that wonderful country. I would say that is where the good points stop. Much is not explained about the couple's relationship and such including Aoi's abortion and subsequent breakup. The side stories of Junsei's friends were not needed and looked hokey. And Michael Wong who played Aoi's new beau had the acting skills of a tree stump. In conclusion one reviewer said Asian perceptions of a love story greatly differ from those of the West and that is true. Perhaps Asians audiences will like this movie more than Western audiences.

And their acting is in my opinion slightly better than those seen in soap operas.  One terrible acting scene I would like to pick on is the scene where Akagi and Aoi kiss after long separation.  It is by far the most fakelooking and artificial kiss scenes I've ever seen. I won't elaborate further to avoid revealing the plot.  Also the English lines delivered by Aoi's boy friend sound really like reading out loud in monotone voice.  Terrible acting there. WarningSPOILERSAlso in my opinion the movie should have ended when they meet at the top of Duomo and not have to drag on to show more of the same predictable conclusion. WarningSPOILERS I would however still recommend this film on the cinematography and to the fans of Kelly Chen and Yutaka Takenouchi.  They do look good physically that is not the acting in particular in the movie.About the DVD region 2 DVD rosso is the one I have comes in anamorphic wide screen and the transfer is flawless along with the digital sound tracks.".

	schema:headline " More romantic than the original";
	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this Japanese remake of Ghost even more than the original Hollywood version. One of the problems with the original is that it could never quite decide what genre it wanted to be. Most people think of Ghost as a romance however since Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore's characters were already an established couple just moving in together at the film's start there wasn't a tremendous amount of romance in their relationship despite the famous pottery scene. The villains were dark enough to suggest this movie really wanted to be a thriller complete with a highstakes heist. Whoopi Goldberg's performance as the con artistturnedreal psychic was hilarious enough to garner her an Oscar yet her overthetop comedy completely broke the mood. By shoving together the elements of a romance thriller and comedy in ways that grated against rather than complemented each other the final product was a confused muddle.The remake falls much more solidly into the romance category starting when the couple first meets. There is a gender reversal from the original Nanami is the highpowered businesswoman Juno the sensitive male potter and it works well providing a more modern feel. We get to see them fall in love and watch as the unique moments they share  which will later become tells for Nanami as a ghost  are created. This makes these moments much more powerful for the audience and enhances the emotional punch of the couple's separation and longing for each other. While the Japanese version showed more restraint with the love scene staying at a PG rating rather than the PG13 of the American version don't mistake modesty for lack of passion. The pottery scene in this one is every bit as affecting as the original and far more tender.Several other changes help minimize distraction from the romance. The original version showed Swayze being reluctantly mentored by an unhinged spirit from the subway whose violence was senseless and disjointed from the rest of the film. The Japanese version uses a small child Nanami meets in the hospital not only is this more logical this character also ties in beautifully with Juno's decision in the climax of the film. The psychic is still eccentric and amusing but she never steals the show away from the leads. Also the fate of the missing funds in the American version is dropped completely replaced with a dramatic conclusion that provides much more emotional resonance. I found this version of Ghost to be more enchanting and satisfying overall than the original so it's one film that I'm glad they remade!".

	schema:reviewBody "It is said that there is no more room for originality in our postmodern world as everything the human race can conceive has been said done and documented. Even if some might disagree the constant regurgitation of remakes done onto our movie screens probably says otherwise. And surprisingly or maybe not the latest movie remake to hit our shores is one reproduced not by Hollywood but by the people most likely to come up with crazy stuff that no one else in the other corners of the world has probably thought of  the Japanese.Although there are several tweaks as compared to the Moore and Swayze original like the role reversal of its couple  the female partner dies in this one and the male is the ceramist 'Ghost' essentially takes on the same romantic fantasy plot. For those like me who were too young to experience the cultural impact of this early nineties movie watching the remake would probably not help us get any closer to that. If you are wondering just what form of cultural impact took place based on a movie about a girl and her lover from another dimension do know that it did bag amongst other accolades an Oscar Best Picture nomination in 1991. It seems that nothing much has changed and there is still something about the love between a person and a supernatural being that sets people off. Well at least the ghost lover in this movie does not sparkle she just glows with heavenly light.To be fair some effort has been made in updating the movie according to the tastes of today's audiences. Featuring dreamy retrotinged scenes of Tokyo's suburbs and a handsome and sensitive Korean character as the male lead it is obvious that the producers are aiming for a piece of the current East Asian zeitgeist. Looking and feeling very much like a heartwarming Korean drama fans of the genre might be easily pleased at watching two goodlooking people taking their time to fall in love and stay in love despite obstacles.Song Seung Heon model and familiar face of Kdramas like 'East of Eden' and 'Autumn Fairy Tale' plays Juno Kim  a Korean ceramist who lives in Tokyo. His girlfriend is Nanami  acted by another wellknown East Asian star Nanako Matsushima. Even if you are not a fan of Japanese dramas you might remember her as the lead in 'The Ring'. Both of them play their parts with a certain tender conservativeness and sensitivity that is probably not unusual for mainstream Asian romantic movies. To be honest it is no Hollywood romcom so if you do not enjoy beautiful people staring longingly into each other's eyes for the longest time and having sweet and unassuming interaction then you would probably be better off watching Natalie Portman's romantic movies.The saving grace to the slowness of 'Ghost' is Whoopi Goldberg's equivalent  Satsuki Unten the fake psychic. With her stereotypical crazy old psychic expression and jittery demeanor she adds laughter and a twist of craziness to the already quite absurd situation. As she is contacted by Nanami and proceeds to discover that her fake psychic powers are not so fake anymore hilarity ensues as she tries to convince the grieving boyfriend that his girlfriend is still around and there is more to her death than is known. The eventual tragic parting after all the unfinished business is completed is guaranteed to draw some tears  only if you can get over the fact that she is a ghost and that dead people can return in movies.www.moviexclusive.com".

And when Nanami dies there is a great deal of grieving on both sides.

	schema:headline " A Good UpToDate Japanese Remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghost is a Japanese remake of the late Patrick Swayze and Demi Moorestarrer box office hit of the same title.It stars Nanako Matsushima and Song Seungheon together with Kirin Kikiwho plays the familiar Whoopi Goldberg role from the original as the physic Uten and Mana Ashida.The screenplay was written by Miho Nakazono and Shimako Sato was taken from story of Bruce Joel Rubin. Nanami is a very wealthy entrepreneur who met Kim Junhoa Korean potter one night after going home drunk.After seemingly spending a night together and a rough start in their friendshipit develops into a surprising romance as they fall in love with one another despite having nothing in common.They decide to get married and spend a very happy life for one year.UnexpectedlyNanami was killed by a biker after a robbery and arises as a ghost.She tries to stay on earth for a while after realizing that she was murdered and her husband's life is in danger.She also tries to utilize the psychic powers of Uten to be able to communicate to Junho and acquires help from a child ghost in a hospital to be able to do things needed to complete her mission.This film definitely took a lot of plot elements from Rubin's story such as the love making while doing pottery and the familiar song Unchained Melody is playing in the backgroundthe familiar expression ditto the comedic physic who never realizes her ability until talking to Nanamithe bestfriend who was involved in a fraud in the company and the unexpected murder of the biker whose intention was simply for robbery.One maybe turned off by it especially if one is a great fan of the 1990 film.But neverthelessit is still nice to see how a Japanese film play them well with respect to their culture despite of doing an American remake. The obvious difference in the remake is that it is the woman Nanamiwho was murdered and turned into a ghost and looks after her husband instead of the manSam Wheat in the original.I felt that this was somewhat contrary to Japanese culture considering that men normally can take care of their own and do really need help from others particularly women.What's also interesting is the fact that it was the woman who is more successful than the man in terms of wealth as she owns her own company while the man was a simple and downtoearth potter.That is probably one reason why the male protagonist happens to be a Korean in Junho so as not to spark tension or controversy.That is why I commend this film for doing it to promote somehow promote feminism.What's also good about it is the romance between Nanami and Junho was the centerpoint of the story instead of instead of trying to include too many genres unlike in the original that the romance gets lost at some parts.It was also great job by the Japanese scriptwriters to minimize the role of the Whoopi Goldbergrole psychic instead of turning it into an important character unlike in the original who unfortunately was able to steal the show from Sam and Molly in the original.This made the lead characters central to the movie.In other wordsviewers will definitely be focused on what happens to both Nanami and Junho instead of another supporting character.Another change that I like in the film is that it was a child who teaches Nanami various things about being ghost.This somehow made the film heartwarming considering that Nanami's unexpected death never allowed her to have a child.FinallyI commend Nanako Matsushima for a great performance.She definitely made Nanami interesting and deserving of our empathy especially when we see her anguish and pain after an unexpected death and her happiness when she was able to complete her mission and spending a few moments with her husband before leaving earth.Overallthis Japanese film was a good uptodate remake in the 21st century.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first question to pop into mind is is there a necessity to remake Jerry Zucker's Ghost which starred Demi Moore and the late Patrick Swayze setting the box office ablaze to the tune of half a billion dollars worldwide propelling clay pottery into the stratosphere of sensuousness boosted by Unchained Melody. It's the image that comes to mind when one remembers this film and it's a tremendous hard act to beat for any remake. One may think that the Japanese may fuse their own romantic sensibilities into this one but the end result is sucking all romanticism out of it and becoming the parody that Zucker is also famed for.Narratively it's almost the same as the Hollywood version with young CEO Nanami Nanako Matsushima falling in love with Korean potter JunHo Song SeungHeon and having their romance cut short when one of them has to depart from this world because of a crime committed that was disguised like a petty theft only for the story to unravel itself and provide that more than meets the eye touch with the plot thickened to include a threat to the life of the still living partner. And to bridge between the lovers they communicate via hack medium Unten Kirin Kiri who provides comic relief as the proxy between the two worlds since she's the only party who can hear the undead. And she's the best part of the movie.So what went wrong? Well everything unfortunately. There's a distinct lack of chemistry between the two leads and their romance was very forced like fitting square pegs to round holes. The direction by Taro Otani also came up short and the alarm bells rang out when he allowed Nanami to give JunHo a slap thinking that he had seduced her into a one night stand but that slap was a meek laughable brush of the cheek with JunHo reacting like a good one had been smacked right across his face. Making things worse having a whiny male also made it unbearable with JunHo lamenting why Nanami refuses to say those three words that he spouts so freely. To think it's usually the other way round.One of the highlights of the Hollywood film is for its time the painstaking level of detail gone into making Swayze's character ghostly and that means removing every frame of shadow and reflection because well spirits don't have them. Here you can detect attempts to do something similar but not as meticulous which is a pity though the effects of passing through humans and walls were still nicely done. Like a typical Japanese film there must be Kawaii moments and this come courtesy of a ghostly friendly child almost like Casper in manner to milk some expired emotions in the last act when you know the two main leads cannot deliver at the emotional level.To make matters worse the romance here was cold and void of feelings. The bed scene made Mediacorp attempts look like vulgar hardcore porn and Unchained Melody was covered by a really weak rendition coming on at such a wrong time that demonstrated impotency at delivering when it mattered. This remake is ghastly cold and tried too hard to evoke a sense of sincere warmth that usually comes automatically with the territory of the genre. If you want to watch Ghost then watch the original Hollywood version as this remake pales in comparison offering nothing new nor matching up to the bar already set.".

It is unbelievably quickly for the two to fall in love even though they have nothing in common.My main complain is the male actor who played Juno. He seems to have a hard time expressing sadness.

The participants though young had potentially too much to lose for the raid to be dismissed as a student prank. Like it or not there was real patriotic fervour at work here and a desire to remedy an old wrong. This is a well written well acted film although the reaction of the Scottish critics would have you think otherwise. It is hard to know what personal or professional uncertainty made for such a grudging reception but it would be a pity if it meant that fewer people saw the film.".

Stone of Destiny tells the true story of Ian Hamilton a young student and nationalist who was to attempt to return the Stone to its rightful place in Scotland and thereby right a longstanding injustice by the English.The cast is strong and features the likes of Robert Carlyle Brenda Fricker and Billy Boyd that fool of a Took. However Charlie Cox once again caught my attention following his leading role in Stardust. Given he is not a native Scot he makes a great effort at the accent and again manages to portray his character with a great balance of likability determination and youthful exuberance and gives us hope that some of the next generation's leading men can combine acting and looking good... Director Charles Martin Smith does wonderfully in conveying the underdog theme brilliantly with a good balance of action comedy and emotion. It's a definite feelgood movie with the people around me clapping at the end. 5 stars a British gem.".

Otherwise you'll still get a warm feeling inside The cast are likable and their performances are good  although Charlie Cox and Kate Mara's accents weren't entirely convincing they both put in winning performances. The supporting cast are also good value with Stephen McCole making a very personable member of the team. Billy Boyd and Robert Carlyle do well with slightly limited roles.There are a few niggles  like the aforementioned accents  and some suspiciously green looking trees given that its set in winter but these are minor.

Student Ian Hamilton frustrated by what appears to be a lack of spirit in the people of Scotland hatches a plan to steal the Stone Of Destiny from Westminster Abbey and bring it home....The movie is based on a book written by Hamilton himself. Now I've not read it so I'm not sure what the author will think of the finished movie but I enjoyed it. Written for the screen and directed by Charles Martin Smith this is Scotland as portrayed by Americans. It's a romantic sweeping place full of downtrodden Scots. It's a view of Scotland that you only ever see in the movies. However it fits the mood of the piece as this movie does have an oldfashioned feel about it. It recalls the Ealing movies of the '50s with the whole thing if not played out for laughs then certainly with a lot of humour in the drama.The robbers as portrayed by Charlie Cox Kate Mara Ciaron Kelly and Stephen McCole come over as enthusiastic if bumbling students who manage to steal the Stone through luck as much as anything else. The movie definitely sides with them.The cast which also includes Robert Carlyle Peter Mullan and Billy Boyd are very good indeed even if some of the accents don't convince.I'm not sure how historically accurate the movie is but as a movie while it does have an oldfashioned feel it is enjoyable and good natured and like Braveheart before it make you proud to be Scottish!".

	schema:headline " A Crazy Patriotic Idea";
	schema:reviewBody "Scotland remains engulfed in its own history. One can see simply from the landscape that it is an ancient land of many events and peoples that have led to its creation. One of its most ancient symbols is the Stone of Scone which was present at every Scottish crowning ceremony until Edward the First the arch villain in Braveheart stole it and brought it to England. In the 1950's a group of patriotic youths hatched a plan to steal it back for Scotland.The film is quirky and serious at the same time. Ian Hamilton is played by a youthful Charlie Cox who reminded me of Robert Sean Leonard's character in Dead Poet's Society. He is easygoing in life but utterly devoted to his country. This sense of patriotism gives him the need to want to do something great for Scotland and he is inspired by an old scrapbook article to steal back the Stone of Scone known as the Stone of Destiny in the film.Enrolling his friend Bill Billy Boyd from Lord of the Rings into this scheme the two of them begin an intensive research into Westminster Abbey to take back the Stone. However Bill drops out of the plan when he realizes just how much is at stake. Ian bounces back immediately by finding a group of other youths to help him. He recruits Kay for her patriotism who brings in Gavin for his strength and boisterous personality who brings in Alan for his extra car.These four embark on a trip to London and in between the planning of the grand caper they learn more about themselves in the process. Ian is so steadfast in his own plan that he finds it difficult to realize as Gavin puts it that someone else other than him might be right. Gavin himself has been labeled as a party animal and a carefree man that opens bottles with his teeth and he wonders if he's more than that. Alan is insecure and shy trying to find something to do that shows people what he's capable of. Kay brings her smarts and her spunky attitude to the group and on the way develops feelings for Ian on the way. The way they finally acknowledge these feelings for each other is shown in a very funny scene just outside Westminster Abbey.The plan itself was real as were the four people who underwent the plan. To say that they failed to bring the stone back is both true and false. True the stone was taken back to England false because bringing the stone across the border was half the success. The point of the plan was to show the average Scot that they could be proud of their heritage and be able to unshackle themselves from English domination. While this took yet more time after the breakin it eventually came about.As a film I enjoyed this very much. The characters were presented very well particularly the youths and Robert Carlyle's character of an elderly professor who tries to win Scotland's freedom through a petition early in the film and provides funding for the youths to travel to England. British humour has rarely failed for me and this film was able to show the deep motivations for taking the Stone back while at the same time show how crazy of a scheme it really was.Scotland has certainly need to go to great lengths to show its identity over the years. What other nation's heroes could go from a screaming warrior leading a horde of his countrymen in a bloody battle against the superior English forces to four rebellious youths sneaking through the back door of Westminster Abbey?".

The Scottishnationalist premise and the political message certainly would have prevented me from seeing the film had it come to our small town. But that's not what the film is about. I caught this flick on a lonely Tuesday. It was on a cheap disk marked 'fantasy'  no doubt because Billy Boyd starred in LOTR.What is this movie about? A college student hatches a plan to steal Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey in 1950. He gathers three accomplices two of whom are engineering students. Based on a true story this ridiculous plot actually happened and the thieves were charged but never prosecuted for reasons that are obvious after watching the film.Why should you see it? Anyone who has been young enough and dumb enough and bright enough to give a flip about anything will be rooting for these idiots all the way through. The film takes a bit to get started but once they decide to steal the Stone of Destiny it actually runs quite fast and if you don't pay attention you'll get lost.The film is remarkably funny. Ever see a 1950's crimecomedy? The story might as well be a comedy. Even the villains  the British  are so charming and normal one wonders why the kids are so intently interested in the Scottish nationalism.Why was the film panned? Young men and one young woman valiantly risk their lives and their future for their nation and their community in a daring plot that could only succeed with a divine blessing they never bother to ask for. ... Need I say more? Patriotism. Virtue. Honor. Duty. Charity. Faith. Sacrifice. All wrapped in a plot so stupid only a couple of engineering students could hatch it. No propaganda. No Hollywood spew. The good guys are all Scots. What's not to hate? I'm surprised the flick was even made.If you can stand a flick with pretty good acting not great but not civic theater and a bit of humor you will enjoy this movie. It is set in the 50's and but for a couple of probably unavoidable goofs it feels like the real 50's.I gave the movie a couple of extra stars... it's a special gem we see so little of.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am just going to say it up front....this story is about the SUCCESSFUL theft of the sacred Stone of Destiny also called the Stone of Scone. I say this up front because most Brits know about the stone and its theft back in 1950or at least they should. So it's not like it's a huge secret but I checked the spoiler alert so that readers will know that I am divulging a secret. Why did a group of Scots sneak into Westminster Abbey to steal some rock anyway?! Well this was the coronation stone which traditionally sat underneath the Scottish monarchs when they were made king or queenand it was stolen by the English in the late 13th century. Over the years Scots felt a sting to their pride and ultimately a group of Scottish nationalists stole it back...temporarily. The film is about the students responsible and it recreates the crime whether it was a crime depends on your perspective.This is a very well acted film featuring mostly young unknown actors. Despite their inexperience the film did a nice job of conveying the story and was assisted by the man who was actually behind this theft! All in all a very interesting filmespecially since the entire operation was so incredibly amateurish and shouldn't have succeeded! As I say above it was like the Three Stooges pulling off a heistsomething that never should have happened BUT which makes those not involved in any way like this American with neither Scottish nor English heritage laugh at the absurdity of it all. Well worth seeing.".

Well this was the coronation stone which traditionally sat underneath the Scottish monarchs when they were made king or queenand it was stolen by the English in the late 13th century. Over the years Scots felt a sting to their pride and ultimately a group of Scottish nationalists stole it back...temporarily. The film is about the students responsible and it recreates the crime whether it was a crime depends on your perspective.This is a very well acted film featuring mostly young unknown actors. Despite their inexperience the film did a nice job of conveying the story and was assisted by the man who was actually behind this theft! All in all a very interesting filmespecially since the entire operation was so incredibly amateurish and shouldn't have succeeded! As I say above it was like the Three Stooges pulling off a heistsomething that never should have happened BUT which makes those not involved in any way like this American with neither Scottish nor English heritage laugh at the absurdity of it all. Well worth seeing.";

But I felt unsure about what the film was aiming to be. It wasn't funny enough to call itself a comedy and some of the humour was verging on farce especially the scenes where the characters are running around the streets of London narrowly missing each other.It wasn't dramatic enough because the characters were on the whole cartoons and I didn't really feel involved or concerned about them  it seemed very american formula road trip but set in 1950s UK  nice handsome lead character funny fat guy with a heart pretty girl who starts off strong but ends up simply being the love interest for the lead character and then the geeky skinny nonentity who makes good before the end. There was some tension in the scenes set in Westminster Abbey when they were trying to steel the stone  but you never really believed that they were ever going to be caught but of course the 50s were years before mobile phones laser burglar alarms and burglars abseiling down from ceilings on micro wires.From a political point of view it was pretty full on in its portrayal of the Nationalist movement  but even this didn't feel fully developed and was perhaps more of an attempt to impress Sean Connery who is a staunch advocate of Scottish Independence and was at the Premiere as well as he is Patron of the Edinburgh Film Festival.Despite these comments I did enjoy the film.

There is rarely harm in student pranks and the students do learn things but as in this case they rarely change the world. So it looks nice but it would have been good to see more Scottish talent on display. I am very happy looking at Kate Mara on screen having seen her in 'Shooter' she was one of the reasons that I went to see the film she was a different character. They all handled their accents well enough for me not to notice and the group worked well together. The production is well done and looked right to my eyes for the time of the film. I think that the script could have been developed more. There is a repeated scene with characters running past each other. I did not walk out really understanding the basic desire that drove the theft of the stone.".

It stars Gudrun Landgrebe as the title character and she was one of the biggest female actresses at this point in terms of star power. The supporting players also include a couple somewhat famous names but I will not mention them. just check the cast list. The title of this movie is tough. It is a major spoiler actually as the entire movie is about what happened exactly that drove one character to madness that he would set Landgrebe's character on fire. But then again it looked like van Ackeren for whatever reason decided that this was actually not too relevant when he randomly shows us the main character in the final scene with no injuries at all. Did this play before the attack? I don't think so and yet she looks like nothing happened. Years must have passed inbetween and even then she cannot be uninjured again I believe. However I am not a doctor so who knows. To me it felt like a forced happy ending though in the worst possible way one could imagine. Lacked realism entirely.I personally did not enjoy the watch at all. I guess the German Film Awards got it right with not paying any awards attention to this one here. It is like a weak man's version of a Fassbinder movie with a lot more sexuality. Sadly these explicit scenes added little in terms of the story and to me it really just seemed they were included to make the film even more controversial. I was fairly disappointed with this film. Landgrebe once again could not convince me that she can carry a film on her own even if she is in almost every scene of the movie. I have no idea why the German Film Academy would pick this very mediocre work to represent Germany at the Academy Awards that year. No surprise this one did not even manage a nomination. The only somewhat thumbsup I can give is for Carrire who was solid with what he was given and elevated the material on some occasions. But that is far from enough to let me recommend this one. I give it a thumbs down and it is another example of how the 1980s really weren't great for German film if a movie like this one here gets so much attention and praise.".

King Creole1958 is such a film where he is given the chance to act and he passes with flying colors.  King Creole1958 and the western Charro1968 are my two favorite Elvis Presley films because of their dark tone and the excellent acting performances by Elvis.

	schema:reviewBody "To a lot of critics and nonfans of the Master of Song or King of Rock 'n' Roll to give him his correct title Elvis Presley was merely a wooden celluloid freak who just sang to children animals and everybody's Grandmother on a movie set. That might have been the case during the mid'60's when Elvis didn't know how to perform on a movie set any other way than to follow the less than mediocre script which was getting more tedious and morose as the previous one. This trend was set by the formula that started with G.I. Blues and finally reaffirmed with the classic Blue Hawaii from then on in with the exception of Flaming Star it was a pretty poor ragbag bunch. However King Creole was Elvis' jewel in the crown. The film is a testimony to a time when rebellion amongst teenage life was coming to the fore and the struggle for a young person's individuality in society was a constant threat to many parents of the 1950's genre. If Elvis was to be a big movie star this is the one that certainly went a step further than Jailhouse Rock to ascertain that position. Elvis' acting improved over the three film period of 195657 and in King Creole you can see the transition. He brings to the screen all the grittiness excitement tension that his character Danny Fisher is all about. This great quality movie really pays justice to a classic piece of film making by Director Michael Curtiz and a great supporting cast that Elvis gained so much from performing with in this story. Another transition also happens in this movie and that is one of the music. Apparently Elvis never really liked Jazz music but he certainly forgot all about that when he cut the soundtrack to this movie. I'm sure that Jazz music featured slightly higher on his list after he realised what he could do in the studio with this kind of music and blending it with his own rock rythmns and blues orientations. To me this is one of the greatest films ever made by one of the most underrated actors of our time. To the critics and nonfans alike Watch it and Weep!".

There was one movie can't remember which one there were over 30 in which he reportedly told the director after filming was done Hey nice movie maybe I'll read the script sometime . In other words Elvis hated the fact that he wasn't getting good scripts. He was the first real money making star which is what ultimately lead to the atrocious film roles. Well except for maybe 4 or 5 of his films. Anyway if you never saw Elvis in a movie before which I find hard to believe with all the Elvis marathons on tv see this one!".

	schema:reviewBody "I had an epiphany tonight. 'King Creole' is a better film than 'Jailhouse Rock'. 'Jailhouse' may contain King's best acting but 'King Creole' is his best film. Why? I would say King's acting is only slightly less convincing in 'Creole' but two things make it a better film the cast and the story. 'King Creole' boasts the finest cast by far of any Presley film. Only AnnMargret is sexier than Carolyn Jones Vic Morrow has that ferocious mouth Dean Jagger is almost perfect as the beaten father and Walter Matthau is deliciously vile. Harold Robbins' novel 'A Stone for Danny Fisher' is gritty and at times hard to read. Although the screenplay cowritten by 'Frankie FiveAngels' Michael V. Gazzo is quite a bit more tame it is still tough. Think about it King plays a character who kills a man in an alley with a switchblade. Here he is not 'Jailhouse Rock's amoral Vince Everett. Instead he is at times IMmoral. Forget all you think you know about the icon Elvis Presley and watch his eyes when as Danny Fisher he tells his father 'you go to school. I'm goin' out to make a buck'. If you don't see it if you don't see IT you're just not looking.".

	schema:headline " And He Goes By The Name of King Creole";
	schema:reviewBody "By this time Elvis Presley was a big movie box office name due in no small measure to the astute management of Colonel Tom Parker. I have no doubt that the Colonel got him Michael Curtiz as a director and a top flight supporting cast consisting of Oscar winners like Dean Jagger as the King's father and Walter Matthau as the villain of the piece. And other such outstanding players as Carolyn Jones Vic Morrow Paul Stewart and Dolores Hart. Presley steps into James Dean territory here had he lived I'm sure Dean would have played the part of Danny Fisher in what would have been a nonmusical story or one where Dean's singing would have been dubbed. Danny Fisher is just the kind of troubled youth searching for himself that Dean excelled with in East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause. In fact in the relationship between Presley and Jagger you can see a lot of the dynamics of Dean's and Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause.Elvis has had to go to work because his father has been unable to hold down a job ever since the death of his wife. So's Elvis's sister Jan Shepard also had to work. He gets a break in Walter Matthau's club with an impromptu audition but it's rival owner Paul Stewart who hires Elvis. That sets the stage for a lot of the action to come.For those who are used to seeing Walter Matthau as the lovable grouch starting from The Odd Couple it would surprise many to learn most of his early roles were bad guys. He's an exceptionally nasty bad guy in King Creole.The title song became one of Elvis's early best sellers and it is also the name of the club Matthau owns in the New Orleans French Quarter. Presley has some other good numbers in this film as well.Some other reviewers have mentioned that Elvis should have done more dramatic stuff like King Creole. Maybe he should have who knows. But I think the point should be made is that first and foremost Elvis was a singing icon not an acting one. As were the idols of former generations Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. I don't think Elvis was willing to push himself as player in the same way they were. Neither Crosby or Sinatra also had a manager with as tight a control over them creatively as Colonel Tom Parker. Both Crosby and Sinatra got Oscars but it was for parts that they knew they could handle and went after especially Sinatra. Maybe Elvis in the words of another icon knew his limitations or the Colonel did.King Creole also was one of the first of Harold Robbins's novels to be made into a film. Yet it's never thought of as a Robbins film like The Carpetbaggers or The Betsy. It's an Elvis film first and foremost.And that's good enough for fans of the King and others.".

	schema:reviewBody "That Elvis Presley's film career gradually petered out after years of making trivialhackneyedfluffy and emptyheaded movies is to be regrettedyet in several early films JAILHOUSE ROCKFLAMING STARhe showed he could give a perfectly decent acting performance alongside good scriptsdirectors and actors.It is arguable that KING CREOLE was his best overall filmand perhaps his most effective big screen performance.Disillusioned youth Danny Fisher Presley lives in New Orleans' French Quarter with his recently widowed father Dean Jagger and sister Jan Shepard.His pharmacist father is finding it tough to cope without his wife and cannot find regular workwhile Danny flunks his college studies to work in a nightclub owned by sleazy crook Maxie Fields Walter Matthau and begins to take romantic interest in a boozy if pitiable trampRonnieused by Fields as a mistress Carolyn Jones.He toys with joining a gang of hoodlums led by Shark Vic Morrowand attracts the attentions of a sweetnatured shopgirlNellie Dolores Hart.With his talent for singingDanny decides not to work in Fields' venuesbut of his rival Charlie LeGrand insteadthe King Creolewhere he is a great success.Fields resents Danny's behaviour and is determined fair ways or foul to force Danny to work for himbut Danny will make his own decisions who he works and falls in love with.Elvis Presley had some good scripts offered in his earlier film career like the above forementionedand KING CREOLE was possibly the best of them.He not only had a good script and story but a topclass producer Hal B.Wallislegendary director Michael Curtizfine actors MatthauJonesJaggerMorrowPaul Stewartaccomplished cameraman Russell Harlangood production and musical numbers too.Presley is very good as the meanmoody but sympathetic youth veering from delinquency to hard workrecalling the ambiance of a younger Marlon Brando or James Dean.He is well supported by Ms Jonesmaking her somewhat trashy character into a threedimensionaltragic nearheroineMatthau as the crooked nightclub operatorJagger as his vulnerable fatherMorrow as a streetwise thugand HartShepard and Stewart doing efficiently in minor but interesting roles.Wallis and Curtiz of course worked together on one the alltime greats CASABLANCA 1942and although KING CREOLE is nowhere in that classa certain moodysmoky atmosphere like the BogartBergman classic is successfully evoked by Harlan's shadowynoirlike lighting and angles in scenes set in the French Quarter and clubsand is immeasurably helped by some high quality songs such as the haunting opener 'Crawfish' where Elvis sings in a duet'Trouble''Dixieland Rock''Hard Headed Woman' and of course the peerless title track.Occasionallythere are one or two uncomfortable dramatic moments that Presley struggles withand the film is somewhat overlongbut KING CREOLE is generally a fine crime drama with musical and noirish elements well handled by the master of versatility Curtiz.Pre1961The King made a number of fine films like thisbut under the influence of Colonel Tom Parkerhe was forced into garishly coloured and obviously contrived entertainments which utilised the same banal plotsdull and repetitive scriptsuninspiring actors and ageing or mediocre directors which caused Presley to call a halt on his film career by the end of the 60's.Had he managed to work with the kind of scriptstory and crew he collaborated with on KING CREOLEwho knows how better his tarnished reputation on movies would've beenas it iswe can be grateful that KING CREOLE shows us how good Elvis was with such top technical and artistic backingand how better he may have become as a screen actor.".

	onyx:emotionText "That Elvis Presley's film career gradually petered out after years of making trivialhackneyedfluffy and emptyheaded movies is to be regrettedyet in several early films JAILHOUSE ROCKFLAMING STARhe showed he could give a perfectly decent acting performance alongside good scriptsdirectors and actors.It is arguable that KING CREOLE was his best overall filmand perhaps his most effective big screen performance.Disillusioned youth Danny Fisher Presley lives in New Orleans' French Quarter with his recently widowed father Dean Jagger and sister Jan Shepard.His pharmacist father is finding it tough to cope without his wife and cannot find regular workwhile Danny flunks his college studies to work in a nightclub owned by sleazy crook Maxie Fields Walter Matthau and begins to take romantic interest in a boozy if pitiable trampRonnieused by Fields as a mistress Carolyn Jones.He toys with joining a gang of hoodlums led by Shark Vic Morrowand attracts the attentions of a sweetnatured shopgirlNellie Dolores Hart.With his talent for singingDanny decides not to work in Fields' venuesbut of his rival Charlie LeGrand insteadthe King Creolewhere he is a great success.Fields resents Danny's behaviour and is determined fair ways or foul to force Danny to work for himbut Danny will make his own decisions who he works and falls in love with.Elvis Presley had some good scripts offered in his earlier film career like the above forementionedand KING CREOLE was possibly the best of them.He not only had a good script and story but a topclass producer Hal B.Wallislegendary director Michael Curtizfine actors MatthauJonesJaggerMorrowPaul Stewartaccomplished cameraman Russell Harlangood production and musical numbers too.Presley is very good as the meanmoody but sympathetic youth veering from delinquency to hard workrecalling the ambiance of a younger Marlon Brando or James Dean.He is well supported by Ms Jonesmaking her somewhat trashy character into a threedimensionaltragic nearheroineMatthau as the crooked nightclub operatorJagger as his vulnerable fatherMorrow as a streetwise thugand HartShepard and Stewart doing efficiently in minor but interesting roles.Wallis and Curtiz of course worked together on one the alltime greats CASABLANCA 1942and although KING CREOLE is nowhere in that classa certain moodysmoky atmosphere like the BogartBergman classic is successfully evoked by Harlan's shadowynoirlike lighting and angles in scenes set in the French Quarter and clubsand is immeasurably helped by some high quality songs such as the haunting opener 'Crawfish' where Elvis sings in a duet'Trouble''Dixieland Rock''Hard Headed Woman' and of course the peerless title track.Occasionallythere are one or two uncomfortable dramatic moments that Presley struggles withand the film is somewhat overlongbut KING CREOLE is generally a fine crime drama with musical and noirish elements well handled by the master of versatility Curtiz.Pre1961The King made a number of fine films like thisbut under the influence of Colonel Tom Parkerhe was forced into garishly coloured and obviously contrived entertainments which utilised the same banal plotsdull and repetitive scriptsuninspiring actors and ageing or mediocre directors which caused Presley to call a halt on his film career by the end of the 60's.Had he managed to work with the kind of scriptstory and crew he collaborated with on KING CREOLEwho knows how better his tarnished reputation on movies would've beenas it iswe can be grateful that KING CREOLE shows us how good Elvis was with such top technical and artistic backingand how better he may have become as a screen actor.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sure Elvis is the star but the real force making it a great movie is Michael Curtiz. King Creole has a great cast great acting a solid script and many interesting musical numbers not to mention excellent cinematography. Without all this it might have just been another Elvis vehicle. Look at the list of Curtiz' movies  Yankee Doodle Dandee Casablanca Mission to Moscow to name three in a row  can you find a more versatile director? I don't think there is any Curtiz style each is unique in each he fits the movie to the material. His work begins in the silent era 1912 yet King Creole epitomizes the 1950s. And Curtiz 72 knows how to showcase the talent and energy of Elvis presenting him as an artist. Yes Elvis can act. There isn't a wrong note anywhere and it is a relatively complex role. I suppose the next question the studios would have asked is whether he had the depth to play a wide range of characters. Could Elvis transform himself into someone else? That is great acting. I'm thinking of someone like Paul Newman  or Walter Matthau. Elvis never got a chance to find out. Perhaps the studios looked at King Creole and decided not to push their luck and stick to the Elvis persona?To do good acting you need a good cast to react off of and he had it here. We see some real chemistry and sparks flying as they interact with Elvis. Here is Matthau at his finest. This is no mobster don caricature we see cruelty and cunning but also rays of kindness and genuine appreciation for Elvis' talent. And who would guess that Ronnie  Carolyn Jones  was also Morticia in the Addams Family or Julie Rawlings in How the West was Won? I am not a big Elvis fan though I do respect the emotional energy of his style. Those who are not familiar with Elvis should watch King Creole to understand why he was so influential.At first I was disappointed that there wasn't a broader range of musical styles displayed given the title King Creole and the fact that Elvis's musical roots are in the black jazz and blues of Memphis Tennessee. It appeared to be all all high octane Elvis. But then I looked closer and realized that Elvis' musical roots are indeed on display in the movie. Even in the slower numbers the Elvis intensity just made them seem high octane.The only Creole influence is seen in the opening number of street vendors calling out their wares Crawfish similar to the Street Cries number in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. But it does set up the musical environment.The first performance number Trouble shows Elvis singing with a Dixieland group but it is actually a solid blues number in a style similar to TBone Walker Stormy Monday. Now this is Elvis' roots. The closest to a slow love ballad is Lover Doll in the Five and Dime accompanied only by a bass. The closest to jazz is New Orleans which starts slow like W.C. Handy and shows a connection between Elvis' style and jazz including a banjo and some Dixieland riffs. In the number King Creole the only connection to the movie's title aside from the club's name we see typical Elvis energy and tempo but also some of the blues and jazz roots we saw more clearly in earlier numbers. Later we have a somewhat gratuitous Dixieland Rock which sounds a lot like Jailhouse Rock and is closer to pure Elvis than most numbers here. The distinctive double clapping by Elvis that sets up the number echoed by the band corresponds to the sound of a car driving over a loose manhole cover. If you'd ever lived with one outside your window you would recognize it. Don't Ask Me Why is a slow number in the style of many Fifties pop songs and a takeoff of O Sole Mio an old Italian song that's seen many permutations including Elvis' later It's Now or Never.What stands out at least to the modern listener is the high energy fast beat Elvis style that became so famous. But actually Curtiz does a good job of mixing styles and tempos and of providing a sort of chronology of musical influences on Elvis in the various numbers. The range could have been a bit broader but this was 1958 and the movie was helping to establish Elvis' musical identity. The influence of black jazz and blues is there to the observant viewer but not fully highlighted. This was the Fifties and displaying too much black influence would have been risky. What we do see was a actually a bold move though setting it in New Orleans makes it more acceptable and probably enhanced Elvis' edgy bad boy image with the teenagers and James Dean crowd. Now if they had made Elvis' role truly Creole part black and part French that would have been ballsy for the time.I suppose you could say the best Elvis movie is the one that was never made the mature actor singing in a broad range of styles rock jazz blues creole and ballads. It's too bad he didn't return to his musical roots in later years as well as acting. But King Creole comes surprisingly close to providing Elvis' musical testament. In the end Curtiz delivers not only fine acting and a fine script but also some fine music in an assortment of Elvis' style. Once again Curtiz fitted the movie to the material.".

Mobster Walter Matthau and his boy toy Carolyn Jones fill out the plot and subplot. Vic Morrow is a convincing thug. Dolores Hart plays the good girl love interest. This song filled flic is highlighted by numbers like Trouble Hard Headed Woman and of course King Creole. I agree with anyone that thinks this is one of Elvis' greatest movies if not the best!";

It stars Elvis Presley Carolyn Jones Walter Matthau Dolores Hart Dean Jagger Vic Morrow Paul Stewart and Jan Shepard. Music is scored by Walter Scharf and cinematography by Russell Harlan. Plot finds Presley as Danny Fisher a high school student struggling at school who falls in with the wrong crowd just as family matters of the heart start to take a hold.He said anybody that disagreed with you got a punch in the mouth. Is that what I brought you up to do to fight?The last film Presley made before going off to do his service in the army King Creole is his best film. It's one of only a small handful that showed the star actually had some acting ability here he gets a top director to work under and a very tidy cast put along side him for him to respond too. Presley immediately warmed to Curtiz CasablancaMildred Pierce wilfully doing as he was told by the wily old director rewarding the film fan with a performance of some merit. Presley would often say it was his personal favourite of his own films and it's not hard to see why. Though packed with musical numbers many of them belters as well the film always stays dramatic in fact the tunes form part of the narrative they are not frothy interludes slotted in purely for fan appeasement.Everything he touches turns to drink.It's not unreasonable to expect King Creole to be a fun movie the kind where Elvis flies a plane speeds around on power boats or saves the word during a treasure hunt because the poster art and DVD covers lend you to think that. Honestly one shows the King with guitar wrapped around him hips bent and a huge smile on his face the other has the same Elvis pose but along side him is a smiling beauty bedecked in a banana patterned dress! I mean really would you think this film is shot in moody black and white features murders theft family upheaval drunks knife fights wasted life and all round dirty tricks? That the King is snarly aggressive and channelling Jim Stark from Rebel Without a Cause? Because all these things reside within this potent and most agreeable Elvis picture.Now you know. That's how you get into it.With the drama relocated from the New York of the novel to Bourbon Street New Orleans and Danny Fisher changed from a boxer to a singer atmosphere needed to be tight to the emotionally battered story. And it is very much so with Harlan RamrodRiot in Cell Block 11 doing a great job of making The Big Easy come off as The Big Seedy. This is a world of back alleys where hoodlum youths dwell and of wet tinged streets barely lit by gas lamps many of the night scenes shot here are worthy of film noir status with a rain sodden mugging sequence truly top of the line. Conversely Curtiz also paints a bustling Orleans picture with song clubs and street sellers proving to be the heartbeat of the city. It's a twin viewpoint of Orleans that matches other duality themes that drive the narrative forward because Danny is caught between two girls and two night club owners.Cast are very good across the board with Matthau menacing Morrow weasel like Jagger and Jones sad and pitiful Stewart elegantly honest and Hart doing a neat line in confused love. Stand out tunes include the title song Hard Headed Woman Trouble Steadfast Loyal and True Lover Doll and the quite beautiful As Long As I Have You. It's not perfect serious crime goes unpunished the main motive driving on Matthau's club boss is rather weak and the two love interest girls are written lazily as love sick puppies. Yet this is still a cracker of a movie where Presley bristles with magnetism and emotional conflict and Curtiz and Harlan rack up the requisite amount of impressive atmospheric visuals. 810".

Hutton Jack Grinnage Dick Winslow Raymond Bailey Leon Tyler...Direcor Michael Curtiz...Screenplay Herbert Baker Based On The Novel By Harold Robbins By 1958 when this film was released there was not a single American unless they were Amish or lived in a cave who didn't know who Elvis Presley was. The popular singer's albums sold fast and his concerts and performances in Las Vegas and on TV drove dozens of young teenage girls crazy. He fancied himself an actor as well or he opted to make movies to cater to his fans. Back then if you wanted to see Elvis shake his waist and hips which you couldn't see on TV because of censorshipyou could see it if you went to see his movies. Director Michael Curtiz was a fine director with great films better than this one to his credit Santa Fe Trail 1940 The Sea Hawk 1940 and of course his masterpiece Casablanca 1942. The director of Casablanca was a noted Hollywood moviemaker and to engage Elvis in a film must have been awfully good for his career. In King Creole he plays Danny Fisher a New Orleans rebel the son of a welltodo and respectable politician or something like that who flunks out of high school and decides to sing in nightclubs instead. His father wants him to marry the wealthy and sweet Nel Dolores Hartand to change his life for the better. But in his nightclub Danny discovers a seedy world of corruption and danger. He encounters the beautiful seemingly comfortable but unhappy Ronnie Carolyn Jones the sweetheart of a powerful mob lord. He's drawn to her on an emotional and physical level but he's torn between both his own sweetheart and Ronnie. A young Walter Matthau plays mob lord Maxie Field with a degree of nastiness and abusive dominance fueled by alcoholism. There are songs but this is not a musical. The songs are featured in the appropriate scenes in which Danny sings in the nightclub. This was a style of movies that Elvis did at the time although he was also in musicals. But this is one film in which he attempted to act. For fans of Elvis he's wonderful in this role which suits him but I personally don't think he's much of an actor and he was the first celebrity to prove that singers should not transition into film acting. Later on singers like Madonna would do the same thing in the 80's and 90's and fail miserably. But this type of a film is a time capsule of the 50's and therefore has value. Elvis would do several films in color in the 60's as well but quit after he began to age visibly. Carolyn Jones is his leading lady in this film. Sadly she's not a wellknown actress. She is known only for her role as Morticia Addams in the memorable and much loved TV comedy series The Addams Family 19641966. Give this woman some credit. She was an outstanding actress with tons of films and TV series in her resume. Here she is subtle next to the more dramatic Elvis but she shows moments of angst in a very dramatic sort of soapoperaish way. She's really good. Her voice is especially essential in her acting and it helped that she was very beautiful. This is a lovely film with an emotional core and with lots of great singing especially the last song.".

	schema:headline " The Weaving Of The Web";
	schema:reviewBody "The Whole is greater than the sum of its parts the System will survive a couple of loose parts and weak links. Arpanet as the precursor to the Internet was designed to withstand localized damage. The Global Economy too has survived the terrorism by AlQaeda as well as by the Unabomber. Likewise this film as a film ABOUT the Internet and the Global Economy withstands the critiquing of its weaker attributes.The subject matter of this film is the Brave New World of technological utopia a MegaSystem of sorts. This story entails systematics globalization technological rationalization and the paranoid fantasies of this world's discontents. Human behaviour becomes a fabrication of control mechanisms and in such a world nothing is feared more than a total lack of control i.e. arbitrary terrorism such as that of The Unabomber. The ingenuity of this film on a purely intellectual level is the way it connects the dots between The Internet Esalen Institute New York Times M.I.T. Henry David Thoreau Montana and Ted Kaczynski. In a word this film weaves an intriguing Web about the Web.One shouldn't be put off by the problematic morals of this film. This film as a document is too important to be dismissed as sensationalism or misguided heroworship. For one Dammbeck puts Unabomber in a context where one is not made to agree with his radical and borderline insane ideas but instead is given a good sample of the institutional background of the professorturnedkiller forcing a transition from the merely personal and anecdotal into the realm of History and Causation. What we are asked is the relationship between fundamental mathematics and the paranoid fantasies of Gdel and Kaczynski? And what if there is a linkage between the CIAArmy behavioural experiments of the 1950's and 60's and the very real madness of Unabomber? What after all is said and done is the role of individual responsibility in a world governed by trends fluctuations computer technology and economic mergers? Lutz Dammbeck's documentary is a fascinating voyage into the dark underbelly of the American Dream to paraphrase Hunter S. Thompson. The film maker slices through a number of interweaving threads in search of something intangible yet real something to cut through the virtual. In fact the film may be accused of being somewhat incoherent in its production because the internal logic of the film follows too closely the subjective voyage of the director with mind maps and internal dialogues given precedence to the voice of the interviewees. That said subjectivity in documentary filmmaking can be a strength and the director takes full advantage of the opening up of new doorways into strange dark alleys of underreported American history. He is bounced around from door to door from person to person from topic to topic. The viewer is in for a roller coaster ride both dazzling and dizzying.The film maker exhibits clear signs of ignorance arrogance confusion banality and moral ambivalence  all in varying proportions. Still the end result manages to be inclusive yet not overeffuse and for the viewer the combinatory effect of topics and interviewees boils down to an altogether charming and fascinating experience. It is hard to say what lessons to learn from this film but one is at least given a glimpse of the full compass of Genius on the moral scale from the Humanitarian to the Criminally Insane. It is less than comfortable to find out that the difference between a Benefactory Visionary and an Evil Genius is a thin red line...".

	onyx:emotionText "The Whole is greater than the sum of its parts the System will survive a couple of loose parts and weak links. Arpanet as the precursor to the Internet was designed to withstand localized damage. The Global Economy too has survived the terrorism by AlQaeda as well as by the Unabomber. Likewise this film as a film ABOUT the Internet and the Global Economy withstands the critiquing of its weaker attributes.The subject matter of this film is the Brave New World of technological utopia a MegaSystem of sorts. This story entails systematics globalization technological rationalization and the paranoid fantasies of this world's discontents. Human behaviour becomes a fabrication of control mechanisms and in such a world nothing is feared more than a total lack of control i.e. arbitrary terrorism such as that of The Unabomber. The ingenuity of this film on a purely intellectual level is the way it connects the dots between The Internet Esalen Institute New York Times M.I.T. Henry David Thoreau Montana and Ted Kaczynski. In a word this film weaves an intriguing Web about the Web.One shouldn't be put off by the problematic morals of this film. This film as a document is too important to be dismissed as sensationalism or misguided heroworship. For one Dammbeck puts Unabomber in a context where one is not made to agree with his radical and borderline insane ideas but instead is given a good sample of the institutional background of the professorturnedkiller forcing a transition from the merely personal and anecdotal into the realm of History and Causation. What we are asked is the relationship between fundamental mathematics and the paranoid fantasies of Gdel and Kaczynski? And what if there is a linkage between the CIAArmy behavioural experiments of the 1950's and 60's and the very real madness of Unabomber? What after all is said and done is the role of individual responsibility in a world governed by trends fluctuations computer technology and economic mergers? Lutz Dammbeck's documentary is a fascinating voyage into the dark underbelly of the American Dream to paraphrase Hunter S. Thompson. The film maker slices through a number of interweaving threads in search of something intangible yet real something to cut through the virtual. In fact the film may be accused of being somewhat incoherent in its production because the internal logic of the film follows too closely the subjective voyage of the director with mind maps and internal dialogues given precedence to the voice of the interviewees. That said subjectivity in documentary filmmaking can be a strength and the director takes full advantage of the opening up of new doorways into strange dark alleys of underreported American history. He is bounced around from door to door from person to person from topic to topic. The viewer is in for a roller coaster ride both dazzling and dizzying.The film maker exhibits clear signs of ignorance arrogance confusion banality and moral ambivalence  all in varying proportions. Still the end result manages to be inclusive yet not overeffuse and for the viewer the combinatory effect of topics and interviewees boils down to an altogether charming and fascinating experience. It is hard to say what lessons to learn from this film but one is at least given a glimpse of the full compass of Genius on the moral scale from the Humanitarian to the Criminally Insane. It is less than comfortable to find out that the difference between a Benefactory Visionary and an Evil Genius is a thin red line...";

Kaczynski no matter what you think of him no matter what his victims think of him has a very very valid point. Philosophically his goal could only have been to deconstruct society make the links fluid then reconstruct it in another way. It is only sad that he thought he had the power to do so since the society the whole world works in a uniform way we are all with very few exceptions driven by instinct through mind to obtain wealth status partner family luxury security and this is intertwined in such a way that the common denominator is simply mo'better. More and better more of better better and more of it. This inevitably means that everyone will be inclined to actively and passively seek shortcuts most come by means of new inventions technology. This is the driving force behind technology and an individual or even a group of individuals cannot possibly challenge that. It strikes me a bit odd that one of Kaczynski's victims dismissed his theories simply because he is a murderer. The difference between him and a soldier who kills is that the soldier has a mandate from the state to do so. Both are widoworphan makers but only one was allowed by the state to do so. Is he therefore not a murderer simply because the state allowed him to kill?A historic fact is that former USSR and Nazi Germany were quite equal in ideology but the reason we don't hear that is because Russia has been too powerful to be challenged like that. Because of politics Russian holocaust of Ukrainians for instance was overlooked. It's the state that decides what you may do what you may know. You see things aren't always black or white and this movie is trying to show just that.If you're thinking about the world where we're going and just want your eyes to be able to perceive more watch this documentary.".

Linking it all together is the story of Kaczynski who's actions were some how connected to the people interviewed. As a look at the rise of the thing we call the internet the film is quite good and thought provoking weaving together a fabric of information that probably wasn't well known before.The problem with the film is that making Kaczynski a focal point the director often goes off the rails indeed almost all of the people interviewed abruptly end the interview when the unabomber is mentioned. This would be okay since what we get up to that point is often choice material however by the time the final credits roll we are not certain what the point of including Kaczynski was. Is he a hero or villain? Does he side with or against him? Is he really connected to all of the other subjects as the filmmakers seem to think he is? I don't think so. Certainly if he's siding towards anti technology there is the chance of being hypocritical since it clear how much of the film comes from computers the net and other sources of technology.I'm a bit flummoxed by the film. Certainly the film is thought provoking and eye opening but in the end it falls apart. Allowing for its final crash this is a film that I look forward to seeing again. It simply has too much material to tickle the gray cells to ignore. Worth a look for those who want to be made to think.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been the best part of a decade since I saw the original film version of this story but I still remember it being pretty enjoyable with a dark edge of comedy. From the opening seconds of the remake it is clear that the focus here is going to be on the action. JayZ's 99 Problems kicks things off while the camera swooshes and zooms round as all the main players move into position  within minutes subway car Pelham 123 has been taken and a race to save the hostages begins. The rest of the film is meant to be exciting and tense and we know this because the camera is constantly swooshing and throwing in slowmotion bits here and there to let us know that the stakes are high lives are on the line and that we should all be tense.Sadly while the cinematographer is keen to make sure we know this nobody else seems that bothered because the film does nothing to justify the sweeping camera movements and pumping soundtrack. In terms of physical money up there on the screen action there is very little and what there is just seems thrown in for the sake of having some action the car crashes trying to get the money in on time rather than being part of the film. This in itself is not a problem by any means because the nature of the plot did always suggest that the spark would be in the dialogue and the interplay between the two stars. Sadly this is lacking as well. It isn't bad though but it just lacks spark impact and tension. The problem is mainly with the script but director Scott doesn't seem to know what to do with it all anyway and seems desperate for characters to get shot or for things to crash into something just for the sake of having action. Travolta appears to be happy just to ham it up with a simplistic performance that matches the basic feel of the film. Washington had the harder job and suggests he could have done it with better material and direction  instead he is thrown into forced dialogue and unlikely semiaction sequences towards the end. The supporting cast is pretty good through with a handful of HBO faces in there Sopranos' Gandolfini Generation Kill's Kelly and The Wire's Akinnagbe. Gandolfini Guzman and Turturro all do the good work you would expect from them although again all are limited by the material.It is not an awful film so if you are looking for a glossy but basic thriller with stars and a big budget then this will just about be good enough to pass the time. The lack of spark and tension is the killer though and this the film cannot compensate for no matter how many time the camera swooshes around or the editor makes quick cuts  the failure is deeper than that and nobody appeared to be able to address it to make this film better than it was.".

Little did he know that he'd become the confidant and 'standin' hostage negotiator for a prickly criminal mastermind who takes over the Pelham subway train and demands money in exchange for the lives of its passengers. Hearing the names Washington Travolta and Scott creates a lot of anticipation but unfortunately what wants to be a slick combination of suspense thriller and character study instead results in a ponderous film with a weak setup predictable plot twists shallow characters and little tension. It's easy to watch with actors of Washington and Travolta's caliber at work but Scott's direction is pretentious and throws out some obligatory action scenes that seem to exist for the sole purpose of padding the time on the way to an expected climax. The leads do what they can with the strained material but really deserve better. ".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to the this most recent remake of Pelham 123 most don't even recall the madeforTV version filmed in Toronto  with good reason with an open mind. I was weened on Godey's book when 8 and saw the original film when it was released a few years later. I've committed practically every line and scene to memory. I'll admit.... I'm biased. I felt the original could not be successfully remade... the gritty feel the outstanding David Shire soundtrack the believable performances of the ensemble cast..... and I was right. I did not go into the theater hoping to hate the remake but instead to like it. I REALLY wanted to like it. I have always enjoyed both Denzel Washington and John Travolta in their various endeavors and thought the chemistry might work fine here. While entertaining it became almost tiresome after a while. I felt no tension no edge of the seat sensation that the original brought I found myself disliking most of the characters and really not caring what happened to them. It passed the time had some thrills but that was about it for me.The '09 version is entertaining with some excellent action scenes and more than a few decent dialog exchanges between characters but it is nothing more than a Tony Scott action movie dressed up as The Taking of Pelham 123. While starting off liking Washington's character now disgraced MTA administratorturned dispatcher Walter Garber as opposed to Detective Zachary Garber in the book and original screen incarnation I found as the movie progressed that he went from believable to just another twodimensional action movie hero who if he was what as he really started out as being would not have ended up doing what he did in the film. Sorry no spoilers here gang. You'll have to go judge for yourselves.Travolta was dynamic putting in a great performance but I found his manic characterization not befitting as the supposed mastermind of the criminal plot involved. Remarkably there were three other hijackers in the movie. I don't know why Scott even bothered including them. They were not only ineffectual characters with lackluster performances but totally lacked the dynamic presence and interplay between the hijackers of the original film so much so that you barely even noticed them  or cared. Oh well I guess it would not have been practical with only one hijacker....The dizzy camerawork and stylized production were tedious at times and distracting. The soundtrack was IMHO pure garbage.Like I said I found it entertaining but despite some opinions that the updated and freshened plot was exhilarating and an improvement on the '74 incarnation I honestly don't think the MatthauShawBalsam version need worry about being eclipsed by this remake. Go see it though as it is fun summer fare and if you have no ties to the original you'll probably find it relevant. Afterward do yourself a favor and rent the original. You'll see the way the story was meant to be done.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS! This film started out good but it soon became clear that the director Tony Scott and the source material had a bit of a falling out somewhere along the way.The story was obviously meant to be a sort of a lowkey thriller where most of the action takes place on a psychological level in the interaction between the hostage taker Travolta and a hapless train operator Washington who happened to be on the shift when the takeover took place. And at times it is exactly that. The scenes where Travolta forces a confession out of Washington and offers hostages in exchange for the mayor the Soprano guy were great. This is where the movie shines where it's the way it was meant to be.However Scott apparently thought this tensionfilled psychological mindgame would be too highbrow for the average consumer. So he decided he must do everything in his power to make the sucker more EXTREME you know the way modern kids like it. And how in the would would a prolific Hollywood director like Tony Scott make a bunch of tensionfilled conversations more exciting?You've guessed it. This is yet another modern movie suffering from the infamous shaky camera syndrome. If you enjoy your POV flying loopdeloops around the room shaky closeups of character faces and stopmotion intermezzos and all that during an average dialog scene you're in for a treat. A direction style normally reserved for action scenes was used to effectively detract the viewers' attention and source of their tension from the events inside the plot to the director outside it.Scott obviously knew this which is why he made sure the little action this movie has and NEEDS is as EXTREME as humanly possible. Thus a simple matter of transporting two bags from point A to point B is turned into an idiotic and completely needles car chase that destroys more property than there's money inside the bags. Then there are Travolta's nameless henchmen who are apparently there solely to die gruesome bloody and EXTREME deaths. And finally there's the main bad guy himself who isn't content to simply headshot his helpless victims but must empty his entire clip into their jerking bodies while droplets of blood and guts spray over the screaming hostages. EXTREME!Really if Tony Scott wanted to make an action movie why he didn't just order an action script? It's not like he's some rookie who must film whatever is given to him.Speaking of the script forced action is hardly the only thing wrong with it. Throughout the movie police snipers have hostagetakers in their sights and can end the crises in the moment they are ordered to shoot. But for some reason no one gives the order nor is anyone apparently in charge of giving it where is the police captain coordinating the hostage negotiations and SWAT shooters? What government would rather pay millions than try a rescue operation if there's even the slightest chance of success? And where's the FBI and SEALs taking over and icing Travolta in a minute?On the other hand why bother at all? Very soon the police finds out identities and faces of everyone involved in the heist. With traffic cameras on every street corner and other assets of the 21st century law enforcement the criminals are screwed whether they escape the train or not. Doesn't Travolta know that? After becoming a YouTube legend how long would it take someone to recognize his face and twitter him over to the police LOL ITS THE SBWAY DUDE !1!!?Considering all this you'd think the bad guys must have a really good reason for engaging in such a risky enterprise. And really throughout the movie Travolta makes it a point to portray his character as a desperate man living on the edge staking his life in an allornothing game against the might of the city that had let him down. Only later we learn his entire schemewithinthescheme depended on him investing 2 million from an earlier robbery so he could make hundred times as much on the market when... wait what!? He'd rather risk his life kill a bunch of innocent people and spend the rest of his life in hiding than retire with just two million!? That burning urge that drove him through his crazy scheme wasn't idealism or revenge or even the simple desire to get rich but the desire to get even RICHER!? He must be the craziest greediest most idiotic millionaire on Earth. And a douche bag to boot.These baffling inconsistencies in the plot make much more sense when we take in account this is a remake of a movie originally published in the early 70ies. Back then they didn't have the Internet cameras and Nazis in charge of airports. The bad guy actually had a chance of getting away with his ingenious plan. The least script rewriters could have done was give Travolta and his men masks or some other way of concealing their identities.On the other hand watching a pair of eyes talking into a radio for 90 minutes would have hardly made for an exciting film so I guess I can see why they decided to sacrifice believability for the sake of character interaction. Now if only Scott would slow down the camera enough so we could actually see that interaction...So was there anything good about this movie? Surprisingly Travolta's acting. All the Scientology stuff aside you can see why he was once considered an Aclass star. Great job. Washington was very good too you can really tell the panic taking a hold of his character when Travolta forces him to confess. As I mentioned earlier radio dialogs between the two of them were truly the highlight of this movie.Too bad the rest of it was sacrificed on the altar of blockbuster popcorn fun.".

Instead he thrives on being the center of attention rather than letting the story and characters unfold on screen. How he mangles the great catandmouse game of the original Taking of Pelham One Two Three is pure torture to watch.In the original Walter Matthau and the icy cold Robert Shaw were brilliant. Here Travolta is way overthetop with all his MF'ers. Denzel for all his greatness is simply miscast as the nice working class hero. In the original NYC shots were gritty and real ... here they are Tony Scott disco complete with flying cars. Since when does a car collision send one of the vehicles soaring and somersaulting? And why does a skilled motorcycle cop ram right into a parked vehicle? Just a ridiculous action sequence.Also in the original Martin Balsam Hector Elizondo and Earl Hindman Wilson from Home Improvement were Shaw's team and each had their own personality. Here Luis Guzman is given little to do and I couldn't pick the other two out of a lineup after just watching the film! John Tuturro and James Gandolfini are the only others with much to say. Gandolfini is a nice combo of Giuliani and Bloomberg and provides at least a touch of humor. The story is expanded from a pure heist film to a bit of distorted revenge by Travolta a disgraced Wall Street stud.Just not much good to say about this one since I don't believe it stands on its own and it certainly can't hold a candle to the original.".

Mix in an annoying jazzy score guitar riffs and some violin music a couple of overrated actors and you get TTOP123.First off did Denzel do a reverse DeNiro and gain 50 pounds for this role? He looked like fat Albert on a good day. Travolta also sporting an earring or two  what are these guys two metrosexuals wanting to do each other?  alternately drops fbombs between ridiculous soliloquies about his tortured past and while plugging a hostage or two just to break the boredom. OK he was reading bad lines but he did not make for a believable villain alternately scowling and laughing or otherwise mugging for the camera. Compare to the superb Robert Shaw who played the character with calm menace that was 10 times as scary.Plot holes? By the bushel. First off there's Denzel's wife in the middle of a tensionfilled crisis in which blood is being spattered left and right badgering her husband to bring home a gallon of milk. Could anything be more ridiculous? Maybe a producer promised the woman some more celluloid time on the casting couch but the role was entirely superfluous and the 10minute scene of the couple talking sweet nothings on a cellphone while bodies are dropping everywhere was one of the funniest I've ever seen.Then there's Travolta 300 million richer thanks to his manipulation of the stock and commodity markets worried about a paltry 2.5 million cut from the heist weighing around 55 pounds that he had to lug around at the end during his escape.No disguise easily identifiable Travolta and the rest of the gang blithely stride through midtown Manhattan carrying big heavy satchels of cash trying to hail cabs with thousands of people milling around and hundreds of cops. Travolta's character was about as stupid as you can get riding and then walking in broad daylight inviting easy capture. A more plausible ending would have had him stroll into the Waldorf get a room and disguise himself until he could try to get away later setting up a catandmouse finish.But there was no imagination no humor no intelligence nothing whatsoever to justify making this movie other than its sole purpose another big paycheck day for the two stars. Watching Gandolfini play mayor I couldn't help thinking that if he was Tony Soprano he would clip the entire cast crew director and production team and dump em all in the East River.Save your money and rent the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 from the minute I saw the trailer this looked like it was going to be such an exciting thriller. We have two great actors in the leads John Travolta and Dezel Washington. Where could you go wrong with that? So my boyfriend and I saw this movie a couple nights ago and had a great time. The movie was intense and provided very good action BUT there is a huge but the film just fell flat at the end. The first and second act are extremely entertaining and beyond intense two power house actors pulling in very decent performances had great chemistry and did a good job with the script they were given. But what the heck was with the ending? We shift into this Action 101 book of clichs list and was a complete let down. As a movie The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is certainly entertaining but when it comes to being realistic yeah it's pretty bad.Four heavily armed men led by a man who calls himself Ryder board a New York City subway 6 train then proceed to take control of the train. Meanwhile MTA dispatcher Walter Garber is assigned to the Rail Control Center due to an ongoing investigation that he took a bribe to recommend a Japanese car manufacturer for the next subway car contract. The group then uncouple the front car from the rest of the train and hold the passengers of that car hostage. Ryder and the hijackers settle down on the front car demanding 10 million dollars in ransom money to be paid within the next 60 minutes. For each minute past the deadline one passenger aboard his car will be killed. Garber and Ryder exchange conversations though the microphone Garber agrees to have the city pay Ryder the 10 million ransom. Lt. Camonetti enters RCC and Garber's boss who has a rocky relationship with Garber orders Garber to leave the premises. Camonetti takes over the hostage negotiations infuriating Ryder who demands that Garber be put back on the mic and that he will speak only to Garber. Beginning a very award friendship as the clock ticks down to get the money for the hostages.Over all I would recommend this for a matine show or just a rental it's nothing I would say to rush out and see. It's still a decent enough movie that I'm shocked John Travolta actually made a good choice in taking. He's a great villain when he wants to be and he proved that in FaceOff. Denzel also did a great job as this poor man who just coincidentally was having an average day and now all of a sudden has the added pressure of having lives depend on him. But like I said there are some major flaws that came with this film as well there were unnecessary moments like what was with the kid and his computer? It had nothing really to do with the story and wasn't that vital. The nice army black man that jumped in front of the gun to protect the kid the kid's mother talks to him before but turned out to be unnecessary. Still as silly as these flaws are it's still a fun movie to watch I'm glad I checked it out.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Taking of Pelham 123 was the movie that had it all. A great director in Tony Scott screenwriter in Brian Helgeland Man on Fire LA Confidential and leading men in Denzel Washington and John Travolta each doing what they do best. To its credit Washington and Travolta keep it afloat. This is the kind of movie both can do in their sleep and watching them go one on one with each other is the film's main bright spot. Were also in for a pretty exciting ride as Tony Scott swings his camera around New York city streets and underground subway tunnels. Though this remake of the 1974 film starring Walter Mathau and Robert Shaw proves to be a little less than the sum of its parts.Washington plays Walter Garber the chief detective for the MTA currently involved in some controversy over a bribe he may or may not have taken. While that's being worked out he's been reassigned to desk duty as dispatcher in the subway command center. Just today will be a day unlike any other as armed men hijack a New York City subway 6 train and hold all of its passengers hostage. The leader of the hijackers wishes to be called Ryder John Travolta and tells Walter that he wants 10 million dollars within an hour or he will start executing hostages. The cops led by John Turturro are brought in but Walter remains as the lead negotiator at Ryder's request.Short on actual plot I was expecting more of a character driven movie and early on it appears to go in that direction. There is a great scene where Ryder puts Walter on trial for the bribe and it leads you to think that these two are going to butt heads in dialoguedriven scenes all day long exposing each other for who they really are. Just the battle of wits ends there which is unfortunate cause the movie really crackles whenever they talk to each other. Travolta sporting a menacing goatee and tattoo is at his overthetop fbombdropping lunatic best and Washington is his levelheaded averageguy adversary.The rest is all action. Car crashes and shootouts take place the car crashes coming within a sloppy scene where the police travel by motorcade to deliver the money and the shootout starting from a rat crawling up a guy's leg of all things. Both feature no important characters and situations that are manipulated. The finale comes before you know it a chase through the streets of NY that's more exciting because it makes more sense. And Tony Scott despite using clichs like counting down the clock and going into slowmotion keeps the movie gritty and fastpaced. As for the rest of the cast James Gandolfini playing a New York Mayor is good comic relief getting jokes about Giuliani subways and the Yankees but Turturro and Luis Guzman playing a disgruntled MTA employee working with Ryder don't get much to do.Pelham works pretty well as a thriller because the Tony ScottDenzel Washington teaming this is their fourth goaround always seems to do so and adding Travolta always fun as a villain is another nice touch. Just it doesn't always leave you engaged in what's happening whether because the plot or the action lacks humanity. Still it's held together by good acting and solid direction and for that alone it's worth a ride.".

Ryder calls the subway control center and the operator Walter Garber Denzel Washington talks to him. The abductor demands ten million dollar and gives one hour to the delivery by the City Hall. The Mayor James Gandolfini accepts to pay the ransom while the NYPD negotiator Camonetti John Turturro assumes the negotiation. However Ryder demands that Garber who was demoted from an executive position due to the accusation of accepting kickback in the purchase business of Japanese trains continues to be his liaison with the authorities. Within the tense hour Ryder empathizes with Garber and asks him to bring the money to the train. The Taking of Pelham 123 could be a good movie with a story with potential and great cast. Unfortunately it is spoiled due to flaws combined with the usual exaggerations of most of Hollywood action movies. There are terrible moments that really destroy the story such as 1 why the corrupt Garber would confess the true story of his bribery?

	schema:headline " Washington offsets Travolta producing entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised to find this remake of the 1974 thriller was actually pretty good. I thought that because it was a remake by an explosionhappy director Tony Scott and starred ultraham John Travolta it couldn't possibly be all that interesting. Maybe a mild diversion but those are a dime a dozen during the summer. But hey big shock! It's actually pretty tense with just enough twistiness to fascinate without seeming implausible.Of course the biggest reason the movie succeeds is Denzel Washington. Washington plays a disgraced investigation pending transit executive who's currently slumming as the control chief. On his shift naturally a 123 train out of Pelham New York City suddenly stops in the middle of its run and a hijacker demands 10 million to be delivered in exactly one hour or passengers start dying unnaturally.What makes this a little more than your typical catandmouse game is the undercurrent of what's gotten Washington character into hot water as well as Travolta's character's actual motives. After all he's just grabbed a subway full of hostages but obviously he can't just ride the car to Cuba or something. He has to have an escape plan.Washington and Travolta play off each other very nicely with Washington's flawless portrayal of a flawed man far more convincing than Travolta's gardenvariety unhinged wacko. Essentially Washington was good enough to counterbalance Travolta's overacting. Is he crazy or is he just cleverly acting crazy? Who cares? Washington's Walter Garber is unsure of himself an actual Everyman thrust into a madman's master plan. It's roles like these that separate Washington from people like say Tom Cruise guys who can play really only one character the Man Who Knows Everything. Walter Garber not only isn't a seize the day kind of person he shies away from confrontations he knows he can't win.Also worth noting are John Turturro as a hostage negotiator displaced by Washington since Travolta won't talk to anyone else and James Gandolfini as Hizzoner finally playing a mayor who's not a complete nitwit. Gone is the whimsical naming convention from the first in which Robert Shaw named his comrades after colors which was swiped by Quentin Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs. There are some changes from the original true but they don't seem contrived for example Walter Matthau was a transit cop in the 1974 version not some underinvestigation suit.The action is tense throughout especially since you assume that the hijackers are going to have to murder someone at some point otherwise why have a deadline? Somehow the movie manages to be gripping and realistic without being over the top. There are some minor bouts of nonsense did we really need to know that Garber needed to bring home a gallon of milk? and maybe in the final 20 minutes or so it's a little by the numbers in its approach to action but overall it's not bad at all. It's certainly a lot better than I'd expect a John Travolta movie to be but maybe that's because he's the bad guy here and they're practically expected to be over the top.".

	schema:reviewBody "A surprisingly enjoyable and tense thriller. While it does have a good bit of the kind of silly excess that ruins most summer blockbuster movies anymore those flaws are overshadowed by the tightlywound script and a couple of good performances from Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Director Tony Scott seems to have spent a good bit of effort trying to channel the spirit of 1970's American movies and often this pays dividends as the focus on grittiness over spectacular action sequences ups the suspense. It's interesting that as the movie approaches the end you can feel the director's 21st century comicbook instincts straining against the genre he's working in as the story becomes increasingly less believable and more heroic. Nevertheless I can recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful action movie that doesn't beat you over the head with histrionics from beginning to end. Admittedly I've never seen the original and I can easily imagine those who love it might be substantially less enthusiastic about this remake.".

	schema:headline " Utterly Pointless Remake of a Classic Don't Bother With This";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to describe my contempt for this remake if you are not familiar with the original. First off the original had a much realer feel to it the stations control tower command center the car etc. You felt that you were really down there. This one was made in the subways too with the cooperation of the MTA but it felt so generic with its trick photography rap blasts etc. It was more like some lame MTV video than a movie at points. Where it fell far behind the original is in the character. This one is just a mind game duel between some generic Hollywood mastermind who also is a pointlessly violent movie psycho and Joe Niceguy in his space age command center. The original had a rich set of extras the tired cranky subway workers the hostages in the car the other hijackers as well as Detective Garber's partners. They all added some humor and color and made it feel that it was a reality based movie. Even the bad guy a ruthless mercenary was at least operating in reality not playing violent head games with his counterpart on the other end of a radio link.For instance Joe Niceguy GarberWashington is sent home by his superior after the NYPD hostage negotiation team moves in. So what does Psycho Bad Guy RyderTravolta do? He freaks out threatens then murders a hostage in cold blood in order to get Garber back on the mike. No one not Garber  the cops or his colleagues even says something like you psychotic bastard what did you shoot an innocent man for you scum? That was not one of your demands. Instead the pacify him and act like it was the city's fault the man was shot. The original had a subway management guys who insulted and refused to cooperate with the hijackers until prodded by Garber. One of them was even murdered in the original when he walked down to the captured subway car unarmed and alone and kept berating the hijackers. Then Bad Guy threatens to murder a teenager unless Good Guy admitted he took some bribe he was accused by the MTA of. Of course Good Guy fesses up saving the youth's life. But when you add that to the last scene of Bad Guy murdering the motorman over Good Guy's absence you have to wonder how someone so childish and impulsive could ever mastermind a sophisticated crime that took planning and others as well as his previous life as some master of the universe. It reminded me of one of those crazed vet with his gun in the room full of hostages for no particular reason sort of scenarios not a complex heist like this.Both of the leads had all sorts of background story fillers that the original did just fine without. Then there is the mayor. In the original he as played by a nobody but he and his coterie of advisers were funny as he struggled with a cold. When he asked if paying off the hijackers would get him any votes the reply was that he would get the hostages' votes. In this one Gandolfini as Mayor walked through the role providing not much more than a cameo. Both movies had a car accident scene when the police were running the money from the federal reserve bank to the subway station cross town at high speed through downtown. But this one had about 3 times the footage as well 3 times the wrecks for what purpose NASCAR fans?I could go on and on but this one just had two stars one hamming the other loafing with a bunch of trick editing and some extras to fill up space. It was technically a good film with good production values so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. The best think about this movie when compared to the original is to show us how bad things have slipped in Hollywood.".

	schema:headline " Pelham Offers Quite a Ride!";
	schema:reviewBody "The new Tony Scott movie gives one helluva ride but don't sit and analyze the plot for credibility during the closing credits this is not that kind of movie. Four sleazy thugs who could be spotted as bad guys by a blind man hijack a Lexington Avenue subway and take passengers as hostages. A ransomforhostages negotiation begins via radio between the driver's compartment on the train and the central control center for the New York City subway system. The premise is hardly new territory and for those who have seen the WalterMatthauRobertShaw version of the John Godey novel the film is even less original.However for audiences that want a night out at the movies with a rousing action flick The Taking of Pelham 123 will fill the bill nicely. The editing is often frenetic and the camera moves even during dialogheavy scenes. The chases are fast paced the car crashes are over the top and the bloody scenes are properly bloody. While all of this is enough for some mindless entertainment four excellent performances enhance the proceedings and make the film seem better than it is. John Travolta pulls out the stops as Ryder the head hijacker and in his full wacko persona steals his every scene. As the man on the other end of the phone bespectacled Denzel Washington dressed down in everyman frumpy is quiet and assured although nothing quite suggests that the character of Walter Garber will or could rise to his climactic actions. James Gandolfini plays the mayor with a sly sense of fun and John Turturro is a hardtogauge hostage negotiator. Pelham is a man's movie and the women are relegated to small peripheral roles as wives conductors and hostages. How refreshing the film might have been if Scott had cast a female in one of the four main roles.However whatever the movie's flaws and there are many The Taking of Pelham 123 does what it sets out to do entertain and engage the audience for two hours. Don't expect more and you won't be disappointed and in a summer movie Pelham's assets are exactly what most of us are looking for anyway.".

On top of these shallow post production and incamera effects the core of the original has been dumbed down with a profane and ranting script. The joy of the original ending has gone to be replaced by guns ranting salutes and machismo.Gone is the tension and excitement of the original. Gone is the subtlety of performance. Gone is the humour.

	schema:reviewBody "When placed sidebyside to the original 1974 classic slowburning thriller Tony Scott's remake looks like Danny Devito did in Twins inferior in every way. Where Joseph Sargent's direction was subtle Scott opts to shove everything down your throat where Peter Stone's screenplay from 25 years ago was clever Brian Helgeland tries too hard to make it hip and cool and where Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw proved an unlikely but memorable pairing as good guy  bad guy Washington and Travolta share next to no chemistry. So rather than sentencing this film to death by comparison which it does deserve mind you how does it go as a standalone picture? Tony Scott is essentially a glorified Michael Bay. Everything is done fast and loud regardless if the film calls for it or not. Where this has worked for Top Gun or Crimson Tide it fails here. Scott has infused so much needless action with rapid edits and whiplashing camera movements that it proves to be distracting. Even an innocuous conversation between the Mayor and an adviser has a circling camera catching the scene such is the constant motion Scott feels compelled to instil. It doesn't stop at the eyes though. Every chance possible our ears are assaulted with unnecessary sounds which are poorly matched to what we see on screen at one point a helicopter sounds like an F1 car. Occasionally a film calls for coarse language  some movies can even use excessive language to great effect Reservoir Dogs or Boondock Saints for example  however almost every time the Fbomb is dropped in Brian Helgeland's script and it happens a hell of a lot it is simply not required. 99 of the colourful language comes from Travolta's crim but instead of emphasising emotion it purely makes him look stupid. Couple this with plot holes galore and this screenplay from the Oscar winner who wrote L.A. Confidential and Mystic River leaves a lot to be desired.Thank goodness for Denzel. Incapable of delivering a bad performance Scott's goto man this is their fourth collaboration salvages this runofthemill action  thriller with his nuanced performance and sheer charisma. As Garber first name Walter as a nod to Matthau who played his 1974 counterpart Washington finds a nice balance between your every day worker and someone able to step up in this extreme situation. Travolta doesn't succeed as the foulmouthed psycho Ryder at all his goforbroke portrayal is laughable and ensures we can never take him seriously. Supporting players Gandolfini and Turturro are solid but don't have much to do.Don't waste your money seeing this on the big screen wait the six months and rent it on DVD. Better yet skip this and see the remarkable original Pelham instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Taking of Pelham 123 Denzel Washington plays Walter Garber a dispatcher in the New York City subway's control center. When Garber notices that the Pelham 123 train has stopped for seemingly no reason he radios the driver and discovers that the train and its passengers have been taken hostage. A team of criminals led by a man who identifies himself as Ryder John Travolta is demanding that the mayor James Gandolfini give them 10 million within one hour in exchange for the hostages. If there's a delay Ryder threatens to kill one hostage for each minute that the money's late.This film is a remake of the 1974 original starring Walter Matthau alongside Jerry Stiller and Hector Elizondo. The filmmakers took some liberties with the story which enhanced it. For instance Garber is no longer Lt. Garber a transit cop. Pelham is a bythenumbers heist flick the good guy will win but the fun is seeing how he'll do it. Because Garber is no longer a professional crime fighter an otherwise predictable although enjoyable premise becomes more suspenseful.Also the updated story portrays technology as both a blessing and a curse to good effect.Washington and Travolta deliver engaging performances. Playing a relatively lowkey almost geeky civil servant is an interesting change of pace for Washington. Travolta is terrifying as a disturbingly intelligent crook who oscillates between being sadistic and amiable. The conversations between Garber and Ryder touch on fate relationships and even contain moments of humor. Such lines in the mouths of less capable actors would have been tedious.A standout in the supporting cast is John Turturro as police negotiator Officer Camonetti who inserts himself into the hostage situation. Although playing a hardboiled cop Turturro handles the role delicately and prevents Camonetti from becoming a caricature.One slight disappointment is that Garber's wife Therese Aunjanue Ellis does not factor into the film that much. Her appearance in the film's trailer is half of her appearance in the film. One would think that there would be plenty of homerelated conflict considering that Garber's situation could result in professional if not fatal consequences. But then again the story plays out in a little more than an hour so the short shrift makes some logical sense Perhaps there wasn't enough time for panic to mount.This performancedriven I had to make a pun somewhere crime thriller is a mustsee for the summer.".

That's your plot folks with Denzel Washington as the demoted subway controller now running point in a desk job pending an investigation for corruption who finds himself on duty just as Travolta and his bunch of merry men put their plan into action.

There's the expected number of bloody killings along the way completely irrelevant carchases around New York where cars don't just crash they rise vertically in the air and roll over a dozen times on collision the police have no less than three separate accidents trying to race the ransom money across town to meet Travolta's deadline and of course an out of control train tearing over New York with a carload of innocent passengers who probably wish they'd taken the bus instead.It's all unbelievable nonsense as you'd expect. I'm fast tiring of Washingston's evernarrowing repertoire of decentbutflawed leading men Travolta is just awful as the loudmouth gangleader and Torturro irrelevant as the negotiator. Only James Gandolfini shines as the city mayor who divines Travolta's real plan wouldn't you know it before the cops do.The direction is garishly bad the dialogue excruciating especially the scenes between Washington and Travolta and Washington and his wife. There's no humour present at all although there are some unintentional laughs like when a rat runs up the trouser leg of a police sniper just as he's taking aim at Travolta causing him to miss.I've decided I really have to stop watching highoctane lowintelligence nonsense like this in future.

It was only after two minutes that I realised what I was watching wasn't the adverts but the opening sequence of THE TAKING PELHAM 123 . That's says all there is about this movie Do I have to repeat it ? It's important to remember that whilst the original only having two sets  the subway control room and the subway train the original film managed to carry itself by some smart dialogue and character interaction . This obviously isn't enough for director Tony Scott and the production crew who feel the need to bludgeon the audience to death with MTV style camera work  editing and score . It's as if the production team think if people are being held at gun point on a train that's not exciting enough for a cinema audience so feel the need to insert sequences regardless of it makes any sense or not It might have been a good idea to make the hostages in the train interesting . The original film succeeded on this score even if they were slightly offensive in their ethnic stereotypes but hey nothing is perfect but even that was preferable than a jarring cut of police cars zooming around the city with crash zoom lens  then to even this up we get a sequence in slow motion . The only people in this film who deserve any credit are the hairdressers who gave John Travolta the same hairstyle as me".

	schema:headline " The noise oh the noise!";
	schema:reviewBody "Is there a prerequisite somewhere in Tony Scott's contract that his films all have to be terribly terribly noisy for no particular reason? I suppose if there was one filmmaker who could take a delicious catandmouse thriller  that was made into a superb 1974 film starring Walter Matthau Robert Shaw Jerry Stiller and Martin Balsam  and turn it into a cacophonous mess it would be Tony Scott.Scott has replaced the wit nuance and subtlety in the original film with yelling bombast some pointless action and noise.After the screeching title credits I actually thought Scott's remake showed promise when it settled into telling the story of the hijacking of Pelham 123. I liked the initial interaction between Denzel Washington's Walter Garber  a tribute to Matthau perhaps?  and John Travolta's Ryder. There were the seeds being grown for a thrilling catandmouse game.But then Scott's needless wizardry comes to the forefront. The dazzling camera work the fast edits the obnoxious music that simply overpowers scenes.Honestly one cannot blame screenwriter Brian Helgeland for this. I am sure had Scott eschewed some of the technical razzmatazz for the story going for substance over style there might actually be an entertaining picture here.Then again Helgeland shares some blame for the story. Ryder is the only hijacker we get to know. The others including one played by Luis Guzman are completely forgettable. We only see them shooting guns or walking around the train carriage. They are cyphers and of little use to the plot. Watch this and then consider the 1974 original where we got to know the other hijackers  they had some depth they were fleshedout  because director Joseph Sargent actually cared about delving into his characters.In this remake Garber is a civil servant as opposed to a cop with a shady past. Washington is up to the task of playing this Everyman character. There's a nice calmness to him even though Helgeland has deprived Garber of any humor or spunk. Though in a van attempt to give Garber depth we have to sit through superfluous scenes involving Garber's wife.Then there's Travolta. Is it possible that Travola like Al Pacino is fastbecoming a caricature of himself? That was certainly the impression I got from watching this version of The Taking of Pelham 123. Travolta's performance is so overthetop that it simply is tough to take seriously. This is overacting of Battlefield Earth 2000 proportions.The trouble with Helgeland's screenplay is that it is riddled with giant plot holes. It really doesn't take a genius to figure out Ryder's background. But just in case we are too daft to get it we are given hints as subtle as thunderous gunshots. But if Ryder is supposed to be as smart a person as he is just consider his getaway plan. It borders on ridiculous. I can see why the other characters might want to abscond with the money but why on earth would Ryder given what we know about him? And given what we know about him why would he want anyone to know what he looks like?The action sequences are completely overblown. Some even don't make any sense. One involving a parked car and a cop is utterly pointless. Action scenes have to make sense there has to be a reason for them. It might look cool to blow things up and have vehicles crashing into each other but if they don't have any meaning they make no sense. That is the case in Scott's film.The Taking of Pelham 123 is the kind of film that gives Hollywood a bad name. Not that there are not styleoversubstance movies that aren't enjoyable. Take Hong Kong actioners such as So Close 2002 or The Killer 1989 for instance Despite their style they still succeeded in being movies that one could get engrossed in. They are thrillers that thrill.Scott uses slambang in a failed attempt to drum up thrills.

	onyx:emotionText "Is there a prerequisite somewhere in Tony Scott's contract that his films all have to be terribly terribly noisy for no particular reason? I suppose if there was one filmmaker who could take a delicious catandmouse thriller  that was made into a superb 1974 film starring Walter Matthau Robert Shaw Jerry Stiller and Martin Balsam  and turn it into a cacophonous mess it would be Tony Scott.Scott has replaced the wit nuance and subtlety in the original film with yelling bombast some pointless action and noise.After the screeching title credits I actually thought Scott's remake showed promise when it settled into telling the story of the hijacking of Pelham 123. I liked the initial interaction between Denzel Washington's Walter Garber  a tribute to Matthau perhaps?  and John Travolta's Ryder. There were the seeds being grown for a thrilling catandmouse game.But then Scott's needless wizardry comes to the forefront. The dazzling camera work the fast edits the obnoxious music that simply overpowers scenes.Honestly one cannot blame screenwriter Brian Helgeland for this. I am sure had Scott eschewed some of the technical razzmatazz for the story going for substance over style there might actually be an entertaining picture here.Then again Helgeland shares some blame for the story. Ryder is the only hijacker we get to know. The others including one played by Luis Guzman are completely forgettable. We only see them shooting guns or walking around the train carriage. They are cyphers and of little use to the plot. Watch this and then consider the 1974 original where we got to know the other hijackers  they had some depth they were fleshedout  because director Joseph Sargent actually cared about delving into his characters.In this remake Garber is a civil servant as opposed to a cop with a shady past. Washington is up to the task of playing this Everyman character. There's a nice calmness to him even though Helgeland has deprived Garber of any humor or spunk. Though in a van attempt to give Garber depth we have to sit through superfluous scenes involving Garber's wife.Then there's Travolta. Is it possible that Travola like Al Pacino is fastbecoming a caricature of himself? That was certainly the impression I got from watching this version of The Taking of Pelham 123. Travolta's performance is so overthetop that it simply is tough to take seriously. This is overacting of Battlefield Earth 2000 proportions.The trouble with Helgeland's screenplay is that it is riddled with giant plot holes. It really doesn't take a genius to figure out Ryder's background. But just in case we are too daft to get it we are given hints as subtle as thunderous gunshots. But if Ryder is supposed to be as smart a person as he is just consider his getaway plan. It borders on ridiculous. I can see why the other characters might want to abscond with the money but why on earth would Ryder given what we know about him? And given what we know about him why would he want anyone to know what he looks like?The action sequences are completely overblown. Some even don't make any sense. One involving a parked car and a cop is utterly pointless. Action scenes have to make sense there has to be a reason for them. It might look cool to blow things up and have vehicles crashing into each other but if they don't have any meaning they make no sense. That is the case in Scott's film.The Taking of Pelham 123 is the kind of film that gives Hollywood a bad name. Not that there are not styleoversubstance movies that aren't enjoyable. Take Hong Kong actioners such as So Close 2002 or The Killer 1989 for instance Despite their style they still succeeded in being movies that one could get engrossed in. They are thrillers that thrill.Scott uses slambang in a failed attempt to drum up thrills. He and Helgeland had a great chance to update the story and make a thoroughly exciting and captivating thriller with two strong intelligent men matching wits. Instead what we have is a boisterous needlessly noisy mindless action film that ignores an enticing premise because it is far more fascinated with car crashes than with nailbiting suspense.";

The way it was released here in the States as a PG film with some scenes edited out it's inoffensive enough. I've since gotten the DVD bootleg floating around here in New York and have seen the edited scenes. They really weren't necessary to make the film a good one so you're not missing anything if you're only seeing the version released here in the States.It was really nice to see less known actors in the roles. I'm personally sick and tired of the same little old crowd always getting parts in everything. It's a fantastic mixture when you can get an actor who is well known in Romania Marcel Iures but relatively unknown in the rest of the world and Kuno Becker again known in Latin America but unknown to everyone else and put them in a British film with a U.S. actor Alessandro Nivola along with British actors. Really clever nice ethnic mix and an unusual oneless predictable than the usual casting that goes on out therekinda opens the pool of actors that we're currently exposed to all the time.A lot of people are complaining about the football soccer aspects of the movie saying that it's not real etc. But I think they're failing to see that the movie is not about the sport itself although I think there's a fair amount of that in there as well as much as it is about the people who play it and some of the backstage politics that are linked with it. I thought these were shown tactfully and were just enough as they were coupled with the human factor the lives of the players their loves their hates competitive spirit etc.What was good about having a Latino as a protagonist in the film is that it shows the wider scope of fans football has. It is not only popular in Europe but in Latin America as well. The film could have easily gone down the eurocentric route of making the story about a European case but this made it a bit more unusual and interesting. Since Santiago was an illegal immigrant who obviously took the great risk to come to the States and didn't really have much going for him here as is the case for most illegal immigrants anyway and is becoming more and more true with the newer policies being undertaken here his risk of going to England to try his luck there is completely plausible to me. I have actually seen similar things tried by other Latinos going to Europe to see if their luck is better there than here for obtaining residence etc. Some people may feel that the portrayal of the Latino family was stereotypical but on the whole I thought it was positive with the characters being honest and working hard for a living rather than being common hoodlums as they are sadly put forth in many films. Santiago was shown to be a modest young man who is not too full of himself and a generally likable character.".

Having FIFA sanction this film means getting some realism injected and lending to the authenticity of is the English Premier League club Newcastle United together with a host of real life soccer superstars like Beckham Zidane and Raul.While the settings and the game results are real we follow the fictional story of an illegal Mexican immigrant to Los Angeles Santiago Munez street footballer extrodinaire. He gets his lucky break when an exNewcastle United player turned scout Glen Foy chances upon his games and invites him over to England for trials.For a guy who's struggling to make ends meet this presents the perfect opportunity to take a stab at his dream. But tension builds as his father disapproves and is skeptical at both the chance as well as his son's gift to make it big. So he leaves his real dad and family behind to follow in the footsteps of Foy his surrogate father in England.The highlight of the movie is not the real football games that the actors get seamlessly transplanted onto but rather the many trials and tribulations that Munez goes through to earn his rightful place in the squad. His disastrous first appearance almost made him take the first plane home and I'd bet many in the audience thought it would be a breeze actually for him to make it to first team. Thankfully the focus was on his sheer determination to overcome the lack of niceties towards newcomer rookies like himself and the difficulties and temptations which fill his 30 days trial that Foy literally begged for.What you read in the papers of the decadent lifestyle of footballers are all in here  the booze the parties the clubbing the women even video games taking a stab at David James maybe?. Munez gets introduced to these by fellow teammate and cocky new German acquisition Gavin Harris whose partying lifestyle takes a toll on his game and becomes the Toon Army's booboy. It's fantastic how these two characters contrast each other and help each other along the way.For nonfans of the beautiful game fear not you're not gonna be alienated in this movie as it doesn't sink into technicalities like the dreaded offside rule. You'll enjoy the movie simply because of the strong human drama weaved into the story as well as the familiarity of easily identifiable themes of hard work right ethics living your dreams and fulfilling your aspirations.Newcastle fans however will rejoice as the hallowed grounds of St James Park gets put on the silver screen. For fans without the opportunity of visiting their beloved club they can gawk at the dressing room the gym the dugout the pitch up close the city neighbourhood and mingle with fellow fanatical Geordies. Club captain Alan Shearer makes appearances too as do the many other first team players. But the screen version of the club manager looks uncannily modelled after Arsenal's Arsene Wenger. Fans of Fulham Chelsea and Liverpool can also see their heroes on screen as well.Santiago Munez is played by a relative newcomer Mexican actor Kuno Becker who was put on real soccer training to improve his skills and make him look credible and natural with the ball at his feet. At certain angles with his short crop he looks like Michael Owen who now is playing for Newcastle he wasn't when this movie was filmed.I so dig the soundtrack especially the guitar piece which opened the movie and track from the trailer which also made its way into the movie  Kasabian's Club Foot and various pieces by Britband Oasis. A pity it's only out in the stores on October 16 based on Amazon but I'll be there to pick it up when it hit the shelves.The ending even though it wrapped up all the pieces nicely is a bit abrupt but I guess it would lead directly into the planned sequels of a trilogy which involve Real Madrid and the World Cup. This is one movie which can spark someone's interest in soccer and I'd recommend it to both fans and nonfans alike. Don't let this movie dribble past you!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think we would all likely agree the rags to riches story has been done to death by Hollywood. But when someone comes along and gets it right the results can be truly excellent. Perhaps the best know of this genre is original Rocky movie. Goal  the dream begins gets it right even though it is loaded with all the clichs that generally accustom this kind of movie. Goal has the whole recipe here  the unknown with the heart of gold a unique and virtuosic talent from a downtrodden and hopeless setting the brooding and unsupportive parent who refuses to accept his child's potential the doting grandparent who can see the potential that lies within our hero the outsider who promises a way to fame and fortune and so on... But like the first few Rocky movies this one delivers without falling into the usual schmaltzy pitfalls.Kuno Becker is very well cast as promising young player Santiago Munez. He is earnest honest and gives off that glow of burning desire to be the best. My only knock is that he doesn't quite physically look the part at times. When they line him up with real professionals he looks a touch slight and skinny not quite boasting the musleclature of a professional athlete. The supporting cast works out well too. No real complaints to offer as everyone seems to be a very good fit. Alessandro Nivola's dialect could use a spot of work but no one outside of the UK will really pick up on this. I very much liked Marcel Irues as Newcastle United's Manager. He seemed to be a totally natural fit for the role and is a shoe in for the lead if someone ever decides to make the Aime Jacquet story.Where this movie really takes off is on the pitch whether its a park in LA the training ground in Newcastle or St. James Park the home of Newcastle United. The soccer scenes are exceptionally well done and look realistic. Real players feature prominently all over film both on and off the pitch and not just in walk on cameos ie Bend it like Beckham. The action is convincing the tackles are crunching and the goals are authentic and not the usual over the top spectacle anyone remember Pele's winner from Victory? Becker fits in well with the action scenes though it's odd how you never really see all of Becker on the ball and usually just the waist up kind of like they found some else to do all the little flicks and stepovers...And for all those who say it can't happen I beg to differ. This movie is not fantasy. In fact they could have made a biopic about a young Calgarian from Western Canada who somehow manages to make Bayern Munich works his way up through the reserves and in his premier season with the senior side wins the league and European Cup makes the England side for World Cup 2002 and returns again to be the best England player in World Cup 2006! Maybe someday someone out there will make the Owen Hargreaves story.All in all great stuff and I'm already looking forward to Goal 2  3.".

In fact they could have made a biopic about a young Calgarian from Western Canada who somehow manages to make Bayern Munich works his way up through the reserves and in his premier season with the senior side wins the league and European Cup makes the England side for World Cup 2002 and returns again to be the best England player in World Cup 2006! Maybe someday someone out there will make the Owen Hargreaves story.All in all great stuff and I'm already looking forward to Goal 2  3.";

There are many many films like this one and will doubtless be more something there is about the 'team spirit' in the identity crisis of whether or not the poor financially new guy will be able to make the physical grade that draws large audiences. It is a formula and it often works despite weak structure and production values.In the case of GOAL! THE DREAM BEGINS the viewer can put aside the doubts as to whether the film can make it on its own this little low profile movie is well written Mike Jefferies's story adapted for the screen by Adrian Butchart well directed by Danny Cannon who knows well how to integrate live sports scenes into the drama and consistently well acted by a troop of excellent actors beginning with the very vibrant handsome and charismatic Kuno Becker 'Lucia Lucia' 'Imagining Argentina' 'Once Upon a Wedding' 'English as a Second Language' a 28 year old Mexican actor with an assured future in the lead role of Santiago. The supporting roles are classy contributions by the gifted Alessandro Nivola 'The Sisters' 'Junebug' 'The Clearing' 'Laurel Canyon' 'Love's Labour's Lost' 'Mansfield Park' etc the very beautiful Anna Friel Stephen Dillane Marcel Iures Tony Plana Miriam Colon to mention only a few.The story is secondary as a child devotee of soccer Santiago immigrates illegally into the US with his family grows up in Los Angeles working as a gardener a dishwasher and other menial tasks while he consumes his spare time with developing his unique talents for soccer. Despite his father's insistence that he remain with the family business of gardening Santiago is discovered by a scout on vacation from England a bond develops and soon Santiago is off to Newcastle to pursue his dream of being a professional soccer player. The rest is pretty obvious  the ups and downs of an asthmatic kid competing in the wild world of sports. The star of the moment is Alessandro Nivola and despite the differences in their goals and social life they become friends who help each other in tender ways. There is of course a love interest telephone calls and encouragement form Santiago's grandmother adjustments to life in the UK all altering the road toward Santiago's eventually attained goal.The film is a bit lengthy two hours for the content but then we understand this is the first of a trilogy so get used to the story and the characters as they all remain constant for the next two installments. Whatever reservations you may have about sitting through another predictable sports movie just relax them Kuno Becker alone is worth the time invested in this very fine little film. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Until recently in history whenever the world of film and the world of football combined the results had often been negligible. With the GOAL! trilogy a new precedent has been set for not only the genre but also for the global sport itself in terms of its plausibility in film towards its millions of demanding fans worldwide.What this film does on the base level is to authentically present the game in high quality realism on the silver screen. However that alone does not lend the film its credo. What makes it stand as the definitive standard bearer for films of football given how every other sport especially American ones have managed to succeed filmwise Bull Durham Space Jam Mighty Ducks Remembering the Titans etc is that it carries many thematic layers on its back pushes the frontiers of the genre with depth in the storyline and finally aces in delivering a film that merges drama with sport hype and overall verisimilitude in all content elements.Obviously every critic knows that the methodology of such a delivery is that it requires realism and in cinematography especially exactly what the film provides and as a result gives it that definitive edge. Soccer films have never been entirely authentic due to factors as diverse as action mapping as well as dramatic scope. Furthermore fans of the sport knew that nothing in cinema could ever approximate the sheer unscriptable drama of the actual game. Until GOAL! came along. When FIFA commissioned and granted the rights for the film to Danny Cannon the air of realism was set in motion already because albeit being fictional it carries the authority of the universal game as fans know it because of its simulated parallels real clubs real superstars like Zidane Raul Shearer etc and realities of the game's actual hierarchies and bureaucracies have been surmised reserves leagues scouts agents and pressures.AG SalomonAdidas may have pumped advertising dollar into this film for placement of their teams Newcastle United Real Madrid and sponsored players for marketing but in a sense when the result is this authentic can you blame the corporations for input? In fact fans might even have to thank them for producing what can be the first high profile and quality football film on record. Just recall the maudlin world of football film until the recent revival of films of the genre which incidentally mirror the revolution of football and its branding that began in the 1990s and the likes of superstars like Beckham. In recent years this revival has seen film entries usher in on the commercial success of football from 1996's 'Fever Pitch' to 2002's Bend it like Beckham but never has a film about the game itself been done the way it has been done here in such centrality.In fact the very dearth of such films is an understatement and may well be the fuel for the GOAL! trilogy's impending success. Even football legend PELE alluded to the paucity of football films or at least those of the simple concept explaining structures of wealth class and the disparities of rich and poor in congruence with football. The plot by Butchart and Jeffries in this film stands out because of this  featuring the barrios of S.America the institution of organized football religion in England and a rag to riches drama where Becker's character combines innocence and disappointments with success and 'aspiracion' in true underdog fantasy. The script is far from genius but it has depth genuine troughs poverty death rejection and hurdles competition adaption and temptation the clubbing scenes were almost a revealingly accurate prcis given footballers' reputations in Europe. In fact perhaps the only inaccurate part was about how Becker signed without a work permit and contract given he had to have been playing in at least 70 of all matches with his International side. Nonetheless the film manages at the same time to convey the global scale of this billion dollar world obsession with the fantasy without compromising the sheer magnitude and challenges of it all. Throw in all the other elements ranging from romance with Anna Friel's pragmatic nurse character to the gamut of football archetypes Nivola as the playboy with conscience Iures as the stoic gaffer Dillane as the gentlemanly scout the mercenary agents an even a Sounesslike hardman on top of the fact that footage of actual matches in England has been seamlessly edited in and you can see why the film accounts for a thorough representation of the sport. Perhaps even most exciting of all the film shows behind the scenes footage of the teams and stars training grounds gyms dressing rooms city streets pubs Toon Geordies.How many people remember a football film that was done this way? More often than not football films have been towed by comedy or played side appendage to broader issues. From Thorold Dickinson's Arsenal Stadium Mystery 1939 about crime to biopics like Yesterday's Hero 1979 or Gregory's Girl 1981 about gender or even Eran Riklis's Cup Final 1991 about the PLO in war most films have broader issues. The rest survive on humour Mike Bassett 2001 being the typical example. GOAL! scores and sets the precedent for the genre from now on. In fact there has been a rush of football films since well accounted for at Cannes or the Berlinale festival and probably well into World Cup 2006.Films at Cannes included 'The Longest Penalty in the World' and Romeo and Juliet Get Married  a strained marriage between a Barcelona fan and a Real Madrid fan while Berlinale had 'Offside' an Iranian film. The market for soccer films has always been there its just a case of whether filmmakers could break the deadlock with quality and authenticity and GOAL! could well be the catalyst for the floodgates to open.By Stephen Thanabalan".

	schema:reviewBody "Goal! The Dream Begins 2005 Directed By Danny Cannon Starring Kuno Becker Alessandro Nivola Anna Friel Stephen Dillane Tony Plana Miriam Colon  Alfredo Rodriguez MPAA Rating PG for language sexual situations and some thematic material including partying I feel as though I have written this review before. Come to think of it I feel as though I have seen this movie before. Oh wait! I havea hundred times before. Goal! The Dream Begins fits so comfortably in the mold of its genre that one could almost imagine that it used the exact same outline as such films as Stick It Take the Lead Akeelah and the Bee Bring It On All or Nothing and so many more. I can see the thought process that the filmmakers used when coming up with this idea. Insert Name Here is a true underdog who wants to excel at inset sport andor competition here but insert potential problem here stands in his or her way. Can he or she overcome the obstacles and achieve insert award name or honor here. Movies like these have been saturating the market latelyyes even more so than PG13 remakes of horror classics. It seems as if every week we see another one of these types of films and I must say that it is getting redundant. It is easy to see why. The layout of these films has already been preset and all filmmakers must do is insert different characters and achievements for them to work towards. How many more movies can they make? I guess when they must resort to using winning a paddleball competition as the achievement they might just hold off for a while. But alas until then we will continue seeing these. The latest or one of the latest is Goal! The Dream Begins. Everything you need to know about this film is in the title. The Dream Begins sums it all up rather nicely if I do say so myself. As it does not say The Dream Ends we must assume that our main hero succeeds in doing whatever it is he desires to do and that this movie paves the way for a long and successful career for out said hero. Come on! You know you knew that already.The hero of this movie is Santiago Munez Becker an illegal immigrant from Mexico who dreams of playing soccer or football for our friends outside of the United States. But his father Hernan Plana has different plans. He wants Santiago to join the family business with him and help secure their family financially. But when Santiago gets the chance to try out for Newcastle United he jumps at the chance and using money his grandmother Colon gives him he secretly jets off to achieve his goal. However he soon realizes that becoming a professional soccer player is not as easy as it looks and that his father may have been right. As things begin to turn into a rollercoaster of highs and lows Santiago realizes that he must first believe in himself before anyone else will. Ah this is such a lovely plot. It's simple and though not brain surgery or anything it serves its purposewhich is to entertain and to inspire. Yes it is about as clichd and predictable as they come but it still kept me entertained. Do I sound as though I am contradicting myself? If so then you have just understood my point. Movies like Goal! The Dream Begins are entertaining movies for the most part and I certainly enjoy watching them but they are still clichd and ripped off of nearly every other movie that came earlier.The cast does an exceptional job. Kuno Becker gives a wonderful breakout performance and really holds his own which surprised me. He is just a very solid actor. Alessandro Nivola who starred in my favorite film of last year Junebug really showcases his versatility as an actor here. Who knew he has such a profound talent? Anna Friel serves as the love interest for Becker's character and though underused somewhat she too does exactly what is asked of her. The remainder of the cast does admirably. As I have said Goal! The Dream Begins is a paintbynumbers drama that really brings nothing new to the table. In fact you have seen all of this before. But like Take the Lead did earlier this year Goal! The Dream Begins manages to transcend its genre and while remaining predictable it is far better than it should be. Wellacted stylishlydirected and competentlywritten Goal! The Dream Begins is a movie that is so much more entertaining than its clichd concept suggests. Will you see every plot twist coming from a mile away? Yes. Will you know the ending even before the opening credits are over? You better believe it. But will you be completely entertained and fulfilled at the end? Most definitely.Final Thought Predictable and clichd Goal! The Dream Begins brings nothing new to its genrebut it is still a very good movie with lots of fun to be had.Overall Rating 710 B".

Can he or she overcome the obstacles and achieve insert award name or honor here. Movies like these have been saturating the market latelyyes even more so than PG13 remakes of horror classics. It seems as if every week we see another one of these types of films and I must say that it is getting redundant. It is easy to see why. The layout of these films has already been preset and all filmmakers must do is insert different characters and achievements for them to work towards. How many more movies can they make? I guess when they must resort to using winning a paddleball competition as the achievement they might just hold off for a while. But alas until then we will continue seeing these. The latest or one of the latest is Goal! The Dream Begins. Everything you need to know about this film is in the title. The Dream Begins sums it all up rather nicely if I do say so myself. As it does not say The Dream Ends we must assume that our main hero succeeds in doing whatever it is he desires to do and that this movie paves the way for a long and successful career for out said hero. Come on! You know you knew that already.The hero of this movie is Santiago Munez Becker an illegal immigrant from Mexico who dreams of playing soccer or football for our friends outside of the United States. But his father Hernan Plana has different plans. He wants Santiago to join the family business with him and help secure their family financially. But when Santiago gets the chance to try out for Newcastle United he jumps at the chance and using money his grandmother Colon gives him he secretly jets off to achieve his goal. However he soon realizes that becoming a professional soccer player is not as easy as it looks and that his father may have been right. As things begin to turn into a rollercoaster of highs and lows Santiago realizes that he must first believe in himself before anyone else will. Ah this is such a lovely plot. It's simple and though not brain surgery or anything it serves its purposewhich is to entertain and to inspire. Yes it is about as clichd and predictable as they come but it still kept me entertained. Do I sound as though I am contradicting myself? If so then you have just understood my point. Movies like Goal! The Dream Begins are entertaining movies for the most part and I certainly enjoy watching them but they are still clichd and ripped off of nearly every other movie that came earlier.The cast does an exceptional job. Kuno Becker gives a wonderful breakout performance and really holds his own which surprised me. He is just a very solid actor. Alessandro Nivola who starred in my favorite film of last year Junebug really showcases his versatility as an actor here. Who knew he has such a profound talent? Anna Friel serves as the love interest for Becker's character and though underused somewhat she too does exactly what is asked of her. The remainder of the cast does admirably. As I have said Goal! The Dream Begins is a paintbynumbers drama that really brings nothing new to the table. In fact you have seen all of this before. But like Take the Lead did earlier this year Goal! The Dream Begins manages to transcend its genre and while remaining predictable it is far better than it should be. Wellacted stylishlydirected and competentlywritten Goal! The Dream Begins is a movie that is so much more entertaining than its clichd concept suggests. Will you see every plot twist coming from a mile away? Yes. Will you know the ending even before the opening credits are over? You better believe it. But will you be completely entertained and fulfilled at the end? Most definitely.Final Thought Predictable and clichd Goal! The Dream Begins brings nothing new to its genrebut it is still a very good movie with lots of fun to be had.Overall Rating 710 B";

	schema:reviewBody "GOAL is a very good soccer film sort of a throwback to all the sports films of the 1940's50's. There were some unexpected surprises too. I never knew that Newcastle could look so good. I had only seen it depicted in the wonderful Auf Wiedersehen Pet TV series and then parts of it were being dismantled by the Auf Wiedersehen crew  including Christopher Fairbanks who has a smallish role in GOAL. Do I recommend GOAL for soccer fans? Most certainly and for fans of British movies too. There are one or two very minor things about the movie that leave me a bit puzzled though.How can Tony Plana the actor playing the hero's Mexican gardener father and illegal border crosser realistically play that role when he's got a mouth full of those artificially big bright Hollywood teeth? I just couldn't get past it  an illegal gardener without a green card but who's got thousands of dollars in dental work blazing across the screen! No selfrespecting actor should ever get involved with this absurd fad of capping whitening bleaching and brightening. It's fake fake fake. As good an actor as Plana is I'd have disqualified him from the role for that reason alone.My other comment is really a question. Who is playing the broadcast commentator in the film? The credits say it's someone named Rob Lee. However the voice seems to ring a bell for me yet I can't find anyone in football broadcasting named Rob Lee. Whoever it is he's doing a fine job and sounds very authentic.I really liked the film.".

So many times you think Santiago is going to screw up you think he's going to steal from the rich white people he works for you think he's going to backstab Glen and sign a deal with the bigtime Rep you think he's going to cheat on Roz with Gavin's girl when she approaches him... but he doesn't! He never makes a moral mistake and it's so refreshing. He's down in the dumps a lot but by being a good man and a persistent and diligent believer in his dreams he overcomes and it's just beautiful. If you haven't seen this movie go see it. You won't regret it!".

No kidding that's basically the plot of the whole thing. So yeah it's gonna be a bad soccer movie right? That's basically my thoughts before watching this movie.Boy am I ever kicking myself to this day for thinking that.This movie was a PROFOUNDLY amazing movie on every level. I wasn't expecting The Godfather and normally I'm not a fan of sports movies. But watching this movie I was so surprised at how much I liked it. It take a plot that would normally be considered simple and turns it into something complex and surprisingly really great. One would not expect a good movie at all watching it but they would be surprised as hell at how well done it is.Ever since his childhood days in Mexico Santiago Munez has had one dream playing soccer. One night his family sneaks across the border into California where he has two jobs one as a chef in a Chinese restaurant and one as a gardener for his dad. In his time off in the hot California sun he plays soccer with his mates. That's his passion. His dream is to be a major league soccer player for a soccer team. Putting aside his status as an illegal immigrant he saves his earnings so he can try out for a major soccer team.Then one day a man from England sees him playing Soccer. He is impressed at how well Munez plays. After the game he offers him the chance to go to England and try out for the team. His grandmother encourages him to ignore his nonbelieving father and just go offering him the money.While in the UK Munez learns that it's not easy being a bigname soccer player. And he learns it the hard way he has trouble playing in the rain he has trouble with his severe asthma and a death in the family causes some drama.This film is of course clichd and predictable LA is depicted with an orange tint England is depicted with a rainy cold washedout blue tint the stereotypical characters all come into effect at one point and the finale is predictable as ever. But the way the movie is done it's done in a way that you wouldn't care about that you'd just really be blown away by how amazingly well done it is. And I must say if this movie doesn't make you wanna go to England who knows what will.Do not miss this movie even if you don't like soccer. It is a great movie.".

It shows real football. The filmmaker knows football. The stars know football. The cameramen know football.This is independent filmmaking at its best. It has the main plot which is the struggle of an athlete to achieve his dream. It has side plots which involve his relationships with his father his new found girlfriend and his grandmother. His interactions with his brother and his teammates are great.

	schema:reviewBody "We had seen this documentary when it was first released. It was a treat to watch it again recently. It is a joy to see all these old opera singers and musicians living in retirement at the house that Giuseppe Verdi perhaps the world's best opera composer of all times created for them to spend their last years. Daniel Schmid the director gives an encore to some of the residents at Casa Verdi when he made this documentary as a loving tribute to those that gave so much and are now forgotten. It is sad to think that most of the people in the documentary made in 1984 might not be with us any longer.The film showcases Sara Scuderi a soprano who was one of the best during her prime. Like most of the other people living at Casa Verdi she shares some of her memories for us. Best of all is watching her listening to her own recording of Tosca an opera that she obviously identifies herself with. One can't help but wonder what goes through her mind at that time. Perhaps her appearances at La Scala or the Colon in Buenos Aires? It must be hard for someone to find herself in that position after years of being acclaimed and in the limelight.There are others like Leonida Bellon who sings in quite a strong voice arias from operas in which he appeared. His encounter with Sara Scuderi in one of the hallways where she as Tosca kills him who is supposed to be Scarpia just like in a performance and both stay in character. We are given a tour of the personal belongings by Giuseppe Mancchini who shows us his costumes he keeps well preserved at Casa Verdi. Giulietta Scimoniatto a leading soprano who is much younger that the rest of the people we meet shares some moments about the importance of maintaining this refuge for the older musicians.Giovanni Puligheddu a composer and the main conductor for all the singers in the residence gives us a tour also of his many trophies and diplomas and even gives a demonstration of one of his improvisations. For a man of his age it is an amazing feat for him or anyone else to be able to do what he does.Thanks to Daniel Schmid we are given a glance of some of the singers that were at their prime during the first half of the twentieth century. These opera performers and musicians are now waiting for their final curtain surrounded by the music they adored.".

Daniel Schmid takes us to Milan Italy circa 19831984 where he was allowed to film inside the Casa Verdi Verdi Retirement House a building that was actually designed and supervised by the grand 19th century Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi himself. The historic building with spacious rooms and a museum which contains busts of Verdi as well as old photographs is home to a number of retired opera singers from the 20th century. It's possible that now in 2006 many of these veteran opera singers are dead. But it's also very likely the Casa Verdi still continues to house retired opera singers. The soprano Sara Scuderi who sang with Beniamino Gigli a top tenor of the 20's and 30's was herself a big name but is now largely forgotten. She clearly loves the camera and spotlight on her and despite her age hams it up and steals the show with excerpts from Puccini's Tosca a role she had made her own. The interview with Scuderi reveals a great deal about the world of opera and the music scene from the preWorld War II and World War II Era. But the real star of the documentary is the more renowned Giuletta Simionato a mezzosoprano who enjoyed a brilliant career and sang opposite the world's most famous diva Maria Callas. Names in the opera biz are dropped excessively names like Enrico Caruso Mario Del Monaco Renata Tebaldi providing this documentary with a kind of educational quality. Phonographs that play opera records and old press photographs costumes and most importantly people who lived for opera in the difficult days of Nazi Europe and Fascist Italy are all part of this marvelous documentary. But with that said the documentary suffers from a length that is frankly too long and therefore boring. We feel ourselves getting older as we watch the these very old people in their 80's and 90's and their supremely slow movements especially when they walk down long corridors. Plus there is very little in the documentary that most opera fanatics don't already know. This is still a great documentary but you have to have the discipline intellect and musical appreciation to really enjoy it. It's a trip back to the 80's and to a world of singers and musicians whose glory days are far behind them and who remember them to escape the rapidly modern world who does not need them and to keep from being depressed. We are genuinely moved by their stories and this is what a truly great documentary should aim to do. Especially emotional are such scenes as when Sara Scuderi hears her old record of Tosca her favorite aria is Vissi D'Arte when she and the still very strong tenor Giuseppe Manachi sing duets or when he sings solo arias to the entire house singing Va Pensiero from Nabucco and the Brindisi from Traviata. This is one for the opera lover who is getting older and wiser in his or her appreciation for the art form.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love Der Fangschuss I think of the title in German rather than Coup de Grace because the movie is told in German  there's nothing French about it in style direction language or locale. I also have a very different interpretation of the movie and different sympathies toward the characters than the author of the other fine review  and probably different from the directorlead actress who are generally involved in movies with a quite leftist slant.The three Baltic countries Estonia Latvia Lithuania had all been occupied by and incorporated in Russia  and any nationalist movements were put down by the Czars  for at least a hundred years before the Russian Revolution in 1917. During this time wealthy German aristocrats were allowed by the Russian government to own and occupy great houses on agricultural estates Junker families. The vast estates had once operated somewhat like southern plantations in the U.S. but like those plantations were transformed by the liberation of the serfs in the 1860s. Thus for over half a century by the time our movie begins the great farms had been operated like any other enterprise  with the vast numbers of agricultural workers free to stay or go. With the Revolution and Russia's consequent withdrawal from World War I there was of course chaos throughout Russia  including a civil war that lasted until 1921. During this time the Bolsheviks the radical Communists sought to ensure that the Baltic countries remained subjugated  now as part of a now Soviet Union  and the nationalist Lithuanians Latvians and Estonians sought to use the chaos in Russia to break away and resume the independence that was once theirs. During this conflict the German Junker families sided with the nationalists who also wished to install democracy rather than the Bolsheviks.Thus even as the aristocratic Germans returned to their homes from the most horrifying war that had ever existed they were involuntarily forced into a new war for their very homes by the besieging Bolsheviks who sought to maintain the status quo absorption of the Baltic countries in a tyrannical Russia. The German aristocrats made common cause with the Baltic democrats to defend the homes in which they and their families had lived for generations.This movie concerns two such German officers  both of whom grew up in this area of Latvia  and have been friends since they were children. They have grown particularly close in four years of fighting on the western front in W.W.I. Now they are returning home  as they arrive at night they see artillery shells from Bolshevik mortar bursting over homes. One of the officers is Konrad whose home remains and whose aunt and sister live there. His best friend who has traveled with him for over a thousand miles from the western front is Erich a courageous and heroic figure who knows his home was already seized. Erich is a handsome romantic melancholy artistic and thoughtful figure a veritable Siegfried who describes his willingness to fight for Konrad's home  rather than live comfortably in Paris or Germany as part of his romantic addiction to lost causes. The defenders of Konrad's home consist not only of the servants of the estate but of native Latvian and Lithuanian soldiers from the area as well as some Russian White officers opposed to the Bolsheviks  some of whom want the return of the Czar and some of whom want the return of Kerensky the democratic leader who began the Revolution that toppled the Czar but fell six months later in the October Bolshevik Revolution.Konrad's sister Sophie is a lonely romantic who is also an immature and trendy political dilettante who believes it romantic to flirt with the local Bolsheviks whose forces attack her home each night. Thus she has formed a relationship with a dreary Bolshevik tailor in the town. This must all be kept secret from the dozens of soldiers who occupy her home to defend her and her aunt. However when Erich arrives with her brother she forms a mad attachment and throws herself at the dutiful Erich who is attempting to save all their lives by directing the defense of the house against the siege. I won't reveal any more of the plot  or the increasing madness and promiscuity of the sister. The movie reveals the trendiness of the sister as leftist political dilettante  who may display personal courage but brings disaster to all she touches  as well as the difficult path of a romantic conservative figure who follows duty to friend and duty to oppose  barbarism  even when it means personal sacrifice and difficult choices. History shows that the Bolsheviks were defeated and independence gained by the combination of the Baltic peoples the Finnish General Mannerheim who saw the threat to Finland from the neighboring Bolsheviks  who would attack again in 1939 and the German aristocrats. As a result the Treaty of Versailles recognized the independence of Latvia Lithuania and Estonia  independent sovereign and democratic countries until overrun in 193940 by the Soviet Union pursuant to the NaziSoviet Pact. They regained their independence in 198991 and are about to join the European Union.Without the difficult and successful fight for independence these countries would not have had the recent memory of independence to console them during the subsequent half century's suppression of liberties  and would perhaps not have struggled so greatly to regain their liberty.The movie is however primarily a character study  shot in black and white  sometimes a little difficult to follow due to the rapidity with which they identify characters  but well worth it. It is fascinating.".

The defenders of Konrad's home consist not only of the servants of the estate but of native Latvian and Lithuanian soldiers from the area as well as some Russian White officers opposed to the Bolsheviks  some of whom want the return of the Czar and some of whom want the return of Kerensky the democratic leader who began the Revolution that toppled the Czar but fell six months later in the October Bolshevik Revolution.Konrad's sister Sophie is a lonely romantic who is also an immature and trendy political dilettante who believes it romantic to flirt with the local Bolsheviks whose forces attack her home each night. Thus she has formed a relationship with a dreary Bolshevik tailor in the town. This must all be kept secret from the dozens of soldiers who occupy her home to defend her and her aunt. However when Erich arrives with her brother she forms a mad attachment and throws herself at the dutiful Erich who is attempting to save all their lives by directing the defense of the house against the siege. I won't reveal any more of the plot  or the increasing madness and promiscuity of the sister. The movie reveals the trendiness of the sister as leftist political dilettante  who may display personal courage but brings disaster to all she touches  as well as the difficult path of a romantic conservative figure who follows duty to friend and duty to oppose  barbarism  even when it means personal sacrifice and difficult choices. History shows that the Bolsheviks were defeated and independence gained by the combination of the Baltic peoples the Finnish General Mannerheim who saw the threat to Finland from the neighboring Bolsheviks  who would attack again in 1939 and the German aristocrats. As a result the Treaty of Versailles recognized the independence of Latvia Lithuania and Estonia  independent sovereign and democratic countries until overrun in 193940 by the Soviet Union pursuant to the NaziSoviet Pact. They regained their independence in 198991 and are about to join the European Union.Without the difficult and successful fight for independence these countries would not have had the recent memory of independence to console them during the subsequent half century's suppression of liberties  and would perhaps not have struggled so greatly to regain their liberty.The movie is however primarily a character study  shot in black and white  sometimes a little difficult to follow due to the rapidity with which they identify characters  but well worth it. It is fascinating.";

Konrad and his volunteer corps have withdrawn from Reval to his parents' castle in Kratovice determined to defend the outdated feudal system. Konrad's sister Sophie maintains friendly relations with the rebels especially Gregori Loew the son of the Jewish village tailor. Although she shares his views she lacks the strength to tear herself out of her surroundings. She falls more and more deeply in love with Konrad's friend Erich von Lhomond a dashing gentleman rider who likes to fight a losing battle because he would only be an insignificant figure in ordinary life. He is not particularly interested in women and is attracted much more strongly to Konrad than to Sophie. He brutally rejects her love but responds more and more jealously as she throws herself headlong into various affairs with his comrades in the corps. Things come to a head at Christmas when Sophie kisses young Volkmar von Plessen who wants to marry her Erich slaps her in front of her aunt and the other officers. She only admits to her love once more. Erich orders her to wait until he returns from a foray against the Bolsheviks. However Sophie has in the meantime learned the truth about Erich von Lhomond and her brother. She sharply demands an answer from her beloved and then leaves the castle to join Gregori Loew and his band of rebels. The situation in the Baltic has become hopeless for Lhomond and his fighters. Konrad has been killed in one of the last battles and the remainder of his troop decides to head for Germany. Sophie and her comrades are captured by Erich in a battle for a farm during which Gregori Loew is killed. The other rebels are shot at Lhomond's command. Sophie demands that Erich execute her himself.Volker Schlndorff had first come across Marguerite Yourcenar's novel Der Fangschuss in 1965 while working on his film TRLESS. Even then he had been attracted by the idea of making a film based on the novel by an author who had become famous for her historical novels and was the only woman in the Acadmie Franaise. FANGSCHUSS follows on from TRLESS in both form and content both films displaying the same respect and caution towards the literary original both are produced in blackandwhite and both are basically about suppressed sexuality and reactionary behaviour with the aim of revealing sadomasochistic relations and fascist tendencies. Volker Schlndorff has by no means left the political arena to concentrate on a historical subject or purely human problem in this film which was produced one year after the sensational success of DIE VERLORENE EHRE DER KATHARINA BLUM the problematical relationship between men and women Volker Schlndorff portrayed by the film in the form of a highly dramatic affair is closely related to the social and historical background of a struggle between supporters of the old order and the supporters of new social ideas. Sophie is not only driven to join the rebels by Erich's emotional coldness and the humiliating realization that he used her to come closer to her brother but also by her revulsion of war and the male solidarity among the officers as well as by the realization that they need the war in order to live out their lives and satisfy their secret cravings. Schlndorff clearly contrasts the scenes showing the private relations and strains between the protagonists with scenes showing the fight against the rebels and the shooting of prisoners. The leading actors and particularly Margarethe von Trotta have prevented the film from fulfilling its intention of telling the story of an act of humiliation ending in revolt Schlndorff. Margarethe von Trotta's Sophie remains a shadowy figure capable of expressing her anger and defiance at Erich's cool remoteness but she fails to display the emancipation of a woman who sees through the men's military madness and rebels against it. Sophie's revolt is emotional not political. However the subject of Sophie's desire the handsome Erich is also a somewhat pale figure and the erotic triangle between Erich Konrad and Sophie is created in the viewer's imagination rather than in the reality of the film. Schlndorff's film thus lacks the dramatic core intended by the director but he compensates this shortcoming with dense atmospheric images of the barren snowscape and the castle's rundown interiors. With their blackandwhite shading and their grey tones reminiscent of the films produced by JeanPierre Melville Schlndorff's first mentor to whom this film is dedicated these images evoke a decaying dying world in which real open relations between people have become impossible. Despite the weakpoints in the screenplay and in the handling of the actors this gives DER FANGSCHUSS a dramatic presence making the historical situation transparent to the present on at least an emotional level if not on an intellectual plane.   It is a powerful film... full of noise and furor...".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Fangschu or Coup de grce is a FrenchGerman coproduction from 1976 so this predominantly Germanlanguage film has its 40th anniversary this year. The director of these almost 100 minutes is Volker Schlndorff and it is an adaptation of a novel by Marguerite Yourcenar. One of the writers was Schlndorff's wife Margarethe von Trotta who also plays the female main character. It is one of von Trotta's last works before the camera before she dedicated her career entirely to filmmaking herself. This is a blackandwhite movie which really was not too common anymore for the 1970s. It is basically the story of two characters only the male main character an army officer played by the young Matthias Habich and the female main character the woman falling in love with him played by von Trotta. The military background in terms of profession of the male protagonist plays a major role too as it basically sets the setting for the film.That's really all that needs to be said about it I guess. The supporting characters including Carrire with whom Schlndorff worked a lot aren't that interesting I must say and it is all about the duo of protagonists. Sadly they are both really unlike able which makes it difficult to get emotionally involved with the film as I myself simply did not care for them at all and I never really wanted them happy especially Habich's character. In one scene says she would be the last woman on Earth he wants to be with. In the next scene he acts as if he truly loves her. He is a coldblooded killer and has really no likable features at all. Of course it is viable to take the approach to depict a realistic idea and make the audience wonder why she would fall for him but I guess it was that she is easily impressed by power and violence and always wants what she cannot have until she maybe can even have it. Not exactly positive character traits either and I am as unimpressed by von Trotta as an actress as I am by her as a filmmaker judging from what I have seen so far.The overall outcome is that this is a very underwhelming watch. I never thought of Schlndorff despite him having an Oscar unlike the others be on par with the great German filmmakers of the 1970s Herzog Fassbinder Wenders and this film just solidifies my opinion and perception that he is inferior. Maybe I am also a bit biased as the war depicted in this movie and political climate and time 19th century were never historical aspects I had interest in. Then again you could also say that this film could have sparkled my interest if it had been good but it did no such thing. Finally I don't recommend the watch and it's really underwhelming even for a Schlndorff film. Watch something else instead.".

	onyx:emotionText "Der Fangschu or Coup de grce is a FrenchGerman coproduction from 1976 so this predominantly Germanlanguage film has its 40th anniversary this year. The director of these almost 100 minutes is Volker Schlndorff and it is an adaptation of a novel by Marguerite Yourcenar. One of the writers was Schlndorff's wife Margarethe von Trotta who also plays the female main character. It is one of von Trotta's last works before the camera before she dedicated her career entirely to filmmaking herself. This is a blackandwhite movie which really was not too common anymore for the 1970s. It is basically the story of two characters only the male main character an army officer played by the young Matthias Habich and the female main character the woman falling in love with him played by von Trotta.

	schema:reviewBody "Coup de grce refers of course a finality. Often it means a bullet to the head or something similar to make certain the subject is dead. The original title is Der Fangschu.In this German and French language film covering the period just after World War One and filmed in a dull black and white that evokes the drab colorless and perhaps hopeless world for many in the war's aftermath. Set in ravaged Latvia where the Czar had previously allowed a number of aristocratic wealthy Germans to continue to own estates with sumptuous homes. Among these Countess Sophie de Reval has allowed herself to become attached to the promise of Communism. Despite the German Empire's collapse German troops nevertheless have been stationed in the region ostensibly to protect the German citizens from Bolshevism. Since this was formerly a part of Mother Russia many locals want to see the return of Czarist Russia of the past while some hope for a republic and others only wanting an end to all the strife and horror of war. They only desire a peaceful home for themselves and their children. One of the German officers who has returned to his former homeland happens to be a gentleman the countess has known since childhood. Once they meet her former passion reignites and when he rebuffs her advances she begins to throw herself at him. Finally unable to achieve fulfillment with the officer the countess releases her sexual desires with others making this a film destined more for adults despite the fact that there are really no outright graphic sexual scenes. As mentioned earlier the drab hopelessness of the period is only accentuated by the lowkey black and white film production. This is not an actionpacked suspense film but rather a study in human values and emotions during times of trial. One comment is that the subtitles in English are not well incorporated into the film and many will find them difficult to follow especially considering that the film does have a number of abrupt changes of scene. For all that this is a film many will not quickly forget.".

Kiefer after working nonstop for years is finally getting long overdue recognition for his excellent work in FOX TV's 24 and Anthony LaPaglia has been a fave since I saw him in the much underseen 29th Street.  These two stars have great onscreen chemistry and it makes for a fun movie to watch.  Kiefer plays a cop who is forced to retire after a heart attack and isn't happy about being sidelined at age 35. Anthony plays his on the other side of the law hyper halfbrother who drags him kicking into buying a racehorse.  They get involved with mob guys and there are some very dark moments due to the danger suddenly brought to their lives but that horse brings Kiefer back to life and he and his brother will do anything to keep it.  I think you'll like this flick.".

Sutherland and LaPaglia work wonderfully together and create a very black and white duo on screen.

Turning to drink and contemplating suicide he is offered distraction by his step brother Ray LaMarr who tries to bring him in on a deal to buy a race horse.  The horse is slow but Ray realises that minor surgery will free him up.  They go through with the deal and bring Tony LaRoche on board as the jockey. However LaRoche owes money to the mob so the mob take the horse.  Stealing the horse back Ray makes a deal to pay off the debt within a month or to give up the horse.I watched this film because I do like Kiefer Sutherland and have grown keener on him now that I am watching him weekly on 24.  I had reasonable hopes for this because it did start quite well and was quite stylish in the opening 10 minutes.  However after this point the darkness opens up and it appears to be an uneasy mix of comedy and drama neither of which really work.  The plot is very plodding and very little actually happens in the film  certainly there is no real tension for the most part.Events happen which are almost without consequence for example one of the mob goes missing but nothing is really mentioned of it again in the film and things just seem to meander until an ending that is far too neat for it's own good.  In fact the final scene of the film is silly and abrupt  like the film didn't so much end as well stop.  It is mildly interesting but this has nothing to do with the plot.What made it watchable was the chemistry between Sutherland and LaPaglia although neither gave a particularly good performance.  They came across well together and made for an pairing that I'd like to see again in a much better film.  Sutherland is a little hampered as he doesn't know how to play his character  at times he is comic others he is dark others he is free and light.  There is no consistence and it seems to be whatever the tone of the scene requires  certainly his stress in one scene quickly vanishes for a more comic scene following.  LaPaglia is a poor character here his furgettabot it' acting is clichd and tired and wastes his talents. Bluteau is really really poor  his accent is way off somewhere and his character is as thin as paper.  The support cast are OK but have little to do  but even with a dream support cast I doubt this film could have been lifted above the material.The direction etc is pretty standard.  After some style early on the film falls away and uses too much rock music etc and lots of clever' shots that are just pointless  more time should have been spend on the story and delivering characters and drama.  Overall I had reasonable hopes but these were dashed early on.  It delivers so very little that it is almost a nonfilm.  Ask me about it in and year and I'm sure I'll have no memory of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Sister a boy helps he and his sister survive by stealing from rich folks at a posh ski resort in the Swiss Alps. But the boy and his sister are both a bit more than each seems in this provocative psychological daring thriller from Ursula Meier.Young Simon Kacey Mottet Klein has procured a season pass to a winter ski lodge. Each day he rides up the giant lifts to the top of the mountain where he swipes skis poles boots gloves and other paraphernalia selling them to the lessfortunate in the town below. He does this to support he and his sister Louise Lea Seydoux an unfocused somewhatselfish wanderer who appears too have little concern for the well being of herself or for Simon flitting from job to job and from lover to lover like a forlorn mosquito. So it's entirely up to Simon to keep them afloat and he's a quick learner. Even at age 12 he can cook and clean and knows ski equipment better than even expert skiers even though he is no skier himself. He's an entrepreneur albeit in a dangerous career.He sells to workers. He sells to kids. He takes advance orders and knows how much to charge. He's not intimidated by anyone. He is at his tender age a master thief knowing where to stow his illgotten gains and how best to get them back down the mountain. One can argue that he does what he has to do since his youth prevents him from getting an authentic job and the adult in the family is wildly undependable. He takes on an apprentice at one point goes into cahoots with another at a different juncture. But a few of his schemes do not end favorably for him. Simon is friendless utterly alone. But his relationship with Louise is quite complicated. There are tender touches. Inappropriate remarks. Lingering glances. Is this simply typical preteen behavior or something more? With no other friends  and apparently no school to serve as a social function  Louise is about the only female with whom he interacts on a regular basis.He meets a visiting family  mom two boys  at the resort. Mom is kind and buys Simon breakfast even though he is loaded with cash. They bond a little she seeing perhaps a lost soul whose story of no parents or siblings isn't ringing true he seeing a mother figure he desperately desires.The twist in the movie makes its appearance just about halfway through. It's surprising that it arrives so early and when it does it passes two crucial tests it is both out of the blue and completely plausible. The perfect twist. Obviously the twist coming so early in the film means that the movie's real enticement comes in this major revelation  well a revelation to the audience not to the characters. At first we're not sure who is telling the truth are we being snookered? When we discover the answer to that question the relationship between Louise and Simon takes on a whole new dimension.Both Klein and Seydoux playing characters who are almost aggressively opposite from one another are phenomenal. Simon longs for a better life even as he excels in his current role. Louise a tragic heroine is mentally scarred unsure unhappy and besieged by doubt. She seems of no use to him and yet he pushes hard to make a life for them both.The ending is one of those that will leave half of the audience wondering if a reel was left off by mistake and the other half nodding appreciatively. It is not a neat ending it is awash with symbolism of the direction each lead's life is headed. And set against the majestic beauty of the mountains it is a strong stark and beautiful finale.".

	schema:reviewBody "For scrawny 12yearold Simon Kacey Mottet Klein life is up and down. Going up however does not mean moving up the ladder of success but only riding a cable car to do his work at the top of a mountain ski resort a playground for wealthy tourists. Ursula Meier's heartbreaking Sister Switzerland's submission for Best Foreign Film at this year's Oscars is built around the continual movement of the cable car moving up to the white wonderland of the glittering slopes and down to the crumbling housing projects that look out on a desolate and muddy industrial plain. Like the marginalized poor in America Simon is an unnoticed presence.He is a crafty entrepreneur whose work consists of stealing skis gloves goggles sneaking in and out of locker rooms emptying coat pockets and grabbing sandwiches and anything else he can from knapsacks to bring home to his older sister Louise Lea Seydoux a lay about in her early twenties who cannot hold a steady job and goes from one boyfriend to another. For Simon a sled is not a fun ride in the snow but a means to stay alive a tool to strap stolen skis and drag them down below to restore and repair so he can sell them to the highest bidder. Simon of course rationalizes his actions by saying They don't miss them. They just go and buy new ones. Supported by a solid script by the director and Antoine Jacquod and the striking cinematography of Agns Godard Beau Travail The Dreamlife of Angels Sister takes place during the ski season from Christmas to Easter as the camera peeks behind the glamour. When Simon is caught in the act of stealing by seasonal worker Mike Martin Compston a friendly Scot Mike automatically assumes that he's stealing to buy more hitech gadgets. Taken aback when he learns that the boy is stealing to buy food toilet paper and other necessities to keep him and his sister alive he joins with him in his questionable activities.The early sequences have a bounce and energy that makes it feel as if the film may be moving in a comic direction but comic it is not. This becomes very apparent in the film's second half when another somewhat strained dimension is added to our knowledge of Simon's lovehate bond with his sister and we watch helplessly as their interaction changes from playful to a no holds barred display of anger and frustration. While some may see Simon as a criminal in training Klein makes him lovable enough for us to view him as a confused little boy desperate for affection at times acting like an adult and at times a forlorn child. We know instinctively however that unless there is some sort of intervention the path Simon is on will lead to a dead end.Unfortunately however there are no parents foster or otherwise no social workers no schools or teachers in sight not even police around to put up a stop sign. People walk by him as they pass by the homeless every day in the streets of most big cities looking away thinking how sad. Nominated for Most Promising Actor at the 2013 Csar Awards Kacey Klein's natural performance is one of remarkable depth and understanding. He does not emote or think the role he lives in it and we are drawn into his life and experience his loneliness as our own. Also remarkable is Lea Seydoux who brings the irresponsible but ultimately sympathetic Louise to life.Based on Meier's memories of growing up near a ski resort near Geneva Switzerland and her recollection of a little boy who was known as a thief Sister is a devastating look at the result when an unwanted child is brought into the world. We discover how truly alone Simon is in scenes where he has to pay Louise to give him a hug and when his neediness pushes him to cling to the mother of two boys Gillian Anderson who buys him lunch at the resort. If as Victor Hugo said Life's greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved Meier makes it evident that growing up in a world without love even the most skillful and resilient child cannot fill the gaping hole it leaves.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in the Berlinale film festival 2012 where it was part of the Competition section. It tells about an intriguing situation with a brother and a sister living together. Both have very uncommon ways to pass the time each having their own survival strategy. We are left in the dark for a long time how all that came about.I especially admire the role of 12year old Simon who shows versatility skills and experience in his daily job of stealing ski's and related material from welltodo tourists in the ski resort in order to resell it later on to less wealthy people in the village. He acts as a real professional and knows everything there is to know about equipment brands and related market prices.The sister role on the other hand gets a bit on my nerves. She is utterly useless in earning a living nor is she capable of running an orderly household. She's easily distracted when a man any man is around and often leaving in the company of a lover each time a different one. I'm not completely sure how to characterize her way of living together with Simon as either symbiotic or parasitic.Halfway the movie it turns out that the relationship between Simon and his sister is completely different from what he tells everyone and us asking about their parents. What we and everyone are led to believe all the time is the explanation that is easiest accepted by everyone asking for details. Their behavior does not change after the revelation about their true relationship. But of course it changes our view on the situation drastically from that moment on.The film ends when the skiing season is nearly over and all tourists are about to leave. Unclear remains what their income will be as of this day. We see them in a ski lift Simon is going up and she is going down. Does this mean anything? A pointer? Seems like a deliberate open ending and I must admit that I cannot think of a better way to wrap up this story.All in all Simon is the real main character and he certainly is a person to get involved in. We follow him closely on his job feel with the risky situations he finds himself in just as we are happy with each of his narrow escapes. Though the sister keeps annoying me all the time she is the second main character who is also very well portrayed. Though we see many other characters appear all of them are mere side roles. Nevertheless they are also performing very well in their assigned roles.".

	schema:headline " More fascinating as voyeuristic crime drama than fairly obvious dissection of broken filial relationship";
	schema:reviewBody "'Sister' is the Swiss entry for both the Academy and Spirit Award nomination in the best foreign language film category. It's a very wellacted bleak portrait of the relationship between a 1213 year old boy Simon and his older caretaker Louise played by La Seydoux.HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD. For a good part of the film we're led to believe that Louise is Simon's older sister after Simon claims that their parents were killed in a car accident. Eventually however it's revealed that Louise is actually the child's mother.Most of the plot takes place at a Swiss ski resort where Simon mainly pilfers expensive skis and ski accessories from welloff unsuspecting tourists and supports himself and his mother by selling the items principally to employees at the resort.

On one occasion a tourist catches Simon stealing from him and the child suffers a beating resulting in a bloody nose and bruises on his body do you really believe no one at the resort would have called the police on their cell phone when they saw an adult attack a young child?.Louise makes it clear to Simon that she never wanted him and refuses to hardly parent him at all. The unloved boy is so desperate for affection that he offers her money if she'll just cuddle him in bed. Meanwhile Louise refuses to support the two and for most of the film selfishly takes money from the boy to support herself.

You'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit to believe that there are people as extreme as Louise. In real life wouldn't a narcissist like Louise simply make sure Simon goes to school to keep him out of her hair? And if he ends up as a truant the authorities would have no problem shipping him off to reform school. Yes I know she's supposed to be out of it but it just seems a little too convenient that no ever reports her and little Simon gets away with his pint size theft routine for so long. And also what exactly is director Usrula Meier's overall point? That without love kids can end up with some really bad problems? Even before Simon poaches the watch causing Louise to lose her job we pretty much realize that Simon's downward spiral will not reverse course in other words we GET the point that this indeed is a TRAGIC situation way before the denouement. Yes it's clever and dramatic to show the two going in opposite directions on the cable lift at film's end symbolizing that Simon will not get the help he needs from his mother but how about letting reality intrude into the story for a minute? The appropriate ending would be for some social workers to intervene and place the child in foster care or some kind of institutional setting. But this film is more about hitting us over the head about the 'tragedy' of this grim relationship instead of establishing a proper verisimilitude.'Sister's weak point is the rather onenote simplistic portrait of the mother from hell. Are there people like that in real life? Maybe. But usually there's some kind of motive is she a drug addict? Prostitute?it's all so sketchy. Why not find out a little bit more about her? Or is she so onedimensional that there's nothing more to learn?What keeps us interested is how far Simon will sink into the morass of criminality. In that respect Meier is more successful in fascinating us as voyeurs in a crime drama than the more unexplained and obvious dissection of a broken relationship between mother and child.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Sister' is the Swiss entry for both the Academy and Spirit Award nomination in the best foreign language film category. It's a very wellacted bleak portrait of the relationship between a 1213 year old boy Simon and his older caretaker Louise played by La Seydoux.HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD. For a good part of the film we're led to believe that Louise is Simon's older sister after Simon claims that their parents were killed in a car accident. Eventually however it's revealed that Louise is actually the child's mother.Most of the plot takes place at a Swiss ski resort where Simon mainly pilfers expensive skis and ski accessories from welloff unsuspecting tourists and supports himself and his mother by selling the items principally to employees at the resort. Along the way Simon befriends a British resort employee who helps him sell some of the stolen merchandise. On one occasion a tourist catches Simon stealing from him and the child suffers a beating resulting in a bloody nose and bruises on his body do you really believe no one at the resort would have called the police on their cell phone when they saw an adult attack a young child?.Louise makes it clear to Simon that she never wanted him and refuses to hardly parent him at all.

You may not be eager to go to skiing after having watched this masterpiece! John Parish's music is hypnotic and costume design are perfect. Everything in their house is ugly like poor Simon's tacky bed sheets. This reminds me of Lorna's silence whose winter clothing always looked bad on her herself a beautiful woman. Even when they but something brand new it doesn't work as supposed like the oven Simon wanted. Everything that enter the house sort of gets soiled. They are always washing clothes. The ending's got a clear symbolism I owe this to IMDb reviewer Dan Frazen. My favourite scene is Simon and his young apprentice stealing kid's wallets leaving aside the toys with cool efficiency complaining when they only have coins and flushing all what they don't want down the toilet.I'm eager to watch Ursula Meier's debut Home. I am sure she'll keep up the greatness.".

His only companion quite unreliable is an older sister Louise whose ups and downs force Simon to act way above is age. We don't know anything about how they ended up in this situation though at midpoint of the film we'll learn the truth of their relationship. The background and the weather are as cold and unpleasant as the relationships portrayed while the deadpan style of the film makes not a single concession to sentimentalism. Under these premises Meier has built a forthright movie full of subtleties not an easy film but utterly rewarding.Other reviewers here have already pointed out the duality of this highlow setting brilliantly used by Meier. It mirrors the class distinction of course and their respective environments the white unspoiled snow on top of the mountain for those with money against the melted mud on the hillside where the underprivileged survive. Simon however doesn't look for the wealth of the mountaintop. Surely he strives for an improvement in his life but his stealing is merely practical he needs to buy food toilet paper. No what Simon yearns for is tenderness for a caring mother for a life in which the lack of money doesn't spoil relationships. Downtown Simon has to be on permanent watch out up in the resort he can still pretend to be a kid.This fight against loneliness drives both siblings. What Louise cannot find in Simon she looks for in random boyfriends. What Simon cannot get from Louise he tries to get from a woman he stalks at the resort. However those relationships are built upon lies that hurt each other driving them further apart.Needless to say Simon won't fare well eventually his pretense falls when the woman he wants as a mother finds him cleaning her cabin Simon can't any longer hope to be her son if he is just a chalet bellboy. To make things worst he's caught stealing the woman's wristwatch. Was his stealing a betrayal a payback for her rejection? Or was he taking a souvenir a keepsake of the mother he lacks? It comes to my mind a little essay by Jean Genet L'Enfant criminel where the author points out the symbolic value of the crime's object in the mind of the young criminal. It is not surprising therefore that the watch he has stolen is found on his crotch. Still following Genet what turns someone into a thief is not the act of stealing but the word thief directed at him. The word the injury is what creates the separation from society a separation that will lead to the development of a criminal moral and the eventual transformation into a thief. Simon struggles to elude this process while at the same time is doomed to it.At the end of the film Simon returns downtown accepting the place where he belongs. There's no other possible direction for him once that the snow melts at the resort there's no tenderness to be found there. Probably as one character says Simon will steal bikes through the summer. Nothing has really changed for him he'll keep surviving at the margins of society. But in this hopeless ending there's the hopeful note too. Simon is going down yes hanging inside a cable car when he crosses another cable car that goes up. His sister obviously worried calls for him. These siblings after all do care for each other and that's something that the lack of money cannot change. They are not alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another strange weird item from the female director Ursula Meier who already gave us HOME back in 2008. With her you may expect the unexpected. Surprises within surprises. The perfect example of the best offbeat french product. The tale of a twelve years old boy who goes to ski resorts up in the Alpes mountains in order to steal skis and many other items.

Louise works sporadically cleaning ski chateaus while Simon seems to be the main breadwinner through his dubious job of swiping ski equipment and selling it as a oneman black market.This sad story is presented in an atmospheric minimalist way making full use of the picturesque setting yet managing to make the grandeur of the mountains and the luxury of the ski resort mostly just serve to make the viewer aware of the sadness of the two main characters. The movie is definitely sociological in nature making the viewer wish some outside party would intervene and help with this horrible situation. No particular moral or message is presented I'm not sure one is implied even subtly except that the world can be a very sad place for people at the bottom even in a place like Switzerland that is often portrayed as an ideal society it certainly isn't in this movie.The only fault I could really find was that the movie dwells for so long on Simon's thefts in the first half of the movie which are not all that entertaining and beyond establishing that his life is like that I'm not sure that we really needed the full 45 minutes of him being a ski resort kleptomaniac. Nothing else in the movie felt unnecessary or even worthy of criticism... for what it is trying to be this movie is quite good especially in the second half.My only advice is to not expect anything upbeat. I found this movie rather depressing. That hardly means it's not a good movie of course. Just brace yourself for one sad slice of life.".

	schema:headline " Strange gripping and worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "Although everything in the plot is very easy to understand everything is explained and selfexplainable it is still hard to say what it all is about but this is the asset of this film. The plot is taking place in a posh expensive Swiss ski resort which of course implies the other side of the coin the everyday life of actual inhabitants of the little settlement who live in a boring building beneath the mountain. The story starts right away with Simon 12 year old boy premature for his age who steals the expensive equipment whereas finds it unattended and resells it for cheap money to anyone interested so that he can support himself and his problematic older sister who keeps changing men and cannot keep the job. Although the plot takes place in Switzerland one of the wealthiest countries in the world where even poor or unemployed people live relatively well it is still interesting that there are many people ready to buy apparently stolen goods if they see an opportunity to make or save money.This is not really a social drama because we cannot see financial or bureaucratic reasons for Simon and his sister to live such a delinquent life. On contrary it seems there are much easier ways for both of them to make the money than to sell stolen goods.. However living such an illegal life seems to be a mode they both accepted in order to prove something to each other or to punish themselves  or challenge the traumas of their lives which will be revealed in the second half of the film. The film is slowly and almost invisibly developing into the resolving narrative mode so its definitely not boring to watch. The social dimension of the film is hence not about the finances or material issues. Its more about the alienation among humans and ignorance towards the children which simply does not even reflect the social status. The little Simon is passing by completely unnoticed for most of the time wandering around the posh ski terrains cafes restaurants because nobody really cares for children nobody bothers to pay attention to the other human being. Most of the people both guests and workers are just visitors in passing by nobody cares to check up on him or call authorities or anything. Simon is not the only child there who often wonders completely unattended. The appearance of the rich English woman with a proper family is more like a dream for Simon like a proper mother he has never had but she is not real for him either and the illusion is just the illusion. The acting of both leads is interesting. Film shows the development of the Simon from the boy who is a victim and who steals to buy food to a little criminal who at certain point simply can't resist stealing although he does not have the immediate need for that towards the end of the film. As for the Lea Seydoux who plays the sister the role that will stay little mysterious almost till the very end somebody has written here already that she is simply too pretty or too young or fragile to fit this story. I disagree with that on contrary the row instinct is often hidden within the fragility and prettiness and her acting is all contained in her face which is at the same time beautiful like a doll's face and wild and cruel to the unthinkable measures. In a word both actors deserve a praise together with director.".

Simon Kacey Mottet Klein is a 12 year old boy who steals to make a living for him and his sistermother Louis La Seydoux. Louise is first believed to be his older sister but Simon tells someone Louise was dating that she is his mother which she wanted no one to know about. One day stealing Simon is caught by Mike Martin Compston whom he goes into business for a while with when stealing such equipment as goggles skis and gloves.The relationship between Louise and Simon did seem different at first because he was taking care of her more even though she was older. Also the reveal that she is his mother was surprising to me and when I do think about how the two acted around each other I could see there was something different about them being brother and sister. The job Simon had seemed funny to me that he had gone on for so long stealing and never getting caught by anyone until Mike decides to go into business with Simon which seemed bound to fail eventually. The film was mostly about Louis and Simon but we did get some scenes with Gillian Anderson as a guest who was skiing and on her holiday and she seemed to act like a missing mother figure for Simon that he never had. The ending of the film where Louis and Simon pass each other going in different directions I believe was a message for how the two had acted throughout the film.Kacey Mottet Klein plays Simon and he was actually great in the role I thought. He was called to be annoying at times but other times when he had to get dramatic I thought that he handled it quite well. He also was able to play the funny when scenes when he was asked to play them by the writing. La Seydoux plays Louise and she may be soft at times only giving a dramatic look but like Klein when she was asked to be emotional she was the one able to pull on my heart strings. The relationship was fully believable to me because of how these actors played so well off of each other. There were also some smaller parts in the film and the standouts of them were Martin Compston and Gillian Anderson.The film is OK with scenes between Klein and Seydoux the best in the film as we see the conflict between them but also the love they share because they are mother and son. Some scenes were not needed but it did not slow down the fast pace of the movie.MOVIE GRADE B MVP La Seydoux".

	schema:headline " The complexity of family is played on screen and throughout the film you watch one do what it takes to be loved as the other seems almost indifferent at times.";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Blue is the Warmest Color or Colour I thought I should look for other films Lea Seydoux did and months ago I was recommended to see this by someone on IMDb. So I finally got around to getting this movie which likely will not be the last time I review a Seydoux movie and though the movie wasn't on the level of Blue is the Warmest Color it still was quite entertaining. Well at least the second half.Characters  StoryIn the film our focus primarily is on Simon played by Kacey Mottet Klein who helps Louise played by Lea Seydoux with the bills by stealing from the local ski resort's tourist and reselling their merchandise. The two live close enough to said ski resort for Simon to find a lot of skis goggles gloves and pockets to go through to make sure him and Louise have food on the table. And during the first half of the movie it seems like this is all Simon does as Louise wanders about with whatever boy fancies her at the time.However in the middle of the film a bomb is dropped and quickly the tone of the film changes and it goes from having this almost coming of age vibe to getting a bit darker and a bit more morose. I won't reveal why but with something Simon says we see his and Louise's relationship in a whole new way. Then from that point of the movie onward the focus is on the layers to that issue which though perhaps simple on paper are portrayed with such complexity that you almost wish this bomb was dropped sooner in the film.PraiseWhat I must admit is that I feel like the climax was quite a bit surprising and did help shake the movie. For the first half of the film was really ho hum but once the climax hits is when you get great performances out of Klein as well as Seydoux. As in Blue Seydoux plays a girl full of mystery but with her stripped of Emma's education and opportunities Louise is simply someone trying to survive the best way she knows how and while she doesn't outdo Klein as she outdid Adele Exarchopoulos in Blue she remains an essential force of which you can't picture the movie without be it her character or simply her.But Klein is perhaps truly the one who deserves praise. For though Seydoux maybe putting him up on her shoulders the boy makes you feel for his character who seemingly just wants the most genuine love and affection from Louise even if it means paying for it. I mean to watch him a 12 year old be in a helpless situation with someone who he loves who would openly tell him no one wanted him when his mother was pregnant is a bit heartbreaking. And yet the woman who tells him this he loves for there is really no one else anymore. So no matter how mean or how much they may struggle she is his everything and he accepts her for reasons which sometimes are hard to understand.CriticismBut I must say that when I first started watching the movie I was ready to turn it off. Us getting to know Simon as a kleptomaniac who sells people's stuff to make ends meet while interesting got old quick as we watch him sell stuff make a partner in selling skis and all that. Then Seydoux in the beginning to me anyway was just this shallow written young adult who seemingly was dependent on her kid brother while she hanged around some boy. And though there was mentions of her working we don't see that till the end so you easily forget she does more than possibly take advantage of Simon's affections for her. But as a whole once the 2nd half hits you can forgive the first half for it really is just made to set things up so the 2nd half can pack a punch.Overall Rental VODHonestly this is more so a TV viewing type film but I am not sure if this would play on TV so I have to push it up to a rental. For while I did like the movie I must admit I am comparing it to Blue and in comparison while I remain a fan of Seydoux and plan to see more of her work in the coming months this film just doesn't seem like it is worth spending money on unless you are a fan of Seydoux or Klein assuming he is still acting. Still though I think this is definitely worth watching on a Sunday afternoon and though the film may seem like it lacks direction in the first half once the 2nd half hits you will see the both performers finally put on a show which may not be the full extent of their talents but definitely gives you enough of a taste to want to see more from them.".

As for Sister This also can be thought as fairly appropriate.I was rather annoyed at the first half depicting a child stealing as the only way to get by and supporting a derelict sister who did not seem to do anything to help herself. I felt there was such waste of energy and little constructive to offer in a world already saturated by petty crimes.But as the story continued it became a lot more interesting and meaningful and kept me totally engrossed to see the outcome.Before coming to IMDb I checked Allo Cine a similar site in French.

The worst one gave only 12 a mark stating that the bourgeois did it again as usual transferring their own hangup to the poor society to which they have not insight or idea about its living condition.  or something to this effect. I believe most of us in some ways are isolated in our own social surrounding and it takes much effort to look or want to look at others introspectively. There are always some reasons for us to go one way or the other regardless of who we are or where we are. So I dismiss this view that states such disdain on the part of the better of people Some are very comfortable thanks to their hard work and also sometime a little luck. I don't think this film is set out to ease the rich people's burden to be different than their not so wealthy counterpart. I see a very good attempt to zoom down unto a very sad situation and portrait its protagonist in a very raw manner to an excellent result.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this a few years ago when I was living in Europe it's currently unavailable in the US except as a bootleg or an import. It is a completely stereotypical and unremarkable Franco WIP film of the era. Four implausibly sexy revolutionaries in an unnamed South American country are captured and thrown into an isolated jungle prison after they try to drive their caravan right by the prison. They are stripped naked chained by their necks to the ceiling in the titular Cellblock 9 and forced to stand hours on end. The Ilsalike female and her bent doctor cohort longtime Franco regular Howard Vernon take great delight in trying to torture information out of them. Some of the tortures like the Spanish horse are exceedingly unpleasant but also surprisingly nongraphic and this movie doesn't quite approach the nastiness of Franco's earlier BarbWire Dolls and Ilsa the Wicked Warden. It also doesn't have the plot of the later Women Behind Bars or feature the genuinely talented Lina Romay. The girls eventually bust out run into the woods still completely naked mind you where the movie ends EXACTLY the way all these Franco WIP films do. Furthermore despite the four girls having very nice bodies and being almost perpetually naked the only time this movie approaches any real eroticism is when the heroines stage a fourway lesbian orgy that goes on for some minutes in order to trick a horny dimwitted male guard into unchaining them. This movie is completely unremarkable in any way EXCEPT. . .The BBFC British Board of Film Censors recently banned this movie after they somehow discovered that one of the incredibly obscure actresses was underage I'll let you figure out which oneshe looks maybe 17 and a half at the youngest. I do NOT want to try to defend Franco on this particular count but this is a perfect example of where what no one knew would not have hurt anybody. Now though thanks to the vigilance of the BBFC you're about thirty years late guys this movie widely available from continental Europe through importers and bootleggers will become another holy grail for the perverts who obsess about this kind of thing. Worse for me though is the hypocrisy. The BBFC did not cut the gratuitous nudity of much more obviously underage girls out of the more recent and much more respectable movies like American Beauty and The Hole even while the girls in question Thora Birch and Keira Knightly respectively were STILL underage. If you are not going to protect actual underage actors from exploitation it is downright silly to try to protect society from us Franco fans who might unwittingly see a naked seventeen year old and presumably go on some kind of sexcrazed rampage. This movie sucks frankly but not nearly as much as braindead censorship and the BBFC.".

In fact I'm pretty sure that the chicks in Cellblock 9 only very briefly keep their clothes on for like the opening scene.

	schema:reviewBody "The reputation of explosurrealist Jess Franco's penchant for sadism and cruelty largely rests on the four Women In Prison films he made almost back to back in the late '70s. Far from the 'intellectual' flaunting of 'Succubus' or the dreamlike aura of 'Vampyros Lesbos' Franco's works like 'Ilsa Absolute Power' 'Barbed Wire Dolls' '99 Women' and this film reveal his fascination with unabashed sadism and humiliation without distraction.Granted a couple of other filmmakers have far surpassed this film in terms of hypershocking violence Guinea Pig anyone? but the latent nihilism and hatred of Franco's entire oeuvre comes out in spades in 'Cell Block 9'.Granted it's highly inartistic very cheap and mainly a smrgsbord of cruel scenarios depicting a woman's political prison in the jungle and the cruel warden who rules it with an iron fist. There is a message in the sense that you can feel Franco's outrage regarding prisoners of conscience but there's no unifying statement here political or otherwise.For those who like Franco's skewed view of human sexuality but can do without the heady surrealism this is a pretty good film to watch especially if you're curious about what happens when the Master takes his gloves off and gets dirty. Also for you hardcore Franco fans if you thought 99 Women and BarbedWire Dolls was a little 'soft' you'll be redeemed here. Recommended for Franco fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jesus Franco has caught a lot of flack over the years mostly of the order of talentless sleaze fixated hack and often from people who haven't actually seen many of his films. Women in Cellblock 9 is not one of his nobler efforts and those who admire him for his atmospheres and talent for fevered headstates and lush sexuality should stay far away it is rather a relentless rush of mean spirits and cruelty. It does strike against the talentless accusation of his critics though being a conventionally well made and even intermittently stylish work. Plotwise there's very little here. Several women attempt to escape a totalitarian South American state but are apprehended. They are then strung up naked and occasionally tortured until a predictable finale. It isn't a set up likely to appeal to many really unremitting sexual abuse tends to be kind of a turn off for people and characters are largely neglected so there's little to hold on to if you aren't a big sleaze fan. Fortunately I am just such a person and thus had rather a good time the key to it being its very one dimensionality I think. Through pained faces and pleading through mostly absent context it builds an atmosphere of pure cruelty with a fine charge some from the cast and some from the situation. The actresses are surely pretty uncomfortable in their scenes and their suffering is palpable even infectious as the film draws on its hard not to feel a sense of genuine unhappiness for them. As performers they work well too Karine Gambier Susan Hemmingway Aida Gouveia and Esther Studer were all either Franco frequent flyers or adult cinema veterans and have an easy chemistry and not just their characters but the film itself. Franco has occasionally cast women that just don't gel with his films but here they work beautifully and the camera is equally responsive. Mostly naked with loving gaze upon breasts and bushes they bring a physical energy that almost makes up for their absent characters radiating convincing pain during even the more daftly lurid of their tortures. Though never graphic these scenes are imaginatively mean spirited and compered with glee by a hammy yet disturbing Howard Vernon clearly having a hoot of a time as a bad bad man who really likes his job. Things are always watchable but like many a film of its ilk this one is simply too unambitious. I know I said the one dimensionality works but it still could have taken its one dimension and made it oh I don't know bigger? Though nasty it never goes for truly grim where it should though sleazy it only once takes a time out to actually be sexy. I didn't expect much and happily I got pretty much exactly what I wanted from this one but I still can't help thinking it could have pushed the boat out a bit more. There is also a sad lack of wild zooms or out of focus shots Franco never tweaks the atmosphere the way his other work has shown he can. When it comes down to it this isn't that memorable and its a crying shame. Still a good time 610 from me though even if it has slipped my mind in a few weeks time.".

	schema:headline " The last men I did this to became homosexual!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is harrowing. Directed by Jess Franco it caused a certain degree of controversy by the inclusion in the cast of Susan Hemingway as Maria an apparently underage actress a young looking 16 year old. It is as bleak and uncompromising ... and dangerous ... a film as Franco ever directed.Produced with collaborator Erwin C. Dietrich this is deliberately gratuitous on many levels. A women in prison peril drama it features Howard Vernon in one of the most disturbing of his roles sleazy dishevelled perverted Dr. Milton who even through the gauze of dubbing still permeates the horrifying persona of someone who really enjoys inflicting many forms of torture The last men I did this to became homosexual he says at one point whatever that might imply.Franco is quite restrained here in his camerawork at least allowing the many scenes of humiliation and inflicted pain to speak for themselves without a frantically zooming lens to highlight a particular horror. What blood and actual gore we do see  with admittedly gaudy red paint  is only partially and briefly glimpsed and therefore powerful indeed if even the camera daren't linger on the wounds how can we the audience?Films like this I'd say more than his more straightforward horror output earned Franco a reputation as exploitationist. As ever the soundtrack by Walter Baumgartner here is glaringly inappropriate. A light jazzy percussive piece for example accompanies scenes of the female prisoners trying to seduce their prison guard including Hemmingway's Maria of course You can have all four of us she says at one point by indulging in lesbian foreplay.Also known as 'Escape from the Island of Death' 'Tropical Inferno' and originally 'Frauen fr Zellenblock 9' this is probably not the best Franco film to show to someone unfamiliar with his work. Often when I watch one of his films I recognise entirely the technical flaws the bad dubbing incomprehensible stories and love them anyway. Here it is the uncompromising exploitation elements that makes me wince a little in that we are watching nubile naked young women continually placed in graphic often sexual peril.French Karine Gambier who has a prolific acting filmography is excellent as the stoical Karine and has a look of Jean Rollin's Castel twins about her Dora Doll is also very effective as governess Loba.

	onyx:emotionText "This is harrowing. Directed by Jess Franco it caused a certain degree of controversy by the inclusion in the cast of Susan Hemingway as Maria an apparently underage actress a young looking 16 year old. It is as bleak and uncompromising ... and dangerous ... a film as Franco ever directed.Produced with collaborator Erwin C. Dietrich this is deliberately gratuitous on many levels. A women in prison peril drama it features Howard Vernon in one of the most disturbing of his roles sleazy dishevelled perverted Dr. Milton who even through the gauze of dubbing still permeates the horrifying persona of someone who really enjoys inflicting many forms of torture The last men I did this to became homosexual he says at one point whatever that might imply.Franco is quite restrained here in his camerawork at least allowing the many scenes of humiliation and inflicted pain to speak for themselves without a frantically zooming lens to highlight a particular horror. What blood and actual gore we do see  with admittedly gaudy red paint  is only partially and briefly glimpsed and therefore powerful indeed if even the camera daren't linger on the wounds how can we the audience?Films like this I'd say more than his more straightforward horror output earned Franco a reputation as exploitationist. As ever the soundtrack by Walter Baumgartner here is glaringly inappropriate. A light jazzy percussive piece for example accompanies scenes of the female prisoners trying to seduce their prison guard including Hemmingway's Maria of course You can have all four of us she says at one point by indulging in lesbian foreplay.Also known as 'Escape from the Island of Death' 'Tropical Inferno' and originally 'Frauen fr Zellenblock 9' this is probably not the best Franco film to show to someone unfamiliar with his work. Often when I watch one of his films I recognise entirely the technical flaws the bad dubbing incomprehensible stories and love them anyway. Here it is the uncompromising exploitation elements that makes me wince a little in that we are watching nubile naked young women continually placed in graphic often sexual peril.French Karine Gambier who has a prolific acting filmography is excellent as the stoical Karine and has a look of Jean Rollin's Castel twins about her Dora Doll is also very effective as governess Loba. The locations which Franco always excels at photographing are either tremendously austere for the prison scenes or idyllic as befits the sprawling surrounding jungle. The characters are typically underwritten and exist purely for the purposes of this film if we knew a little more about them and saw some semblance of personality  although dubbing strangles this  then we would care more for their plight on a personal level  but Franco isn't interested in backstory.As an aside two years earlier Hammer released one of their final films 'To the Devil a Daughter' which featured Nastassia Kinski who was reportedly only 14 when her naked scenes were shot two years younger than Susan Hemingway and yet the usually prudish British censors seemed happy to let this go without comment yet 'Women of Cellblock 9' is still officially banned in the UK.";

From London to Berlin via Helsingborg Dallas Las Vegas to Montral skinheads establish themselves as a movement of youth with rebellious violent often extremist traits. Skins stir up fears and form the street movement which is feared most. They are used to being objects of the media but who are they really? SKINHEAD ATTITUDE is a road movie accompanying Karole a modern skinhead girl with a traditional and antiracist attitude. At the age of 22 she discovers her female identity within a maledominated movement being skin despite the influential stereotypes and the looks of others.

	schema:reviewBody "This surprisingly lowkey documentary is interesting as it clarifies the differences between three basic types of baldies racist antiracist and just plain ol' apolitical skins. Although to be fair the one thing they all do have in common  apart from their mysterious hatred of hair  is that they're all rather daft. Perhaps the Nazi skins are somewhat dumber than the rest but those antiglobalism SHARP skins aren't exactly sharp either. The other positive aspect of SA Oi! Hang On! SA??! is the high entertainment level that watching a bunch of deluded morons behave and talk like Neanderthals brings.What are skinheads? Generally speaking skins are a bunch of insecure inferioritycomplex misfits with debilitating amounts of brain damage  which is usually inborn i.e. hereditary. They're extremely afraid of life they suffer from constant anxiety their selfesteem is very low or nonexistent i.e. they are mentally weak losers hence aren't fit for the tough competition that's out there waiting for them in the real world  a world which they naturally start despising early on in their lives simply because they can't be a part of it or so they believe.So burdened with all these mental problems utter desperation and a sense of total hopelessness they seek solace warmth coziness in an underground movement that is just as antiindividualistic as much a slave to fashion and limiting rules as any other pop army Mods rude boys punks hippies Emos... low IQs the lot of them. Once they've joined other baldies it gives them a sudden injection of selfrespect. In this new little skinhead world that they join they find themselves a Utopia of sorts there are no more pressures there is no ratrace there is no ambition and most importantly no expectations whatsoever. No one there expects them to have or make money to be smart or to be goodlooking.In fact the reason why they wear awful hair or no hair and dress as badly as they can is their way of saying we're ugly and we're proud of it.

Naturally not all skinheads are weaklings.

	onyx:emotionText "This surprisingly lowkey documentary is interesting as it clarifies the differences between three basic types of baldies racist antiracist and just plain ol' apolitical skins. Although to be fair the one thing they all do have in common  apart from their mysterious hatred of hair  is that they're all rather daft. Perhaps the Nazi skins are somewhat dumber than the rest but those antiglobalism SHARP skins aren't exactly sharp either. The other positive aspect of SA Oi! Hang On! SA??! is the high entertainment level that watching a bunch of deluded morons behave and talk like Neanderthals brings.What are skinheads? Generally speaking skins are a bunch of insecure inferioritycomplex misfits with debilitating amounts of brain damage  which is usually inborn i.e. hereditary. They're extremely afraid of life they suffer from constant anxiety their selfesteem is very low or nonexistent i.e. they are mentally weak losers hence aren't fit for the tough competition that's out there waiting for them in the real world  a world which they naturally start despising early on in their lives simply because they can't be a part of it or so they believe.So burdened with all these mental problems utter desperation and a sense of total hopelessness they seek solace warmth coziness in an underground movement that is just as antiindividualistic as much a slave to fashion and limiting rules as any other pop army Mods rude boys punks hippies Emos... low IQs the lot of them. Once they've joined other baldies it gives them a sudden injection of selfrespect. In this new little skinhead world that they join they find themselves a Utopia of sorts there are no more pressures there is no ratrace there is no ambition and most importantly no expectations whatsoever. No one there expects them to have or make money to be smart or to be goodlooking.In fact the reason why they wear awful hair or no hair and dress as badly as they can is their way of saying we're ugly and we're proud of it. Of course they're not actually happy about being ugly but when surrounded by likeminded misfits they feel as if their deficiencies no longer matter and are even a point of pride. Naturally in order to support and justify this fantasyworld lifestyle to THEMSELVES for years on they are forced to be in heavy denial all the time.

This film has a rare and unique quality that captures the audience attention from the beginning to the very end. In the midst of the film it also have the ability to make you laugh cry little and finishes off with a bittersweet smile. In essence this is a movie made for kids but also an enjoyable film for adults to watch together. This is the kind of movie that Ninja Kids!!! fails to be and should have been. Putting in a Samurai of the 1800s Edo period into modern day Tokyo is a smart idea but full credit must go to the entire likable cast of Ryo Nishikido Rie Tomosaka and Fuku Suzuki. In particular Fuku Suzuki steals the show with steady child cuteness and the trio Nishikido and Tomosaka plays off each other with chemistry and fun. All in all A Boy and His Samurai is one of those films that allows the audience to enjoy the experience laugh together carefree lighthearted and engages the audience at an emotional level. It is a rare quality and the pacing is much faster than most Japanese movies. In doing so A Boy and His Samurai is fast becoming a contender as the most enjoyable movie at the 15th Japanese Film Festival. A must see.Neo rates it 8.510.www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Divorce Hiroko Rie Tomosaka struggles with worklife balance issues as she tries to raise her son Tomoya Fuku Suzuki singlehandedly while holding down a fulltime job. It is a very Japanese divorce  Dad is completely out of the picture. Salvation arrives in the unlikely form of Edoera samurai Yasubei Ryo Nishikikido mystically transported to the present day. In need of food and shelter he discovers the culinary delights of puddings and desserts. A deal is hatched whereby he devotes himself to household chores in return for food and lodging allowing Hiroko to forge ahead in her career. However Yasubei's growing patisserie talents will bring tension to the deal.Tomosaka and Nishikikido do decent work as the starcrossed potential lovers Tomosaka in particular carrying the world weariness of a single mum worn down by the barbs from work colleagues. Some interesting thematic elements are hinted at here the samurai finds the notion of a working woman and single mum incomprehensible but adapts in a way that foreshadows the transformation of Meijiera samurai. Tomosaka remarkably divorces her husband because he was an unreformed male  and yet finds a suitable replacement in a samurai the embodiment of patriarchal ideals. This could all make for some insightful comment on contemporary Japan and gender roles but these strands remain unmined as the film follows predictable lines by having Yasubei enter a cakebaking contest with the illprepared Tomoya by his side. Despite one cute scene with white chocolate transformed to snow the interpersonal relationships notions of displacement role and worklife balance are all underrealised in the end. Quite simply the film builds up nicely but by the second half I was looking at my watch. Yasubei never stops to take stock of the Japan he has lost and the new Japan he finds thrust upon him. Hiroko similarly never has to reflect on the fact that she has entrusted the parenting of her son to a swordwielding bigot.Perhaps such thoughts would have taken the film too far from the generic fare it strives to be. A pity as Chonmage Purin gives up a few chuckles along the way and the strong cast look like they could have handled more challenging fare.".

Harte Jungs seems to be made by someone who watched Al Bundy and took him too seriously.The best actors in the movie are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jrgens who play Schenke's semiliberal parents.

You really feel for Jason Biggs but certainly not for this guy. At 15 you also know he's not going to get some anyway. So where exactly is this going? It's highly predictable and there's no real character development here. As for his talking Johnson  well what's the point of that?The film desperately wants to be American. With the exception of the few buildings you actually see you'd hardly know this was in Germany. Plus the fact that the dubbed version uses American accents.As for the girl he ends up with? No way.

This however does not make up for an essentially dull and predicable story.A few comments here are saying this film is good. I see they're all GermanHungarian.

	schema:headline " Pretty bad and embarrassing for the most part";
	schema:reviewBody "Harte Jungs is a German movie from 2000. It is relatively short stays easily under the 90minute mark and was directed by Marc Rothemund. It is certainly still one of his most known works even if his careerdefining film is probably the Oscarnominated Sophie Scholl. The writer is Granz Henman i.e. he adapted Alberto Moravia's novel. And Moravia was already dead for 10 years which may have been a good thing that he did not see the outcome of this film we have here. As for Henman he went on to write and also direct the sequel to Harte Jungs two years later. I would try to justify his weak work on these two films by lack of experience but honestly it is not possible as his possibly best movie Der Eisbr was also his very first and some of his recent work after being busy in the industry for a long time is downright horrible Coming In. Anyway back to this one here. It is comedy from start to finish with the occasional romancefantasy element. Lookikng at the cast you will find several names that are still somewhat known today like the then still chubby Stein Tander Jrgens Perlinger Sawatzki Ruland and lead actor Schenke whose star has gone down pretty quickly though. But also with these names it becomes obvious that almost all of these are actors who never really scored with great talent or range but rather with charisma and recognition value and maybe also a memorable physicality for the women mostly.And still the actors are not really the ones to blame for what a mess this film turned out to be. It is the script. First of all the part about talking male genitalia is taken early as a crucial component of the plot and then it is not elaborated on later at all for really really long sequences as if it is the most normal thing in the world. Besides that the plot is as predictable as nonsensical really. This includes for example the parents' talk with the protagonist but also all the conversations with the girl of his dreams. And how are we supposed to like him if he freshly together with the real girl of his dreams that truly loves him starts looking after the first attractive other girl he encounters. Is that what men are? Maybe some maybe also the central character here. And maybe this is why besides from Schenke's lack of talent he comes off as a complete jerk and idiot from start to finish. It sure takes a special lack of range if you are easily outclassed by a genuinely mediocre actor like Axel Stein in your movie. So yeah there is a decent moment here and there and it is also very much in the film's favor that it does not take itself seriously at all because it does not have any right to but as a whole this was a disappointment and I am glad it runs for 80 minutes only and this already includes credits. But sadly people back then here in Germany loved trash comedies already as much as they do today and the consequence was a sequel that turned out probably worse even than this one here and that's quite a challenge. Then again you should already stay away from this very first film. Not recommended.".

The documentary is actually somewhat emotional in that you can feel the ideals the respect the openness and the doubts from that of the director or it's protagonists through the structure of the movie. But then again the guy beside me nodded off. The doc combines more or less 5 different journeysstories if you will  and some surprises. One is of the retelling from an AlJazzera's journalist another from the perspective of an French archaeologist a CanadianAfghani actress a local Afghani that lived in the Bamiyan valley and the director's POV. possible spoilers The style mixes personal accounts videos pictures and memories of and on anything related to the 2 Giant Buddhas that was destroyed by the Talibans. These methods are like any conventional docs. These methods through the 5 journeys give the documentary many personal levelsangles of emotional points of entry. And the camera the music the silences together regards the valley with warmth and respect. There are back stories legends comparisons future plans that encompasses and paints a multidimensional sphere of sentiment on the subject. And there is even a brief use of FX to convey a dream sequence the director pointed out.In the QA the director indicated he will go back to the region to show the film with an Arabic track credit shows a German and English narrator versions and as well as interpretors for the illiterates.".

The documentary is actually somewhat emotional in that you can feel the ideals the respect the openness and the doubts from that of the director or it's protagonists through the structure of the movie. But then again the guy beside me nodded off. The doc combines more or less 5 different journeysstories if you will  and some surprises. One is of the retelling from an AlJazzera's journalist another from the perspective of an French archaeologist a CanadianAfghani actress a local Afghani that lived in the Bamiyan valley and the director's POV. possible spoilers The style mixes personal accounts videos pictures and memories of and on anything related to the 2 Giant Buddhas that was destroyed by the Talibans. These methods are like any conventional docs. These methods through the 5 journeys give the documentary many personal levelsangles of emotional points of entry. And the camera the music the silences together regards the valley with warmth and respect. There are back stories legends comparisons future plans that encompasses and paints a multidimensional sphere of sentiment on the subject. And there is even a brief use of FX to convey a dream sequence the director pointed out.In the QA the director indicated he will go back to the region to show the film with an Arabic track credit shows a German and English narrator versions and as well as interpretors for the illiterates.";

Lack of structure isn't necessarily a bad thing but this topic would have benefited from a more straightforward approach.You don't know who is behind the camera half the timethat person seems to change. Who is in the UN airplaneis that Frei? Is that him in those meetings? In the segment in China when looking for the recreation who was speaking? Does Frei speak Chinese? Who was writing the letters to Nelofer Pazira and what was their point? I enjoyed the long lingering closeups of Pazira's beautiful face and especially those amazing green eyes but they were completely gratuitous. If she were unattractive I'm sure she wouldn't have appeared in the film at all. Seemed like Frei was as interested in filming her as in filming his erstwhile topic. Don't blame him but seems like that should be a different movie. Also as mentioned Frei did not succeed in connecting Buddhism in general to these statues. I saw this film with five others and none felt any particular historical or artistic loss at the destruction of the Buddhas. Did any modern Buddhists care about what was happening in Afghanistan? Seemed not. Maybe few even knew about the existence of these statues or didn't care because they were only large and old not beautiful. They were ugly in fact.The walkingaround scenes were confusing. There is a scene in which Pazira climbs up inside then seems to be looking down on the Buddha's facebut it had already been blown up by then. I lost my bearings.This film needed a good disciplined editor I think to give this raw material some shape and to clarify its point. Time spent lingering on Pazira's eyes could have been better spent on providing context. It should have been possible to present the Taliban's rationale directly from a Taliban. Maps showing where the Bamiyan Valley is exactly where it stood on the trade route and how Buddhism might have reached the area in the first place would also have helped. Also to identify what languages people were speaking and how the local Hazaris got to be there. Perhaps these details were missing in favor of a more subjective or artistic approach but that seems to me more simply a lack of discipline than an expression of art.Still in its favor the music was very good though maybe local music might have been more fitting and I give credit for simply exposing viewers to footage of a part of the world westerners rarely get to see.".

Writerdirector Michael Caleo thought he was making some sort of hip clever drama like The Usual Suspects. Michael Keaton and Daniel Stern thought they were doing a comedy. Brendan Fraser apparently believed he was playing in some sort of angstfilled indy flick and Amber Valletta appears to have been doing some sort of tragic romance. Those disparate intentions slide into each other and produce a film that makes no sense and becomes more and more unintentionally hilarious as it tries to pretend that it does.Ted Michael Keaton is the top salesman at a computer technology company in New York City. He's a living breathing Yosemite Sam so angry at everything and everyone in the world that steam is practically coming out of his ears. His pathetic boss Daniel Stern has teamed Ted up with Jaime Brendan Fraser the new salesman on staff. Jaime is fresh into town from Ohio and is the bright and chipper opposite of Ted. At first Ted is simply disgusted with Jaime's happiness and cando attitude but that changes after he meets Jaime's fianc Belisa Amber Valletta. Ted and Belisa quickly fall in lust leading to Ted trying to help Jaime due to both guilt and to keep him busy so Ted can have Belisa all to himself. But as Jaime's failures continue he turns into an ever surlier version of Ted. And as Ted's own sales falter because he's obsessed with Belisa the company starts to collapse around him. Then there's a big twist at the end which even the dimmest bulb will have halfway figured out before the movie is halfway over. You'll only figure out about 50 of the twist though because it's just so stupid. It's like a 14 year old's notion of a cunning plan.The best thing about The Last Time is that the acting is good but only in spurts. When he gets his chance Keaton again demonstrates he's one of the great angryfunny ranters of his age. Stern is also good when he's on screen as the harried sloganeering sales manager who always feels like he's drowning in quicksand. Valetta is suitably appealing as an object of desire and Fraser is almost as entertaining as Keaston when Jaime is allowed to just be funny.The worst thing about The Last Time is that writerdirector Caleo understands his own script about as well as a jellyfish understands algebra. There are parts of this movie that are straight comedy parts that are serious drama parts that as edgy parts that are mushy parts that are overthetop ridiculous and about 7 different other stuff. Caleo quite bizarrely treats all of it exactly the same. This isn't a serious movie with funny bits it's not a comedy with dark moments and it's not goofy film that gets a little outrageous. It tries to be all of those things equally to laughably lame effect. It'll be things like an overtly humorous scene that has starkly dramatic music playing on the soundtrack at the same time or something as insane as Ted and Belisa having sex on the same bed where Jaime is passed out drunk being treated like a garden variety affair. It creates this overriding sense of unreality that prevents you from enjoying any part of the movie that much.Its little eruptions of comedy from Keaton and Stern along with Amber Valetta going topless prevent The Last Time from being completely unwatchable. There's a clunky fakeness to the whole film though that stops it from being that entertaining. You don't need to see this film but you won't end up hating yourself if you do.".

Since my opinion is still fresh and wouldn't be influenced by anything else at this very moment at least not dramatically I thought I'd share my thoughts.Yes my summary is It doesn't know what it wants to be and that is it's main flaw. Director Michael Caleo was brave enough to incorporate numerous themes and genres into this confused work. What starts off to be your average two lead comedy wanders off into the thriller territory and attempts to simultaneously touch upon the RomCom genre. I say Caleo was brave because he took a risk where the odds were against him. He attempted something that could have easily failed he tried to defy the conventions of your average ComedyDrama by reinforcing forcing even innovation.Was it a complete failure? I wouldn't say so. I've been rather generous with my '6' rating but there were a few redeeming qualities about it. The most overt quality was mainly Michael Keaton's on screen presence. His charisma was present as always and quirky demeanour was reminiscent of his pre 90s career. As for the rest of the cast Brendan Fraser and Amber Valletta were tolerable but nothing amazing.The twist that unravels as the conclusion was lowbrow and felt rushed. In fact a lot of the dialogue felt rushed. There seemed to be a lot of reliance on foul language to encapsulate it's comedic elements that it attempted to implement.I'd like to sum this up by saying that if you aren't a Michael Keaton or Brendan Fraser fan you might find it hard to be engaged because as a movie on it's own it isn't very good. However it isn't all bad Caleo's attempt is worth having a look at. The Last Time is an unconventional Dramedy sort of that didn't quite achieve what it wanted to.".

However it isn't all bad Caleo's attempt is worth having a look at. The Last Time is an unconventional Dramedy sort of that didn't quite achieve what it wanted to.";

	schema:reviewBody "Before reviewing this film let me state that I don't think there's another actor who can create as much interest and tension as Michael Keaton. I often wonder how different the career of this beyondbrilliant actor would be if he had played the second Batman. Anyway The Last Time is Michael's film. He looks great he's thin he's complex and he's outwardly cold. Which makes you wonder why he would put up with so many of Brendan Fraser's flaws even if it meant getting to romance BF's beautiful wife Amber Valletta. The story was for the most part compelling though I wasn't totally comfortable with not knowing what the corporation actually made Was I supposed to? and why Daniel Stern was so hilariously freaked out. Near the endthe film took an emotional dip which led one to guess the ending before one should. Despite many flaws in logic I think this was a fascinating film and would recommend it to anyone. My main complaint is what it always is the swearing. Not because I don't like swearing but it's always those false Hollywoodtype vulgarities that everyone uses in the film but very few men employ in real life. How do they come up with these sexualscatologicalhomoeroticphobic and ultimately silly curses. Try using any one of them at a business office and you'd be out the door or on the carpet. Good film. Good performances. However Michael Keaton deserves to be in much more important films.".

My feelings are mixed as I can never slam a Michael Keaton movie.Lets me elaborate on what you may not like first.1 If you've read the synopsis on the IMDb site you've basically seen three quarters of the film. And if you thought this would enhance character development guess again. It doesn't happen...2 Frasier on most parts reminded me of Hayden's attitude on Attack of the Clones with a spice of the Three Stooges all rolled into one a whinny stupid 5year old.3 The use of the 'F' word and I don't mean 'Freedom'. I must have heard it about 150 times in less than 100 minutes you figure out the ratio.4 The whole film tries to be interesting by incorporating ideas that where successful elsewhere flashbacks conspiracy theories etc but fails to maintain focus on any of those tricks. Alas the fluctuation is present every 2 to 3 minutes. An overlysimplistic plot may be an excuse for the directors efforts but not for the audiences' ...5 There is too much evidence on what's going to take place at the end of the movie. It may not be entirely predictable but if you take a closer look at what could really be going on you'd see how this one ends halfway through the movie.True this was never going to be a Miami Vice in terms of hype or action sequences but it does have some plus points...1 Keaton is good. Not top notch mind you but he delivered as expected. He portrayed his character in a believable fashion for most part of the film and proved once again that he can still be the difference between an average movie and a movie that sucked... Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast...2 Bitter ending. It doesn't try to sell the extra ticket by miraculously turning things around like 'Click' did so infuriatingly in an otherwise excellent showing. In other words the film does not really have any 'scifi' connections but gives you a dry directlyfromlife ending which is so often missed in Hollywood...3 You may find yourself feeling for the lead Keaton a little once his true character is revealed you know he would somehow get the shorter end of the stick...To sum it up Go see it if you're a Keaton fan... Otherwise...".

While this film presents a different situation basically it is easy to see why Michael Caleo's film will be likened to the other one. In fact Mr. Caleo made his name writing for television. His claim to fame is tied to the success of The Sopranos for which he contributed.We are introduced to the sales department of what might be a corporation involved in computer systems although nothing is made clear. The star salesman is Ted a man with a filthy mouth and an aggressive attitude toward his prospective customers. He totally dominates the work force because he is a successful salesman who generates a lot of revenue for his company.In spite of his exterior Ted is a lonely guy. We see him getting to his huge loft apartment a sterile atmosphere. One thing he can't be blamed for is the amount of books in the place he is a big question mark with no apparent relationship at the moment. Ted is given the task of breaking in a new salesman from Ohio Jamie who has been hired based on his previous performance.Ted obviously hates the assignment. There is no love lost between the men. Ted realizes Jamie doesn't have what it takes to make in New York a tough territory indeed. When Ted meets Belisa Jamie's fianc he sees a gorgeous creature ready for the attention his groom to be doesn't give her. The two embark into a dangerous affair that could only lead to trouble as we watch it play out.In the process we discover that Ted was a professor of literature at Northwestern. He has turned into sales from the world of academia quite a change for him or anyone for that matter. Ted in a way sees Jamie as the person he is not. In fact that is the reason he goes after Belisa. Having conquered her he has nothing else to prove.The whole reason for watching The Last Time is its star Michael Keaton. He runs away with the film. Model turned actress Amber Valletta is a beautiful woman. She is believable as Belisa. As the addled salesman from Ohio Brendan Fraser convinces us but his presence can be irritating.".

It's that good a movie.It's also a thinking person's movie. Nothing explodes and no one's head rolls down a staircase and there's no blood and gore but my oh my is it a compelling story.There are a lot of messages you can take away from this movie but the one that rings most true to me is a quote I heard many years ago from William Barclay Bible scholar. He said that evil seeks to breech our spiritual fortress in our weakest places and in our strongest places and that we should be vigilant to guard those two low spots. The other reason I loved this movie is it's about every man and each plot and subplot is very believable and has no discernible plot holes as so many movies do. It's very wellwritten wellacted and deliciously interesting. You may want to watch it twice to make sure you miss nothing.".

One weakness of the film was its depiction of women as greedy piranhas that only seek nourishment from money not love. There were no nonmaterialistic female characters in the film to balance out this theme resulting in a rather overgeneralized characterization of women. If one can get past this problem the premise that those obsessed with making money will go to unspeakable evil lengths to attempt to satisfy their insatiable greed is an interesting theme to consider.

	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoilers hereinThe Last Time represents a dramatic character reversal inevitably a character study as opposed to just another independent feature.From the getgo you don't really like Keaton's Ted the cocky sarcastic ambitious and worst of all always right salesman. He knows all about his trade what he's doing and how he's doing it. Each moment we spend with him however we come to understand his nature. We dig to find his personal flaws that which built the man portrayed before us. In the opposite we have Fraser Jaime a green salesman who was big news in his small town then comes the big city. We've seen this formula before true but Brendan has always been able to lose the veracity of himself in his character. You could compare this to the way he interviews and his commentary on The Mummy DVD. In fact you tend to feel sorry for him in this particular role.Finally you have Valletta Belisa a housewife in complete support of her husband going so far as to move to the big city with him so he may accomplish dreams so grand hopes to start a family notwithstanding.This is all well and fine but think when you watch of how you feel toward them in the beginning versus how you end up feeling about them.Ted turns out to be a very brilliant but troubled individual who's sole purpose in this job is not to crush others but actually to make as much money as possible. He was a professor you see highly successful at it due to his intelligence but not altogether wealthy a reason his wife decided to up and leave him. This chain of events propelled our man to move to the big city and prove his worth in this world. He attacks the forefront of sales under the disguise of confidence but the soul of pain. Taking what he wants seems a primary motive at first until he meets Belisa who renews in him that sense of purity and living. Though they begin and live an affair throughout it would seem as true love. Ted finally is able to open up to someone and give his personality not that guise that has guided him to her.Which brings us to Belisa who fronts the lie of a happy housewife. Her Jaime is focused on doing his best but is failing miserably. So his work stalks him in his personal life hitting her full swing with the loss of love and a renewed seek of interest. Enter Ted that sureofhimself professional who takes charge where needed. Thus we begin the affair.Back to Jaime who we define as weak and afraid throughout. Someone like I said before we feel sorry for from the beginning primarily because we have all been there starting out and not altogether sure of how. His lack of interest in his wife causes her to run to the arms of another man and it seeps through as he knows she's going behind his back but never to whom. He finds a fatherly figure in Ted think of a son attempting all he can to win his father's respect but never learned enough to do so. With the guilt of the affair Ted feels sorry for the young man and so assists him in any way possible.This again is a fairly typical formula but as I said each character takes a complete 180 near the end.We find Ted a poet by heart and actually feel sorry for what happens to him. We find Jaime a conniving opportunist who knows full well how to manipulate others and Belisa becomes the embodiment of if this were a spy novel a femme fatal. I will not to spoil how this comes to light as not to be the purpose of this review. My intent is to give potential viewers a fair realization of what The Last Time is truly about not what the surface will have you believe. If you walk into this thinking the overall production will be spectacular disappointment will ensue. The music is not very well synthesized the cinematography is average at best but gets the point across and the dialogue could've used a bit of strengthening. However the direction is remarkable the characters believable and full circle and the story is superb in terms of originality. Keaton and Fraser deliver Ted and Jaime in such a way that you forget they are acting after only a bit of time in my opinion Keaton begins in character and never ends whereas Fraser had moments of similarity to his other works although quite remarkable nonetheless while Valletta gives a rich performance.And as I preemptively mentioned all of these characters including the supporting players Daniel Stern especially oppose their first impression which is how life really works this day in age. Actions govern personality and vice versa.Rent this when you are ready to watch a character study along with clever storytelling not when you want to see overly dramatic play upon your TV screen. For that I recommend you start watching Lifetime or a good percentage of movie channel HBO Showtime etc original series.".

Keaton and Fraser deliver Ted and Jaime in such a way that you forget they are acting after only a bit of time in my opinion Keaton begins in character and never ends whereas Fraser had moments of similarity to his other works although quite remarkable nonetheless while Valletta gives a rich performance.And as I preemptively mentioned all of these characters including the supporting players Daniel Stern especially oppose their first impression which is how life really works this day in age. Actions govern personality and vice versa.Rent this when you are ready to watch a character study along with clever storytelling not when you want to see overly dramatic play upon your TV screen. For that I recommend you start watching Lifetime or a good percentage of movie channel HBO Showtime etc original series.";

Michael Keaton in this movie is such an unpredictable fascinating character that nobody can say they were bored. They may not think the performance is believable as a real person but it wasn't boring.I'm recommending this movie because I was entertained simple as that. There was many problems I had throughout the film that were all solved by the end but the ending created more problems if I took the time to think about it. But taking the time to think about it after the fact shouldn't affect my emotional response I had when the credits were rolling. People blast movies like Sixth Sense for the same reason. By the twist ending everybody in the audience were shocked. Their minds were reeling. They were entertained. Then driving home they rethink the movie with knowledge of the twist and find all sorts of plot holes. Then they decide they hate the movie. If you are entertained during the course of the movie that's all that matters. Don't analyze everything and try to find problems.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Time seems at first glance like a forgettable unrecognized title in which Brendan Fraser and Michael Keaton both known for their careermaking roles of better movies appear to have settled for paychecks here. And the movie itself seems predictable the story of one egregiously disillusioned salesman Keaton partnered with the dubious optimist Fraser who warns him that he will soon realize what everyone has already concluded life is sht. The plot seems too utterly simplistic  that eventually Fraser is going to realize that sales is not a piece of cake and that his symbols of success are not fixed with any certainty. That as Fraser faces mounting failure sinking him deeper into acceptance of Keaton's character initial determination about the truth of life Keaton's character is revealed to be the strategic softee who has more in mind than scoring a few sales which seem to be effortless of him in the first place. But the beauty of this movie besides the performances of its stars that model the black comedy style of Swimming With Sharks is that viewers are presented with things that are not always as they seem. Just as culling of elephants is the motivation for the actions on screen the audiences too are being culled. This is certainly a title deserving of attention but remember things are not always what they seem.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Last Time seems at first glance like a forgettable unrecognized title in which Brendan Fraser and Michael Keaton both known for their careermaking roles of better movies appear to have settled for paychecks here. And the movie itself seems predictable the story of one egregiously disillusioned salesman Keaton partnered with the dubious optimist Fraser who warns him that he will soon realize what everyone has already concluded life is sht. The plot seems too utterly simplistic  that eventually Fraser is going to realize that sales is not a piece of cake and that his symbols of success are not fixed with any certainty. That as Fraser faces mounting failure sinking him deeper into acceptance of Keaton's character initial determination about the truth of life Keaton's character is revealed to be the strategic softee who has more in mind than scoring a few sales which seem to be effortless of him in the first place. But the beauty of this movie besides the performances of its stars that model the black comedy style of Swimming With Sharks is that viewers are presented with things that are not always as they seem. Just as culling of elephants is the motivation for the actions on screen the audiences too are being culled. This is certainly a title deserving of attention but remember things are not always what they seem.";

Now normally I like to do some research before I invest my time in a movie but we were out by the store and I like Michael Keaton and Brendan Fraser so I thought we were safe.I was sad to say very very wrong.We snuggled up and began the movie which is rated R. When the rating appeared at the beginning it mentioned pervasive language. Okay...that was an understatement. There was so much cussing particularly with the fword that it was totally distracting and basically just ridiculous.But this was Keaton and Fraser so we pressed on a bit. I think we got about 30 minutes into it and both agreed that this would be 'the last time' we just pick up a movie without reading a little about it. The dialogue the acting the story...the whole thing seemed to be a joke. I kept wondering...'how does a guy like Michael Keaton end up in a movie like this? Didn't he read the script? Or was he that desperate for work?' Anyway we stopped the madness and popped in a movie we own City of Angels. Okay...now that is a movie. What an incredible difference. Watching those movies backtoback made The Last Time seem like a high school production.I am very disappointed. But it turns out I only threw away thirty minutes and 4.74 so it's not the end of the world.My respect for these two actors again whom I generally like a lot has diminished significantly.I would strongly recommend that you stay away from this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the better part of a decade every British comedy or romance was hailed as 'The funniest film since Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Although there are many Brit films made in any year worth a look only one will truly be mass marketed and labelled as our best export. With Four Weddings' a distant memory anything remotely amusing or linked with horror is now wrongly compared to Shaun of the Dead or possibly Dog Soldiers. Poster quotes and lazy comparisons aside it's nice surprise that for a horror comedy Severance isn't actually half bad at all.The plot is nice and simple. A predominantly English sales division working for a multinational weapons corporation are sent on a team building exercise in Hungary only to find themselves stuck in a dense forest where they are being hunted by a merciless European gang.While Severance doesn't do anything particularly wrong there are of course a couple of faults. Any work environment has to have some pretty unlikeable characters so it's unavoidable to feel less sorry for some when the killings start. Toby Stephens is undoubtedly one of the finest actors around but he's yet to play a role in a successful film that really does him justice. Utterly capable and ever reliable Tim McInnerny of legendary Blackadder fame is amiable enough but it's Danny Dyer that gets most of the punchy oneliners as the partdruggie partchav cheeky chappie he's grown accustomed to playing. Thankfully cute Laura Harris hasn't been cast as the 'is she or isn't she the villain all along?' as it's really time she ditched that and moved on.The two distinct genres don't always make for a happy marriage and eventually the tone shifts over to deadpan. At least one line is stolen from elsewhere but there's a couple of shots that felt like homages rather than plagiarism. There's more than enough laughs and nasty moments to fill both audience preferences. The fast pace means Severance doesn't risk outstaying a welcome the special effects team did a great job and the camera work is suitably snappy. The only real risk is hype as anyone expecting anything other than a night out with a few grim moments and some genuine belly laughs will leave wondering what the fuss is about. Try to avoid thinking about where these guys took their inspiration from too as that wouldn't do anyone any good either. A solid 3 star experience that hopefully has some extra bits come homeentertainment time.".

Thankfully cute Laura Harris hasn't been cast as the 'is she or isn't she the villain all along?' as it's really time she ditched that and moved on.The two distinct genres don't always make for a happy marriage and eventually the tone shifts over to deadpan. At least one line is stolen from elsewhere but there's a couple of shots that felt like homages rather than plagiarism. There's more than enough laughs and nasty moments to fill both audience preferences. The fast pace means Severance doesn't risk outstaying a welcome the special effects team did a great job and the camera work is suitably snappy. The only real risk is hype as anyone expecting anything other than a night out with a few grim moments and some genuine belly laughs will leave wondering what the fuss is about. Try to avoid thinking about where these guys took their inspiration from too as that wouldn't do anyone any good either. A solid 3 star experience that hopefully has some extra bits come homeentertainment time.";

Suffice to say that the audience were busily quoting them and some of the better of the fantastic lines of dialogue after the screening. I feel people will be quoting some of these lines for years!On a more serious note there are some seriously scary scenes in the picture and even a couple of deaths of some of the more sympathetic characters that are actually quite moving.The cast is also perfect none of them put a foot wrong. Laura Harris completely kicks ass as the heroine.I sorta want to see a sequel but heaven knows where they'd go with it.Overall I loved the film  it's made by a writer and director who are genuine horror fans and it shows.

The idea behind the story is seemingly unique within cinema and therefore was interesting and kept the viewer gripped. The acting was of a high standard in particular Andy Nyman. I would say that Danny Dyer's role was wellplayed etc etc but I met him afterwards and there was also a QA session and he was rather obnoxious I didn't like him think Moff from Human Traffic... that wasn't method acting.As for the direction it is very commendable in fact the director Chris Smith held a QA after the film and he definitely knew what he was talking about as a big horror fangeek that was refreshing to see particularly since none of his other films have approached this genre with any gusto. The film is reminiscent of Calvaire the ordeal and you can definitely see this in the direction  he did say that Calvaire was one of his favourite films when I questioned him about the similarities.Overall the film is definitely worth your hard earned 6.

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film expecting a zombie movie for some reason but actually Severance is more like a British version of Eli Roth's successful 'Hostel' albeit with a bit more humour. There have been a few good British horror movies over the past few years including most notably the likes of Dog Soldiers Shaun of the Dead Wilderness and The Descent. I wouldn't say this one really lives up to the best of them but Severance is good comedic and bloodthirsty fun and there's certainly enough about it to ensure that the film stands tall as another feather in the cap of modern British horror. The film starts off in a truly nightmarish fashion we are introduced to a bunch of office workers going on a 'team building' trip in the middle of nowhere. The prospect of this alone is enough to make me not want to sleep tonight but it gets arguably worse for these guys it when it turns out that they're not the only ones in the middle of nowhere  a bunch of bloodthirsty maniacs turn out to be doing a bit of team building too! The film is pretty slow to start with the first half of the film merely seeing us being introduced to the cast of snivelling office workers. However once the violence starts the film really hots up as we get treated to a whole load of grisly sequences that see things such as decapitations and limbs being lopped off. The location is put to good use as our cast of characters finds themselves in the middle of an Eastern European country and director Christopher Smith does an excellent job of ensuring the tone of the film is always hopeless. The cast isn't anything to write home about although Danny Dyer who you might remember from the very decent British gangster flick The Business does a good job of holding the film together. The humour doesn't blend as well with the horror as the director obviously thought it would and this is where the film falls down for me. Severance would have been a better movie if the director could have made his mind up about exactly where he wanted to take it. As it happens Severance is an entertaining mix of gore and laughs but it's not at the cutting edge of modern horror.".

For one reason or another I never ended up watching it until now March 2013. And I must say the buzz was probably correct  while not among the best horror films out there it sure is well above average.The trick of this film is that it is a horror film but only in its feeling. Terrorists a bus flipping over guns and bombs... that is an action film. This should be an action comedy. But the style is definitely in the horror vein with the way certain things are presented particularly the bear trap. What makes a horror film a horror film? That question has been asked many times and I think this film definitely makes you wonder.Although many of the references were lost on me I now know from looking into the production that many of the scenes were evoking Kubrick 2001 Strangelove and Clockwork Orange and other notable directors. I love it. I love the subtlety of these homages... the Clockwork scene was clear to me but I also am probably most familiar with that Kubrick film although I have seen them all at least once.I would need to see this again to fully review it but my initial impression is that it is a great blend of action humor and horror. Well worth a look.".

Even before watching it I thought it was going be awful simply by the line in the TV advert As witty as Shaun of the Dead. OK so SotD was a good film and I think that Severance is jumping on the bandwagon a bit.The film spends around 30 minutes building up to any action. In this time the characters are not developed at all except for the fact that one of them is a drug addict That will appeal to the typical 15 rated cheap horror cinema goer and one of them is American which is irrelevant.We eventually see a number of the cast die by 'gruesome' means. The comedy in this film is not 'as witty as Shaun of the Dead' at all. In fact there is very little comedy in the entire film. Trying to put a leg in a fridge while pulling disgusted faces isn't really very witty at all.People seem to just settle for very mediocre films at the moment. Sure its mildly entertaining but its nothing new. Even the actionslasher scenes are pretty lame and become tiresome. And when the Romanian 'escorts' arrive for comic relish at the end of the film and it ends with the word 'foursome' it just completely leaves it on a down ending.To be honest I was bored throughout the film. Nothing led anywhere the action scenes were as dull as the characters.510".

Not only did it not meet my admittedly high expectations this movie also contains some of the sickest scenarios imaginable.The humor of a woman tied to a tree doused in gasoline and burnt with a flamethrower is simply beyond me. Having a guy's foot ripped off by a bear trap is something that doesn't get funnier if the trap keeps slipping and the guys' leg is mashed to pulp well actually it's severed ! right off leaving us with the admittedly mildly original scene of the protagonist taking off shoe and sock to place the severed foot into the bus' fridge. I honestly failed to see the irony of it all.Alluding to concentration camps the makeup of the final scenery with railroad tracks leading into an abandoned factory is reminiscent of large CCs and having the psychos whose actions have no purpose other than to scare and revolt the viewer  don't expect any explanation for why this carnage is unleashed upon the screen be rampant easternEuropean soldiers on a torture and killing spree renders the movie a sickening touch that really has no part in entertainment movies.I should have noticed that Severance was directed by the same pervert who brought us Creep. I sincerely believe that there are certain transgressions that shouldn't be made in cinema  especially with such a transparent intent of solely entertaining. What might be considered funny by a bunch of pubescent weeds is that the protagonist keeps his joints in receptacles originally intended for cigarettes and cigars. That's about the funniest this movie got. The actors themselves were charismatic but seeing them in a sick movie like this one really put me off them for a long time.".

The first half hour is pretty boring and filled with lame attempts at comedy but afterwards it actually gets pretty exciting. The tension is gradually built up and around halfway you're just totally sucked into this movie. This is mainly due to the characters who are all pretty likable to the standards of the genre at least. You actually give a damn who lives and who dies which is very rare is a slasher. The story also takes a lot of unexpected twists and turns it's a pretty cleverly written movie. Severance is by no means great cinema but it does seem to achieve whatever it wanted to achieve.

But once they reach their less than luxurious lodge out in the forest it becomes apparent they are not alone.....We open with a chase that results in a brutal murder all played out to the wonderful strains of The Small Faces singing Itchycoo park it's obvious from this moment that this is no ordinary horror comedy. Comedy as everyone knows is hugely subjective even more so when it involves horror some attempts have been roundly accepted such as parody supreme Shaun Of The Dead or nervous titillation in the Evil Dead series while others are so bad they don't need a mention here. Severance happily is as sharp with its humour as one of the knives used in the piece itself perfectly tuned into the modern world and the bizarreness of it all.What started out as a working script called P45 where Christopher Smith's film was to be about these yuppie types literally team building for a weekend where if they didn't pass the tests they lost their jobs escalated to a slasher with a wry satirical edge. The characters as the makers point out on the DVD are the perfect blend of the archetypal office workers. Each of them can readily be found in any Brirtish office on any given day. The ineffective leader who's wormed his way into the position the jocular wide boy the creep the babe attracting all the sexual attention and on it goes. Each character rich with British office traditions thrust together for one bubbling comedy stew.Enter the central theme of weapons making companies firmly under the microscope and Severance has much to say. As a promo video made by the managing director plays the irony is absolutely hilarious and sets the film up a treat. Even as the film gets bloody and it's certainly bloody at times the smiling assassin nature of the script continues to be bitingly funny. There's reams of clever jokes in the piece so many in fact that even now after my third viewing experience I'm still finding new stuff. So with that I would urge anyone who has only seen it the one time and been less than enamoured with the premise to try again and observe and listen without interruption. There's even self mocking of the genre it belongs in and this from the director of 2004s culter Creep. The cast are uniformly strong from Tim McInnerny's weasel team leader portrayal to Danny Dyer's with type drug taking cockernee boy all playing off each other with smart and mirth inducing results. A fine fine entry in the horror comedy pantheon one that just gets better and better with each and every viewing. 910".

But me and my boyfriend were still quoting funny lines and great scenes the following week!!  that speaks volumes for me.Severance is relentlessly engaging oscillating perfectly between horror and comedy. There was not a moment when I wasn't either sat on the edge of my seat or throwing my head back in laughter. As I said I am not a horror fan they often bore me with their ridiculousness. Boredom however did not figure at the point where I would ordinarily lose interest in a horror film Severance reengages its audience with its hilarity.Don't get me wrong this film is not void of the gore and violence that horror fans will expect it provides jumps in all the right places. But what Severance does is take horror to a level above and beyond the head of critics. Who can criticise a film that has already taken the mickey out of itself and of the genre in which it lies whilst also managing to leave you hanging on the edge of your seat?? Danny Dyer plays a fantastically lovable character and Laura Harris' acing is phenomenal as is th rest of the cast's.All in all this is the best film I've seen this year. I can't wait until its release.My advice don't let the comedy fool you into thinking you can relax if so you'll get a few shocks along the way!!".

That's why Christopher Smith's Severance is so groundbreaking it's not just here to make you laugh it also intends to give you the creeps. And I must say it succeeds.The film starts as if it were a normal British comedy a group of people working for a weapon factory go on holiday in Eastern Europe the country is never specified to improve their teamwork. Naturally the lodge they're supposed to live in sucks. Naturally the boss Richard Tim McInnerny has to go philosophical about the matter. And naturally that was just the beginning.When first told something is in the woods surrounding the lodge the team is skeptical. Steve Danny Dyer a likable if slightly geeky stoner even asks the informer Did you eat my hallucinatory mushrooms?. Soon enough though things get serious and blood starts flowing. There's a squad of war criminals hunting our heroes using ironically their factory's weapons to dismember victims so there's a political subtext to the film as well. We never find out who these psychos really are and what motives they may have but then again that's not an issue. As long as the massacre is compensated by outrageous surreal totally unpredictable gags everything's fine.Earlier on I said this film is different from others because of the balance between horror and comedy. That's true for the first 60 minutes there's nervewrecking suspense and some shocking gore but always followed by some kind of laugh. The last halfhour however is a complete gagfest when you thought the film couldn't become any crazier Christopher Smith pushes all the boundaries and exploits any kind of situation mostly involving Dyer and Laura Harris both at their best in possible starmaking roles to keep the audience riotously entertained when I saw Severance at the Locarno film festival people even applauded on top of laughing to exhaustion.So if you're looking for something that isn't the usual horror film I strongly recommend Severance. Also if you want to see a really hilarious movie you should watch Severance. The last line is arguably the best moviecloser since Some Like It Hot's final witticism. Trust me it will crack you up.".

Juliette Binoche is an absolute revelation as an actress. Watch her facial expressions change instantly as she responds to other people. She is marvelous. There is an incredibly funny dialogue between her and her French friend who lives in US played by an actress also very good whose last name i believe is Buttle. Many of the commentators seem to believe that this dialogue shows the two women to be stupid but I disagree. What the whole film slyly hints at is the stupidity of conventional sectarian ideologically driven psychoanalysis. These women in their innocence of ideology see thru the veil. As does Beatrice in her role as makeshift therapist. What makes her a wonderful therapist is her RESPONSIVENESS as indicated above to what is happening in the moment with each patient as an individual. Unhampered by rigid doctrine she gives each what they need not a load of ideology. I would love to see the actual script but haven't been able to find it.".

What makes her a wonderful therapist is her RESPONSIVENESS as indicated above to what is happening in the moment with each patient as an individual. Unhampered by rigid doctrine she gives each what they need not a load of ideology. I would love to see the actual script but haven't been able to find it.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Couch in New York the first American film by acclaimed Belgian director Chantal Akerman Dr. Henry Harriston William Hurt is a dour New York psychoanalyst who is close to exhaustion. He decides to place an ad in the Paris Herald Tribune offering to swap his New York apartment for a month. Henry ends up in the digs of a freespirited dancer from Paris Beatrice Saulnier Juliet Binoche and she takes over his swank New York penthouse. Obviously well to do Henry's apartment is spacious impeccably furnished and meticulously cared for while hers is messy bohemian and funky.In what Ms. Akerman describes as what Hollywood calls a double fish out of water film this film is something of a curiosity yet it's one of the best screwball romantic comedies I've seen. The premise is totally ludicrous of course and off the wall but that's what makes it so special. Of course I'm particularly open to films that pop the bubble of the psychiatric establishment.Apparently Henry forgets to tell his patients he is going away and they come knocking on Ms. Saulnier's door and calling for appointments hardly even noticing the change in doctors. Being a sweet and sympathetic soul and not wanting to turn people away she listens to their stories for an hour and they pay her money for her advice illegally of course. She learns quickly that all analysts have to say is yeees or hmmmm or what comes to mind now? and get paid big bucks. Of course patients have the right to remain silent and sometimes nothing comes to mind  they can sometimes spend an hour in total silence and must still pay for the privilege. Ms. Saulnier is an understanding person and a good listener and in quite a slap at the professionals achieves more success with Henry's patients not to mention his dog Edgar in one week than he apparently has in years.Beatrice decides to continue to pretend to be Dr. Harriston's assistant and studies up on her Freud. Meanwhile in Paris Henry must contend with Beatrice's aggressive boy friends messy rooms leaky plumbing and the hammering of a roof being repaired. Fed up with the problems in Paris he returns to New York to stay with an old friend in a down home part of Brooklyn. Conveniently for the plot the good doctor stops off at his office and finds Beatrice playing psychoanalyst and his patients miraculously improved. Finding Ms. Saulnier intriguing and attractive he goes along with her game pretending to be her patient. This sets off a process of mutual discovery and selfawareness that is quite predictable but nonetheless amusing and enlightening.This was my first Akerman film and while I realize it is totally unlike her others I really loved it and found both leads to be superb. Binoche never looked more alluring and Hurt is terrific in his role as the deadpan doctor. I don't know who's crazy the majority of critics who trashed it or me but I know for sure one of us is ready for the couch. I won't say any more about Couch in New York except that while it does unfold its magic at a very leisurely pace the rewards are there for the patient no pun intended. Since the ending left me with such a warm fuzzy feeling I'm thinking of calling Ms. Binoche and.well.on second thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "Undoubtedly we are talking about a film released twelve years ago so we can cut some slack here to the imprecisions and errors in the script but even though it tries to be a comedy I couldn't help to become completely baffled with the way the pace is conducted and forcibly led. There are too many obvious silly details that make me wonder if the director was trying to tease the spectator or simply was disregarding those for the sake of the time frame and the socalled comedy. William Hurt portrays a very stiff and iconic psychoanalyst and during the whole time he is meddled in ridiculous situations maybe because his own stiffness has those inevitable consequences. I never was convinced by his portray why he decides to go to Paris? why he comes back? why doesn't have the gull to tell Beatrice who really he is from point one? How come all of the sudden he falls in love with Beatrice? During the whole film you wonder if this renown expert is more novice than Beatrice who actually looks like performs at the couch better than him. I think that the role assigned to William Hurt was bad developed bad implemented and bad performed. Maybe not to put the blame on him. The end was pushed because there were no more stereotypic ideas to exploit or maybe the budget was short or maybe everybody had something better to do so it was better to kill the movie than keep on going. Anyway you end up completely bemused and wondering about what just happened. I wouldn't recommend this film if not for watching Juliette Binoche who is always a delightful gift for the eyes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Undoubtedly we are talking about a film released twelve years ago so we can cut some slack here to the imprecisions and errors in the script but even though it tries to be a comedy I couldn't help to become completely baffled with the way the pace is conducted and forcibly led. There are too many obvious silly details that make me wonder if the director was trying to tease the spectator or simply was disregarding those for the sake of the time frame and the socalled comedy. William Hurt portrays a very stiff and iconic psychoanalyst and during the whole time he is meddled in ridiculous situations maybe because his own stiffness has those inevitable consequences. I never was convinced by his portray why he decides to go to Paris? why he comes back? why doesn't have the gull to tell Beatrice who really he is from point one? How come all of the sudden he falls in love with Beatrice?

I guess she tired of simply saying it and decided to actually try it out. Unfortunately the result is not that great. The premise of the film is actually quite promising and suits the genre perfectly. A cold clinical psychoanalyst is overwhelmed by the neediness of his patients and decides to house swap. The person who answers his ad is a young dancer. She is all youth exuberance and mess. He is cold clean calculated. While he can't get comfortable in her apartment she gets all too comfortable in his when a patient mistakenly assumes she is the analyst's replacement she ends up rolling with it. The movie isn't the greatest there is some awkward editing that seems to be the result of scenes missing. There's also the fact that for a romantic comedy the comedy of the film never really soars. Binoche and Hurt do well enough with their characters but they don't have the sort of magic chemistry that could have made this film really work. Also perhaps the strangest bit of all for being the work of such an acclaimed director it seems curiously stripped of nearly all the traits that made Akerman Akerman. It feels like the kind of forgettable movie you would find flipping through the channels late at night. If it wasn't for the fact that this was an Akerman film and that the stars are very notable as well this would be a completely forgotten film one of dozens of rom coms that got pumped out by studios in the 90s. Pleasant enough to watch but very forgettable.".

I never knew she made this film and as one person mentioned if you live in low budget Belgium film country and you can make a movie with Binoche and Hurt who would not jump out of his chair.The story line is unbelievable but I don't care so was Matrix I. To say that Binoche can't act as I read somewhere on this forum is a great understatement. It would NOT have been better with Julia Roberts.Actually we could have been watching this sort of comedy at the theater. It's certainly low budget except for the wages of the stars 90  is filmed indoors at the same locations.I could not believe this was an Ackerman movie. She is very much known as a detailed dialogue women. Once in a while we see this happen but then it does not fit in this movie. This movie needs action swift editing etc. Remember Barefoot in the Park? That one worked for some reason this doesn't. Problem is I cannot put my finger on what it was that disturbed me not the actors not the story not the locations. I very personally think Ackerman had to give in to make this production she would have made a totally different film with disturbing dialogues but she was not allowed to do so.Conclusion I love all the work of Ackerman but she should never have done this one. A couch in New York needs more spark.No hard feelings Chantal.PS I have to share this with you. My husband walked in after 30 minutes and saw William Hurt in Binoche's flat. His one and only comment was You're watching a movie with Hurt in Paris? Yep he did recognize Hurt and Paris in one shot. I'm getting tired of attics and attic views. Paris has changed a bit. I'm sure this is again an American must.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ackerman director is one of our most respectable women directors in Belgium. I never knew she made this film and as one person mentioned if you live in low budget Belgium film country and you can make a movie with Binoche and Hurt who would not jump out of his chair.The story line is unbelievable but I don't care so was Matrix I. To say that Binoche can't act as I read somewhere on this forum is a great understatement. It would NOT have been better with Julia Roberts.Actually we could have been watching this sort of comedy at the theater. It's certainly low budget except for the wages of the stars 90  is filmed indoors at the same locations.I could not believe this was an Ackerman movie. She is very much known as a detailed dialogue women. Once in a while we see this happen but then it does not fit in this movie. This movie needs action swift editing etc. Remember Barefoot in the Park? That one worked for some reason this doesn't. Problem is I cannot put my finger on what it was that disturbed me not the actors not the story not the locations.
