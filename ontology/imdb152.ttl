I first saw it several years ago on network TV immediately liked it but also realized that a fair amount of critical flavor had been bleeped out of the movie due to editing it for television. So just recently I purchased the DVD version which gave me the opportunity to watch it in all its unedited glory.Kathleen Turner is awesome as mad housewife Beverly Sutphin where DO they get these names?. I can't think of a modern actress who has such a commanding presence on the screen as Kathleen Turner and here she uses it to full advantage. I don't know if it's her supreme confidence in the delivery of her lines or her captivating facial expressions or just the way she carries herself as a woman not to be trifled with but somehow she grabs you by the ears and doesn't let go.There is a goodly dose of carnage in the film including a particularly gory scene where a guy gets skewered in the men's room with a fireplace poker resulting in his liver being torn out. But in the capable hands of John Waters plus the presence of Kathleen Turner in the scene it all just seems so natural and perfectly hilarious. Here I couldn't help thinking about the great film Harold and Maude 1971 where Bud Cort's character fakes his own suicide various times throughout the film and by golly he made suicide actually seem FUNNY! You get the same reaction from Serial Mom where Beverly Sutphin's murders come across as being somewhat on the level of laughinducing college pranks.The cinematography is superb the costars Sam Waterston Mink Stole Ricki Lake Matthew Lillard Patricia Hearst Traci Lords et al are spoton well cast the pacing is excellent and the film wraps with a very satisfying denouement. Granted the film is not for the squeamish nor for those who are averse to John Waters. But for those who can deal with a whimsical horror film I would recommend seeing this  and get the DVD version if possible as the director's commentary by John Waters is worth the rental price. I actually purchased the DVD as I want this one in my permanent video library. I only wish they would make a sequel. Perhaps Serial Mom joins the PTA.".

It's certainly not to everyone's taste and if you can't handle high camp you definitely don't want to see this but if you like your films wild and wicked Serial Mom is a treat indeed! The film follows a slasher plot line but it's clear that director John Waters didn't want to merely make a slash flick. The film is a parody of life as a housewife the media and modern society in general with a heavy dosage of sick humour and a very unique mean streak running throughout. Serial Mom is the sort of film that puts a smile on your face and it follows the story of a not quite so normal American mother. While her fellow housewives are cooking dinner and cleaning the house Beverly R. Sutphin is out dispatching people that have got on hers and her family's nerves in a variety of nasty yet hilarious ways. Her kids think it's cool and her husband is duly worried...Kathleen Turner takes the lead role and does an excellent job of performing in a serious yet jokey way which does the film no end of favours on the parody front. She looks the part acts the part...and really I cant think of a better middleaged actress to take the lead in this film. The support cast which includes Matthew Lillard and Ricki Lake is good but it's the director that's the real star of the show. John Waters has made a name for himself by creating odd and twisted films and although I haven't seen a great deal of them Serial Mom is his best as far as I'm concerned. It's one of those films that constantly make you laugh providing you've got a sick sense of humour while poking fun at society and offending all the right people all at once! I love originality in movies and this really is one unique film. The nineties saw the release of lots of obscure social commentaries that were lost under films like Schindler's List and Fight Club and Serial Mom along with Francois Ozon's 'Sitcom' is one of the best 'under the radar' films of the decade. It's not a film that everyone will like but everyone should see it just in case!".

	schema:reviewBody "Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right in the cinema as well as in the theatre. We can I am sure all think of films which were intended to be gross but hilarious and ended up as simply gross. There are too many examples to list them all but high on my personal list of offenders in this regard must be The Sweetest Thing Beautiful Creatures and Drop Dead Gorgeous. On the other hand when black comedy succeeds the result can be superb. Two of my favourites are Kubrick's Dr Strangelove and Scorsese's King of Comedy both of which derive humour from serious subjects nuclear war and crime but do so with a brilliant satirical wit.John Waters's Serial Mom is not quite in the same class as those two films but is one of the better black comedies of recent years. The main character is Beverley Sutphin a middleaged middleclass Middle American housewife. Beverley happily married to dentist Eugene with two teenage children Chip and Misty lives in an affluent idyllic suburb which looks as though it has been taken from a fifties sitcom. Like most of Waters's films this one is set in his home town of Baltimore. There is only one thing which disturbs the peace and tranquillity of the area. Beverley combines her role as a housewife and mother with a parttime career as a serial killer. Her first victim is Paul Stubbins a teacher who makes some unkind remarks about her son at a PTA meeting and she progresses to her daughter's unfaithful boyfriend a couple who are rude about Eugene's dental practice and various people who commit minor social gaffes such as failing to rewind rented video tapes the film predates the coming of DVD failing to recycle their garbage and wearing white shoes after Labor day. This last is apparently regarded as a major fashion crime in America. Eventually she is arrested and put on trial.Waters has the reputation of being a director to whom the notion of good taste is quite alien and with a plot like this Serial Mom could have ended up as nothing more than horribly tasteless garbage. It is of course horribly tasteless and not a film to see if you are at all squeamish Waters does not spare us sight of plenty of blood and gore but is saved from ending up as garbage by two things. The first is an often very witty script displaying a refreshingly cynical sense of humour which includes some great lines such as He killed people mom We all have our bad days. and Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross did he? the local priest is preaching a prodeath penalty sermon.The second is Kathleen Turner's manically overthetop performance as Beverley alternating between a model of bourgeois domestic virtue and a bloodthirsty maniac and playing both with equal relish. My favourite parts were the courtroom scene where Beverley conducts her own defence with great brilliance and the scenes where she makes obscene phone calls to her neighbour Dottie a woman who can be shocked by a phrase as seemingly innocuous as Are those pussy willows? Turner is an actress who has somewhat disappeared from view in recent years but in the eighties and nineties she was one of Hollywood's best known leading ladies and gave some excellent performances in films like the neonoir thriller Body Heat and The War of the Roses another very good black comedy.Like most good black comedies Serial Mom has some serious points to make. The mores of suburbia have been fair game for satirists ever since the first suburbs were built and here Waters is sending up the culture of middleclass conformity which all too often attaches to such places. Beverley is far from being the only allAmerican soccer mom who looks with horrified disfavour on her neighbours' minor deviations from accepted norms all that distinguishes her from millions of others is the extreme lengths to which she will go to punish such deviations. The satire however is not just aimed at Beverley but also at her victims some of whom are such obnoxious individuals that it is impossible to have any sympathy for them despite their horrific fates. There is one grotesque scene where Emma Lou Jensen she who fails to rewind her videos sings loudly and tunelessly along to Tomorrow from the musical Annie while allowing her dog to lick her feet all over suggesting she is to say the least a somewhat strange person. Stubbins who suggests that Chip is in need of therapy because of his love of horror films is the sort of arrogant selfimportant teacher who thinks that he is paid not just to teach maths but also to control every aspect of his students' lives down to their taste in films.Serial Mom may not be the best cinematic satire on suburbia of recent years that must be Sam Mendes's American Beauty but it is for all its lapses of taste a witty and entertaining black comedy. 810".

There are too many examples to list them all but high on my personal list of offenders in this regard must be The Sweetest Thing Beautiful Creatures and Drop Dead Gorgeous. On the other hand when black comedy succeeds the result can be superb. Two of my favourites are Kubrick's Dr Strangelove and Scorsese's King of Comedy both of which derive humour from serious subjects nuclear war and crime but do so with a brilliant satirical wit.John Waters's Serial Mom is not quite in the same class as those two films but is one of the better black comedies of recent years. The main character is Beverley Sutphin a middleaged middleclass Middle American housewife. Beverley happily married to dentist Eugene with two teenage children Chip and Misty lives in an affluent idyllic suburb which looks as though it has been taken from a fifties sitcom. Like most of Waters's films this one is set in his home town of Baltimore. There is only one thing which disturbs the peace and tranquillity of the area. Beverley combines her role as a housewife and mother with a parttime career as a serial killer. Her first victim is Paul Stubbins a teacher who makes some unkind remarks about her son at a PTA meeting and she progresses to her daughter's unfaithful boyfriend a couple who are rude about Eugene's dental practice and various people who commit minor social gaffes such as failing to rewind rented video tapes the film predates the coming of DVD failing to recycle their garbage and wearing white shoes after Labor day. This last is apparently regarded as a major fashion crime in America. Eventually she is arrested and put on trial.Waters has the reputation of being a director to whom the notion of good taste is quite alien and with a plot like this Serial Mom could have ended up as nothing more than horribly tasteless garbage. It is of course horribly tasteless and not a film to see if you are at all squeamish Waters does not spare us sight of plenty of blood and gore but is saved from ending up as garbage by two things. The first is an often very witty script displaying a refreshingly cynical sense of humour which includes some great lines such as He killed people mom We all have our bad days. and Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross did he? the local priest is preaching a prodeath penalty sermon.The second is Kathleen Turner's manically overthetop performance as Beverley alternating between a model of bourgeois domestic virtue and a bloodthirsty maniac and playing both with equal relish. My favourite parts were the courtroom scene where Beverley conducts her own defence with great brilliance and the scenes where she makes obscene phone calls to her neighbour Dottie a woman who can be shocked by a phrase as seemingly innocuous as Are those pussy willows? Turner is an actress who has somewhat disappeared from view in recent years but in the eighties and nineties she was one of Hollywood's best known leading ladies and gave some excellent performances in films like the neonoir thriller Body Heat and The War of the Roses another very good black comedy.Like most good black comedies Serial Mom has some serious points to make. The mores of suburbia have been fair game for satirists ever since the first suburbs were built and here Waters is sending up the culture of middleclass conformity which all too often attaches to such places. Beverley is far from being the only allAmerican soccer mom who looks with horrified disfavour on her neighbours' minor deviations from accepted norms all that distinguishes her from millions of others is the extreme lengths to which she will go to punish such deviations. The satire however is not just aimed at Beverley but also at her victims some of whom are such obnoxious individuals that it is impossible to have any sympathy for them despite their horrific fates. There is one grotesque scene where Emma Lou Jensen she who fails to rewind her videos sings loudly and tunelessly along to Tomorrow from the musical Annie while allowing her dog to lick her feet all over suggesting she is to say the least a somewhat strange person. Stubbins who suggests that Chip is in need of therapy because of his love of horror films is the sort of arrogant selfimportant teacher who thinks that he is paid not just to teach maths but also to control every aspect of his students' lives down to their taste in films.Serial Mom may not be the best cinematic satire on suburbia of recent years that must be Sam Mendes's American Beauty but it is for all its lapses of taste a witty and entertaining black comedy. 810";

The various strategems she uses to distract witnesses at her trial are delivered with the precision of a knife and she does more acting in the defendant's chair than most actors manage in a typical Hollywood flick today. I gave it a 7 rather than something higher because the action around her is okay but delivered more as a setup for her various exercises in family values and the plot itself doesn't seem driven by anything other than her proclivities for a particular problem solving approach. But it is a very entertaining film though I wouldn't watch it with a kid under the age of 15 however jaded by the media today's youths may seem to be.".

He's nowhere near as creative as the Coen brothers and not as uproariously funny as the Farrelly brothers but we're almost in a state of awe watching the movie smiling but wondering if we should be when an overlysweet caring mother beats a woman to death with a leg of lamb. Thing is it never seems bad  it's not even morally reprehensible the way Waters shows it. It's like when you've just watched a gag in extremely poor taste done pleasantly with such giddy amusement that you just shake your head and say That is just wrong!Kathleen Turner plays the mother who underneath her thin veil of perfect mother normalcy has a latent desire to murder those who offend her sensibilities. Sam Waterston plays her husband a goodnatured dentist who stands by his wife as long as he can. It's an interesting pairing of Sam Waterston and Kathleen Turner two actors blessed with raspy gasping voices. Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard play the two's children. Lake the daughter in search of a boyfriend is the first to suspect her mother's dark side and Lillard the son with a love for classic gore horror movies is interested when he's told his mother may be a killer.It's sort of like a David Lynch movie if you were to focus only on the gee whiz part of America and replace all of Lynch's darkness with campy situations like a punk rock band called Camel Lips.A lot of the dialogue and the satirical jabs were pretty obvious but I wasn't quite sure whether this was just unsubtle comedy or if the joke was in how obvious some of the stuff was I made a killing!.The acting by Turner reminded me of Annette Bening's in American Beauty but demented instead of onenote. All the leads are fine but the big chuckles come from the supporting players like Mink Stole as poor Dottie Hinkle the victim of a crank caller. Or Patricia Hearst as a juror who's not in tune with what Turner sees as a fashion faux pas.I had a big smile plastered on my face for about the first halfhour which is the best part of the movie and while the last halfhour loses some steam it's still a joy to watch Turner and especially Mink Stole. It's not really a criticism though  most movies start with a great premise and have trouble resolving it. It's not so much that there's no satisfying resolution it's that some of the more shocking moments come in the beginning and middle of the film.The best way I can think to describe the movie is that it exists in a realistic place populated by unrealistic characters. It's a satirical farcical black comedy that despite its gruesome murders is perpetually cheery and without a trace of meanspiritedness. Any modern movie that still uses wipes for editing... With no pun intended well maybe some it's a movie definition of queer.I think I'll have to go look for CryBaby and Hairspray now. And if I can find it and be able to stomach it I probably owe it to myself to see Pink Flamingos which may help me understand the filth label Waters is often given. This movie isn't filthy or vile I had a good time and it's a nice break to see a movie as demented as this and not feel as if you were just subjected to watching a director stomp on someone already on the ground.".

Kathleen Turner plays a sweet and perfect suburbia mom who suddenly decides to kill the people who don't do the right thing just like bother her kids not rewinding the rented videos or wearing white shoes after Labour Day. But she's not a complex serial killer she goes and kill in the most sordid and hilarious way. KT's performance is great and funny and the rest of the cast is good.Rated 8 out of 10. Hey don't miss it!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a hardcore John Waters fan but this is not my favorite film of his. I can't really think of anything I would want to change about it however other than maybe setting it in the 50's or 60's so Van Smith could have worked his costume magic. I personally consider this film and Pecker to be his weakest. However even my least favorite Waters film beats most movies. If another director say Robert Zemeckis or someone had directed this then based on the subject matter I probably wouldn't have had any interest in seeing it. But hey any movie containing the credits Written and Directed by John Waters in this case the credit is superimposed over an image of a pulverized fly who has just been swatted by the title character...he always picks the best shots for his credit doesn't he? well I'm there no matter what the premise is. Waters' films often center on 'troubled' but lovable female characters and this one is no exception. Kathleen Turner does a great job portraying Beverly Sutphin a June Cleaveresque devoted happy homemaker who doesn't even allow gum in her house but has a short fuse and keeps a secret scrapbook I wonder if it was from Waters personal collection of clippings about serial killers.  We don't know how long she's been killing but the first half of the film follows a week in her life and the various neighbors and acquaintances she dispatches simply because they pi her off. Ever momentarily had an urge to kill someone when they stole a parking spot from you badmouthed a member of your family or committed an obvious fashion violation? We don't act on it well I don't anyway maybe some of you have and I just don't know about it but Serial Mom sure does.Again only Waters could have pulled this movie and subject matter off. If you're a Waters devotee then you are well aware that criminal behavior trials and serial killers are subjects near and dear to his heartthis is a man who is a selfconfessed trial groupie.  With any other filmmaker it could have been boring. Many probably would have been extremely offended by a movie about a lovable serial killer played for laughs especially those who knew the victim of a violent crime but the tone of the movie is so light and overthetop that only people with no sense of humor could think it might condone murder. Who else but Waters could think of a victim being bludgeoned to death  with a  slab of pork chop because she made the mistake of not rewinding a movie before she returns it to the video store while watching a videotape of Annie? This is not the funniest Waters movie I've seen but it has its moments. Among the funniest are the scenes where Beverly torments her neighbor Mink Stole with hilariously obscene phone calls to drive her over the edge. Also very amusing are scenes where Beverly's whitebread manner oh honey the only serial I know anything about is Rice Krispies! contrasts with the horrified stares of her family and neighbors. Turner is best in the moments when she goes from a harmless Donna Reed to Charles Manson within seconds when someone makes the mistake of annoying her just watch her face. Waters fans should also watch for cameos small roles by Alan Wendel Traci Lords Susan Lowe Mary Vivian Pearce I only recognized her from her distinctive voice and though he doesn't appear in the credits Waters manages to work in Don Knotts.This is one of the few Waters films that I rent from time to time rather than own but it's still lots of fun. I'll take one of Waters less memorable films over a teen slasher flick or anything starring JeanClaude Van Damme any day of the week.".

Did I mention she was also a crazy and vengeful woman hellbent on serial killers and killing for vengeful purposes?  That's right she's a serial kiler.Beverly will do anything for her family even if it means murdering someone. When someone rubs her the wrong way she immediately plots revenge on them by killing them.  Even if its for the smallest infraction to her it often results in the brutal slaying of someone who was just brutally honest. There's her son Chip's math teacher Mr. Stubbins who says that Chip needs more focus due to his high interest in horror and gore films Chip's the assistant manager of a video store Misty's exboyfriend Carl who stood her up Betty and Ralph Sterner for no apparent reason Scotty Chip's friend who just aggravated Beverly LuAnn Hodges who forgot to rewind the video tape and Juror 8 who wore white shoes after Labor Day.sorry this may be a spoiler! not to mention the obscene prank calls to neighbor Dottie Hinkle they were so bad I won't even say them here!.Ok this is just a strange movie and when I first saw it two summers ago I was shocked by it.  Not only was it outrageously rediculous it was almost sickening what this woman would do for revenge.  I watched it again last night with my brother who happens to LOVE this movie and my best friend who had never seen it but for some reason I was enjoying it scary thought on my part since I thought Hairspray was strange and Crybaby was almost unwatchable.  Kathleen Turner puts on an almost memorable performance for this role I'm wondering how many cartons of Camel cigarettes she smoked prior to making this film because her voice is SO HUSKY now! as the murderous mother.  How old were Misty and Chip supposed to be?  I knew that Lake and Lillard were both 24 at the time this movie was released but was Chip only supposed to be in high school?  Matthew Lillard certainly looked young enough to be in high school and we noticed it.  What a stretch for Sam Waterston playing this gullible husband.  How much did they pay him to do this coming from an actor on Law and Order?!  Whoah that's guts.My favorite scenes from this movie are The prank call scene between Beverly and Dottie the Ted Bundy Tape oh my god I cracked up watching this! the part where Beverly kills LuAnn Hodges to the tune of Tomorrow from Annie we were crying during this part it was so funny the video store scene where Hodges brings in the video without rewinding it and Chip informs her of the 1 charge for not rewinding and when he asks her why she informs him I didn't FEEL like rewinding!  My brother particularly enjoyed this line because he works in a video store and they don't charge for not rewinding! and the serial mom scenes when Beverly acts out her revenge.  I LOVED Matthew Lillard in this film he is so funny and talented and this was a great start for him as he has made some memorable performances!This was an unusual movie and may be too strange for those who don't appreciate campy farce.  John Waters has done it again in typical John Waters fashion and for some reason this film works. I couldn't begin to tell you how it works but it does.  This may take two watchings to actually enjoy it but its not bad just strange.  This acting is decent and this film is a real scream at times.  I recommend this film to any John Waters fan as it is one of his own creations.  Don't do anything to make Beverly Sutphin mad you'll pay for it later!".

I LOVED Matthew Lillard in this film he is so funny and talented and this was a great start for him as he has made some memorable performances!This was an unusual movie and may be too strange for those who don't appreciate campy farce.  John Waters has done it again in typical John Waters fashion and for some reason this film works. I couldn't begin to tell you how it works but it does.  This may take two watchings to actually enjoy it but its not bad just strange.  This acting is decent and this film is a real scream at times.  I recommend this film to any John Waters fan as it is one of his own creations.  Don't do anything to make Beverly Sutphin mad you'll pay for it later!";

Wanting to make their illicit love eternal they feel compelled to make ritualistic human sacrifices to Satan. The film aided by an excellent Jerry Goldsmith score manages to create an unsettling and more and more threatening atmosphere as the true nature of these two becomes clearer and a journalist played by Alan Alda gets drawn into their web. His wife played by Jacqueline Bisset sees the imminent danger in nightmares. These dream sequences that gradually unveil the shocking truth are extremely well filmed and the music enhances the emotional impact even further. This one is a real chiller with some very frightening moments and a very surprising end. Its many disturbing images will haunt you for quite some time. It proves that elegant filmmaking becomes the horror genre very well. I'd love to see The Mephisto Waltz released on DVD!".

	schema:reviewBody "Too bad this neglected horror film got lost in the wake of the similarly themed Rosemany's Baby. Modestly successful journalist Alan Alda suddenly becomes a successful concert pianist following a chance meeting with piano virtuoso Duncan Ely Curt Jergens and his darkly seductive daughter Roxanne Barbara Parkins. His growing involvement with the wealthy family and their strange friends eventually comes between Alda and his loving wife Paula Jackie Bissett. As sinister events unravel Paula is drawn deeper into a web of diabolic happenings until the threads come together in a surprising and oddly gratifying climax.The script is tight and wellthought out with the exception of Dillman's role as Roxanne's exhusband. After all if the diabolists are so sexually compelling how could he divorce her. And though director Paul Wendkos occasionally goes overboard with the camera tricks the scenes are stylishly done especially the banquet with its snatches of pretentious banter and the New Years party with its erotic grotesqueries bound to end in an orgy. And underneath it all lies an undercurrent of evil even during the brightest splashes of sunlight.Though Alda gets star billing it's actually Bissett's movie which she carries off in finely shaded fashion. Her scenes with the ominously silent Roxanne just count Parkins' few lines amount to an exquisite model of civilized contempt minus the fisticuffs. Alda too shines as he acts out Ely's imperious manner at just the right moments proving in those preMASH days that he was more than the humorously caustic Hawkeye Pierce.As good as the movie is I can't help wondering if it might have been even better had the mystery not been exposed as early as it is. Suppose the script had skipped the transference ritual and simply had Alda take on Ely's characteristics without explanation such that the audience would have to ponder what's going on instead of having it handed to them. There may have been good reasons for not taking this mystery route but at least it's worth considering.Still and all Waltz remains a fine example of movie horror done in both color and sunny surroundings and with a lot of style and conviction. Too bad it's slipped into movieland's version of yesteryear oblivion. It deserves better. And if nothing else the script raises the scary question of whether dogs really are man's woman's best friend.".

How many times has he had to do this before? How this operation actually plays out on the screen isn't all that impressive though the man's daughter played by Barbara Parkins is as her body is that of his daughter but it's possessed by the soul of his dead wife. Needless to say Parkins is perfect for the part and that this is essential viewing for Parkins fans. The old man now gets to be the husband of Alda's beautiful wife played by Bisset in a merely temporary arrangement as she's more an obstacle though Alda's new persona has a more supercharged sex drive than the old one and relishes her much more than the old one ever did. And Bisset falls in love with the new incarnation setting up a nasty showdown with Parkins in a tidy little conclusion where the evil mother's spirit goes from one beautiful body to another. Between the sex and the search for young bodies and the bizarre satanic rituals and a weird New Year's Eve party and lots of psychedelia trippy camera work this even manages to surpass Rosemary's Baby in scope and reach though not so much in the dark underpinnings of the story under the direction of the underrated Paul Wendkos.".

Myles has the libido of a eunuch with the personality ambition and fidelity to match.  When Ely possesses his body the relationship with Paula becomes more physical and exciting. Paula prefers Ely to Myles who is quickly forgotten.  Paula's only adversary is the daughterwife Roxanne whose body she gladly accepts.  Ely and Paula deserve each other.".

The story plagiarizes the storyline of Rosemary's Baby showing a community that worships the devil.

For example Abby Clarkson Pamelyn Ferdin has a mysterious disease and dies and is forgotten in the rest of the story. Based on the last scenes when Paula switches her soul with Roxanne's was the desire of Paula for Myles so intense that she decides to live with Myles having the soul of the man who traded the life of their daughter per a successful life? However The Mephisto Waltz has a good atmosphere of horror and together with the astonishing beauty of Jacqueline Bisset are the best attractions in this confused movie.

We can judge a horror film in addition to its style by its ability to actually frighten. THE MEPHISTO WALTZ does well on this count.The film is about a couple who is coerced into the household of rich socialiteSatanists led by Duncan Ely who is played by Curt Jurgens who is pretty good here. What follows is a deadly game of catandmouse between the converted and unconverted to Ely's sect. It is pretty wellwritten and shot with genuine suspense and a deceptively simple use of oblique angles and soft focus to create a nightmarish atmosphere. The problem with the film is that it is too long and domestic sequences are not poignant enough to be interesting despite the strange Alda performance.However there are scary sequences of fantasy vs. reality and terrorbased ideas such as Jaquelin Bisset's realization that her dreams are reality and the pure horror of the dog attack scene. Initially director Paul Wendkos's inserts seem too jarring but in being jarring they make the action more threatening.I didn't really like the title sequence because it gives away too many of the nice shots we should be surprised or thrilled by later in the film. One thing that definitely adds to the suspense of the film is Jerry Goldsmith's score it rivals Herrman's PSYCHO score for violinfueled fullblooded accompaniment to a horror film.Overall despite some problems of character development and loose ends THE MEPHISTO WALTZ is a frightening film and a devious twist on a concept used in such other films as THE SEVENTH VICTIM and ROSEMARY'S BABY this one is a distinctive experience in the bizarre.

Rosemary's Baby was in truth a film about paranoia with the trappings of devil worship the engine that made it run. It was also blessed with an excellent cast and what was clearly a healthy budget for the time. In contrast Mephisto Waltz concerns the ruthless desire for immortality with a dollop of devil worship to make it possible. Therefore I think it unfair to compare the two. Finally while I've never been an Alda fan his character was required to be colorless and malleable. Had his character been a strong one he'd surely have intuited what was happening and never have allowed himself to be overtaken. Considering the decade in which the film was made and a real dearth of truly good 70s chillers I don't think Mephisto fared quite so poorly. I too read the book. As with most bookstofilm a good deal is lost.

	schema:reviewBody "The first indication that this is going to be a science fictionfantasy film is the fact that Alda is married to Bisset!  Doubtful.....  They play a relatively happy couple who become embroiled into the lives of an eccentric concert pianist Jurgens and his rather creepy daughter Parkins.  As Alda continues to find himself in the world of the very rich and very indulgent Jurgens Bisset realizes that something is very wrong.  It seems that Jurgens wants to with a little help from Satan put his soul into Alda's body.  It is emphasized that it's due to his incredible piano hands not for any other esoteric things that Alda has to offer......though truthfully this is probably about the best Alda ever looked.  Though Alda gets top billing this is really Bisset's story as she tries to navigate the world of the devil cult before they can set their sights on her daughter who is next on the list of conquests.  These transformations are punctuated by the appearance of a dab of Wisk detergent on the receiver's forehead. Oddly no one in the film seems to particularly want to be Bisset who is one of the most glorious women ever to be seen on film even if here her hair is a bit flyaway and  she wears little makeup.  The film has a sort of soupedup TV movie quality to it no doubt due to the producer Quinn Martin who created so many memorable 1960's and 1970's TV series.  It's just a retread of the more popular and better done Rosemary's Baby.  Here the director doesn't take the time to make the coven of worshippers memorable even though they are played by familiar character actors in most cases and they are hardly utilized at all.  It's difficult to work up much familial concern for Alda Bisset and their daughter Ferdin since they are hardly ever seen together.  Ferdin after one initial glimpse is mostly just referred to until later in the movie.  Alda gives a very sedate performance for the most part.  He seems horribly miscast.  Bisset does pretty well until the ridiculous ending throws the movie off it's track. Parkins is good as the icily evil daughter.  She and Jurgens share a memorably disturbing kiss.  Widdoes tries to bring dimension to the standard best friend role.  Dillman oddly billed as Brad does a decent enough job as Parkins' former husband.  Jerry Goldsmith provides a nervejarring score which is sometimes a bit too over the top for it's own good.  It's fun to watch in a kitschy way.  Check out those main titles!  Moss Mabry has some fun with the costuming at times notably at a risque costume ball.  There's also a convincingly nasty little dog that Bisset has to contend with.  All in all an enjoyable enough film for a mild shock or two and some creeps but by no means is it a great film.".

However he still has extraordinary musical talent and this is something that has not escaped the notice of a dying pianist named Duncan Ely Curt Jurgens. Ely suggests an interview with Clarkson and the latter flattered is only too keen to oblige. But the reality of the matter is that Ely is actually a dedicated Satanist who plans to use occult magic to switch bodies with Clarkson when his inevitable death from leukaemia eventually occurs. As anticipated Ely soon passes away but Myles' wife Paula Jacqueline Bisset quickly notices strange and inexplicable character changes in her husband. He is more aggressive and perverted in bed oddly colder and crueller towards her and full of renewed vigour towards his musical compositions. He also seems rather taken with Ely's daughter Roxanne Barbara Parkins making Paula feeling less and less wanted. Paula gradually pieces together the mystery with a little help from Ely's exsoninlaw Bill Bradford Dillman. She discovers the history of Ely's satanic practices and also learns that Ely had an incestuous relationship with his daughter  a relationship he plans to renew now that he has taken over her husband's body. But Paula isn't prepared to accept defeat without a fight and goes to extraordinary lengths to have her twisted revenge..The Mephisto Waltz has moments that are effectively eerie such as a few shuddersome dream segments and a memorable sequence involving a masked ball but more often than not it is rather predictable. The openended climax is also rather heavyhanded. I usually like movies with unusual and thoughtprovoking endings but this one just seemed excessively hokey. The whole concept of Paula summoning the Devil to help her get her own back against Roxanne  by BECOMING Roxanne !!  spoils the film for me. Paula is the one character with whom we can sympathise throughout the film but at the end she fights evil with evil and this strips away any audience appeal her character might bear. Jerry Goldsmith provides a suitably creepy music score and the flashy cinematography of William W. Spencer generates occasional suspense but on the whole The Mephisto Waltz narrowly misses the mark. While some will enjoy its dark playfulness and interpretable ending others  like myself  will find it frustratingly underdeveloped.".

Happy ending.This teaches usThat the mind and soul are nothing the body is everything well it is an American story That beauty literally is only skin deep that love is only as deep as your skin that adults are willing to sell their souls instantly to get mortal happiness that Satan can evict your soul any time he wants and replace it with someone elses even without your permission and that God won't interfere as he isn't even mentioned in the movie.Not good lessons for nine and tenyearold kids to watch as Alda and his wife are smooching on the way to bed at the end of the movie.How did they get away with this movie on t.v. at a time when kids were watching?  Were they aware of the themes and how sick the message was?People talk about how sick t.v. is today.  Gotta tell you folks things like this outdo any number of shows that use the word penis.   The movie is wellmade creepy with one of the most effective and believable appearances of The Evil One  in any movie I have ever seen because he doesn't appear with milliondollar special effects he is simply there a strangely convincing entity in the shadows waiting to do his business with stupid humans when summoned and leave.This would have been a good Rrated movie but it was entirely inappropriate for children stupid for parents to let them watch and I would definitely not let impressionable children watch it.  It makes the statement that God is out to lunch and happiness can be obtained only by selling your soul before it is ripped out of you.Seven out of ten stars because of production not content.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mephisto Waltz could have been a rather interesting and chilling film along similar lines to Rosemary's Baby. Unfortunately the film is simply a boring and not at all scary horror by numbers.  Just add The Devil to a few vague plot ideas and mix seems to be the way that it was created.Once the main premise has been set  a famous pianist Jurgens as Ely wants to live on after death in the body of a suitably matched person played by Alan Alda  and the diabolical in several senses of the word act has been carried out the plot chugs along with nowhere to go.  Luckily the exhusband of Ely's daughter appears with details of their eerie past to shove the film towards its conclusion.  Unfortunately the chain of events that unfolds is unconvincing to say the least and the ending makes absolutely no sense  nobody is in their right body or mind by the end.Spoiler!If Bissett can suss that Alda is possessed by Ely don't you think Ely might work out what has happened to his daughter?The acting is pretty poor apart from Alan Alda who is spectacularly poor. I think he's even worse than the dog.  Also it's fairly easy to guess the next person to die at each stage.Finally I was quite surprised that the mike boom didn't get its own credit  it was in the film more than most of the principal actors!".

Unfortunately the film is simply a boring and not at all scary horror by numbers.  Just add The Devil to a few vague plot ideas and mix seems to be the way that it was created.Once the main premise has been set  a famous pianist Jurgens as Ely wants to live on after death in the body of a suitably matched person played by Alan Alda  and the diabolical in several senses of the word act has been carried out the plot chugs along with nowhere to go.  Luckily the exhusband of Ely's daughter appears with details of their eerie past to shove the film towards its conclusion.  Unfortunately the chain of events that unfolds is unconvincing to say the least and the ending makes absolutely no sense  nobody is in their right body or mind by the end.Spoiler!If Bissett can suss that Alda is possessed by Ely don't you think Ely might work out what has happened to his daughter?The acting is pretty poor apart from Alan Alda who is spectacularly poor. I think he's even worse than the dog.  Also it's fairly easy to guess the next person to die at each stage.Finally I was quite surprised that the mike boom didn't get its own credit  it was in the film more than most of the principal actors!";

One the audience needs to keep in mind...Because once this detail is noticed Ely does a complete one eighty and along with his daughter Roxanne Barbara Parkins proceeds to woo Myles with dinners presents offers of friendship. And of course free use of his piano.Myles is swept up. Overwhelmed.Completely lost in their glamorous thrall.His wife Paula Jacqueline Bisset is suspicious and has every right to be. There's something not quite right about this couple.And as the plot progresses we learn what it is.And when we do we're not really all that shocked.Is it any surprise that Ely and Roxanne have been having an incestous affair?Is it any surprise that they're Satanists?Is it any surprise that Myles has been seduced completely?The story really is terrific.With an ending that's as disturbing as Paula's insane love for her husband which causes her to overlook the fact that he murdered their daughter as part of a deal with Satan and Ely.All of this the novel conveys brilliantly.The problem is the movie doesn't at all.Not only does fail to onvey Paula's enamourment with Myles it also grossly miscasts the characters. Paula's obsession with Miles is never conveyed well in the script.Roxanne a femme fatale in the novel has been reduced here to a weak trembling waiffe. And Alan Alda is a good actor. He's just not good for this. He has no sex appeal making it ridiculous that women like Paula and Roxanne are getting into a cat fight over him.It's a little bit like them getting into a cat fight over Woody Allen... only worse With Woody Allen it's hysterical with Alan Alda it's just plain stupid.".

	schema:headline " An underappreciated gem with one of the rarest bold endings for a studio horror film";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on Fred Mustard Stewart's novel of the same name and directed by Paul Wendkos THE MEPHISTO WALTZ was an underappreciated early 70s gem that got lost into the shadow of other greater  renowned masterpieces of the same era. By the time Twentieth Century Fox gave it a theatrical release under the Quinn Martin Production the audience already seen Roman Polanski's ROSEMARY'S BABY 1968 and mostly because of both the movies shared a familiar theme in the story that set around a satanic cult ran by a large group of high society people THE MEPHISTO WALTZ criminally received negative responses from the critics  the moviegoers for being just another Rosemary's Babywannabe. But other than having the devil worshipers into the story this movie actually delivers quite a different  superbly twisted tale of its own. This time the devil offers a different deal for his followers than physically invading the world in a human form i.e. Rosemary's Baby or THE OMEN. Although it wasn't as flawless as those popular horror classics were but still Mephisto Waltz was like many other Bava inspired late 60s  early 70s horror movies that's strikingly colorful yet able to make the atmosphere effectively work as the story progress frame by frame. There was this weird New Year's Eve party at the earlier phase of the movie where someone was walking around with a dog with an eerily accurate and realistic human head mask of William Shatner that later worn by Michael Myers in the original John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN 1978 info source IMDb trivia. And not only that the bizarre rituals and some psychedelic visuals at the nightmare sequences with chilling scores done by Jerry Goldsmith made it a fantastic experience that may remind you of some Fulci  Argento classics as well. Like I said already it wasn't entirely flawlessAlan Alda's performance was criticized as at times he indeed kind of felt like 'not so quite in there' mode in compare to admirable performances coming from the other end. Jacqueline Bisset on the lead carried the story as beautifully as she looked throughout the whole movie. Her stunning gorgeous looks  the way she smartly portrayed the character made me think of she could be a great Bond girl for that memorable 007 era when it was shifting over from Sean Connery's legacy to Roger Moore's decades even the wealthy pianist played by Curt Jergens later appeared as the main Bond villain for THE SPY WHO LOVED ME 1977. I think mainly because of the running time issue the film noticeably rushed over a significant segment in the middle where the Clarkson couple losses a very important family member their reactions regarding the loss  grief were downright questionable  kinda funny also. But the strongest segment of this underrated occult horrorthriller was its climax. The finale was a real shocker and went into an area that I didn't see coming. All I can say without spoiling anything that you'd never see an ending like this today in a studio horror film for sure  It's an ending that may initially make you think why or how the hell heshe could make that choice but if you take a quick look back into the story then you'll surely find plenty of hints that surprisingly somehow makes everything sense and made it work in a weird way.I think a remake by Darren Aronofsky would be interesting with Ben Affleck portraying Alan Alda's role Emily Blunt reprising Paula Jacqueline Bisset's character Bill Nighy as Duncan Ely and Rosamund Pike as his daughter Roxanne.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever moral issues exist in this strange tale of the occult they vanish as soon as you accept the premise of this storythat a woman would kill another to repossess her husband with both of them in the guise of someone else's body!! It's about as weird as any Tales from the Crypt! On the plus side all of it is stylishly photographed and played with a certain amount of relish at least by Jacqueline Bisset Curt Jurgens and Bradford Dillman. Biggest flaw is casting Alan Alda in the central role as the pianist who inherits the musical talent of Curt Jurgens when the Satanist dies bequeathing Alda with his body and soul. Bisset is the wife who slowly comes to suspect that her husband has been taken over by someone else.Not quite as strikingly original as Rosemary's Baby it does have some effective horror moments notably involving scenes with a rather ferocious black dog and a scene where the Devil is summoned but we never actually see him. Imagination is given free reign here at least fleetingly shades of Val Lewton. Perhaps a technique that should have been used more often throughout.None of it quite makes sense and the ending is a distinct letdown but there are some chilling moments nevertheless. Bisset and Parkins are beautifully photographed with Bisset coming out ahead in the acting department playing the stressed out wife with appropriate fear and tension. Parkins on the other hand seems to rely on one frozen expression sleepwalking through her role relying solely on her looks to get by in a way that Hedy Lamarr was often accused of doing in films of the '40s.As for Alan Alda he is much too bland lending neither interest nor credibility to a role that demands a strong romantic lead. His career suggests that he is clearly more comfortable in character roles requiring comic flair not straight dramatic parts. Bradford Dillman is at least a stronger presence in a lesser role.All in all not bad for watching when you're in the mood for a tale of the occult. I seem to recall enjoying the book years ago and the film doesn't quite measure up. It emerges as one of those films that could have been much more satisfying with better casting and direction.".

	schema:headline " A surprisingly charming film!";
	schema:reviewBody "So here's this movie Flashdance which has been staring me in the face for years both in pop culture for over half of my life and on the video rental store shelves and yet I've never gotten around to checking it out until now.I was fifteen when this movie was first out and popular. I heard the soundtrack of course and loved it to pieces... but I had never been able to watch the movie because it was rated R.I had grown up having it be in an odd sort of way both a part of my life and at the same time not a part of my life. I was familiar with its music images and even its basic plot outline but had never seen the movie.And as an adult I felt extremely dubious about checking it out. Over the years I had heard that people either loved it to pieces or hated it. I've heard critics both call it uplifting and fun while others called it nothing more than a string of glittering little music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot a creation device for a LOT of MTVera movies such as Top Gun Footloose and Purple Rain.To add to my confusion about whether or not I should give it a try I had had the same experience with Saturday Night Fever I grew up loving the soundtrack to pieces but having never seen the movie... and when I finally did I felt utter disappointment at first discovering the film to be far darker than expected. Oh sure I later liked Fever okay actually I should use the term appreciated but still preferred the gorgeous soundtrack to the actual film that was the basis for its existance.Would I have the same experience with Flashdance?Tonight I finally decided to as one character in the film puts it hold my breath and take the plunge.As it turns out I found it to be a surprisingly charming entertaining and uplifting film. I was fearing it to be something raunchy but at it turns out it has a very special starryeyed sweet innocence that is difficult to define.The performance of the equally starryeyed and innocent Jennifer Beals helps of course. She brings a wideeyed sparkle and hopefulness to her role plus a determination to keep her life on the right track precisely as she feels it ought to go without any major morality screwups and this adds a wonderful flavour of hope and childlike wonder to her character Alex that just simply grows on you.Now it IS true that there are a few flaws here and there and a couple of editing flaws as well. Plus the other characters aren't really as developed as hers but they are developed just enough to demonstrate to her personally the various dos and don'ts regarding attitudes to have while pursuing a dream voices for her to observe and learn from representing both directions. But none of that matters because the film has a charm all its own. Looking at it today I can easily see why so many out there loved it its a beautiful and very encouraging little film. It has a heroine whom anybody could relate with and like it has wonderful music in it it has a delicate and lighthearted touch to it which language and a couple of scenes aside such as the film's most heartbreaking scene in which Alex saves a desperate friend from throwing life away in a strip joint a sequence which only lasts about two minutes longbut it's sad and disturbing not Oooh let's put this in to grab male members of the audience!which is most likely the only ingredient to earn the film its R rating is nevertheless still so pure and true that it could have come straight out of a '70smade Walt Disney Productions movie !!! it's touching and moving... and of course it has dance sequences which are fun to watch.In other words it was a comforting and uplifting movie released during a time when people youngsters with career goals in particular needed one. And if anything folks still need movies like that out today. It's a happy little film with a happy ending which isn't overdone or unconvincing and precisely the sort of flick which should be perscribed to those suffering severe depression. Heaven knows that I myself certainly felt encouraged about my own career and life in particular after watching it!It might not be for everybody but if the above description I've written voices the sort of movie you personally enjoy then do yourself a big favour and give it a try. Chances are that if you are as naturally starryeyed and hopeful as Alex isand believe me I certainly amthen you will easily relate to this delightful little fable.".

I've heard critics both call it uplifting and fun while others called it nothing more than a string of glittering little music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot a creation device for a LOT of MTVera movies such as Top Gun Footloose and Purple Rain.To add to my confusion about whether or not I should give it a try I had had the same experience with Saturday Night Fever I grew up loving the soundtrack to pieces but having never seen the movie... and when I finally did I felt utter disappointment at first discovering the film to be far darker than expected. Oh sure I later liked Fever okay actually I should use the term appreciated but still preferred the gorgeous soundtrack to the actual film that was the basis for its existance.Would I have the same experience with Flashdance?Tonight I finally decided to as one character in the film puts it hold my breath and take the plunge.As it turns out I found it to be a surprisingly charming entertaining and uplifting film. I was fearing it to be something raunchy but at it turns out it has a very special starryeyed sweet innocence that is difficult to define.The performance of the equally starryeyed and innocent Jennifer Beals helps of course. She brings a wideeyed sparkle and hopefulness to her role plus a determination to keep her life on the right track precisely as she feels it ought to go without any major morality screwups and this adds a wonderful flavour of hope and childlike wonder to her character Alex that just simply grows on you.Now it IS true that there are a few flaws here and there and a couple of editing flaws as well. Plus the other characters aren't really as developed as hers but they are developed just enough to demonstrate to her personally the various dos and don'ts regarding attitudes to have while pursuing a dream voices for her to observe and learn from representing both directions. But none of that matters because the film has a charm all its own. Looking at it today I can easily see why so many out there loved it its a beautiful and very encouraging little film. It has a heroine whom anybody could relate with and like it has wonderful music in it it has a delicate and lighthearted touch to it which language and a couple of scenes aside such as the film's most heartbreaking scene in which Alex saves a desperate friend from throwing life away in a strip joint a sequence which only lasts about two minutes longbut it's sad and disturbing not Oooh let's put this in to grab male members of the audience!which is most likely the only ingredient to earn the film its R rating is nevertheless still so pure and true that it could have come straight out of a '70smade Walt Disney Productions movie !!! it's touching and moving... and of course it has dance sequences which are fun to watch.In other words it was a comforting and uplifting movie released during a time when people youngsters with career goals in particular needed one. And if anything folks still need movies like that out today. It's a happy little film with a happy ending which isn't overdone or unconvincing and precisely the sort of flick which should be perscribed to those suffering severe depression. Heaven knows that I myself certainly felt encouraged about my own career and life in particular after watching it!It might not be for everybody but if the above description I've written voices the sort of movie you personally enjoy then do yourself a big favour and give it a try. Chances are that if you are as naturally starryeyed and hopeful as Alex isand believe me I certainly amthen you will easily relate to this delightful little fable.";

I REALLY don't care that it's a chick flick.  I love this movie!! Some people after seeing Flashdance choose to see a movie about exotic dancing.  For one reason or another I see a movie about chasing dreams taking chances and maximizing life.  Jennifer Beals' character Alex Owens's dream of attending a formal dance school and becoming a ballerina is the central theme of the film.  Her friends Jeanie and Richie are aspiring figure skaters and standup comedians respectively.  However Alex is the only dreamer receiving any encouragement.  Her senior citizen friend Hannah a former ballerina herself gives Alex practical advice and unconditional faith.  Jeanie's father openly criticizes Jeanie's dream as well as her beau Richie. Richie a cook at Mawby's Bar is put down by his boss for wanting to go to Hollywood and being a comedian You're too short.  They don't let short people into Hollywood.The subplots facilitate Alex's dream to create a captivating story.  To support herself and possibly to keep life interesting Alex holds 2 jobs a welder by day and a dancer at aforementioned Mawby's Bar during the night. Her welding boss Nick takes a liking to her and pursues her.  Alex resists his charms but gives in eventually.  Johnny C. the sleazy strip bar owner continually tries to lure Alex into dancing for him.  As mentioned before Alex's friends Jeanie and Richie have dreams of their own and we see where their dreams take them.  The factor that made Flashdance a hit was the music of course.  What a Feeling took away an Oscar for Best Song.  I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is sung by Kim Carnes Bette Davis Eyes fits Alex's personalcrisis scene perfectly. The first time I watched Flashdance was 4 years ago I bought the video knowing I'd like it.  After 20 viewings I still love it.  Flashdance is for anyone who has a dream but not the courage to pursue it.".

Flahdance is a very retro cheesy entertaining film that is at no point boring and never drags and is also a very clear symbol of the great 1980's and the night club exotic dancing scene of the time. Jennifer Beals puts down an amazing performance as a dancer and as an actress. I guess the story comes down to the fact that reality bites that life is tough but if you push hard you just might make it.All in all Flashdance despite its few undeniable faults is a very decent and enjoyable film in my opinion. As it mostly meets all of my requirements I am happy to give it a positive review. This film is one of the quintessential 80's films that works well as a symbolic artifact of its time. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves 80's.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "In recent years there have been a number of British films based on the theme of workingclass people who find fulfilment through their cultural activities examples being Educating Rita the first and most distinguished Brassed Off The Full Monty and Billy Elliott.  Such films are frequently described as quintessentially British' or something that we can do and Hollywood can't' whereas the truth is that twenty years ago Hollywood was indeed making very similar films mostly centred upon dancing such as Saturday Night Fever Dirty Dancing or Flashdance. Whereas these American films may not have had the covert or in the case of Brassed Off highly overt political message of their British counterparts they nevertheless concentrated on differences in social class far more than Hollywood movies usually do.The heroine of Flashdance Alex is a young woman who works as a welder and whose main joy in life is dancing. She moonlights as a dancer in a local nightclub but her great ambition in life is to become a ballet dancer. The film tells the story of how she achieves that ambition as well as the story of her romance with a wealthy middleclass divorcee set against frequent dance sequences as Alex and her iceskating friend Jeanie go through their paces. The climax comes with a scene in which she auditions for a place at a prestigious ballet academy and treats the judging committee to a bravura display of breakdancing. Would a ballet school really be prepared to offer a place to a candidate whose dance skills owe more to the disco than to Swan Lake and who seems completely ignorant of balletic idiom?The film has its weak points. Although the plot is not as nonexistent as some reviewers have felt it nevertheless tends to take second place to the showpiece dance numbers at times it felt as if I were watching an extended series of pop videos. Potentially interesting themes are ignored for example Alex is a practising Catholic but this seems to be a plot device to enable scenes set in the confessional to be used as soliloquies in which she can air her emotional problems. No attempt is made to explore the possible conflict between the demands of her religion and her sexually provocative dancing or her love for a divorcee.The acting is undistinguished Jennifer Beals makes an attractive and personable heroine but it is clear why despite the success of this film she did not go on to become a major star. Her acting is too weak to enable her to carry a film certainly I felt that she would be out of her depth in one that depends more upon plot and less upon song and dance. The other characters are little more than ciphers with the exception of Hanna the old lady who acts as Alex's mentor. I could certainly have done without the tasteless ethnic jokes told by Alex's comedian friend.Yet despite its faults I enjoyed this film. Its redeeming feature is the zest and energy of its dance sequences set to some wellchosen music such as Laura Branigan's Gloria or Irene Cara's title song. It may not be deep or significant but it is an enjoyable wellmade piece of popular entertainment. 610.".

Flashdance is a very outdated movie that has never appealed to most film critics so I felt this was sufficiently unusual to justify an attempted explanation.Since the DVD of Flashdance was released it has appeared for hire in many small local convenience stores and service stations that only maintain a very small rack of films for hire Clearly although it is now very much of a period movie it continues to retain an enormous appeal for many of those who have seen it before. Personally I have watched our tape of Flashdance more often than most of the other tapes we have at home. This is not because it would be my first choice but because it is a film that my wife loves to watch again and again whilst I find I can view it repeatedly more readily than many of her other favorite tapes so when we are discussing what to view and have rejected a number of other possibilities we tend to turn back to Flashdance. This reinforces the comments already made in your database about Flashdance being a feel good movie for which most people seem able to ignore the faults and just enjoy the music the dancing and the romance. It also features Grunt a very appealing dog who remains one of the reasons why my wife is always ready to rewatch this film. As a film Flashdance is therefore something of a paradox. Originally the final product was not very highly regarded by the studio and only received a limited release. This was severely panned by most of the critics and  not surprisingly the film initially received very little support from the public. The reviews and the low attendance led to plans to withdraw it from circulation early but before these were implemented the audiences started to grow and continued to increase until cinemas showing the film were mostly packed out. Clearly those few who saw the film at an early showing started telling their friends to ignore the critics and see it. This escalated exponentially until the film finished up as a major hit. In commenting on this film it would be equally invalid to ignore the very real concerns of the critics or the equally real appeal it had and still seems to have for most of the public.The story is trite  a female welder in a steelworks dreams of being a ballet dancer and practices her dancing in one of the local bars at night. Here she meets and starts to fall in love with her fairly young divorced boss. With his support she is able obtain an audition with a major dance company who are essentially only interested in her dance training and lose any interest they may have had when she says she has never attended a dance school. However she proceeds to audition for the very bored selection committee and gives an electrifying free dance performance that in true fairy story tradition brings the committee to its feet. Some critics have complained that doubles replaced the star Jennifer Beals for this sequence but this is surely not important  the real question is how effectively the film plays and this sequence has rightly been very widely admired. About the time the film was released modern dance companies were being formed alongside traditional ballet companies in many major cities in North America and this sequence certainly added to the appeal of the film at the time but it is decidedly not the only reason for watching it.I could spend pages criticizing the screenplay in several different respects but other comments in your database have already done this and these criticisms are ultimately not damming. The important thing is that the film maintains an ongoing flow which sweeps most viewers along and earns it a place as one of the finer musical comedies to have been released in the past quarter century. The object of a film is to entertain the public and in ranking Flashdance I feel I must base my rating on its undeniable success in doing just this. So 7 out of 10.".

But she has big time dreams to become a ballet dancer she has promised her grandmother that she would apply to the top ballet school and try to get an audition. But Alex is always intimidated by the other proper looking dancers with tons more experience than her. She falls in love with a fellow coworker Nick who wants her to make it just as badly. She goes through rough times but she just wants to make it and will do anything for that chance.Flashdance is one of those must see movies if you wanna see the important films of the 80's. I just wanted to see what this movie was about since it's such a huge part of film culture. Jennifer Beals actually did a great job as Alex she was absolutely beautiful and made the character very likable. While this film did not live up to my expectations it still was a good film. It has an awesome sound track and really is a lot of fun to dance too. Now excuse me but I wanna try to take my bra off without removing my shirt lol.510".

Really the whole film is played like a 90minute ad for MTV! Laugh at the dopey plot and listen to the great tunes. Great film to earmark the 80s.".

Adrian Lyne perfectly captured the time a post disco era when Breakdancing and Synth Pop were all the rage  Who could forget the FANTASTIC theme song sung by Irene Cara Fame and composed by Synth Pop genius Giorgio Moroder I feel love  Donna Summer among many others. So what if Jennifer Beals wasn't a great actress? So what if it wasn't her dancing? Think one of them was a break dancer from The Rock Steady Crew  see? All about the era! she was a good looking girl and this was a harmless bit of fun at the time.".

But I just saw it recently in its entirety the other night on TV.I don't know maybe it's the current sorry state of affairs of the world today that made me want to watch this film just so I could revisit the happy days? of the eighties when although the world was also in a sorry state of affairs at least there was an underlying pretense of hope and glory a pervasive albeit childlike adherence to the belief that wishes DO sometimes come true miracles CAN happen and for every ugly frog there IS a beautiful princess waiting to kiss him...This movie sucks bigtime... but it also rocks! And that people is the honest to God truth. This movie is so bad it reeks of the stench of the very phoneybaloney on which it is based and we all know how awful THAT is. BUT it also rocks you to your very soul and hey how can you possibly fault a movie that dares to offer people and not just young people but ALL people that little thing called HOPE??? I hope you don't take my critique the wrong way... Honestly I don't think the movie is really all that good but the message and the feeling and the spirit of this movie are all very wonderful and infectious indeed and should NOT be discounted. It makes it a wonderful movie. Strange isn't it? If those of you reading this are parents with upandcoming kids make them sit through this film!! Make them watch it!! I guarantee you at least there is not a single scene in it where some teenager just HAS to have sex with a baked pastry object!! Finally let me comment on the fact that many in filmdom have dissed Jennifer Beals over the fact that a standin dancer performed various or several of her dance segments. Well let me just mention that at the very end of the film in the credit roll there is a disclaimer that states The people and events in this film are fictional. Any similarity to actual people or events is unintentional. So with this in mind a stunt double performed some of the dance steps!?? I was shocked shocked to find that stunt doubles are used in Hollywood!!".

I finally decided to watch it because I like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact. After seeing the movie I am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep.The story is pretty preposterous when you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steelworkers and teamsters could keep their clientle with the high concept dances that those girls were doing? They would have all been over to Zanzibar faster than you can say performance art. Can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre TV watching No theater dance thing that she did? Please.It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancerafter all both are physically demanding jobs. But I didn't buy for a second that THAT girl worked in a steel yard. And I didn't buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel yard. Steel work is dangerous. You don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb. I love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding. What the hell are they doing in there? Or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. She was obviously board and just started cutting random things up.But story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way. Flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it however.The dancing horrible. It is the spastic twitchandpose style that ruined American musicals until...well are we really over it yet? The sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by Jennifer Beal's complete lack of personality. I mean I am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib.You can't really get behind Alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more going on than she did.The love affair is flat. It comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers. Zero passion.Even the final scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable. What serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at Alex's lame cheerleader routine? In short the movie had nothing but legwarmers and large sweatshirts. Oh yeah there is a good chunk of nudity when Alex rescues her friend from being a useless erotic dancer a laughable bit of hypocrisy. Other than that the movie is a waste of time. I wish that the MST3K crew were still in business. This would make good fodder for them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Flashdance for the first time since it came out and my opinion has not mellowed over time.  I dubbed it Flashdunce then and it remains Flashdunce now a film so lame inconsequential and annoyingly dumb that it actually made the comparably silly Footloose look like Singing in the Rain by comparison.  Actually I'm being too hard on Footloose since it actually had a plot some interesting characters and a pointofview to say nothing of a POINT as opposed to the pointless and silly Flashdance.But then why should I be surprised?  Flashdance was cowritten by notorious flopmeister Joe Eszterhaus who followed this up with the intelligent Jagged Edge then dropped such neutron bombs as Basic Instinct Showgirls and An Allen Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn on an unsuspecting public.  At least Flashdance's seemingly untalented director Adrian Lyne went on to redeem himself with the Play Misty for Me ripoff Fatal Attraction to say nothing of Lolita and the superior Richard GereDiane Lane starrer Unfaithful.  Here he directs the nonexistent story as a serious of brainnumbing music videos in which the lead actress Jennifer Beals who followed this up with an incredibly forgettable film career is replaced by an obvious double in the dance sequences and then the audience treated like a bunch of idiots when the filmmakers denied a double was used and refused to give her credit for her obvious hard work.  I have long contended that the incredible success of films like Flashdance which were written in crayon and cynically slapped together without a thought as to whether the plot makes sense or not have led to the increasingly abysmal state of Hollywood films which are terribly written and forcefed to a braindead audience of Pavlovian dogs who are trained to drool and devour garbage like this.Okay the plot  Beals is Alex who dreams of a career as a serious dancer. She's only 18 yet she works as a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night.  And by exotic dancer I mean one that doesn't remove her clothes and gets no more dirty than dousing herself with water and shaking her fullydressed booty at the audience.  She ends up romancing her wealthy boss helping out her loser collection of friends whenever she can and visiting a littleoldlady friend who acts as a defacto grandmother to her. Can you see where this is going?  Will Alex get an audition to the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance?  Will she fall in love with the boss?  Will he help her get an audition?  Will she get mad at her meddling boyfriendboss even though she meddles in everyone else's life? Will she see him with his sister and jealously break up with him without even asking who he's with?  Will Grandma die?  Will she pass her audition? Do we care?Incidentally not once does the film answer the most obvious question just what the hell is a flashdance anyway?  And why did audiences care so much about so little?  Even at 94 minutes the film seems padded.  As for nightmare double features imagine this  this film was eventually paired with another megabomb from 1983 the Sylvester Stallonedirected Saturday Night Fever sequel Staying Alive which was rightfully considered the worst film of 1983 Flashdance being runnerup.  Pity poor Cynthia Rhodes the beautiful and talented ingenue who is best known for costarring in the infinitely better Dirty Dancing.  She appeared in both Flashdance and Staying Alive.  Now that's what I call a bad year.  no stars".

Beals' face is so young sweet and innocent and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him opting rather to walk home  in the middle of the road  with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact the whole romance was very disturbing  the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. As for the dancing I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition  perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers' I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes Penny in Dirty Dancing. You could see that she was a real dancer and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. There were two good bits in this film  the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition  they look so lovely and classy and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents they were funny.Some other random points  who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway what happened to the ice skater? Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message  don't give up hope keep on trying and your dreams will come true. Watch The Little Mermaid instead.".

And Jennifer Beals was still passing for white. I am glad to see she is not doing that anymore. With movies such as All Saints and shows like the L Word. People actually aspired to be strippers after seeing this movie. Since all it was is a cleaned up stripper movie not a dance movie. I still think that Flashdance phenomena is still going on to this day. Ever since that movie came out every stripper is a stripper because they use the Flashdance excuse they are aspiring dancers who are paying for college..school. It is hilarious. The movie is kind of creepy now that I am older but at the time I thought nothing of this 35 year boss chasing after his 19 year old employee. Talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also no way in Pittsburgh will there be a 19 year old arc welder. That is a very good job which takes years to master a big union job. She surely could afford to go to any school she wanted if she was making welding money. And that bike would of been gone a long time ago with the bad weather Pittsburgh has in the winter. I liked that she did have friends too many of these movies the women seem to have no friends. But just boyfriends and perhaps a family member. And they all got along. I liked that. It was very sad that the actress who played Jeannie Sunny Johnson died the next year. She was very popular at the time and I remember being shocked. Jennifer Beals is very engaging in the movie Micheal Nouri is creepy and entirely too old for her. It was a joke at time when people use to do Jennifer Beals imitations with her running in place to the music Maniac because it was the only scene in the movie you actually saw her face while she moving. What was distracting about the movie was the dance doubles they did not even have the same body type and in the last scene the one that is suppose to be the showstopper that took away from the movie. They actually used a man named crazy legs to do the break dancing spin And you can see it! I was happy to see Cynthia Rhodes who is a real dancer..why didn't they use her for the lead since she could really dance? Since she married Richard Marx she hasn't been seen. I almost forgot about her. She was all over the place in during the 80's. I am happy to see Jennifer Beals career doing well. She really has picked good edgy roles. All in All the movie is very entertaining. Not The Red Shoes  but good for what it is...fluffy not to be taken seriously. But Nouri is too old for that girl.".

	schema:reviewBody "I give Flashdance a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos in order to clock in as a feature length film. Since when does that count as film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens an aspiring 18yearold dancer who incomprehensibly has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. Not a line of work most older women find their way into much less 18yearolds fresh out of high school. Meanwhile at night she works as an exotic dancer who never actually takes off her clothes in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at Mawby's you would think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip.Alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss Nick Hurley Michael Nouri who is about twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances because going out with the boss isn't a good idea she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to Alex's coworkers.When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably when her bossboyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.Of course Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in Flashdance. This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.You have to hand it to the makers of Flashdance though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. A truly forgettable film.".

Since when does that count as film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens an aspiring 18yearold dancer who incomprehensibly has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. Not a line of work most older women find their way into much less 18yearolds fresh out of high school. Meanwhile at night she works as an exotic dancer who never actually takes off her clothes in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at Mawby's you would think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip.Alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss Nick Hurley Michael Nouri who is about twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances because going out with the boss isn't a good idea she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to Alex's coworkers.When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably when her bossboyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.Of course Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in Flashdance. This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.You have to hand it to the makers of Flashdance though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. A truly forgettable film.";

The viewer forgets  almost everything else in the film once you see it. I say almost  because the most often published photo graph of Beals pulling that long  shirt over her buff 20 year young body does get a lot of attention  is  memorable to be sure.

The film is heavy on symbolism and sparse in the storytelling department. It is basically a series of meditations and the artist at rest before he goes on rampages of sex as frenetic as his violin playing. The film is full of often beautiful photography mostly using natural light or candles and the distorted vision of the period comes to life in a staggering way. In terms of narrative it is a complete fiasco but Kinski does not give a damn about the story. He cares about the character and the moment. As such character and moment are as intense and vibrant as any Kinski performance.Kinski as an actor always seemed to burn through the screen. This film is 100 Kinski. Therefore predictably it is completely overwhelming unbearable one might say even if one overlooks the manic sex scenes a heroic feat a woman touches herself to the sound of Paganini's playing while horses fornicate the camera whirls savagely about as Paganini dives hungrily into an admirer's skirt etc. Frankly these scenes would be out of place in any other movie. What unsettles here is the fact that they seem entirely at home in this crazed psychopath of a film.Kinski Paganini is impossible to rate. You will very likely hate it all the more so if you see it in the company of other people. As a window into Klaus Kinski's mind it is essential. And since it is a completely personal work featuring the creator's obsessions and themes under his complete control it fits the dictionary definition of art. Art is in the eye of the beholder so no one need feel personally insulted and for better or worse this is one of the rare times I have seen its kind on a screen. You get it or you don't and on a visceral level since narrative or sense is not the issue in fact the only similar film is Luis Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou where you just follow a train of thought....A trainwreck of a film. Filmed with bewildering sensitivity and and fueled by intimidating passion this is the cinematic expression of a man's soul.".

Some of the scenes filmed indoors particularly in the theater have an eerie surreal feel to it much to Kinski's foresight to film it without any electrical lighting and often using only candle light for illumination.  I've read Kinski's autobiography.  The parallels between the two Kinski and Paganini are eerie and more than coincidental.  Both obsessed over young girls the younger the better.  Both were and are considered to be geniuses in their respective fields.  Both gave impassioned performances to the point of being referred to as being demonic in nature. Both made enormous sums of money but inevitably squandered it away.  And both had young sons late in life whom they absolutely and without doubt worshipped.  Originally Klaus had presented this film as a very long 3 hour plus movie.  It would have been interesting to see exactly what he had in mind if this version had ever been released but alas producers only allowed a very sparse 82 minute cut version of what Klaus Kinski described to be the work of his life.  It really is too bad that the original longer version isn't available.  After viewing this film one is left with a very unfulfilled and empty feeling.  Too often there is little character development within Nicolo Paganini's aquaintances and conquests.  In particular an affair with a member of a royal family.   While this film outwardly appears to be little more than a tawdry lewd effort on Kinski's part it more importantly portrays Paganini as a suffering shell of a human being never satisfied with anything and all too often left unsatiated unfulfilled and all too often spiritually dead   The film has a remarkable soundtrack thanks to the efforts of virtuoso violinist Salvatore Accardo. It also features performances by Kinski's lolita wife Deborah Caprioglio Kinski and his son Nikolai Nanhoi Kinski who both perform their roles admirably.  This is a definite must see movie regardless of whether or not you are a fan of Klaus Kinski.  Sadly it is the last film he ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note I thought it would be more in line with the spirit of the film if I capitalised every instance of KLAUS KINSKI's name being used throughout this reviewI have no doubt that this is the most narcissistic film ever to see the inside of a cinema. Even the very title KINSKI Paganini shows a total lack of restraint.It begins with an audience of pretty women frigging themselves senseless as KINSKI lashes at his violin. The whole movie is pretty much a montage of women losing complete control of their senses at the mere thought of KINS I mean Paganini. Even eleven year old girls wish they could for but one second experience the full thrust of his virility. He even sends seaanimals into a dizzy frenzy of lust and horses too. You see two horses going at it early on in the film and I'm sure both of them were secretly thinking of KINSKI. At least that's what he probably wanted us to think.Just like with Dennis Hopper's The Last Movie whatever plot may have been present whilst shooting was completely torn to shreds in the editing suite. What remains is a lot of strangely pretty shots of KINSKI powerwalking through a lush 19th Century Europe or cavorting with buxom underrage actresses inside ornate manor houses. It's mostly shot in a cinma vrit style. If it weren't for the fact that he's on screen for almost every second of the movie I wouldn't be surprised if it was KINSKI himself manning the camera. The only time you see shots of anyone else is when a beautiful woman is rubbing herself lustfully her thoughts occupied by the eponymous scowling Nosferatu with sweaty jetblack hair and a bald patch.Ah but KINSKI has a more sensitive side too. Just like that memorable scene in My Best Fiend where he gently plays with a butterfly that's become strangely enamoured of him we see him care for his exceptionally pretty young son. Although even this relationship seems oddly lusty. The camerawork wellstaged as most of it is has far too many close ups. You almost never see any wide shots showing off the beautiful locations. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind at all this is because KINSKI wanted KINSKI to fill up the frame as much as possible. According to his ol' sparring partner Herzy KINSKI threw a tantrum for not having the opening shot to Aguirre be a closeup of him walking down that misty mountain instead of the hundreds of people and cattle that we actually saw. Well he finally got his way.In all likelihood you'll absolutely loathe this movie. And you'll probably be right to. But there is a strange energy coursing throughout that of a man at the end of his tether foreseeing his death and spending all his remaining lifeblood on this one final work.I believe KLAUS KINSKI may have been an incredibly rare genetic throwback to some transitional CroMagnon race. He shows no signs of the tempering of thousands of years of social evolution. He's like some purely physical being. You can tell that by the time this movie was shot he didn't so much burn the candle at both ends as throw it into the fire and cackle maniacally as it melted. He died two years after this was released. It was the last film he shot in a career that spanned over 130 movies. I can't think of a more fitting way to go out.If you came here as a Paganini fan rather than a KINSKI fan as if anyone could be a bigger fan of KINSKI than KINSKI himself you can always just imagine this is a sexy 80minute music video to some of Paganini's works. The interpretations by Salvatore Accardo are wonderfully performed.".

Even the very title KINSKI Paganini shows a total lack of restraint.It begins with an audience of pretty women frigging themselves senseless as KINSKI lashes at his violin. The whole movie is pretty much a montage of women losing complete control of their senses at the mere thought of KINS I mean Paganini. Even eleven year old girls wish they could for but one second experience the full thrust of his virility. He even sends seaanimals into a dizzy frenzy of lust and horses too. You see two horses going at it early on in the film and I'm sure both of them were secretly thinking of KINSKI. At least that's what he probably wanted us to think.Just like with Dennis Hopper's The Last Movie whatever plot may have been present whilst shooting was completely torn to shreds in the editing suite. What remains is a lot of strangely pretty shots of KINSKI powerwalking through a lush 19th Century Europe or cavorting with buxom underrage actresses inside ornate manor houses. It's mostly shot in a cinma vrit style. If it weren't for the fact that he's on screen for almost every second of the movie I wouldn't be surprised if it was KINSKI himself manning the camera. The only time you see shots of anyone else is when a beautiful woman is rubbing herself lustfully her thoughts occupied by the eponymous scowling Nosferatu with sweaty jetblack hair and a bald patch.Ah but KINSKI has a more sensitive side too. Just like that memorable scene in My Best Fiend where he gently plays with a butterfly that's become strangely enamoured of him we see him care for his exceptionally pretty young son. Although even this relationship seems oddly lusty. The camerawork wellstaged as most of it is has far too many close ups. You almost never see any wide shots showing off the beautiful locations. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind at all this is because KINSKI wanted KINSKI to fill up the frame as much as possible. According to his ol' sparring partner Herzy KINSKI threw a tantrum for not having the opening shot to Aguirre be a closeup of him walking down that misty mountain instead of the hundreds of people and cattle that we actually saw. Well he finally got his way.In all likelihood you'll absolutely loathe this movie. And you'll probably be right to. But there is a strange energy coursing throughout that of a man at the end of his tether foreseeing his death and spending all his remaining lifeblood on this one final work.I believe KLAUS KINSKI may have been an incredibly rare genetic throwback to some transitional CroMagnon race. He shows no signs of the tempering of thousands of years of social evolution. He's like some purely physical being. You can tell that by the time this movie was shot he didn't so much burn the candle at both ends as throw it into the fire and cackle maniacally as it melted. He died two years after this was released. It was the last film he shot in a career that spanned over 130 movies. I can't think of a more fitting way to go out.If you came here as a Paganini fan rather than a KINSKI fan as if anyone could be a bigger fan of KINSKI than KINSKI himself you can always just imagine this is a sexy 80minute music video to some of Paganini's works. The interpretations by Salvatore Accardo are wonderfully performed.";

His insistence on using natural lighting doesn't make him a Kubrick  just inept. As a musician I see no trace of any insight into Paganini here and the latter was indeed a fascinating human being. I suspect that part of the problem is that Kinski was surrounded by hangerson worshippers arselickers probably literally in slow motion sycophants who either didn't notice that he was producing tripe or were afraid to tell him. The sad sad thing is that he wasted so much of his life trying to put this farrago together and that the frustrations of it may have hastened his death.

Those two films were nothing to write home about but they feel like real cinema whereas this is an incoherent mess of a softcore home movie! Apparently Kinski identified with violinist Paganini who here is repeatedly described as a crippled monster yet women shamelessly lust for him! because of their parallel lives  both being misunderstood geniuses with a voracious sexual appetite of course the fact that Kinski saw himself like that speaks volumes about the size of his ego...to the point that the film is generally referred to as KINSKI PAGANINI! Incidentally the version I watched where Kinski delivers his own lines in softspoken but heavilyaccented Italian despite being ostensibly a local! ran just 81 minutes which is how it was released theatrically edited from a reportedly 12hour TV miniseries!. Why the film was given a manic haphazard pace there is no plot to speak of here as if we were only intended to catch a cursory glimpse of Paganini's backstory which basically resolves itself in a succession of carriagerides anyway! when it could have been extended to say 2 hours with a proper beginning middle and end is beyond me  but then it would probably not have been worthy of attention except that as it stands now and the way I see it it only elicits contempt! I know of Kinski's reputation the Italian Stracult TV program even showed scenes of him going apeshit during the shooting of this very film its subsequent press conference and other Italian movies he worked on but this had never interfered with my appreciation of his undeniable acting talent. Here however by assuming complete control after his frequent director Werner Herzog turned him down flat which soured their relationship even more than it already was! one can only place the film's shortcomings at his door. For the record a recent German DVD edition unearthed a Director's Cut of PAGANINI running 95 minutes which suggests that Kinski always knew he would end up with merely the skeleton of the original version  indeed on the aforementioned program Kinski is seen wildly operating the camera himself and no amount of postproduction tweaking can adjust a shot that is badlyframed outoffocus or underexposedbut as I said more judicious editing  rather than relying solely on instinct  could have improved the overall quality or at least allowed the viewer to care about what he was being asked to watch! Needless to say the film ends up giving Arthouse cinema a bad name not just because of its ungainly approach but mainly because it cannibalizes other filmmakers without ever hoping to match their dexterity apart from the fragmented structure a' la Nicolas Roeg down to Paganini's son rushing to and aching over him in slowmotion at the moment of the violinist's death in a reverse situation to the one at the start of DON'T LOOK NOW 1973 and its being shot by utilizing only natural light in clear imitation of Stanley Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON 1975 we also get an irrelevant horsemating scene to go along with shots of Dalila Di Lazzaro pleasuring herself whilst thinking of Maestro Paganini! lifted outright from Walerian Borowczyk's similarly smutty but far more considerable  and rewarding  THE BEAST 1975! Incidentally the film costars two of Kinski's family members his last wife Debora Caprioglio billed Kinski and his son Nikolai Kinski. While the former is not given much to do especially since she has to share Paganini with so many other adulating women including Italian starlet Eva Grimaldi as Napoleon Bonaparte' sister who carries on with Paganini in full military regalia! the boy is quite good  indeed the film only connects on an emotional level during his scenes with Daddy and it was undeniably poignant to watch the older Kinski dote so unreservedly over his offspring keeping in mind also that he would die within 2 years!. Also turning up briefly in the film are Feodor Chaliapin as an elderly authority figure hellbent on expelling Paganini from the country for his licentiousness and celebrated mime Marcel Marceau incarnating the musician in a staged parody of his exploits.However the starwriterdirector's egomania high opinion of himself at one point Paganini  and by extension Kinski  is literally described as being able to give himself a hardon through the playing of his musical instrument! and his lack of experience behind the camera sabotages at every turn the film's aspirations as an objective look at the mindset of a creative but evidently troubled personality. The fact that Paganini's predilection for underage girls which obviously landed him in trouble with the Law elicits the ire of the people can only be shared by the audience who are thus forced to participate in the masturbatory fantasies of an ageing and deranged narcissist who has pretty much hit rockbottom on all conceivable levels! In the end I should mention that Paganini's music is heard practically incessantly throughout but rather than evoking the accomplishment of the work itself one is left with ears reeling squeamishly from the strident notes!".

Also turning up briefly in the film are Feodor Chaliapin as an elderly authority figure hellbent on expelling Paganini from the country for his licentiousness and celebrated mime Marcel Marceau incarnating the musician in a staged parody of his exploits.However the starwriterdirector's egomania high opinion of himself at one point Paganini  and by extension Kinski  is literally described as being able to give himself a hardon through the playing of his musical instrument! and his lack of experience behind the camera sabotages at every turn the film's aspirations as an objective look at the mindset of a creative but evidently troubled personality. The fact that Paganini's predilection for underage girls which obviously landed him in trouble with the Law elicits the ire of the people can only be shared by the audience who are thus forced to participate in the masturbatory fantasies of an ageing and deranged narcissist who has pretty much hit rockbottom on all conceivable levels! In the end I should mention that Paganini's music is heard practically incessantly throughout but rather than evoking the accomplishment of the work itself one is left with ears reeling squeamishly from the strident notes!";

The last 'new' movie with Kinski I saw was Paganini his final film. Not an easy film to find or to watch and to one level the often devastating reviews being true a mess of a movie almost unwatchable due to the natural light Kinskis refusal of filming a straight storyline the odd editing seemingly random unsimulated sexscenes etc.We've seen Kinski perform Paganini before not the actual role but the character which the actor bestows upon the violinist there have been traces of Paganini in Fruits of Passion where he plays a character that is similarly haunted by his own satyrlike sexuality. The last time was in Cobra Verde Kinskis secondtolast film. Cobra Verde had complained that Kinski had turned the character of Cobra Verde into something that was more Paganini.Speaking of Werner Herzog in the documentary My Best Fiend the director commented that during the filming of Cobra Verde he felt that Kinski was at the end of his road and that Kinski himself had remarked I no longer exist. Even though his performance in Paganini carries all the trademarks of a Kinskiperformance  manic passionate filling the screen with his presence  it is sad to say that Herzog was probably correct. We cannot help but feel that we're watching a dying man not just because Paganini himself is on the brink of death but because Kinski had already spent most of his lifeforce.Well first off Klaus Kinski the director is no Werner Herzog but to say that Kinskis is as bad a director as Herzog is an actor would be a little unfair. Kinski had worked with the best and Kinski had learned from the best but his unwillingness to compromise his vision of the film makes Paganini one man's piece of art  not an artful movie.It makes one wonder what this film could have looked like had it been directed by a professional Werner Herzog who was offered the directors seat but refused or Stanley Kubrick for example. As it remains it's an interesting even though deeply flawed film.I wish I could give this film at least 8 points out of 10  but no that would be pseudointellectual and more befitting a Klaus Kinski fanboy so I'll have to give it what it deserves five points is all I can give.".

	schema:reviewBody "Short stories often make better films than full novels as is evident in the case of JD Locke's 'Ladies in Lavender' as adapted for the screen and directed by the multitalented Charles Dance. Given the barest outline of a quiet little idea of a 'fairy tale' LADIES IN LAVENDER becomes an unfolding meditation of quiet lives altered by an incident that awakens sleeping needs and emotions.Ursula Judi Dench and Janet Maggie Smith are elderly sisters living a quiet life of gardening strolling the cliffs and beach of Cornwall knitting and reading. Their bumpy housekeeper Dorcas Miriam Margolyes cooks cleans shops and chatters in a wonderful Cornish brogue allowing the sisters to live an otherwise isolated life  isolated from history personal emotions and vulnerabilities. After a storm Ursula spies a figure on the beach below their home and the two descend to find an unconscious handsome young man whom they rescue house nurture mend a broken ankle and ultimately become doting adorers. The young man Andrea Daniel Brhl finally awakens speaks no English as he is Polish and his charming ways attract inner emotions in both sisters. Janet studies some German and is able to speak with Andreas while Ursula pastes English words on items in his room to teach him English. He mends and it is discovered that he is a concert violinist who was shipwrecked while striving to go to America. A Russian visitor to the town Olga Natascha McElhone the requisite 'evil witch' for a fairy tale hears Andreas play informs him she has a cousin who is a famous violinist and attracts him away from Cornwall to London where he ultimately gives his own concert.Those are the bare facts of the film's story. The magic lies not in the story itself but in the submerged feelings of the two sisters. Ursula having never been in love in her youth falls in love with Andrea fully aware that there is no possibility of consummation. She feels long desired emotional attachment to the lad and the stirring in her breast is overwhelming to her. Janet who once loved but lost that love to death likewise falls for Andrea. It is this sibling rivalry over the passion for Andrea that provides some of the most touching and understated brilliant acting moments ever recorded on film. There is a scene where resting from a stroll on the cliffs Andrea rests with his head on Ursula's lap perhaps the first physical contact with a man she has ever known and the gentility of the slow and reticent placement of her hand on Andrea's resting head is a crystal of acting magic. How the sisters cope with this time with Andrea and his eventual leaving for his career is the climax of the film. And touching and understated it is.Judi Dench and Maggie Smith give pitch perfect characterizations creating two lovely beings we will never forget. Likewise Daniel Brhl is superb in a role far different from his usual German repertoire Goodbye Lenin! The Edukators Love in Thoughts and manages to create the illusion that he is actually playing the violin while the true artist is Joshua Bell in some stunning performances. The atmosphere of Cornwall is magically captured by Dance and his cinematographer Peter Biziou with assistance from Ed Rutherford. Nigel Hess has written a musical score incorporating wellknown classical violin works as well as his own hauntingly beautiful music that adds immeasurably to the film's success.LADIES IN LAVENDER is not a major blockbuster of a success nor does it try to be. It is simply a exquisitely crafted and acted fairy tale that gently reminds us that age does not prevent the heart from responding to that most beautiful of emotions Love. Highly recommended.

	schema:reviewBody "This film bursts into life in a few electrifying scenes  but these scenes are perhaps muted by the general leisurely air of the whole.What can be said is that this film belongs to Maggie Smith although Judi Dench has the lovelorn role of the smitten sister it is Dame Maggie who has the wider variety of emotions the presence and the charisma which gives the film the energy it needs to involve the viewer. A case in point is the scene where Dame Judi has her point of emotional release  and Dame Maggie tops it with just the slightest nuance of phrase. Indeed hers is a performance of subtlety and delicacy so understated and insightful that it recalls the outstanding work that she did in The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne. If it was up to me Dame Maggie would be right up there in contention for the Oscar and BAFTA. She is of course perfectly paired with Dame Judi who creates a portrayal of both pathos and charm. There is such rapport between the two that it wipes away memories of the caricatures of Tea With Mussolini and replaces it with genuine truth and humanity. The two dames are underscored by the comic bluster of Miriam Margolyes and the suspicious lusting of David Warner. This is a film of emotion and elegance. If it lacks narrative drive and dynamic then it is more than made up for by the space created for the talents of the actors. It is a film which lives on in the memory  and for that we mainly have to thank the performance of Maggie Smith.".

It was so obvious after a while and I reminisced about the time I fell in love with someone so much younger than me. It was a treat to see Maggie Smith trying to protect and comfort her sister in her obvious agony of the just impossible love she was feeling for the boy. How sad.The end was a poignant and subtle end to a fabulous SHORT story. I actually thought they were in the islands off the southern coast..

	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoilers'Ladies in Lavender' is an example of the genre which has become known as 'Heritage Cinema'. The term is generally used to describe films set in the past often in the nineteenth or early twentieth century and which aim for a detailed recreation of the period. Plots are often taken from literary sources there is often but not always an emphasis on the wealthy or welltodo sections of society the films tend to concentrate on emotions and psychology rather than dramatic physical action and are often very visually attractive with lovingly shot photography of the scenery that forms the backdrop to the action. Although the genre is sometimes criticised as being backwardlooking or overconservative it is one in which it is possible to work creatively and one in which much good work has been done in recent years especially in Britain. The film is set in the 1930s and centres around two elderly sisters Janet a widow and Ursula a spinster two live together in a cottage by the sea in Cornwall. For nonBritish readers this is a rural county in the extreme southwest of England. Their lives are changed one morning after a stormy night when they discover a young man cast up on the beach after being washed overboard from a ship. They take the stranger back to their cottage where they care for him and nurse him back to health. They discover that he is Polish that his name is Andrea and that he is a talented violinist. A romance develops between Andrea and Olga Daniloff a Russian migr artist whose brother is himself a famous violinist and takes Andrea under his wing as his protg. This romance however arouses the jealousy of Ursula who has herself developed feelings for the young man. Andrea and Olga also arouse the suspicion of the locals especially when they are heard speaking German their only shared language together this is the period leading up to the Second World War and anyone believed to be German is regarded with deep distrust. Like many 'heritage cinema' pictures this one makes good use of the scenery there is some fine photography of the Cornish landscapes. Nigel Hess's music also plays an important part I understand that he composed not only the incidental music but also the wonderful violin concerto which we hear Andrea playing in a concert near the end of the film. This was supposedly composed by Boris Daniloff for Andrea to play. It did seem a little too conservative in style for the 1930s but possibly Daniloff was a follower of say Rachmaninov rather than the likes of Stravinsky.What really makes the film a success however is the fine acting. The two Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are two of the best actresses of their generation in Britain. They were born within three weeks of each other in December 1934. Both give marvelous performances here bringing out the differing individual personalities of the two sisters. Janet is the dominant personality Ursula the quieter more passive one. Judi Dench shows us the full tragedy of Ursula's situation. Unlike her sister whose husband died in the Great War has never previously been in love with a man she only falls in love when it is too late and her love is an impossible one for a much younger man. There is some enjoyable comic relief from Miriam Margolyes as Dorcas the sisters' loyal but outspoken housekeeper. Daniel Bruehl is also very good in a trilingual performance as Andrea. He has to speak dialogue not only in his native German but also in English and Polish.I had never heard of William J. Locke who wrote the short story on which this film was based. I understand that he was a popular and prolific author in the Britain of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century but he now seems almost completely forgotten. Literary survival however is often as much a matter of fashion and chance as of merit and many fine stories have been written by authors whom we do not remember today. In his directorial debut Charles Dance has shown that even the works of a neglected author can form the basis of a fine film. This is a memorable tale of love and longing. 810".

The story plot line is a excellent one I assure you. It goes like this The ladies in lavender find a body of a young man barely still alive on the rocky rough surf beach in front of their old home. They take him in and nurse him to health. He turns out to be an extraordinarily gifted individual. When it is discovered that he is the ladies have to face a harsh reality in order for him to realize his potential.It is comparable to Tea with Mussolini in both quality of script story and especially cast.

There's nothing about it a child couldn't understand and plenty about it that senior people would relate to as well. Whales of August with Bette Davis and Lillian Gish is a superior treasure.".

The director's objective is clearly to focus on the internal feelings of the two old sisters and for that enough information is provided in their own comments. After all it's not the story of the stranger that is so important but the story of their loneliness and attachment to this young man that is the cornerstone of the plot.Not as shattering as some more actiondriven movies this film is a good treat for those who want to get away from the din of our modern life and enjoy some excellent music for precious one and a half hours.".

So what this film was saying was  these ladies have been in storage a while forgotten  and only when the young Polish guy comes into their lives do they flicker back to life.The usual superb performances from Judi and Maggie what makes them so good in Judi Dench's case particularly is that you can see what they are thinking before they even speak. Superb fingering on the violin from an actor who prior to this movie had never touched one  you'd swear he was really playing.The movie was particularly poignant for me as I lived for many years in Cornwall and recognised a lot of the scenery. I can incidentally assure the critic who claimed a mistake by saying Starrygazey pie is confined to Moushole that this heshe totally wrong. It may have been originally a Mousehole speciality but like Yorkshire pudding has long since spread to other areas.Ladies in Lavender is one of those British films which will become a classic for its gentle theme fantastic setting inside and out superb lighting and sound  and a good strong story line.".

Like Il Postino Ladies in Lavender is a period piece set around about the same time as Radford's film which zeroes in on a sleepy coastal town and a specific inhabitant whose life has been somewhat bereft of incident let alone incident with the opposite sex and often we feel sheltered.

As either films progress we will come to watch this lead go on to both interact as well as advance the nature of their feelings for the previously exterior individual thus leading to all sorts of complications to do with lust and anger which lead to overwhelming residing sentiments.The film follows that of Judi Dench's Ursula an elderly woman living in a Cornish town with her sister Janet  played by the seemingly everconsummate Maggie Smith. This pairing live in the sort of place in which local residents are able to recall what people looked like nighon forty years ago the sense of those born in the area not necessarily going anywhere during their lives that is particularly far away from the area prominent. We open on them with this quaint blissful sentiment to proceedings the duo messing about on a beach during a clear summer evening establishing real degrees of closeness and a sense of very little strife or indeed issue currently between them  even at this late stage in either of their lives. Whilst on the beach Janet appears willing to have a brief paddle in the lapping sea Ursula's natural reaction to dismiss such an idea through being afraid of it or whatever sees her hold back as the sibling makes the proverbial step forward to get involved thus an instance is an early highlighting of either women's nature and the dynamic of their relationship therein.Further sentiments of these sisters being as close as they are reside when we realise they share a bedroom housing two single beds in spite of the fact the house is clearly big enough for the pair of them. Janet's sidetable houses a photograph of a younger man dressed as a soldier and is most probably her husband then we observe that Ursula's sidetable is vacant of such things inferring a lack of prior masculine presence in her life. As a pairing we observe Janet dismissing a populist radio show Ursula enjoys listening to Janet spends the free time they have reading whereas Ursula can only knit and when it comes to starting up their motorvehicle to go out Janet must again drive proceedings as she cranks it up and gets it going before taking them both out. Culturally and in terms of exposure to life and whatnot Janet appears indelibly more advanced than her sister brief establishments that go a long way to tee up what will be Ursula's tale of having to come to terms with certain feelings and drive a strand of her own that will go against this established patriarchy.Where we come to sense few ever get out and that sense of the whole place being entirely tied in to one another in that community driven way some places are we sense the film's catalyst arriving in the form of a young man washed up on the nearby shore through Daniel Brhl's Andrea could be quite the occasion. Upon first seeing him and the consequent interactions thereafter Janet's busy physical demeanour as someone trying to aid and take care of him is in stark contrast to Ursula's stilted far more stunned complexion she reacts as if not having seen one of his kind in her entire life even doing so a fair time after the initial shock of finding someone with the potentially to be seriously injured or even dead has evaporate. The night before Andrea's inglorious arrival they turn off their radio with the announcer on the brink of speaking of a severe storm due to hit the area  what they end up with is a more burning more physical incarnation of this sort particularly when Natascha McElhone manoeuvres into proceedings. McElhone plays a Russian love rival named Olga whom turns up and reveals herself to paint rather than merely knit someone whom we enjoy observing at home barefoot and blowing smoke into the air from her cigarette as she sports a loose gown and sits comfortably on a chair in an extravagant looking house.The film gently constructs Ursula's gradual coming to feel for this young man eventually revealed to be a Polish violinist. The film tiptoes between a fine line separating it from warm hearted drama and out and out tragedy we really enjoy Dench's acting  her frail and fragile performance as she plays this vulnerable person exposed to elements she struggles to comprehend a wondrous performance off the back of playing that of domineering grizzled women evident in the likes of Die Another Day and The Chronicles of Riddick Dench flicks from one to the other remarkably. Director Charles Dance his first and so far his only venture into directing does a more than ample job in depicting these events and these characters his film amongst some of the better filmmaking debuts from the first half of last decade and worthy of utterance in the same breath as Romanek's One Hour Photo or Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko in what is a fascinating drama.".

Who has not nursed a secret passion and saved little mementos of the loved one at one time or another in our lives..? In fact I blushed in front of the screen a couple of times as the old woman's behaviour made me remember embarrassing things I have done myself...Although I think the story would have been still more effective if the woman had been a little younger. Maybe in her 40s or 50s instead of her 70s. It would have been easier to relate to it then and feel sorry for her... That is I did feel sorry for her now as well. It wrung my heart when the young man left with a beautiful woman of his own age  something that had to happen before or later. But an age difference of about 50 years is simply indecent  insane.Or alternatively if her love for him had not been sexual at all but only long repressed denied motherly feelings  as she had never had any children either as well as no husband... That would have been nicer I think.".

And you know what? I loved it admittedly it is very slow and perhaps the ending a little abrupt but essentially it is beautifullyacted directed and rendered that I actually found very moving.First of all I loved how it was filmed. The setting is old fashioned but it is exquisite to look at as well. Some parts are like looking at a watercolour painting seeing how picturesque it all was. The scenery was sumptuous and the costumes gorgeous. And the music from Nigel Hess was utterly amazing some of the melodies played on the violin is close to heart rending. Although the violin can play sinister and devilish pieces like Danse Macabre it also works bringing to life poignant works like Meditation from Thais and Tchaikovsky's Melody. The music composed I think was one of those elements that made the film so touching it was extremely beautiful.The direction from Charles Dance who acted so well in Bleak House is subtle and this allows each actor to bring their character and the sophisticated screenplay to life. The story is nimbly told about the upheaval and yearning when a handsome young manwith a catchhe can't speak English is found washed up on the beach and goes into very subtle emotional regions.And the cast is exceptional. Maggie Smith doesn't get as much screen time as Dench but she gives a very strong performances as always as the voice of reason. Judi Dench is also exceptional in a difficult role as Ursula and Daniel Bruhl is indeed handsome as the handsome stranger Andrea. The supporting cast were outstanding as well Natascha McElhone David Warner and Miriam Margoyles give suitably deft performances and it works for this sort of film.Overall very beautiful and touching particularly worth seeing for the acting and the music. 910 Bethany Cox".

The ensemble is what one has come to expect from an English company.The direction is relaxed and sure the photography superb.

	schema:reviewBody "A film devoid of special effects or big name young stars Ladies in Lavender shows that even in the 21st Century you can make a quality film with fine acting as its unique selling proposition. The story is thin and the one conventionally dramatic event is over within five minutes of the start. From then on we are treated to acting of the highest quality not only by the principals Judi Dench and Maggie Smith but also by the excellent supporting cast. Daniel Bruhl and Natascha McElhone are very good as the young 'not quite' lovers and David Warner gives a moving performance as the ageing widower full of wishes but short on fulfilment. There is a small galaxy of wrinkly British acting talent supporting the leads not least amongst whom is the hilarious Miriam Margolyes as the grumpy old servant Dorcas.A young Polish sailor is washed mysteriously ashore on the rocks near where the old sisters Smith and Dench live. They care for him and nurse him back to health and then his extraordinary talent as a violinist emerges. The action takes place in and around a Cornish village a few years before the outbreak of the Second World War and the approaching war clouds are an every present feature of the story. As with the Camomile Lawn also set in Cornwall in the same period and even like Brideshead Revisited this is a story about how life will never be the same again. From the archaic agricultural instruments to the archaic social attitudes this is a fin de siecle film. The sisters' lives were moulded by the First World War one lost a husband in the conflict and they dread that another war is near. The arrival of Andreas gives their life a purpose and fills a void that we suspect was there for a very long time.Charles Dance's direction is controlled and credible and avoids any easy descent into sentiment. Nigel Hess's music is exceptional and the CD worth buying in its own right.".

There is a small galaxy of wrinkly British acting talent supporting the leads not least amongst whom is the hilarious Miriam Margolyes as the grumpy old servant Dorcas.A young Polish sailor is washed mysteriously ashore on the rocks near where the old sisters Smith and Dench live. They care for him and nurse him back to health and then his extraordinary talent as a violinist emerges. The action takes place in and around a Cornish village a few years before the outbreak of the Second World War and the approaching war clouds are an every present feature of the story. As with the Camomile Lawn also set in Cornwall in the same period and even like Brideshead Revisited this is a story about how life will never be the same again. From the archaic agricultural instruments to the archaic social attitudes this is a fin de siecle film. The sisters' lives were moulded by the First World War one lost a husband in the conflict and they dread that another war is near. The arrival of Andreas gives their life a purpose and fills a void that we suspect was there for a very long time.Charles Dance's direction is controlled and credible and avoids any easy descent into sentiment. Nigel Hess's music is exceptional and the CD worth buying in its own right.";

	schema:headline " The cast breathes life into the story...";
	schema:reviewBody "When you have a cast headlined by Judi Dench and Maggie Smith your film is going to do well with their names alone. LADIES IN LAVENDER is saved by these two ladies and their screen presence and the pingponglike banter with each other.The two veteran actresses play Janet Smith and Ursula Dench two sisters living a comfortable and mundane life in Cornwall England in 1936. Janet is a widow and Ursula is a spinster. Their lives are altered when a mysterious young Polish man Daniel Bruhlwashes up on the beach near their home. They take him in aid in his recovery from an accident that is never explained and learn that he is a gifted violinist. Their comfort zone which is already disturbed becomes more so when a young German female painter Natascha McElhonealso shows an interest in the young man.Like in TEA WITH MUSSOLINI Maggie Smith's character is the more levelheaded and pragmatic while Judi Dench's Ursula is overlysensitive and borderline childlike. Miriam Margoyles does a great job as their rougharoundtheedges housekeeper and David Warner who played that undertaker of a manservant in TITANIC plays an equally creepy character in this film as the town's doctor.The movie is far from perfect Ebert and Roeper just gave it two thumbs down but it is enjoyable. It is just one little slice in the lives of all of these characters not giving the viewer much history or much closure at the end. The most poignant sideline is the love that Ursula starts to feel for this young man and though he is in his 20's and she is in her 70's you are reminded that one really can't choose who one loves even when the love is as inconvenient and impossible as this. However I do agree with the 2 professional critics when they said that Maggie Smith didn't have a lot to do in this film. This is true. Usually she is just the motherly voice of reason when Dench's character is acting irrational.When I was at the theater there were many many senior citizens in the audience. I heard many positive comments from my fellow audience members when the film ended and I think several could relate to the two ladies in the story. As for myself and in my early 30's I am still glad I saw it.Marginally recommended".

Two exceptions Olga was dressed in 1990s or even currentday style yes I know she is an 'artist' but even so... the combination of flowers blooming in the garden was botanically highly unlikely even in Cornwall! Part but only partof the answer to the question of age posed by jackie107 lies in the fact that the film is precisely set in 1939 as the Second World War breaks out with the German invasion of Poland as reported on the radio and not in 1936. But this only gives the sisters three extra years. The date also helps to explain Andrea's unorthodox arrival. Presumably he was the 1939 equivalent of an asylumseeker! If so this gives this 'escapist' film a rather interesting contemporary political relevance. Well worth seeing even for cynics like me!".

These ladies of a certain age take the young man into their home and tend to his wounds. Janet a widow and Ursula her spinster sister live comfortably in a cinematically beautiful if somehow faded elegant house. The young visitor becomes the object of Ursula's attention. This kind soul hasn't had any man in her life or so it seems. Andrea who they discover is Polish awakens a tender love in Ursula. Janet senses there is trouble if this situation is left unchecked but she goes along catering to Andrea's needs. Both ladies discover that Andrea is a violinist by profession. They contact the local fiddler so he can lend Andrea his instrument. The young man amazes everyone by playing wonderful tunes that attract the attention of a young German painter visiting the area and overhears the music coming from the cottage. Janet and Ursula don't want anything to do with this young woman intruding in their house but as fate would have it she ends up taking the young man away to fame and fortune.The story is neatly arranged for the screen. There's is no logic in how the young man arrives and why don't these two conservative women notify the local authorities. For all practical purposes Andrea might be a dangerous person. A lot of questions about the absurdity of the situation are never answered by the screen play let alone how Andrea in a matter of days by the magic of the movies becomes a soloist with the BBC Symphony orchestra something that perhaps better and more talented musicians never get to do in their lives!Ladies in Lavender is the perfect way to spend almost two hours in the company of Judi Dench and Maggie Smith two of the most beloved grand dames of the English cinema. Daniel Bruhl is a charismatic actor as he already showed in Goodbye Lenin and he is as good here. Natasha McElhone a beautiful actress plays Olga.

Almost every mature man and woman knows and understands why the US has gone in to Iraq. After it has been covered up what had been obvious to most of the Turkish and middleeastern people it was only a question of time when such a movie would come out.While Syriana reflects the dirty business of oil and corruption while Constant Gardener reflects the dirty business of pharmaceuticals and corruption and while Lord of War reflects the dirty business of gunrunners and corruption Kurtlar Vadisi Irak gives a little bit insight what is going on in a country occupied by those who want more power and more money whatever it may costs in humanlives and humandignity.About the events shown in this movie we have been aware of through various media before haven't we? So what changes our minds as mature and righteous human beings when we see those events in a movie played by actors? We should condemn them in the same way we did before no matter if it is a bombing of innocents by the occupiers or if it is a bombing of innocents by suicideattacks.Is this an antiUs movie? No this is an antiwar anticorruption and an antiimperialism movie. Kurtlar Vadisi Irak does not condemn a whole nation like once Midnight Express did in the most shabby way it damns those who know no ethical standards and show no respect to other cultures religions and nations.".

OK I don't really know if something like this container incident did really happen in Iraq but we know that many bad enough things did actually happen.There are interesting scenes e.g. where a sheik stops some fanatists from executing an American journalist and confronts them with facts why this has nothing to do with Islam or another one where he discusses with suicide bombers why their plans are wrong.This movie can help us understand how many Turkish Arabic or Muslim people feel and think. It is provocative onesided and mixes historic truth with fiction in a questionable way. However isn't that a good starting point for discussing these issues? Sometimes provocation is necessary to get people start talking. First we need to learn to talk about our own feelings. Then we can talk to each other.

So the movie has already achieved it's goal  made the people think and doubt the official propaganda that Bush's administration feeds to them.To say a few words about the movie itself  well it's definitely NOT a masterpiece of the cinema. But it's provocative and brave  that is more than enough.Way to go Turks! 10 points to you!";

Russians have been showed bad and evil for years then the Japanese then the Arabian world and it always was OK. Who says the good guys are always American ? Who says justice is being made by stars'n'stripes ? Once Oliver Stone dragged a whole country and its people in the mud and every consumer thought ooohhh yeah so this is what Turkey is about. And when the Turks complained about that movie Hollywood's answer was Hey it's just a movie. Don't take serious. Exact the same thing word is what I'm saying now Hey it's only Showbiz !!! But back to the movie.Valley of Wolves sure has some lacks in professionalism but what has to be said the movie is thrilling. Besides the American actors which are chosen very well the Turkish ones have some work to do to take place in the higher class. But of course there are also very touching moments like the Hospital visit from the main character. The special and action effects are not bad but are too limited in its volume to be really spectacle.I think it is a solid action movie and for once told from the other side than the usual hero saves the world stuff.cheers.".

The movie is based on the characters from the series but the story is completely different. It zooms in the war in Iraq with a different subjectivity than the American one. The makers of the movie could base the story on the mafia events that the viewers of the TV series were used to but they took a risk and carried the war to the screen.

The GoodThe actors all did well and I'm surprised to see so many real American actors including Busey and Zane in such a blatantly antiwar movie. The music The cinematography The editing The special effectsThe BadThe production design is cheap by movie standards. The US military uniforms are not very believable and many of the US soldiers speak with thick accents especially the jailer at Abu Ghraib. The plot is not believable with the four Turkish special forces guys taking out a LOT of American G.I.'s at the climax. The US soldiers are shown to be cartoonishly evil  one guy even kills one of his own men for threatening to tell on him for killing some Iraqi civilians! Gary Busey as a Jewish Doctor harvesting organs to send to the West  a bit far fetched.As ludicrous as it gets this movie is a real eyeopener to how the Islamic world sees us. The war is controversial and polarizing here just like this movie and most Americans are gonna love it or hate it long before they actually watch it. I liked it. One almost never sees an American nondocumentary movie with the guts to be so completely onesided especially when our questionable foreign policy is involved. US soldiers as the bad guys led by a fanatical Christian zealot is definitely not something one sees every day. This movie is kinda like THE OMEGA CODE 2 turned on its head.

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched this movie I was somewhat reminded of a mixture between a classic bad western and a Nazi propaganda movie from the forties. The historical fact consisted of Americans rounding up the headquarters of Turkish special forces operating in northern Iraq apprehending them with sacks over their heads. No reason given. No state leadership or respectively their military does ANYTHING without a reason. Here it appears the Americans are simply evil. Maybe it is arrogant of me to say the Turkish commander was an idiot for committing suicide because of being subjected to such shame instead of becoming the movies hero himself. Questions questions! So before we enter the debate about real depictions of events in Iraq let us consider what we know for facts from credible sources meaning American and German media as well as Al Jazeera English combined. Yes there are camps like Guantanamo around the world. Very ugly stuff is happening in those camps and the United States would be advised closing them down yesterday. Here we see a depiction of Abu Ghraib prison with a JewishAmerican doctor Gary Busey  the ugliest man alive who operates healthy Irqis in order to send their organs off to New York and Tel Aviv. Anyone who believes this antisemitic nonsense should pay a visit to the former death camps in Poland. Abu Ghraib being an infamous place does not even scratch the surface of camps like Auschwitz or Treblinka. Talking about Abu Ghraib. After the perverted things that took place there the American military replaced the entire company guarding it. They made it a normal prison by now knowing they have constant media attention from all over the world. Then there is a scene in which the US Army unit waits outside a wedding party until the party guests begin shooting into the air. A tradition apparently very common in the middle east. In SSmanner the soldiers who look more like irregular fighters storm the place and start killing some women and children. The remaining people get stuffed into a container headed to Abu Ghraub where Dr. Busey awaits them. In reality this event took place in Afghanistan where a Spectre gunship was flying over a wedding ceremony. The airmen on board misinterpreted the small arms fire as an attack bullets hitting the plane and subsequently opened fire killing most of the party guests. The real scandal was the Pentagon downplaying the event paying the victims families off 200 per killed person instead of openly apologizing for the tragic mistake. Going into the political analyses given in the movie would fill a book so let us do the fun part. The craft Since I watched the movie in Turkish with German subtitles I cannot say much about the actors qualities. The equipment used in the movie is a totally different thing. I have no clue where the makers of the movie bought their vehicles. CIVILIAN Hummers with tyres that look like they were stolen off a Ukrainian tractor. People damn! Old Mercedes trucks from the sixties as a means of transportation? American infantry dressed like they were Chechen mountain rebels. Some uniformed some not. Soldiers having LONG HAIR wearing helmets that look like bedpans. I guess the love revolution finally reached the US forces. Oh and the American military must have realized tanks and air support were superfluous nonsense since they did not use it in the movie. All in all this is like an islamofascistoid gory Turkish copy of the ATeam. Just like onedimensional western productions that depict Arabs as evil women beating fascistoid fanatics this flick claiming to show the other side is part of the problem not a solution.".

It's showing the real face of war in the Near East. Most of the shown are happening day by day all around the world. We are watching only sterilized pictures on TV. The reason why this film makes some people nervous is that its forcing to watch in the mirror. People with lower grades of criticism ability are not well advised by this movie.The question is Are the people in Near East or elsewhere asked whether they would like or want that kind of peace shown by the movie? One should clean the own stable before tying to clean other stables! To understand this Turkish MovieHighlight and to create an opinion about the topic in general one have to inform about their prophet Mohammed his achievements and the Islamic Culture.The mirror at the Wall says not always things we want to hear.Therefore 10 Points for an awakeshaking movie from Germany.Best regards Stephan Frumm".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw it yesterday at a local movie theater. As a turk I think it is a depiction of antiamericanism run amok in turkey. The main reason behind this attitude is the thought that if we don't stand in solidarity with our neighbor Saddam's Iraq we would be the next to be hit. In addition to this came the economical damage caused by 1991 gulf war and America's prospects of establishing a kurdish state in the oil rich areas of Iraq where also many turcomen are deported from their villages. These prospects are explained in detail in the movie.In reflecting the personalities of people from a different culture this movie is very much like midnight express. In midnight express each and every one of the turks in the movie was a sadistic villain. Likewise Kurtlar Vadisi depicts all of the Americans as plain villains. Additionaly the sight of American soldiers driving a Mercedes army truck from 60's is just hilarious. Also my personal belief is that the organ trading cannot be done officially as is depicted in the movie. With Gary Busey and Billy Zane starring it is easy to see that it could only be a Bmovie.I hate this movie as much as I hate midnight express because it does not serve a useful purpose except for making it harder for different cultures to know each other and get along.Some quotes from the movie Doctor You just can't treat those prisoners like that. They are people not animals. Sam's assistant I have more respect for animals than I have for those iraqis sir.".

It is easy to BLOG from where you sit and not realise that Turkey is in the Valley of Wolves. 30000 people have died due to terror and the 91 Gulf war nearly bankrupted the Turkish Economy. So it is unfair to put any blame on Turkey or the Turkish people for their sentiment.Keep in mind that Turkey and Israel conduct joint military operations assist each other with regards to armaments upgrades. No need to explain that the biggest threat to Turkey comes from religious and Kurdish terrorists. Please note that I said religious fanatics and not Muslim Islamic fanatics.In fact the movie stresses this difference. The movie repeatedly shows near news release events over the past 3 yrs ... arrest of Turkish Allies Abu Ghraib the Wedding Incident etc. None seemed fictional to me yes the movie is shockingly brutal No true friend or Ally can be expected to back the other 100. This is ever more true when one has been brutalised. The Turkish proverb  A frank  blunt speaking friend is better than a flattering fool comes to mind.A Democratic Secular Turkey is the LAST BEST hope for US aka Western World. You can be assured that behind the scenes Turkey has logistically supported US troops far more than anyone cares to admit. Well maybe the 2004 bombings in Istanbul showed that Al Qaida felt that the Turks had to punished.".

I love my country however we are not perfect and we all know this. BACK TO MY COMMENTS... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! I can honestly say this movie was creatively artistically done with passion. The culture the women the men the determination and love was so beautifully shown during the whole movie. The title Valley of the Volves was what made me want to watch this movie.

I love my country however we are not perfect and we all know this. BACK TO MY COMMENTS... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! I can honestly say this movie was creatively artistically done with passion. The culture the women the men the determination and love was so beautifully shown during the whole movie. The title Valley of the Volves was what made me want to watch this movie. The characters were amazing. I really loved the music it was very different and exotic and cultural. It was so beautiful. I am so buying the DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "Ticker is a strange movie. It starts out promising with a good cast nice story and lots of action. Especially after watching Out for a kill which I did 2 weeks ago this one seems to be much better. And in fact it is better especially the acting. Tom Sizemore does a good job Dennis Hopper is adequate as the bad guy and Joe Spano in a small roll is good too.So what's wrong? First of all Steven Seagall obviously gained a lot of weight. He just sits there at his desk or in his car except for the last 15 minutes or so when finally he decides to kick some ass. However it is painfully clear that for the action scenes a standin is used. I replayed these scenes in slow motion to verify this and it is very obvious. Shame on Steven for this.A lot of scenes are really dark which makes it very hard to see what's happening. Also some of the scenes are too chaotic with good and bad guys running around looking the same. Out for a kill had the same problem.Right at the start of the movie the scene where Seagal's troops jump out of the helicopter by ropes it is clear that the rope is hanging in a studio. Besides I have no idea why these bomb experts would land on the roof while they know there's a bomb in the basement.The blue screen car scene with Dennis Hopper and Jaime Pressly has been mentioned a few times already. It is good for a few unintended laughs. The same goes for Hoppers parttime Irish accent the old police cars with wrong plates and the police choppers without even the word police on them.Later on Jaime blows up the BMW convertible with Hopper in it. It is painfully obvious that the car that's blown up is another model a much older 4 doors saloon instead of the 2 doors convertible. There's even another car visible blowing up right next to the BMW. I don't know where it came from. Even the surrounding buildings are different before and during the explosion. I suspect this explosion was taken from another movie.The final scenes take place in city hall where a bal masqu is going on. The room where this takes place looks like a discotheque. Now really what city hall would look like that? Not surprisingly this scene too is taken from another movie.Near the end Steven walks up the stairs towards the roof of city hall to dismantle the bomb on the roof. However several men with machine guns are sitting there. When they start shooting Steven decides to walk back. Walk not run or jump even when men firing their guns come after him he takes his time to get some cover. My grandfather walks faster than that.Finally two bombs have to be dismantled. One is in the basement and Sizemore has to take care of this one following instructions by Seagall. This is the right time for Seagal to preach some Zen before telling Sizemore how to deal with the bomb. When the bomb in the basement is secured Seagal takes care of the other one. This is really easy. He just cuts some wires the timer stops and that's the end of the movie. No suspense no final fight no good feelings.My rating 410. One point because this one's better than Out for a kill one for Tom Sizemore one for... I don't know. And one for Steven Seagall for old times sake.Better rent The Glimmerman or one of the other old style Seagl flicks.".

	schema:reviewBody "UP until a month ago I had no idea that this film even existed. Upon seeing it I wish it would have stayed that way. I only seen it because I knew Steven Seagal was part of a very promising cast that included Denis Hopper Tom Sizemore rapper Nas and Jamie Pressly. When I think action such films as Die Hard Lethal Weapon and Under Siege come to mind as great examples of what action should be based on. This film rips off every one of those films. The story features a terrorist bomber who is blowing up the city Die Hard a cop on the edge Lethal Weapon and Steven Seagal Under Siege. But in action a rip off of another film isn't a bad thing as long it is done with excitement and style. This film has all the right elements to be an action classic but fails horribly under its bad direction terrible script and dreadful acting. Hopper plays Swann the philosophical Irish bomber who thinks he is creating art by blowing things up. Sizemore is Nettles a cop on the edge who is going to blow if he doesn't went some of his frustration from having his wife and son blown up by a car bomb or so his partners say. Lastly Seagal is head of the bomb squad named Glass for some reason none of the main characters have first names who lost some men a year early to a bomb call gone wrong and decides to preach about the morals of life to other people. The story is standard action fare that would seem solid enough for a few decent jolts of action and the first scene the one where Glass losses his men packs one heck of a blast no pun intended. But after that scene ends and we fastforward one year later the film crashes under its terrible acting and scripting. The actors are given nothing to work with and show it by the very little they produce. Seagal seems like he is bored and could fall asleep any minute but I don't blame him the whole time he just sits around and tells people what to do he only gets one five minute fight scene towards the end of the film. Hopper is so bad it is almost laughable in fact it is just plain hilarious. He speaks with an Irish accent only when he feels the need to and in one scene he even sounded German for a minute. I guess that explains why he has a goatee and wears glasses I wouldn't want anyone to know it was me either. Sizemore actually does a good job at acting well as good as one can expect from Sizemore. Just to bad the character he is acting isn't the one from this film. He is supposed to be a cop on the edge but I wouldn't have known he had a problem unless everyone around him wouldn't have always been telling him he did. Nettles and Glass both have one thing in common the both have had a past tragedy but neither of them once touch on their inner problems Glass doesn't even seem to care about what happened at the start and aside from two flashback scenes Sizemore doesn't seem to either. If this film were a game to see who could deliver the most inept performance they all would have won. The plot takes us nowhere fast and when it finally seems to want to go somewhere we realize that it hasn't really advance after all it has just pulled in a scene from some other movie and hoped no one would notice. The direction is also so bad to a point where it is laughable. There is a scene in which Swann and Claire Jamie Pressly are driving in a car against on of the worst blue screen effects I have ever seen. To make matters even worse when Claire tells him to pull over the background almost doubles in speed and then comes to an instant stop. It really has to be seen to be believed I even found myself rewinding several times just to make sure my eyes weren't just playing tricks on me. This effect was so bad I almost spilt my sides from laughing. Now I am not biased towards this film I happen to love nobrainer action flicks but this film relies too much on a plot that is nonexistent and not enough of action sequences. Along from the films opening the only other action scene is the climax with a few small explosions inbetween that don't account for the bad scripting acting and directing making this one of the lower point in action history.".

Very derivative lazy and uninteresting story. The only reason I thought I would check this out was for Tom Sizemore who was an excellent actor that appeared in Heat Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down and plus Steven Seagal when he had box office appeal. I thought Steven Seagal's role would be identical to his role in Executive Decision but its not. Here in Ticker he was just going through the motions with very minimal effort so he could get his paycheck. Dennis Hopper was very uninspiring as the villain. He was great as the villain in Blue Velvet and Speed but here is is just sleepwalking though his role.Apparently director Albert Pyun hated the completed version of this movie and I don't blame him in the slightest. I would disown this movie too.If you are a fan of Tom Sizemore Dennis Hopper or Steven Seagal by all means check it out but you will be very very disappointed at how bad this movie is.

	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer I like Albert Pyun's films.  But Ticker is awful.  I don't know how it could have happened.  OK I suppose I do know how it happened. It was after all pretty easy to spot the doubles used for the actors in over half the film as well as the bad looping accompanying it.

My advice to others if you feel the masochistic desire to see the DVD and have any interest at all in the commentary just watch it with the commentary the first time and get it done with.  You won't miss a thing from the movie as minutes  nay entire chapters  go by without either of the guys saying a word.

	schema:headline " A rubbish action film so incompetent it's something of a guilty pleasure";
	schema:reviewBody "Albert Pyun. The name of this director will leave a bad taste in the mouths of any selfrespecting Zgrade movie fan out there. For more than a decade Pyun has effortlessly and I mean that in a literal sense churned out one rubbishy movie after another generally cheap science fiction films with only the minimal levels of editing and postproduction work. So far he's only managed one halfway decent movie CYBORG and his latest film TICKER is yet another bomb and that's also in the literal sense of the word. Despite the man's lack of talent and budget bad film lovers still find themselves drawn to Pyun's work like moths to a flame only to get burned by his sheer ineptitude and to steer well clear for a long time afterwards. Like the body of Pyun's work TICKER is a pretty awful movie but not without interest watching it with friends or relatives is a sure fire way to spend an enjoyable evening just having a laugh at all the poor points this film has to offer.The plot is one of those runofamill edgy cop vs. terrorist thriller stories that were run into the ground back in the '90s. Maybe the scripting will save this film I thought sadly not as it never rises above the norm. Everything about this film screams cheap television movie but it can't even achieve that no network would finance Pyun to create his abominations let alone broadcast them. Nope the only reason I watched this film was for the cast. Taking the lead of the maverick cop is a downonhisluck Tom Sizemore usually seen in bigger budget fare like RED PLANET who surprisingly puts in a halfway decent performance despite the lack of professionality in all other departments. Although his character is clichd and hard to believe Sizemore makes a good job of it and does the best he can. I wasn't disappointed.On the other hand Dennis Hopper is very disappointing as the villain but hilariously so. Slumming his way through a terrorist role which is a direct reprise of his villain in SPEED Hopper doesn't even try here. To make matters worse he attempts a ludicrous Irish accent which comes and goes throughout the movie with much hilarity. Apparently Hopper is a member of the IRA and hangs around with a couple of other shifty guys in long black trench coats like they've failed auditions for THE MATRIX. Poor old Hopper. A long way from his glory days and hard to believe that his career has reached this low an ebb.Thirdbilled and barely bothering to sit up from his chair where he spends two thirds of the running time Steven Seagal is a long way from his recent cinematic success with EXIT WOUNDS. It's like he doesn't even bother in this movie. He never gets out of his seat instead he just sits around and talks weird dialogue in his role of a laidback bomb expert. Fans looking for some trademark Seagal action will find it in short supply. After piling on the pounds and having grown a ridiculously large ponytail this old and tired Seagal is far from the lithe and pounding NICO ABOVE THE LAW he gave us fifteen odd years ago. To add insult to injury he doesn't even get to do any martial arts until the very end of the film where some tackedon scenes show him fighting a bunch of guys in a dark corridor. A small poorlychoreographed pleasure but the lack of action before this moment led me to jump from my chair shouting in admiration for Seagal having been starved of the bonebreaking I'm used to from the rest of his career.The rest of the cast barely registers. The less said about Jaime Pressley's performance the better although she is an attractive actress and should have been used far more. Some rap stars turn up for little more than cameos but why? And who put the stock footage of IceT into this movie and for what reason? Speaking of stock footage Pyun is up to his old tricks here shooting scenes with actors alone and cutting them in with other actors to make it look like they're in the thick of the action. Seagal often has a body double especially noticeable at the ending walking in silhouette and during a fight scene. He even has a voice double to cut costs. Same thing for Hopper you see the back of his head and can tell it's a guy thirty years younger with spraypainted grey hair. The funniest moment in the film comes when the good guys swarm city hall and we're treated to footage of some laughing goons at a Halloween party being evacuated. What the heck? Sheer bliss incompetence you don't often see in modern cinema fare. Things like this make TICKER something of a guilty pleasure although far from a good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seagal is certainly capable of making entertaining Action films. But with the crop he's done DTV you certainly wouldn't detect that in the slightest. Ticker is a shameless attempt for these big stars to obviously make a quick buck. All of them look less than thrilled to be involved with this especially Dennis Hopper who should be ashamed himself. The action is very cheap looking as it relies on boring looking explosions and stock footage taken from other films. Albert Pyun is notorious for making many horrible lowbudget projects and this one is no different. I saw this many years ago and despite the fact that I was more open to those films back then I thought it was horrible than as well too. Tom Sizemore is probably the best of the star lot here but that really isn't saying much. It's very hard to get through and the action is pretty much nonexistent aside from a couple of brief fight sequences provided by Seagal of course at the end.Performances. Steven Seagal is not at his worst here but he's clearly not any good. His deep mysterious talk of Brother gets old quickly and he certainly doesn't look that motivated. Tom Sizemore looks drugged out half the time and looks ashamed to be a part of this. Dennis Hopper should be ashamed of himself for being involved in this. His accent is laughable and wanders around the film aimlessly spurting his lines with no emotion. Jaime Pressley looks good but that is about it. They throw in a bunch of rappers who can't act either. Nas is the worst though.Bottom line. Ticker is where it belongs in cheap bargain bins. Even in that scenario your better off finding something else. Ticker is godawful in every sense of the word and ranks among Seagal's worst.010".

	onyx:emotionText "Seagal is certainly capable of making entertaining Action films. But with the crop he's done DTV you certainly wouldn't detect that in the slightest. Ticker is a shameless attempt for these big stars to obviously make a quick buck. All of them look less than thrilled to be involved with this especially Dennis Hopper who should be ashamed himself. The action is very cheap looking as it relies on boring looking explosions and stock footage taken from other films. Albert Pyun is notorious for making many horrible lowbudget projects and this one is no different. I saw this many years ago and despite the fact that I was more open to those films back then I thought it was horrible than as well too. Tom Sizemore is probably the best of the star lot here but that really isn't saying much. It's very hard to get through and the action is pretty much nonexistent aside from a couple of brief fight sequences provided by Seagal of course at the end.Performances. Steven Seagal is not at his worst here but he's clearly not any good. His deep mysterious talk of Brother gets old quickly and he certainly doesn't look that motivated. Tom Sizemore looks drugged out half the time and looks ashamed to be a part of this. Dennis Hopper should be ashamed of himself for being involved in this. His accent is laughable and wanders around the film aimlessly spurting his lines with no emotion. Jaime Pressley looks good but that is about it. They throw in a bunch of rappers who can't act either. Nas is the worst though.Bottom line. Ticker is where it belongs in cheap bargain bins. Even in that scenario your better off finding something else. Ticker is godawful in every sense of the word and ranks among Seagal's worst.010";

Swan needs Claire so phones the police demanding that Claire be let go or he'll blow lots of things up which will kill people lots of people. Nettles teams up with the bomb squad  Lieutenant Frank Glass Steven Seagal who is the one in charge to track down Swan  disarm his bombs erm that's about it really.Directed by Albert Pyun this film has a pretty bad reputation which I'm sad to report it fully deserves. Things got off to a bad start when I saw the 'Nu Image' logo appear prior to the films commencement my heart literally sank as I'm one of the few poor souls who has actually sat through some of their giant 'creature feature' flicks so my hopes for Ticker were not high  despite that I still felt let down. The script by Paul B. Margolis is awful the character's are awful the dialogue is awful the story is awful things happen to accommodate the copious use of footage stolen from other 'Nu Image' films  the fact the three main 'stars' who are all packing some serious excess weight around their belly's probably never met each other  were probably only available for short times means the script was also tailored for this  it just ends up looking  feeling an absolute mess. Ticker is just awful I've seen some terrible Seagal flicks but even I think this is probably his worst film  believe me that's saying something. As for respectable actors such as Tom Sizemore  Dennis Hopper they should know better  are far too good for crap like this. The only good aspect of Ticker is that it actually had a decent plot twist towards the end but coming in such a bad film it matters little.Director Pyun turns in a terrible film the action scenes are absolutely terrible since almost all of the explosions  action is stolen from other films footage from Deadly Outbreak 1996 makes for the opening explosion of the senator's house The Last Days of Frankie the Fly 1997 steals footage of Dennis Hopper The Peacekeeper 1997 accounts for virtually the entire final 20 minutes  it also uses footage from Sweepers 1998. The continuity is absolutely horrible the sites of explosions changes between shots the things that are blowing up changes cars change types the number of passengers in them changes  this is just a really badly cheaply made flick that is quite frankly a disaster on every level.The IMDb says Ticker cost 25000000 to make no disrespect but that's bull. The makers have said that it cost a lot less  director Pyun has said in interviews that it cost a mere 600000  was shot in just 11 days  I believe him. Apparently Hopper was only on set for 1 day  never met any of his costars his Irish accent is terrible  I think you can see he knows the films junk  he isn't really trying. In fact Hopper's role as a mad bomber holding a city to ransom isn't a million miles from his role in Speed 1994 having said that Seagal playing a hard as nails karate kicking cop is more or less the same role as every other film he's been in as well. Why actor's like Sizemore Hopper Seagal  Peter Greene agreed to do Ticker is beyond me. IceT also makes a small appearance at the end.Ticker is an awful film there are some unintentionally hilarious moments in it which makes it one of those car crash films which are a complete disaster but you can't take your eyes off it. Do yourself a favour  give this one a miss.".

	schema:reviewBody "During one of my frequent visits to IMDb I checked out Albert Pyun's page of cinematic offenses and noticed that the guy is responsible for at least half of what I would call the worst movies of the 90's. He has now moved into the 21st century with a new bomb appropriately called Ticker.I try to give as much credit as possible to filmmakers as I know how difficult it can be to even get a film off the ground. And considering the calibre of actors appearing in Ticker I was fully prepared to give credit to veteran director Albert Pyun if credit were due.It isn't.As someone else already mentioned it is amazing that this guy still finds people to finance his films. I can name of the top of my head a few people who could all have made better entertainment with that squandered budget me my mother my grandmother hey even my cat...I am also amazed that actors such as Tom Sizemore Dennis Hopper and yes even Steven Seagal would appear in such films. Sizemore and Hopper in the hands of worthy directors are superb. In the hands of Pyun look like there having no fun at all and subsequently do little to help an already pathetic film such as this. The plot A mad bomber Dennis Hopper is for reasons unclear blowing up the city. Tom Sizemore is the detective out to stop him with or without the aid of the zen preaching leader of the bomb squad Steven Seagal. add also the beautiful Jamey Preissly as the Hopper's girlfriend who is detained by Sizemore. There is also a bunch of insignifigant bombers in black swat suits led by Ice T and a bunch of other guys in black swat suits whom are really members of the swat team making them impossible to distinguish. In other words this is one big mess in desperate need of some talented direction. But I do recommend Ticker. I had a great laugh watching it seeing Seagal using 10 seconds to waddle down 6 stairs while being shot at by a group of men 20 feet away with M16 rifles and hitting nothing listening to Hopper's Irish accent appear disappear reappear and so on watching the evacuation of a town hall government building of some kind it wasn't clear when what we are shown is a night club evac scene lifted directly out of another film and hundreds of other serious and obvious inconsistencies unfold before your eyes. For the purpose of hilarity and ridicule Ticker is great fun and lands firmly in the category of so bad it's good.".

Seagal is so out of shape that when they show his supposed karate scenes they only show glimpses of his hands moving and mostly show the person he's attacking as it may not even be him doing the karate chops. In a few scenes where he's doing roundhouse style kicks I'm pretty sure they had a stunt double stand in for him as they only show the legs and not who's they are.  I'm pretty sure the guy is too fat to actually get his legs up in the air.  In the shootout scenes with Seagal there will be like 5 or more guys spraying him with machine gun fire but none of them will hit him. He will then either shoot them or waddle over and throw a few karate chops and knock them unconscious.  The plot is so lame its almost funny.  The movie basically ends with Seagal and his cohort disarming two bombs with just a few seconds left on the timers.  gee how original is that?  this was the quality of a bad madeforTV movie.  The only possible redeeming quality of this movie is that it is somewhat humorous it is so bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Promise directed by Chen Kaige who directed the excellent but depressing Farewell My Concubine is pretty much being hated by people everywhere on this database. Everybody claims that it's not a real martial arts film that the cast is terrible the special effects are cheesy the story is garbage and the directing is just plain awful. Well there is some truth in some of those comments. But instead of looking at it a negative way one should look at those negatives with a glass halffull approach and one realize there is a very enjoyable movie underneath all this massive criticism.Yes The Promise is not a martial arts movie i'll be the first to admit that. It's such a shame that this movie is being compared to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Hero because this movie is not at all like those films. For starters this movie is less Jet Li and more Lord of the Rings but with an Asian influence. That being said i found that element of the movie quite intriguing for the costumes and the cultures of the characters in the movie made me feel as if i were reading a fantasy novel rather than merely watching a martial arts film. Furthermore since this movie is not a martial arts film really one should realize that this movie isn't about China contrary to what many people think. So it makes sense that there is a range of other Asian actors in this film despite what everyone else making it out that it is ludicrous. The director Chen Kaige wanted to present a story in a land that was just limited to Chinese people Japanese people or one simple Asian people. He wanted to create his own land with his own people perhaps his own mythology one could say. I find it quite intriguing when people create their own mythology after all it works for Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino why can't it work for Kaige? So the story excels not perfect but it is still intriguing enough. So what about the acting? Not superb either but still quite solid. Though i was a little disappointed in Cecilia Cheung i was surprisingly enamored with Nicholas Tse. For some reason his character had me hooked intrigued and his role at the ending may be either clever or stupid depending on your openness to this movie. Hiroyuki Sanada was also quite a surprise but i felt a little let down by his performance as well expecting perhaps too much from a character that was limited. As for the slave Kunlun he perhaps had a very stellar performance as the slave turned hero but to me he didn't compare to Nicholas Tse.The effects of the movie aren't the greatest at times they are cheesy and some part even had me chuckle a bit making me feel as if i were watching an anime film and not a real movie. Yet contrary to what many people say it doesn't take anything away from the movie. And as far as the directing i believe Chen Kaige did a fantastic job. He is a very underrated director which is hard to say for a guy that won the 1993 Cann Palm D'or but i believe he needs to have some supporters with all the critique he gets from movie audiences all over the world.The Promise is a glorious film and i was enamored with it from beginning to end. It may not be one of the best Asian films out there Wong Kar Wai is still the king of Asian Cinema and i'm still scratching my head on why the government of China would sponsor a film like this considering it really is about any Chinese history whatsoever but it is enjoyable. If you're looking for a fun fantasy romance that has a little bit more substance than the simple hack and slash fantasy film this is your call. If you're looking though for a dramatic martial arts film in the mold of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon you might be a little disappointed. But nonetheless it's a good film that deserves recognition.".

As the title suggests the film is about a promise or a series of promises and the events they set into motion. The story unfolds slowly as fairy tales do and it's a visual stunner. The sets and costumes are rich and vibrantly colored and the music and cinematography were breathtakingly beautiful. The subtitles were actually poetic! This film is pure fantasy and watching it is like watching a painting in motion. Forget realism  it's a fairytale and must be approached with that in mind. It is not what I would describe as a martial arts film although there is some stylized fighting a la Crouching Tiger. But unlike that film I would probably be willing to allow my 8yearold son to watch this film with me alongside as it was not graphically violent certainly not like Lord of the Rings and was such a magical fairytale. People who see this film expecting one of those classic martial arts films will be disappointed because that's not what this film is about. I suspect the many negative comments on this board are from people who had other expectations I had none when I saw this film and was utterly delighted.I loved that it surprised me in how it ended an ending that moved me to tears.

Rather compare it to the many serials on Chinese television with flying goddesses and white haired sorcerers in fiery caves. The Promise is a deluxe version of these folk legends visually stunning beautifully coloured and with all the lack of logic you also find in European fairy tales and folk stories.

	schema:reviewBody "When the world was young laid a Kingdom between the Land of Snow and the Barbarian Territory where gods and men lived side by side and promises were lies. When the poor and starving orphaned girl Qingcheng meets the Goddess Manshen Hong Chen she accepts to become the wealthy beauty of beauties with the curse that she would lose every man she loves unless three things happen snow falls in the spring time moves backwards and the dead comes back to life. Years later the slave Kunlun DongKun Jang helps the Great General Master of the Crimson Armor Guangming Hiroyuki Sanada to defeat a barbarian army with almost seven times more warriors and Kunlun becomes his slave. When Guangming is wounded he asks Kunlun to wear his armor and save the king from the cruel Duke of the North Wuhuan Nicholas Tse that put the Imperial City under siege with his army. However Kunlun kills the king to save Princess Qingcheng Cecilia Cheung and promises her to never let her die. Princess Qingcheng falls in love for the man of the crimson armor that she believes is General Guangming. When Snow Wolf Ye Liu saves Kunlun and brings him to the Land of Snow he recollects his childhood when his mother and sister were killed by the evil Wuhuan. Kunlun decides to return to the Kingdom to face Wuhuan and fight for his love.Wu Ji is one of the most beautiful fantasies that I have ever seen and I list this magnificent film among my favorites. The story has romance magic betrayal loyalty action supported by a stunning cinematography great screenplay wonderful special effects and awesome direction and performances. This film is surprisingly underrated in IMDb with and user rating of 5.6. Cecilia Cheung is one of the most beautiful actresses of cinema and is perfect in the role of the Beauty of Beauties. In the end fate can be changed. My vote is nine.Title Brazil A Promessa The Promise".

While it's obvious a film that could have been better it still offers a stunning look that Chen Kaige has given it. It helps he was working with an excellent cinematographer Peter Pau who photographed this film with lovingly care. The result are exquisite images that might not mean a lot to the fans of films of this genre but will delight others like this viewer who is not into this type of fantasy film. The music of Klaus Badelt plays well in the context of the movie. The film has some of the fabulous costumes of any film in recent memory.It's easy to dismiss the film as a total failure. Other more recent fare is cited as being much better which could be true. But actually to experience the film as a gorgeous fantasy out of the talented director Chen Kaige's mind is worth the price of admission. Unfortunately judging by the screening we attended recently this film has not found an audience.DongKunJang is impressive as Kunlun. Hiroyuki Sanada also does good work as the General Quianming. The gorgeous Cecilia Cheung lends her beauty to her character Princess Qingcheng.The director will surely recover from this experience and concentrate on a more worthwhile story for his next venture. Chen Kaige deserves better and he will surely rise from the ashes like the magnificent phoenix he is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that this is a very good film in spite of what many people on this board have said. It is however a very different kind of film altogether it is almost a pure transposition of folk tale to film with all of the magic and illogic and quirky plotting that such tales involve. Films that attempt to transposetranslate comic books to film do so best when they manage to get the 'tone' of the comic onto the screen and recreate as much as possible the graphic and narrative style of the comic. The Promise does this effectively for folktalemyth.I should probably add that I also like Operetta Tanuki Goten by Suzuki Seijun which is also working the same territory albeit in a very different way. Chen's film also references highly formalistic genres like Beijing Opera hence the acting styles are sometimes very far from the boring realism of most contemporary film. Viewers who complain of a lack of realism or believable emotion in films like these should try to climb Rapunzel's hair and stick to classic fare like Red Sorghum and Farewell My Concubine which brilliant though they are work in the very familiar idiom of 'Art Film' and provide no difficulty for the kind of viewer who used to say I don't watch TV but I really like Masterpiece Theatre.Yimou and Kaige with their latest films are pushing Chinese film and therefore international film in new directions altogether and part of that push is clearly an attempt to escape the heavy yoke of the 'European Art Film' tradition the 'quirkyIndieimitationthereof' tradition and the narrow confines of the various 'martial arts film' traditions as well. I say good on them and shame to those who won't celebrate creative development because it betrays their deeply conservative and traditionalist expectations. As to the suggestion that their recent work betrays a kind of Hollywoodification all I can say is huh?".

Most of the the themes are very serious ones like lovehonor and betrayal. Only the ending was a bit confusingbut I think they did that to add some extra dimension or mystery to the story. I understand why many reviewers were a bit disappointed with this movie as they were expecting a martial arts movie. Although there is some martial arts this movie isn't about that.

And we were supposed to have seen the King killed and known Kunlun was going to do it as part of the theme of destiny being impossible to change. The entire movie's overall plot was based on destiny and that whole scene was a major part of establishing Kunlun's destiny to be with Qingcheung and the General's destiny to lose the armor and his status. There were more edits and changes made also. All of them important to the storyline. It wasn't even the same movie anymore! I'm extremely angry with the Director Chen Kaige for doing this to his work or allowing it to be done. The China Version on DVD is way better and I'm sticking to that. The only thing that save it for me was the acting performances. I recommend seeing More Nic Tse Movies like Jade Goddess of Mercy or Moving Targets or New Police Story with Jakie Chan.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was truly so bad that I laughed pretty much the whole way through it. Then when I heard it was going to play in the US theaters I was so embarrassed that the US audience is going to see this movie and think that this is what Chinese cinema is all about. First off I've read many of the comments on the message boards where people who blasted this movie have been called by other posters as westernminded and ignorant of Asian culture. Let me just state that yes I was raised in the US but I was born in Taiwan and raised by my parents who were born in China. I saw this movie with both of my parents and all three of us hated it. What was bad about it? Just about everything. To list it all would take up too much time so let me just list a few of the most terrible bitsThe special effects it was so special it looks like some guy just made it up on his home computer and slapped it on. I heard that this was a bigbudget movie. Obviously none of that money went towards real special effects. Most of the video games I've played had better graphics. In fact most of the lowbudget TV dramas from China and Taiwan had better special effects. The plot I'll admit the idea that this girl can have everything she wants in life except love is a good plot. But the way the rest of the story plays out basically have next to nothing to do with this. The characters I get that this is a fantasy movie so things don't have to be believable. But some of the things these characters do just end up being so illogical as to boggle my mind. Why were the Emperor and his mistress standing on top of the roof of their palace when there's a huge army waiting to kill them down on the ground? Isn't that a surefire way for arrows to hit them?By the end of this movie and I'll confess I have no idea what happened in the end because I was beyond caring at that point I was crying tears of boredom. The plot started out as somewhat interesting and just descended into garbage from there on. None of the characters were likable and I could really care less what happened to them. Some people have issues with the accents of the actors but I can overlook that since it is a fantasy movie. The only redeeming quality of this movie is possibly the pretty colors. Everything else the martial arts the costumes and yes the special effects was just so blah and have been done a hundred times better in countless other movies.".

As the years went by inspired by Hollywood fame and fortune but lacking the heart and soul of Ang Lee Zhang went ahead to make flashy and empty Heroes and outright trashy House of Flying Dagger. Chen finally cannot resist the lure and made The promise which however shows who is still master when compared with Zhang who seems anxious to show the world in Heroes that he is incapable of handling more than one colour scheme in a frame.Still flashy and showy The promise at least does not pretend to be anything else other than a fantasy of raw emotions. The characters at least are interesting. In her idiotic simplicity Cecilia Cheung's character has a degree of fascination. The four men provide a field of varied contrasts and are well casted. The simple allgoodness slave is convincingly portrayed by Korean Jang DongKun. Japanese Sanada Hiroyuki has the flare and charisma for the indomitable spirit of the general who is all egos. Then it is certainly a pleasure to see Nicholas Tse in a role that could have been written for Johnny Depp the evil and slightly campy duke. The one I like best however is Liu Ye in a role that better than perfect for him tragic to the bones.Nothing much to say about the photography and CGI effects other than keep your eyes wild open for the entire movie if you like that sort of thing. The script because it is set within the realm of COMPLETE FANTASY is surprisingly well done and even coherent. Not such a bad movie from director Chen for the Hollywood market and certainly far superior to the two turned out by his excameraman I mentioned.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Promise";
	schema:reviewBody "The trailers the posters the casting all looked promising. Sadly the storyline is one heck of a convoluted one and I hate to use the word but absurd is what The Promise is.This is a fantasy picture as promoted and true enough it is so much that you have to leave your brains at the door. In trying to sound intelligent the plot fumbles and ended up really unconvincing. It's all style and little substance. To associate this with martial arts films is to insult the genre and one shouldn't even mention this film nor compare it to Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It's time filmmakers wake up to the idea that CTHD is a oneoff that cannot be replicated. Do not try to go one up by having characters fly faster higher harder. Or run so fast they can break the spacetime continuum and time travel. Science fiction this is not.Yet you cannot fault the cinematography which seemed beautiful until a closer scrutiny makes it so obvious that it's CGI created. Think Storm Rider's special effects in the creation of its world there is no improvement in the refinement of graphics in The Promise after so many years. Does this mean that only the West can come up with believable CGI worlds for audiences? Plot loopholes are abound and you can drive a horde of running bulls right through it. You also get the usual villain driven soliloquy at the finale explaining his grudge he unbelievably held for so long and the lengths he goes to settle it and some homosexual undertones in one of the minor characters too. Hip? Guess not. What fails in plot delivery is having drag on what is obvious to the audience but not to a character for too long. In fact almost the entire length of the movie. It wearies the audience and insults the audience's intelligence.So what's this movie about? It's a love triangle of sorts between a Princess Cecilia Cheung a General of the Crimson Army Japan's Hiroyuki Sanada and his slave Kunlun Korea's Jang Dong Gun. Playing the chief villain is Nicholas Tse whose pretty boy looks probably made his character less threatening. Destiny is the running theme of the movie where each character is destined for certain goals and events and one in which is set in stone. Cursed by a fairy when young the Princess is not to find true love until impossible conditions are met. And the General too is foretold the elements leading to his impending death. What started off plotwise as promising degenerated into a web of blah which I wince at by just recalling it.Are there any saving graces in the movie? Yes but they are few. Look out for the fights involving Nicholas Tse where I thought his use of the fan as a lethal boomerang was a marvel to watch. Cecilia Cheung also lit up the screen but not for her acting nor the character's development though. The editing of a love scene too was uncalled for to get a PG rating so that more audiences could fill the theatres. I reckon the word of mouth for this film will unsettle that. Hiroyuki Sanada and Jang Dong Gun I guess tried their best with the flimsily weak storyline to deliver their lines in Mandarin. Better that way too with the rubbish I hope they don't understand.If there is any movie which failed to live up to its hype this movie is it miserably. I'm sad to say that this is easily one of the worst films of the year. One more thing they should have subtitled the opening titles explaining the background of the movie too if they want to target nonmandarin speaking audiences. Slipshoddy careless start to a Chen Kaige disappointment.".

OK so the events in the film don't always make sense and the story jumps around from plot point to plot point like the people who made it were on crack  but it's really not that far removed from the whimsical randomness of a story that you tell while gathered with your family in front of a fire or sitting at a child's bedside. And for capturing the essence of that type of story I think The Promise succeeds admirably. Even when the special effects range from gorgeous to laughably bad since it's never really exactly supposed to be realistic anyway a guy running so fast he can fly a woman tied to a length of rope like a kite? so IMHO it doesn't really detract from the story.That being said I'm sure there will be many viewers who will find the story moronic the acting deplorable and the technical aspects terrible even despite approaching it from the angle that I described above...

From here the plot thickens as a faster than light assassin dressed totally in black with a gothy white pale face named Snow Wolf Liu Ye is sent to kill Guangming and only injures him after seeing Kunlun and telling him that he comes from The Land of Snow. Now Kunlun is ordered to go to the capital wearing Guangming's crimson armor and to save the King. From here point the movie runs into trouble as the story and plot aren't very convincing. The acting is mostly cartoonish and wooden like a fairy tale. Only Kunlun is believable in his role as he is the only character that truly emotes and has some substance on the screen and instills some empathy in the viewer. Wuhuan turns into the stock villain with the tiny pencil mustache with traps and schemes Guangming is the halfhearted hero with destructive secret and Qingcheng is the princess in peril and generally unsympathetic. The Promise is a good wuxia movie a blend of martial arts and fantasy that will suspend your beliefs only if you allow it. It is simply a fairy tale that is a good piece of escapist entertainment. The Promise is not as terrible as you might think if you believe all the bad reviews online. I really don't know what movie they saw but it certainly wasn't what I just watched. Give it a chance since it is far more entertaining a movie than nearly all the of Hollywood movies of last year and very much deserving of a wider audience.".

I was also annoyed by the way the actors spoke in the movie. They looked like they haven not eaten for several days. It goes to show what a bad script and direction can do to actors like Hiroyuki Sanada who was so good in The Last Samurai like Ye Liu who was won some awards in Lan yu. It would be hard to imagine that the good actors in this film didn't know it was a turkey when they were making it.As for someone who enjoyed CGI I have to say that even CGI was ridiculous sometimes since it was not necessary. It made this movie like a bad animation movie.So if you have absolutely nothing else to do you may want to watch this one once. Otherwise my suggestion is avoid this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Only a handful of Belgian movies haven't given me the feeling that they were produced locally and with a limited budget. This is one of them not surprisingly because it was done with a larger budget than usual but still quite small by Hollywood standards. I feel it has everything in place to rival any Hollywood production. The most important asset of the movie however is veteran actor Jan Decleir a man who was already indirectly nominated a few times for the Oscars via the foreign movies section. Jan Decleir is brilliant and outclasses everyone else on the set as he often does. The rest of the cast consists of good and not so good actors some come from terrible Flemish soap series but somehow everyone seems to rise above himherself on this occasion and everyone deliver a decent performance. The photography camerawork everything's done quite professionally. The difference with many Hollywood action movies is the fact that the plot is quite good. The fact that the main character has Alzheimer's and that he has to use his ever shrinking mental capabilities to finish his quest is an original twist. People will compare Alzheimer's to Memento because of the main character's memory loss. But Memento was conceived to challenge viewers to baffle them to be perceived as intelligent and artistic. By contrast this movie is more down to Earth more realistic and in the end simply something completely different. It's nothing more than an original copmovie good entertainment and certainly something I'd recommend even to non Belgian or nonDutch speaking viewers. Plans are underway for a Hollywood remake of this movie so it must be other people have recognized its potential too. One word of caution though. Many people say the movie is a bit too long. That's a sentiment I share. At the end the plot loses a bit of its strength. But overall i'd label 'De zaak Alzheimer' a good movie.".

The emphatic character of Angelo Ledda is played by the unknown actor Jan Decleir and I was really impressed with his acting. I have just seen in IMDb that De Zaak Alzheimer won seven prizes and three nominations in European Festivals and this movie certainly deserved these awards.

Movies featuring a character with Alzheimer's are often somber bittersweet weepers. The Memory of a Killer is nothing like that.It's a taut fastpaced noir with a protagonist who lives by the same code as that of Alain Delon in Jean Pierre Melville's Le Samourai or Jean Gabin in Touchez Pas Au Grisbi. The hit man Angelo Ledda is portrayed by Belgian actor Jan Decleir. He won his country's top acting award and other European festival honors for his nuanced empathic performance.How Ledda knows what's happening to his mind is explained in a way totally credible to anyone who has known someone suffering from this disease. Even as his mind slips away he retains his morality about certain crimes and that code eventually sends him in directions that surprise and anger his employer. Ledda's crimes and related crimes drive two police investigators  and Ledda  in a race against time. The plot threads become as tangled and mysterious as the tangles in Ledda's diseased mind and unravel in a stunning conclusion.This film was made by Belgian director Erik Van Looy whose stylish work won top honors along with Decleir. The film is based on the novel De Zaak Alzheimer by popular Belgian detective novelist Jef Geeraerts. Hopefully it and his other novels will be translated into English. Geeraerts' psychological approach evokes another Belgian writer the incomparable Georges Simenon. This is the first of Geeraerts' stories to reach the big screen and Hollywood has bought the rights to a remake. Don't wait see the original. Decleir's portrayal should not be missed.".

Although based on a novel this stylish police thriller's main conceit hitman has Alzheimer's could have been lifted from a Hollywood film executive's idea of high concept. Except that it would have made a forgettable Hollywood picture. Instead director Van Looy sets this story in his native Belgium. Police detectives Vincke and Verstuyft are like a modern day Starsky and Hutch without the bad haircuts. Who knew that Antwerp even had police never mind such cool ones? Their job is to track down the man who's killed several highprofile politicians and a young child prostitute.Reminding me a lot of Terence Stamp in The Limey veteran actor Jan Decleir portrays aging hitman Angelo Ledda whose refusal to kill the young girl leads him to seek revenge on the people who want her dead. His deterioration is a cause for sympathy as well as a plot device. He must complete his mission before he forgets his reasons for carrying it out. He also plays a cat and mouse game with the police who are trying to solve the killings staying one step ahead until he can no longer think clearly.Van Looy admitted his fondness for police thrillers with a soul and especially for the work of Michael Mann and the influence of Mann is everywhere. If you like Mann you'll like this film. Welldeveloped characters moody cinematography and fine acting didn't completely save this film though. I thought the plot was a little too straightforward and the film itself was about 20 minutes too long with a couple of false endings that could have been recut. I think I would have given a shorter version of this film an 8 but even if it was a slightly derivative cop film it was a slightly derivative cop film IN FLEMISH which has to count for something!710".

	schema:reviewBody "The Memory of a Killer De Zaak Alzheimer is a sophisticated synthesis of several genres into a stylish thriller. There's the opening shots of a steam engine saluting European film noir contrasting with the sharp sunlight of corrupt Marseille the Georges Simenonlike police investigation contemporized with gritty Brit mystery crimes and the hunky bantering buddy cops where one is a wild rulebreaker and his boss is an Eliot Ness straight arrow the samurai code of honor the Western where the old gunslinger takes on one last conflict like The Unforgiven and already adapted to Man on the Train L'Homme du Train a revenge showdown like the recent Four Brothers the memory stream of consciousness tricks of Memento and the snappy editing of Hong Kong crime thrillers like Infernal Affairs Wu jian dao. And we even get a The Sopranoslike psychological profile of a hit man. While director Erik Van Looy smoothly integrates all these elements together in adapting what must have been a complex novel this is terrific intelligent popular entertainment and only its subtitles keep it in limited release in the U.S. in art houses. Too bad a Hollywood adaptation is inevitable. The film has an exciting dual structure of following the cops and the criminal as they get intertwined and chase each other as each sorts out vengeance and some justice with surprising collateral damage ever higher up the responsibility ladder so that our sympathies and theirs are compromised. While we atypically don't see anything of the cops' personal lives except with an amusing visual twist that it's the guy in the shower we do get thrust into their quite believable bureaucratic and legal wranglings which while a bit confusing for an American audience can be inferred to be similar to the jurisdictional conflicts between local police departments and the FBI that we've seen in plenty of movies and TV shows. The English subtitles seem pretty good at communicating the localisms though some of the cultural conflict in Belgium between French and Flemish speakers is lost particularly when it is significant which language is being spoken.The twist that is given away in the original title of the film translated as The Alzheimer Affair is that the highly intelligent and perceptive criminal the charismatic Jan Decleir realizes he is losing his memory and sees his near future clearly in his hospitalized brother. We get inside his head as he is trying to out race not only the cops his traitorous client and duplicitous boss but himself so that his taunt of too slow takes on a double meaning. His professionalism takes over even when the flashy cinematography indicates he doesn't quite remember what he's done.While the body count is high the violence is one on one and is not gratuitous. Each death ratchets up the tensions and complications as what at first seems street level crime has cynical political implications. Much of the film takes place in the dark like Collateral and while there's a fair amount of sudden coming up from behind scares that's usually the start of a suspenseful scene where cat and mouse decisions ricochet off in surprising ways.The music very effectively supports the action particularly when the story continues in an unexpected direction though the choice of a Starsailor song over the credits didn't seem to fit.It's a bit perplexing that The Beat That My Heart Skipped De Battre mon coeur s'est arrete is getting wider distribution probably because it's a remake of an American film and has a young hunk at the center when this is the better European crime thriller of the summer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised to read several negative comments on this site about De Zaak Alzheimer. Some people seem to think that the movie wasn't worth the hype but I disagree with this. I think this is the best Belgian cop thriller ever made. The story based on the novel of Jef Geeraerts is brilliantly written and the cast is outstanding. Our best Belgian actors give top performances. Jan Decleir Koen De Bouw Werner De Smedt and Jo De Meyere are wonderful.When I would see an American movie who is similar to De Zaak Alzheimer I'd probably give it 810. What so special about De Zaak Alzheimer? It is a Belgian production made with a limited budget and a cast and crew who doesn't have that much experience in making cop thrillers in an American style. So I'm convinced the movie is really worth the hype. Also that fact that the movie was nominated and won several awards in other countries proves Erik Van Looy really made a good impression with his movie. I also heard they're negotiating for an American adaptation of the book what also proves the value of the movie and the book.A sequel? No not a sequel but an adaptation of another book of Jef Geeraerts would be suitable. Erik Van Looy is also planning on doing this but I read it is possible we will have to wait several years for this adaptation because the expectations will be high and Van Looy of course doesn't want to disappoint the audience.To conclude my comment I can only repeat the fact that De Zaak Alzheimer is a great movie and I can't hardly wait to see the American adaptation they talked about Morgan Freeman for one of the leading roles and the next adaptation of a Jef Geeraertsnovel by Erik Van Looy.910".

He isn't able to remember any details so he writes everything down on his arm. When he's hired to kill a 12 year old girl who was the victim of pedophiles he doesn't do his job but goes after the bad guys.If a Spanish or French director made this movie this would have been a huge success all over the world. Now the movie went by rather unnoticed. OK here it was a huge success but I'm sure that most people in other countries haven't heard of it before. Still this may well be called one of the best movies in Belgian history. It's true that it has a big American feeling but that didn't bother me once and I heard that Hollywood is planning a remake of this movie so Van Looy must have done something right. I give it an 8510.".

	schema:reviewBody "'De Zaak Alzheimer' or 'The Alzheimer Case' or the US titled 'The Memory of a Killer' is a stunningly well written directed acted and photographed film from Belgium. Though termed by director Erik Van Looy as a 'police thriller' this gripping drama is so much more this is the story of organized crime of the men and women who fight crime and of a man afflicted with progressive Alzheimer's Disease which alters his entire view of his life of crime. It is a police thriller with a soul and as such is one of the finest films of this genre this viewer has ever seen.Angelo Ledda the enormously gifted Jan Decleir is a hit man sent to Antwerp to eliminate some important 'clients'. He is hesitant to take on the job as he understands that his mind is being slowly altered by the effects of Alzheimer's disease. But go he must and after his first successful 'kill' he is ordered to kill a young girl an order he cannot follow and an order which with his failing memory and abilities acknowledged he decides to turn on his employers and rid the world of those big crime magnates. The Flemish police lead by two superb minds  Vincke Koen De Bouw and Verstuyft Werner De Smedt  follow the path of corpses that lay in Ledda's wake of destroying the important heads of crime in Antwerp. Ledda becomes strangely connected and committed to the two police in reality helping them by remote stance do their job but the movie is a cat and mouse chase between the police and Ledda and one whose ending though somewhat predictable manages to tear at the heart of the audience as the unwinding of Ledda's mind by Alzheimer's disease results in a metamorphosis of a killer's mentality to that of a quasihero.Brilliantly photographed by Danny Elsen and accompanied by an electrifying musical score by Stephen Warbeck THE MEMORY OF A KILLER is a taut tense unnerving and fascinating tale told to perfection by Carl Joos' screenplay based on Jef Geeraerts' novel. There isn't a weak link here  every actor is superb and the performance by Jan Decleir is the stuff of which legends are made. Recommended without reservation. In Dutch and French and Flemish with English subtitles. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "If like me you don't know what country Flemish cinema refers to then read on. Yeah I'm one of those dimwits like Joey on Friends when they tell him Dutch people live in the Netherlands and he says no that's where Peter Pan came from. Suffice it to say this was the first Belgian film I've ever seen and I was really impressed. It's stylish polished has a lush musical score and features a lot of actors who seem really human. Even the minor roles were well played.I'm not usually a fan of crime thrillers but this one drew me in with its interesting premise a hero who's losing his memory. In that respect reminded me of the excellent Tom Tykwer film Winter Sleepers 1997 except this film is driven by a faster more actionoriented plot and pace.There's a lot going on here. Just when you think it's over a new drama comes into the mix making it unpredictable until the end. The director effectively used a lot of suspense tricks which will make you say aha you got me! For example though this was not used in this movie a cat might jump out at the perfect moment to give your heart a little leap. In hindsight it's silly but you can't deny it works. So bear in mind this is definitely a movie for people who enjoy being taken for a ride. In the same vein I think the director intentionally uses some standard clichs almost in a playful way. If you approach this movie with the idea of having a fun time you won't be disappointed.Final note I think it helps to be a little familiar with Belgian culture which I'm not. I could tell the characters switch languages between different variations of DutchFlemish French and snippets of English and I think that's significant. Some of the settings are breathtaking and I found myself saying wow that place is cool! I wonder where that is. In all this is a film that Belgium can be very proud of and I hope to see more like it in the future.".

	schema:headline " 'Alzheimer' 2003 is now 'Memory of a Killer' 2005";
	schema:reviewBody "Unlike Memento the 2003 Belgian film Memory of a Killer is not about a struggle with failing memory even if the original title was The Alzheimer Affair  not a potential boxoffice draw. The main character Ledda played with selfeffacing brilliance by Jan Decleir does have the onset of Alzheimer's and he writes names of his future victims on his arm but if you took that element away the story would remain virtually the same.Initially that story is about an international mafia operation in Antwerp including child prostitution on its agenda. Decleir's character  an aging but impressively professional killer who is fleshandblood real far from the typical Hollywood caricature  runs up against an order to kill a 13yearold girl. In crime syndicates assignments are not optional so Ledda is now pitched against his former colleagues and bosses in a desperate run for survival.It is at that point the film's real nature emerges a variation on The Fugitive a lone man against overwhelming forces but with a unique twist Ledda is no hero in fact he is a supervillain and yet director Erik Van Looy's work of honesty and integrity and Decleir's performance put the audience squarely in the killer's corner.The reason he is fighting not only for survival but against a major collusion between crime bosses and government officials making the work of the honest police official Vincke played by Koen De Bouw quite impossible.It is the reluctant and indirect collaboration between Ledda and Vincke two individuals  a cop and a killer  against a mighty machine that gives Memory of a Killer its focus and zing.There is something very puzzling about the presentation of this film. Anyone with even a passing exposure to world news may well remember that there was a huge scandal in Belgium just a few years ago over exactly the same scenario child prostitution and a government coverup that went up to the highest ranks busted open finally by a few honest cops and even an intervention from the king. And yet in all the studio literature there isn't a single mention of a possible connection and when specifically asked a spokesperson for US presenter Sony said the film has no relationship whatsoever to the Belgian scandal. Strange indeed.".

His path crosses with that of Jan Declair an assassin with early symptoms of Alzheimer's. Memento showed quite compellingly the multitude of dilemmas that would be present for solving a puzzle without a memory. Instead here we get a generally competent but not particularly engaging formula film of a tortured cop and a tortured villain each out to solve the same case. One does it because it's his job and the other well we don't really know maybe some childhood thing. Nonetheless the assassin will ruthlessly and quickly kill innocent folks but not a teenager. While it's true that moral boundaries are at some level arbitrary it still seems odd that someone that has exactly zero problems offing folks would hesitate just because of the age if the target.Declair is hired to smite a few people involved in the blackmail of a powerful family. As the bodies start to pile up De Bouw starts to investigate. Lots of dead bystanders and contrived twists later we end up with an unlikely alliance. That alliance is threatened continually by the number of face to face showdowns between the protagonists. How often must they be in contact? Director Erik Van Looy gives Declair's fading recall an interesting look as the assassin's confused and indecisive look reappears whenever trying to figure the next course of action. That alone though is not enough to break the mold.Alternating between amusing and annoyingly gimmicky TMOAK could have use some judicious editing. The story is convoluted and the pieces don't add up convincingly. By the time De Bouw figures out the unlikely answer the film is a half hour past a preferable end point. It's not a poor film but with all of different American art forms to be exported this middling formula film is one of the more unfortunate results.".

Having that out of the way this is still a decent movie. The comparison with Memento falls flat because although the main character does suffer from memory loss this is more an effort to revive the almost dead French genre of the policier extra points for that somewhat influenced by Mann although Mann's movies are much more rooted in literature.Most striking is that there is fierce criticism of Belgian society No cooperation between cops of different corpses there is little funding for police corruption abound appointments for friends only etc. But the most important subject is that of pedophilia and this being made after the Dutrouxcase seems to support the theory of large pedophile networks protected by certain people in the upper echelons of society be it law police or politics. This satisfies the opinion of most Belgians on the subject matter although never proved up till now. But you can still debate if it is very ethical to cash in on the whole case in this matter.Unfortunately a large amount of logic is lacking in the screenplay. Why does Ledda take such risks to contact police as he is the only one who can tackle the case. He shoots a cop and Vincke hardly is very angry the next time they speak. Ledda seeks shelter in his old home where everybody can find him. Once in the hospital he is almost dead he then suddenly revives after a death treat and starts acting like a super hero with suicidal tendencies. The subject of Alzheimer itself is worked upon but nothing is accomplished that makes the theme work in the movie.The movie looks good with reasonable camerawork but most 'cool' sequences are on the video clip level. The movie has some bad lines although the whole structure works. Some jokes are rather infantile. And there is a strange mix of good and bad acting with Jan Decleir coming out on top and Werner De Smedt at the bottom.".

It's getting numerous rave reviews in my home country Belgium but the only reason I can think of why this is happening is because it's a Belgian film. This is actually Hollywood filmmaking but with Belgian actors and situations. It ain't worse than your average Hollywood thriller but it ain't exactly much better too. It's like the director Erik van Looy is shouting out Look what I can do I can make a perfect copy of a Hollywood policier! In copying the Hollywood style he surely has succeeded. It almost seems like every scene is an exact copy of what you have seen in superior films such as SE7EN right up to the package of the killer at the end MEMENTO the notes on the lead character's arm the Michael Mann films the look of the film etc. You could compare this film to those films but that would be unfair this simply has none of the greatness nor the originality of those films.Thus said the biggest problem of this film is its originality. You could predict every story twist as the films comes along right up to the final shot. It's quite enjoyable nonetheless though it gets more and more frustrating in the end when you realize nothing surprising will happen.Can you blame the actors for all of this? Well I was never a big fan of Belgian actors and I still feel the same way. Some are pretty good others are simply not believable. Actors like Koen De Bouw and Jo De Meyere get excellent reviews but are quite disappointing in their onedimensional approach to their characters. Jan Decleir is regarded as our best actor he appears in almost every Belgian film and he delivers with a decent if not great performance. Werner De Smedt is always watchable though I liked him better in the Academy Awardnominated IEDEREEN BEROEMD! not a great film either by the way though I really liked that film's lead actor Josse De Pauw. The supporting roles fare generally better especially Dirk Roofthooft in a small but pivotal role and actresses like Els Dottermans or Hilde De Baerdemaker though their roles don't add up to much. But for a better actors' film watch Tom Barman's ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS though actors and style is all that one's got.Now you might have guessed that I'm not a big fan of Belgian films unlike most of the people I know but I really wouldn't bother watching this film if you're not Belgian yourself. You could just as easily watch mediocre Hollywood fare like KISS THE GIRLS BLOOD WORK or another SE7ENSILENCE OF THE LAMBS ripoff. De Zaak Alzheimer The Alzheimer Case is watchable enough and at times rather funny but I think mostly to Belgian audiences. The rivalry between the different Belgian police units or the scandals in which almost every Belgian politician advocate prosecutor or whatever is embroiled are quite amusing but this film has really not that much more to offer. My rating would be a mere 5510.P.S. for a good Belgian film see if you can find ALLES MOET WEG Everything Must Go MANNEKEN PIS ROSIE or more or lessDAENS. See that I don't dislike em all? ".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything works in this movie. The script is well written the actors do a fine job and are believable and the pace never slows. There is a very plausible storyline about a hired killer given an assignment that he does not want to do since he knows he is losing his memory therefore does not know if he can pull it off. Second he's tired of doing this job but is reminded by another in the profession that what they do there is no retirement other than death. So he takes the job. The 1st contract he has no qualms about but the second he does as it involves killing a child and this is something he refuses to do as this goes against his value system. In the course of completing the first assignment he comes across a conspiracy to cover up what he considers a total disregard to humanity which is the killing of a child regardless of the situation that warrants the contract to do so. The movie then centers on 2 law enforcement agencies at odds with one another nothing new here in the movies and in real life a coverup that actually includes the government again nothing new here and finally a little twist on what would otherwise be your general suspense thriller. Is the bad guy such a bad guy if who he kills are also killers and especially killers of a child? Shades of Dexter books and TV show. This is what separates this movie from a lot of others just like it The moral dilemma of an assassin. There's also a running joke there are some funny moments in this movie as in real life in the world of law enforcement that has to do with BMW cars. Lots of twists and it all does not come together in your usual format.".

There is a very plausible storyline about a hired killer given an assignment that he does not want to do since he knows he is losing his memory therefore does not know if he can pull it off. Second he's tired of doing this job but is reminded by another in the profession that what they do there is no retirement other than death. So he takes the job.

Superb storytelling great acting especially by the seasoned Jan Decleir. This one is a treat for those who love policestories but do not need fastspeed action scenes.

But that's a good thing. The film is a gradual unfolding of farreaching crime and conspiracy. The characterization here is deep with a lot to say about complex interpersonal political and groupinstitutional relationships including quite a few ethical quandaries. The antihero Angelo Ledda Jan Decleir is refreshingly different as an older man suffering with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. That may sound as if De Zaak Alzheimer is more of a drama but it is solidly in crimeactionthriller territory with quite a few edgeofyourseat scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "The Alzheimer Case is a gritty thriller from Belgium. Erik Van Looy has managed to craft a film that is both hugely compelling and highly original. It should come as no real surprise if Hollywood pillages The Alzheimer Case for a remake in the very near future.Films about morally plagued hit men are not unusual. However films about a morally plagued hitman succumbing to Alzheimer's disease are less common. This twist puts a whole new spin on events in the film. Not only must Angelo complete his assignment he must complete it before he loses his memory entirely. The assignment in this case is one that Angelo has set for himself after refusing to carry out a hit on a 12 year old girl. When Angelo discovers that the child has been killed by someone else he decides to bring the culprits to justice. Needless to say this brings him into conflict with the investigating police officers Vincke and Verstuyft.One of the film's best qualities is the absence of any kind of sentimentality or message. Angelo is not looking to become a better person nor is he seeking last minute salvation. He is simply a tired old man who believes that a line has been crossed. Angelo is played with great skill by award winning Belgian actor Jan Decleir from DaensHop etc. His performance is wonderfully restrained and authentic. Koen De Bouw is also hugely impressive as Vincke the much maligned intellectual police officer. He is especially good during scenes with his condescending superiors and the slimy prosecutor. Koen De Bouw has the potential to be the Rutger Hauer of his generation he certainly has the talent and looks to have an international film career.The actors are well supported by Erik Van Looy's lively direction. Van Looy handles the action scenes with great flair and controls the film's pacing and tone expertly. The special effects are well done and the window cleaning assassination is brilliantly staged. This film looks like it cost significantly more than a couple of million Euro.The Alzheimer Case is an accomplished film from beginning to end. This really is one of the better European action thrillers of recent years.".

The plot is standard copthriller material with an allknowing assassin turning against his instructors and leaving the Antwerp police with a series of corpses of eminent but corrupt politicians. The story is thickened by some secondary elements such as the killer suffering from Alzheimer's disease and the dreadful catandmouse game he's playing with the coppers. Merely thanks to the cast world famousin Belgium and expensive promotional campaigns this film was very successful and received much praise. Quite undeserved actually as it's far too long and featuring too much clichs and stereotype characters. The only real smart element is the unsubtle sarcasm towards the failure of united police forces. But that only works if you're familiar with the Belgian law system that recently implanted collaboration between the different police cells. The competition and venom between these cells results in efficient pranks and sometimes even a bit of tension. The action sequences effects and settings are okay but as said before nothing really spectacular. The thing that irritated me mostly was the director's urge to make this film look so typically Hollywoodlike. The camerawork the cutandpaste editing the musicVan Looy tries too hard and the wholesome eventually looks like a giant wannabe. De Zaak Alzheimer is adapted from a novel by Jef Geeraerts a famous Belgian writer who wrote tons of similar stories trust meI was forced to read many of them in school. One of his previous novels already was turned into a miniseries called Diamant. That series was at least ten times better than this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possibly one of the most insightful fascinating and profound movies to come out in twenty years Luther follows the turbulent struggle between the Catholic church and the country of Germany in the 1500's revolving around the greatest religious liberator of the middle ages Martin Luther. Both historically correct in many respects as well as a fantastically wellwritten epic with an excessively wellrounded cast all of which deserve Oscar nominations the film has many insightful glimpses into one man's journey toward his greatest triumph... the translation of the scriptures into common German. If you have any opportunity to view this bigbudget Independent film take it.From a purely historical standpoint the film offers a shocking glimpse into power and politics as Cardinals attempt to bend and wrestle princes and monarchs to their side. It's a shame but this film will probably not be recognized at the Oscars due to its strong religious tone. Therefore allow it to be said that the center core of actors all deserve Oscars for their performances particularly Fiennes Firth and Ustinov. It was a pleasure to see Fiennes conform to an astonishingly strong charismatic man who is not faultless but instead human. The costuming visual effects and writing are all fantastic. The dialogue is unusually rich spattered with direct quotes from Luther's literary works.The best thing about Luther is the quality of the filmmaking. A lot of money was poured into this production leaving Christian films like Megiddo and Left Behind in the dust. Not only will this receive greater recognition as a serious movie it will also attract larger audiences due to the quality budget massive locations and cast list. Secular audiences will get an open story of salvation. Christian audiences will have the pleasure of finally having a hero to root for in the cinema a man who stands up for his faith against all odds.".

	onyx:emotionText "Possibly one of the most insightful fascinating and profound movies to come out in twenty years Luther follows the turbulent struggle between the Catholic church and the country of Germany in the 1500's revolving around the greatest religious liberator of the middle ages Martin Luther. Both historically correct in many respects as well as a fantastically wellwritten epic with an excessively wellrounded cast all of which deserve Oscar nominations the film has many insightful glimpses into one man's journey toward his greatest triumph... the translation of the scriptures into common German. If you have any opportunity to view this bigbudget Independent film take it.From a purely historical standpoint the film offers a shocking glimpse into power and politics as Cardinals attempt to bend and wrestle princes and monarchs to their side. It's a shame but this film will probably not be recognized at the Oscars due to its strong religious tone. Therefore allow it to be said that the center core of actors all deserve Oscars for their performances particularly Fiennes Firth and Ustinov. It was a pleasure to see Fiennes conform to an astonishingly strong charismatic man who is not faultless but instead human. The costuming visual effects and writing are all fantastic. The dialogue is unusually rich spattered with direct quotes from Luther's literary works.The best thing about Luther is the quality of the filmmaking.

	schema:reviewBody "I just came from the St. Louis premier in conjunction with the 14th annual Theological Symposium at Concordia Seminary and am very impressed with the film.  Not only is it entertaining but it follows the history of Luther's early years of ministry quite faithfully.  Sure some things were fictionalized to get us from one scene to another but the facts of the reformation movement and the realities of life in the 16th century are brought to great realism on the screen.The performances of Fiennes and Ustinov were particularly strong but I think viewers will fall in love with Ustinov's portrayal of Prince Friedrich the Wise.  He's like the cuddly grandpa you always wished you had or maybe you did have who didn't care what people thought of them said and did what they pleased and no one gave them any crap for it.  I truly think it is Oscar calibre work.  I think you will too.Firth as Aleandro was convincing as the Roman Bureaucrat determined to get ahead by keeping the peace between Leo and Charles.  Ganz plays a great pastor to Luther  throughout his life  one that we should all be so lucky to have looking after our spiritual well being.Hofschneider as the eager to learn and willing to suffer all for the Gospel assistant Ulrick to Luther made it very easy for the viewer to feel a connection to him.  His loyalty was genuine and not self serving. A true man of the cloth.Although not on screen long Clair Cox does a nice job showing just how strong a woman Katie was.  Is it any wonder that she went on to run a rather successful business apart from Martin's influence?For sure this is a courageous movie about a stalwart leader of Church state and society to whom western civilization owes a great debt.  While the 1950's version of Luther may be more complete in some respects it is not nearly as accesable to today's viewers who are used to big budget visually stimulating and fast paced movies".

	schema:headline " Can't stop this thing we started";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of Bryan Adams' song Can't Stop This Thing We Started aptly  describes this 2003 retelling of the story of Martin Luther. The film  basically depicts Luther as a good Catholic loyal to the Pope but  horrified by the scandals and corruption that plagued the 16th century  Church. He is even more horrified when his effort to reform the Church  gets out of control is coopted for political purposes and becomes a  popular revolution with the attendant carnage and bloodshed.  I suspect Luther has been highly romanticized here. For one thing the  film follows him from age 34 to 50 yet as embodied by the angelically  handsome Joseph Fiennes he never ages a day. His relationship with  Katharina von Bora seems astonishingly chaste  no struggle with the  lusts of the flesh for this pious monk! His demons are of a different  kind. We see scenes where Luther seems plagued by demons thrashing  about in his cell hearing unseen voices. I know Luther was  manicdepressive but I hardly think he was a madman.  The film provides a good summary or outline of the major events of  Luther's life and times the selling of indulgences the NinetyFive  Theses nailed to the door of Wittenberg Church the Diet of Worms a  council presided over by Emperor Charles V the Confession of  Augsburg. The costumes accurately reflect historical reality. If I have  any quarrel with the film in this regard it is that it does not  adequately mirror a key factor in the struggle between Germany and  Rome the principle of cuius regio eius religio. In other words  local princes and kings imposed their own religious beliefs on the  peoples they governed.  The cast is a constellation of stars veritable luminaries including  Sir Peter Ustinov in one of his last roles as Frederick of Saxony. The  actors are uniformly excellent in their roles and the dialogue is well  written. The photography is somewhat static leading me to believe this  film was made with television in mind  albeit of the highbrow kind  in the Masterpiece Theatre tradition.  Still if anyone asked me if I recommended Luther I would reply as  he did at the Diet of Worms Here I stand. I can do no other. God help  me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Luther is without a doubt one of the most important figures in Western Civilization.  His actions not only reformed Christianity but also shaped the direction in which Europe developed and opened the door for additional reform and individual freedoms.  Luther the movie does a fine job at highlighting Luther's actions prior to and during the Reformation.Luther is a very rich movie to say the least.  The costumes scenery music acting and characters all compliment the film nicely.  Joseph Fiennes turns in a fine performance portraying Luther and making the audience both admire and feel pity for him throughout the film the sticklers to realism just have to forgive the fact that Fiennes and Luther do not look very much alike.  All the supporting roles were well done as well especially Peter Ustinov as Prince Friedrich and  Uwe Ochsenknecht say that name three times fast! as Pope Leo.Personally as a Lutheran I was very pleased to see the movie focus mainly on Luther's scriptural interpretations and 95 Theses rather than solely on the secular politics of the time.  Thankfully the creators of Luther do not tiptoe around including and expressing Christian messages as to not offend nonChristian viewers.  If anything all the direct references to the Bible and doctrine may win people over by showing just how much Martin Luther was a model of Christianity through his love of God and strict belief in only the scriptures and not unjust rules of men.  All that he used to battle the ridiculous man made ordinances and general corruption of the 16th century Catholic Church.The only things I can really pick apart in Luther is the ending  I just wish the ending was slightly more rounded than it is it seemed that things were sped up in the last 14 of the film and then it kind of ended abruptly. Nonetheless the ending was still very emotional and made me want to stand up and applaud.  I highly recommend this film to those wishing to learn more about Luther the Reformation or even just basic Christianity.  But keep in mind at times this film is violent.  But the violence is used sparingly and only to drive home some important points in the film such as Luther's despair over feeling responsible for so many gruesome deaths.  All in all this is a very emotional film which works on so many levels and it was a great pleasure to watch.".

As the subject of indulgences and other practices begin to transform Luther's ideas of what Jesus' church should be the story grows in intensity as Luther gets pressured by the Catholic hierarchy as his protest issues become public. What happens to him and to the masses because of his actions are revealed in pretty dramatic form. Obviously the story is far more complex than two hours can give it but the filmmakers did a pretty good job condensing it to make the time constriction.Notes This was Peter Ustinov's last movie.

He also witnesses the church collecting coins from the people supposedly to free their sins to build Saint Peter's Church and would be therefore released from Purgatory and enter the Heaven Luther was eventually branded a heretic his books examined and burned and anyone who presumes to infringe Pope Leo's excommunication will stand under the wrath of Almighty God and the Apostles Peter and Paul The reaction of the peasants in Germany was against the reaction of the Inquisition who was burning his writingsFor the German people you can't burn his ideas. For the Church his works shall be erased from the memory of man!

He also witnesses the church collecting coins from the people supposedly to free their sins to build Saint Peter's Church and would be therefore released from Purgatory and enter the Heaven Luther was eventually branded a heretic his books examined and burned and anyone who presumes to infringe Pope Leo's excommunication will stand under the wrath of Almighty God and the Apostles Peter and Paul The reaction of the peasants in Germany was against the reaction of the Inquisition who was burning his writingsFor the German people you can't burn his ideas. For the Church his works shall be erased from the memory of man! Luther's criticism was not against his Holiness Pope Leo X but of those rogues who claim to represent him His goal was not to quarrel with the Pope or the Church but to defend them than mere opinion! The Gospel as he affirmed cannot be denied for the word of man! As a loyal son of the Church Luther finds sanctuary with Prince Frederick who finds him too daring for him but decides not to surrender him to Rome Luther goes on to produce his first translation of the New Testament Bible into German language He marries the exnun Katerina Von Borg becomes a hero to the people and in spite of his outlaw status with the Church authorities his followers ultimately break with Rome Joseph Fiennes played intensely the intriguing story of a brilliant Augustinian monk with an independent mind who is not interested in comfort but in the truth! Sir Peter Ustinovin his final rolerealizes the danger Luther poses to the Catholic Church Alfred Molina as Brother John Tetzel is the showman terrorizing the good people of Jterbog into purchasing special indulgences letting everyone know the fires of hell awaiting those who did not contribute Johann Von Staupitz is the spiritual counselor who knows that Martin has aptitude for law and could be send to Rome for a legal brief Claire Cox is Luther's beautiful wife who stood behind her young 16th century monk driven by courage and outrage against a powerful Medieval Church";

The supporting cast was also fabulous particularly the merryinthefaceofdanger performances by Bruno Ganz and Peter Ustinov.What's troubling then about Luther is that the movie just isn't long enough to portray the story accurately and therefore it feels not only unfinished but full of gaps.  Things happen one against another people come and go with little explanation and yet the story marches on.  Luther's mission is clear but his purposes are so boiled down that only a few of his famous Theses are actually voiced in the movie.  Shortening the story was obviously necessary for a movie but in all I think it acts against the dramatic effect of the film as a whole because things end up with a certain disjointed feel.Still the cinematography is brilliant and the acting nearly perfect.  The film is worth seeing for its visual splendor in both performance and sets alone and certainly as an introduction to a complex historical topic.".

The acting by Fiennes and Ustinov could not be improved in my view. I was swept away with drama and emotion of the portrayal of Luther at this time of crisis in Christianity. Interestingly the  pivotal moment of the nailing of the 95 thesis to the door of the church in Wittenburg is regarded as fictional by most careful scholars of Luther!

No doubt because of its funding by some investment group for Lutherans this film came across as a reverential cartoonbroughttolife suitable for a Lutheran Sunday school.  Joseph Fiennes handsomely portrayed Luther as a comicbook hero.  The film wisely avoided the last 16 years of Luther's life.  While the early Luther needed to tell people he was not a saint few would have mistaken the later Luther for one.  See the transcripts of Luther's table talk.There is nothing wrong with telling a story in terms children can understand.  I assume that was why the film makers added the cloyingly sentimental poor woman and her crippled girl.  However the real Luther was far more complex and far more interesting than portrayed in this film.  Advanced children and adults interested in a collegelevel approach should move up to something more accurate and challenging the 1976 film version of John Osborne's awardwinning play Luther starring Stacey Keach.

His translation of the Bible helped empower Christians to come to their own conclusions. The example he set by getting married surely was a liberating force for those who wondered if they could be devoted to God and also experience the love of family. These elements were treated quite well in the film and can be appreciated by Christians of whatever stripe.The film also contains hints of a darker side of Luther and what he helped unleash. Battling demons was just one aspect of his personal life. His role in first inspiring the Peasants' Revolt and then supporting the merciless suppression of it  the film tones it down into a kind of inner regret and sorrow not fully displaying the harshness with which he tended to speak of people once he decided they were his enemies. The film does a decent job of showing that the line between religious and political conflict can be very fuzzy. The German nationalism that factored into the princes' resistance to Rome was evident.I was disappointed that the film chose to completely ignore the most negative side of Luther's legacy his seething contempt for Jews and his recommendations for dealing with them. In this he was very much a product of his times  he certainly didn't invent antisemitism. But the very fact that Luther was so influential probably amplified the effect of his words on the matter. He was also not at his best when he helped persecute some of the smaller and more radical protestant movements. History seems to show that once Luther gained more power and influence he grew more sure of himself more combative and poweroriented and more hateful toward his enemies.In this he can be seen as very human instead of either angelic or demonic. In ignoring this side of Luther's imperfect self the film seems to me flawed as the man himself was.

	schema:reviewBody "Here's an interesting film. It seems competently enough made. And I suppose the history isn't distorted much more than most events in schoolbooks. We like our stories after all.But historical films have an obligation don't they? Honest histories have Luther as an antisemite a vulgar drunk mentally unstable and a violent revolutionary. All this in addition to being a sort of Thomas Jefferson of his day insightful and articulate.In this version his nuttiness is a sort of mystical obsession.

We like our stories after all.But historical films have an obligation don't they? Honest histories have Luther as an antisemite a vulgar drunk mentally unstable and a violent revolutionary. All this in addition to being a sort of Thomas Jefferson of his day insightful and articulate.In this version his nuttiness is a sort of mystical obsession.

	schema:reviewBody "The life of Martin Luther examined in this film presents a man that started out his life by being a devout catholic. He even became an Agustinian monk following his desire to be a better man. His faith was tested as he went to Rome. There Martin experienced a world in which there was corruption and the men that called themselves followers of the doctrine did not hesitate to break the precepts that were the basis of their religion. That experience set Luther on the road that led to his eventual break with the church which he vowed to serve.In attending the university Luther became aware of other way of thinking. Having seen first hand the way Rome conducted business as the ambitious Pope Leo X the ruler of the church wanted to build what would later become St. Peter's basilica as a monument to his reign to be financed by the selling of special indulgences a sort of panacea that would benefit the ones buying them.Luther's rebellion came about when he started questioning things that up to that point no one had dared to ask. Thus he was deemed a heretic because he wanted to simplify things and worst of all he decided to translate from the Greek the sacred scriptures that up to that time was only the domain of an inner group of Roman higher ups.Luther is not a great film. It plays like a documentary by stating highlights in the life of Martin Luther. The film directed by Eric Till and written by Bart Gavigan and Camille Thomasson is based loosely on the play by John Osborne. Of course this is a reimagination of a piece of history. How accurate it is we have no idea. This is the kind of international coproduction where the cast includes the basic English actors in the main roles but there are different accents depending on the nationality of the actor.Joseph Fiennes in the title role shows an inspired Luther. Others in the large cast include the excellent Bruno Ganz Alfred Molina Sir Peter Ustinov making his last appearance in a theatrical movie and others. The film was splendidly photographed by Robert Fraisse whose camera takes us to some breathtaking locales that span from Germany to the Czech Republic and Italy. Our only objection was the Richard Harvey music score that has a way to interfere with the action.".

The acting is superb I've been thinking Joseph is so much better than Ralph. where is Ralph nowadays? Sure some of the movie seems like a TV movie. And I'm disappointed the film isn't in German it looks like it was copyrighted in Germany though why the English? And there's some possibilities that arn't quite logical. And in one of the very quaint interviews they admit this. At least the cast does. But overlooking those faults it's an emotional film. Haven't seen such a powerful film in a long time. And of late it's been rather short. I consider myself Wisconsin Lutheran WELS unfortunately for me I've been stuck in Iowa for the past 4 yrs. So unless I bumped into an ELS 4 5 miles away.

	schema:headline " One Of My AllTime Favorites Too";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie never got much acclaim for some reason. When I read where Clint Eastwood said it was a personal favorite of his I smiled because it's mine too.....and I like a lot of Eastwood's movies.This isn't just my favorite Eastwood film. It's one of my alltime favorite  period! That's probably because it has tremendous charm with a good mixture of comedy and drama with characters you care about. It's definitely different from most of Clint's movies. The famous Eastwood glare when he's mad is still there and he still shows his violent side. However it's not a violent story just a tale of a modernday man and his little troupe who want to be cowboys and Indians and go on tour with their little Wild West show.The film has nice colorful photography and looks great on DVD. However the story not the visuals is the main attraction. It's refreshing to see Eastwood play a role like this where he's a Mr. Rogerstype western hero for little kids urging children to stay on the straight and narrow mind their parents and say their prayers before going to bed at night.Sondra Locke also is effective as the cold newcomer who reluctantly joins the group and slowly changes from a meanspirited sarcastic woman to a caring person. She shows a good comedic touch and is excellent in this film perhaps her best effort since The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter.The rest of the cast is fun to watch too and it includes one of my favorite faces and voices that of Scatman Crothers. There is very little profanity in this film too which adds to the attraction and widens the potential audience of this neglected gem. I really think it's Eastwood's most underrated movie.".

	schema:headline " Lets hear a cheer for everyone's favourite cowboy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bronco Billy the sharpshooting cowboy is the owner of a modernday travelling Wild West Show that seems to get caught in one messy situation after another. And not helping is the lack of crowd figures to their show. But nothing is going to stop Bronco Billy along with his companions from living their American dream. Through some amusing chain of events a wealthy snobby heiress Antoinette Lilly finds herself tagging along with the show and becoming one of Bronco Billy's assistant after her new husband leaves her stranded with nothing.I don't understand why they think this cap gun shoots nothing but blanks. While Eastwood who directs and stars goes all sentimental warm and fuzzy for a change. It wasn't as well accepted despite it being one of Eastwood's favourites and flopped at the box office with it receiving such poor jabs from most critics. Not to say it's great but this comically lighthearted character journey has a certain amount of charm within its foundation that doesn't make it as bad as you would believe. Even with this whimsical nature it never gets overbearing. Sure it can cause you to cringe at times but it wears its heart on its sleeve and keeps it integrity intact. More often I found myself smiling at the shenanigans well it was hard not to. It's simply a satire worked into an oldfashioned story of familiar ingredients were there was plenty of things going on in the plot. Who knew these traditional plot devices could maintain such interest. This is because of a delightful bunch of wholesome performances authentically zippy purple patches of random fun and Eastwood's conventionally hardy direction makes sure it ticks along sufficiently. Even if it's nicely shot there's nothing overly flashy or quirky creeping up so it's all about the loyal chemistry and assured story that keeps one compelled. Streamlining the moralistic story are deep insights and symbolic brushes of the true feeling of the American dream. You got to earn it as it's not served on up on a plate for you and from that you make the most out of it to live up to 'your' dreams. Pacingwise it can stall in stretches but I didn't find it boring when that did occur. The stock characters here seem to be grounded by reality despite some silly developments mainly involving a mental institution. The relaxed Clint Eastwood chimes in with a wonderfully touching performance. He simply chews up the material with great vigour. A terrific Sandra Locke has a screen presence that's equally as dominating in the role of the stuckup coldblooded highend dame. Eastwood regular Geoffrey Lewis' oddball greedy turn was marvellously madcap. The performances of Sam Bottoms Dan Vadis Sierra Pecheur and Bill McKinney are pleasurably sincere as Eastwood's ragtag team.If there's one Eastwood film that's unfairly lampooned. Bronco Billy gets my vote. This gratifying show must go on.".

It's mainly a light comedy with some touches of drama thrown in.  While Clint's in fine form in one of his few comedic roles the highlight is easily Scatman Crothers as Doc.  He shines in each of his scenes and is the film's most likable character. Is the film a classic? No.  But it does have a lot of heart and I ended up caring about what happened to Billy and his wild west show.  It's not too hard to see why this is one of Clint's personal favorite films.   I think the film has a good message too.  And that is if you do good deeds then good luck might just come your way.  Even though he is a flawed character Billy does have a good heart and performs shows for the underprivileged for free.If you are a in the mood for a film that will make you feel good for two hours then Bronco Billy is for you. My rating 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Bronco Billy represents another example of Clint Eastwood's offbeat nontraditional cinematic endeavors. Primarily this sentimental road show of sorts follows an anachronistic Wild West rodeo show on tour around the west and focuses on the problems that they encounter and resolve to keep the show going. This troupe of performers runs across an heiress on the lam that winds up hiding out with them until she learns that she has been reported murdered and may lose her fortune.Shrewdly Eastwood explores another facet of his own iconic western persona in a lowbudget but endearing version of Henry Hathaway's Circus World 1964 with John Wayne. Bronco Billy and Circus World deal with the problems of holding together a modernday western circus show. Both movies feature a catastrophic tent fire and the protagonists are constantly tangling with problems. Chiefly however the comparison between the two films ends here because Bronco Billy lassos bigger themes than the contrived selfconscious Circus World. As it turns out the Clint Eastwood characterBronco Billy McCoyis a huge fraud in the best sense that Paul Newman's hero amounted to a fraud in Robert Altman's Buffalo Bill and the Indians or Sitting Bull's History Lesson 1976. Bronco Billy and Buffalo Bill shoot the same kind of explosive pelletladen cartridges to account for their excellent marksmanship. The chief difference between the Eastwood character and the Newman character is that Bronco Billy knows that he's a fraud while William F. Cody does everything to perpetrate his own mythological destiny. Whereas director Altman ridicules Buffalo Bill as a cynical fraud in the bicentennial Buffalo Bill the Eastwood film pokes fun at Bronco Billy's masquerade but not the dreamer of a man beneath the masquerade. In another sense Bronco Billy shares a lot of similarities with the common man in the films of Frank Capra. Or perhaps underdogs is a better choice of words. As it turns out Bronco Billy was never a cowboy. In fact he was a shoe salesman who shot his unfaithful wife and served time in prison. While in prison Bronco Billy meet the future members of his traveling onehorse Wild West Show and taught them everything that he knew so they could go on tour.In a reference to Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth where James Stewart hid out in clownface from the law the Sam Bottoms charactera lasso twirling cowboyis a draft dodger from the Vietnam era. Bronco Billy sings the praises of the lower middle class perhaps even lower because this is essentially a populist modernday oater. Were that not enough everybody in Bronco Billy knows that they are a fraud and the theme of the film is that you can be anything that you want to be in Bronco Billy's Wild West Show. As any credible film scholar will tell you this is Clint Eastwood paying homage to Federico Felliniwhether the former realizes he was paying tribute to the Maestro or notbecause the circus formed a pivot part in all Felllini's work. In a sense director Eastwood appropriates himself as a hero the same way that Fellini relied on Marcello Mastroianni as his typical protagonist. Moreover Sondra Locke who plays the recalcitrant heiress that recalls Fellini's own wife Giulietta Masina in a reversal of sorts. Bronco Billy's circus reforms the hardhearted Antoinette Lilly and gives her a home the way that Fellini's circuses give Masina a home in his own films. Hardcore Eastwood fans that want to see Eastwood in Dirty Harry type movies are not going to still through Bronco Billy. Or if they do they will be disappointed. An underrated classic!".

Even though it's flawed 'Bronco Billy' has heart and how can one not like a film about a circus group with intriguing characters. Let me start with the flaws just to get them out of the way. I liked how the relationship was developing between Billy and Antoinette but in the second half the film felt rushed as though Eastwood was suddenly in a hurry to finish the movie.I've always been fascinated by the circus the real ones not the ones that torture animals and was easily persuaded to see 'Bronco Billy' alongside the fact that it's a Clint Eastwood film of course. I was quickly drawn to the interesting characters that include Billy Lefty Big Eagle Running Water Leo and so on. Each of them have left a painful past behind and Billy has given them a new purpose. The Antoinette Lily what a sexy name for a character character is sort of the typical spoiledbrat turned into affectionate woman type of leading lady but she is definitely amusing to watch.All the actors perform well. Eastwood is solid as he's always been. He's brilliantly supported by Scatman Crothers Geoffrey Lewis Bill McKinney Sam Bottoms Dan Vadis and Sierra Pecheur. Sondra Locke shares fine chemistry with her leading man.There's a subtle sense of adventure in 'Bronco Billy' which isn't realized right away. As the viewer is lead to follow these characters and experience their struggle and hardship at the same time their will to stick together and be there for one another while embracing the unpredictable life they lead Eastwood shows that there is something beautiful and pure about that lifestyle.'Bronco Billy' is quite wellcrafted. The landscape is pleasing to the eyes. The score lighting and cinematography are quite good. Editing is slightly uneven. The tongue in cheek humour stands outOverall for me 'Bronco Billy' was a delight to watch. Eastwood's sincerity shows in this memorable little gem thanks to the characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bronco Billy 1980  12 out of 4 The cowboydreamer Bronco Billy Clint Eastwood is barely keeping his Wild West show going but his luck's about to change when he gets involved with a woman Sondra Locke recently dumped by her husband. This is a rather interesting film as I've read that Eastwood says it's his favorite but at the same time I've read what a bomb it was at the box office when originally released. It's certainly understandable why most people would avoid this thing but that's a shame as it's a cute little film that manages to have enough charm but I doubt those wanting Dirty Harry will have much use for it. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the film all the way through as I did think there were some flaws including the ultralong running time. A dreamy comedy like this one really didn't need to go on for nearly twohours but some of that is due to the screenplay which is quite predictable in regards to the ending. With that said one still has to admire Eastwood for trying a film like this because it's basically just about making your dreams come true. In the case of Eastwood's character he always wanted to be a cowboy and he's doing whatever it takes to keep his show going even though modern audiences have grown tired of it. Eastwood gives a very good performance and once that will keep a smile on the viewers face. The actors hasn't had too many chances to play a nice and charming person but he handles the role very well. Locke is also quite good in her performance as the rich brat who eventually buys into the show of dreams. I found her performances to be quite good and she was very believable in the turns her character takes. Scatman Crothers. Geoffrey Lewis Bill McKinney Sam Bottoms and Sierra Pecheur all add nice support as well. I think a little editing would have helped the picture but then again I'm sure this is the type of film that would getting better on repeat viewings. I'm sure even today this isn't a title that Eastwood fans rush out to view but they should certainly give it a shot if for no other reason that to see the legend in a different light.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin let me just give a shout out to all the folks who claim that this movie is part of Clint Eastwood's long drawn out patch of bad moviemaking. First off Eastwood never had a patch of bad movie making. I have enjoyed all of the films I've seen of his.This film is no exception. It's not as serious as some of his other material and I feel like it's not supposed to be. This film is a fun feel good movie with characters you adore if you don't you have serious psychological issues. The main character is Bronco Billy the fastest gun in the west. Of course he's a performer portrayed by Clint who runs a Wild West Show in contemporary 1980's America. The reality of his character's background is somewhat of a mystery for the first part of the movie and when his origins are finally revealed you almost don't believe it... or maybe you don't want to.There are a lot of great old west motifs and while some aspects of the plot are somewhat unbelievable they are certainly plausible. For those of you who are still in doubt maybe you'll get a kick out of this Imagine if Clint Eastwood decided to force Paris Hilton to perform in a wild west show and had to on occasion put the smack down to keep her in line... now that's worth renting on Netflix isn't it?".

	onyx:emotionText "Before I begin let me just give a shout out to all the folks who claim that this movie is part of Clint Eastwood's long drawn out patch of bad moviemaking. First off Eastwood never had a patch of bad movie making. I have enjoyed all of the films I've seen of his.This film is no exception. It's not as serious as some of his other material and I feel like it's not supposed to be. This film is a fun feel good movie with characters you adore if you don't you have serious psychological issues. The main character is Bronco Billy the fastest gun in the west. Of course he's a performer portrayed by Clint who runs a Wild West Show in contemporary 1980's America.

	schema:reviewBody "Bronco Billy McCoy is the poor man's Buffalo Bill Cody the proprietor and star of a touring Wild West show essentially a circus with a Western theme. Billy might dress like a cowboy but in reality he is not even a Westerner he was originally a New Jersey shoe salesman who has spent time in jail for the attempted murder of his unfaithful first wife. Two other stars of the show have criminal records one for practising medicine without a licence one for embezzlement and a third has been on the run ever since deserting the Army during the Vietnam War.Billy has big ideas for his show but the whole thing has a very amateurish air. One of his female assistants quits after he accidentally hits her in the leg during his knifethrowing act another after she falls off his horse. He accidentally finds himself entangled with Antoinette an heiress who has eloped but who has been abandoned by her husband. Antoinette's elopement was dictated not by love but by the terms of her late father's will which provided that she will only inherit his money if she marries before the age of thirty. Her husband John is a fortunehunting gigolo his main attraction for Antoinette is that she needs a husband who is as mercenary as she is. Antoinette is reluctantly persuaded to become Billy's new assistant but the two initially loathe one another. Of course this being a romantic comedy that means that they will eventually end up falling for one another.Antoinette is played by Sondra Locke who was Eastwood's lover at the time. She starts off as cold snobbish sarcastic and foultempered before gradually mellowing I wonder if her name was borrowed from the French queen who is popularly although inaccurately believed to have advised her starving subjects to eat cake. There is a similar development in another film from this period The Gauntlet which also starred the two together. In that film also Locke's character starts off as foulmouthed and shrewish and the two characters initially hate one another before falling in love. This casts an interesting light to say the least on the reallife relationship of Locke and Eastwood.There are some amusing scenes arising from the efforts of Antoinette's stepmother Irene with the assistance of a conniving lawyer to defraud her stepdaughter of her inheritance. At one point Antoinette having gone missing is believed to be dead and John is persuaded by the promise of a large windfall to confess to her murder. The lawyer assures him that if he pleads insanity he will only receive a few years in a mental institution. The film is however more than simply a romcom. It also deals with the theme of the way in which the enduring legend of the Old West continued to influence American culture even in the late twentieth century.Clint Eastwood's Billy character has been described as a parody of the sort of Western heroes he played in films such as The Good the Bad and the Ugly or High Plains Drifter but in fact he is both a parody of and a celebration of the traditional Western hero. Billy's stage persona is similar to that of Roy Rogers or the Lone Ranger the Western hero who tries to live by a simple moral code honour patriotism decency courage truthfulness and for the children always do your schoolwork and respect your parents. Cinema Westerns of the sixties and seventies such as The Wild Bunch and Lawman had often taken a revisionist view of the Code of the West trying to show that it was a myth. Eastwood himself was later to make Unforgiven possibly the greatest of all revisionist Westerns. Of course the Code of the West was a myth not everyone in the West was honourable patriotic decent courageous or truthful. The word myth however in its original Greek sense did not simply mean a falsehood. It meant a story which was not necessarily literally true but which had a deeper symbolic significance. The significance of the Myth of the West for Billy is that he himself believes it. It is not merely a stage persona. He has his faults but for the most part he does make a genuine effort to live by the code he preaches which is why Antoinette who has spent most of her life surrounded by phonies ends up falling for him.In a scene at the end Billy and his troupe give their show to the strains of a rousing Sousa march in a tent symbolically made up of American flags stitched together. This indicates that this is a patriotic film although this is not a gungho military patriotism. Leonard the Vietnam deserter is treated sympathetically which perhaps suggests that Eastwood is not the diehard conservative he is sometimes assumed to be by both admirers and detractors. Rather it is a wider patriotism celebrating the way in which America allows its citizens to reinvent themselves to realise their full potential to be whatever they want to be. Billy's circus may be smallscale and amateurish but it has allowed Billy and his colleagues to live out their dreams. Billy the shoe salesman with a criminal record has become on his own terms at least a sort of a hero. The Wild West Show thus functions as a microcosm of the Wild West itself which in the nineteenth century allowed many Americans to make new lives for themselves just as America has offered a fresh start in life to many people from other parts of the world.Until this film was recently shown by TCM as part of a Clint Eastwood season I had never seen it before indeed I had never heard of it. Having seen it however I am surprised it is not betterknown and can understand why Eastwood counts it among his favourites. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "We are used to seeing Clint Eastwood starring in and directing himself in cowboys but this one wasn't the usual western with a town showdown and shootouts it was hopefully going to be something more fun. Basically Bronco Billy's Wild West Show is a rundown travelling circus the star is cowboy Bronco Billy McCoy Clint Eastwood the fastest gun in the West. The show's final act is Bronco Billy blindfolded to shoot balloons while a female assistant is spun around on a revolving wooden disc the final balloon is burst when he throw a knife. The show may not make a lot of money and the performers are often not getting paid but they remain loyal to Billy he does not accept criticism about himself or the show but he does have a soft side especially to young and disadvantaged fans. Lately he has had troubled retaining an assistant for the final act his last assistant quit following an accident where her leg was nicked by the final knife thrown. In a new town Antoinette Lily Sondra Locke and John Arlington Geoffrey Lewis are getting married Antoinette hates her husband tobe but has to marry to inherit a fortune their car breaks down outside the Wild West Show the following morning she is left to fend for herself when John steals all her money and the repaired car. Bronco Billy finds Antoinette and convinces her to be his assistant Miss Lily she agrees to one performance the show is unusually successful despite Antoinette annoying Billy not sticking to the script. Antoinette finds out Arlington was arrested for her murder she sees an opportunity to get even with him and rejoins the Wild West Show during which she discovers the performers are not real cowboys most are former convicts and alcoholics Bronco Cilly was a shoe salesman and shot his wife for having an affair nevertheless Antoinette begins to warm to the troupe. The performers go to a bar to celebrate two of the performers announcing that they are going to have a baby one gets arrested after it is discovered they are an Army deserter but Billy bribes the sheriff he swallows his pride and endures the sheriff's verbal humiliations. Then the circus tent burns down Miss Lily is blamed for their bad luck but Bronco Billy stands up for her he suggests they rob a train they attempt this but a modern day train proves difficult and they give up. The troupe next travel to perform for a mental institution the head of which agrees to provide them with accommodation and supply a new tent Miss Lily and Bronco Billy spend the night together one of the institute inmates turns out to be Arlington he raises a fuss and gets released Bronco Billy and the show depart without Miss Lily. In the end Antoinette returns to a life of luxury but she is bored and misses Bronco Billy he is drowning his own loneliness with alcohol the two happily reunite she returns to the circus and the performance success is restored. Also starring The Shining's Scatman Crothers as Doc Lynch Bill McKinney as Lefty LeBow Sam Bottoms as Leonard James Dan Vadis as Chief Big Eagle Sierra Pecheur as Lorraine Running Water Walter Barnes as Sheriff Dix Woodrow Parfrey as Dr. Canterbury Beverlee McKinsey as Irene Lily and Doug McGrath as Lieutenant Wiecker. Eastwood is essentially a cowboy with a good heart Locke is slightly annoying but an alright performer's assistant it a nice simple of how optimism and showmanship can get you somewhere most of the nohoper and oddball characters are likable and the circus scenes are memorable enough it is mostly the circus stuff I remember the sentimental and attempted dramatic stuff only works slightly it is a fun enough smallscale comedy western.

Making this Eastwood's first film since Kelly's Heroes 10 yeas ago not produced by his own company. A personal favourite of Clint's Bronco Billy is a charming little movie very similar to Every Which Way But Loose in that it just ambles along pleasantly from one scene to another. Like EWWBL this is another movie I'd have expected from Burt Reynolds at the time and could easily imagine Reynolds in the role. Once again Sondra Locke is playing an unappealing character and it's worth noting that she is once again the victim of a sexual assault What's with that?? along with Locke previous Eastwood Co Stars Bill McKinney Geoffrey Lewis Sam Bottoms Walter Barnes Dan Vardis and William Prince all appear. Like their character in The Gauntlet Eastwood and Locke are constantly at each other's throats until the win is each other's hearts. There is a sweetness to Eastwoods Billy who frequently performs for free at orphanages and hospitals. He holds the doors for old ladies and loves kids always taking the opportunity to warn them away from cigarettes booze telling lies and playing Hookey from school!! Annoyingly it always irritates me that Bronco Billy does not get any form of revenge on the Sheriff who humiliates him. Much like Gazzo's driver in Rocky and the douche who humiliated Rocky in Rocky 2. Can't you think of anything tougher to say than ooops!! Bronco Billy grossed 24 million at the domestic box office to end the year as the 26th highest grossing movie of 1980.".

If you liked the films Blazing Saddles Every Which Way But Loose or any of the serious Western films starring Clint Eastwood  then you might enjoy Bronco Billy.7.510";

A crazy comedy that I only could compare with Hellzapoppin' a Hollywood production or some Marx Brothers films.Totally implausible situations lived by our heroine Mirtha Legrand so pretty and unreal that she even plays a window store mannequin adopting the pose and keeping quiet and... nobody noticing the deceit!!!But there are much more outrageous situations like her being wrapped up in a Persian carpet tied up in it and even kicked by the thieves they don't know a person is inside the rolled carpet. Those thieves are behind a necklace valued at one million and a half Pesos in 1950 the value of a Dollar was 1520 Pesos I checked it on the Internet and the whole film is a continuous pursue between police and robbers to see who will get first to that necklace. All sorts of hilarious mishaps will happen during this desperate search by pursuers on both sides of the law.Mirtha Legrand was an excellent comedy actress safe when she had to play drunkenness... One cringes and feels the embarrassment she must have felt playing that scene.The movie must have been planned for twelve year old boys so if you are able to go back to that time in you life it's a very entertaining pastime. I enjoyed it very much. As a matter of fact I swallowed it hook line and sinker.I will never reveal who got the necklace.".

That said the story has a lot of laughs and it was a complete surprise given the negative comments one had heard about this film. David Watkins' script and direction give this film a different look of what Hollywood is giving us lately. Steve Martin is a very difficult actor to cast and he has to have the right vehicle and direction in order to excel as he  does here. Sometimes Mr. Martin comes across rather shallow in some of his screen portrayals but as the dentist at the center of this comedy he is at the top of his craft. Laura Dern is just perfect in her role. She keeps getting better all the time whether it's comedy as it is here or her other film this year Focus. She's an actress who doesn't repeat herself. She's a true original. Helena BonhamCarter is perfect as the junkie that appears in Steve Martin's life. Quite a change for her image better known for her appearances in serious films. This must have been quite a turn around for this actress better remembered for her work in serious English drama. The most remarkable scenes are those of the great Kevin Bacon as an actor tailing David Keith in preparation for an upcoming police film. He is hilarious as the method actor in search of ways to interpret the real life detective in the movies.All in all this is a very satisfying comedy.".

Helena Bonham Carter plays a role similar to her Fight Club role very mysterious and brooding.  I was also happy to see Laura Dern in a great role.  She's different in every movie and is especially strong in this one. The movie is such a mixture of twists and turns that it's hard to rave about it without giving anything away.

After an intriguing set up everything has less and less logic. The proverbial happy ending is totally unbelievable as is the supposed motivation for the entire storyline.

But the core of film noir is really the essential idea of the Everyman thrust into incomprehensible situations not aware of what is happening why or how to stop it. Film noirs usually show our hero caught up in framed murder. In Novocaine a dentist is thrust into a world of lies deceit sex drugs and murder. And if that doesn't tickle your fear then maybe the fact that the dentist is Steve Martin will.Film noirs are a tricky thing to make correctly. They can fail very easily such as the incredibly disappointing D.O.A. They can stumble mess up. When the rare Who Framed Roger Rabbit? comes along it is time to rejoice. I must admit that when I went to see Novocaine with Steve Martin I did not expect very much. I had already heard bad news about it seen little previews for it and generally expected it to be a bad movie. Steve Martin in a film noir about a funny dentist? Fortunately I instantly realized I had made a mistake.Our tale begins with Dr. Frank Sangster a mildmannered dentist isn't that how it always is in film noirs? with a fianccoworker Jean Laura Dern and a generally nice peaceful little world. But that world is shaken when a sleazy lusty woman named Susan Ivey Helena Bonham Carter walks through the doors. She wants Novocaine but Frank doesn't know this. After a night of passion in the dentist's chair Frank agrees to give her Novocaine for pain she is having. But the next day when he thinks he may have gotten away with everything he finds out that Susan has increased the amount on the prescription he gave her from about 1 to 100 or something like that. Soon Frank is being checked out by the ThreeLetter Government Corporations and unable to come up with excuses for the missing Novocaine tries to find Susan and confront her about it. Before long he is caught up in a web of deceit murder perjury all the stuff I said before.Novocaine is a sweet ball of darkness laughs and film noir. It numbs you leaving you breathless. It is as if the film itself is Novocaine. It isn't a terrific comedy or a terrific film noir but it is a heck of a lot better than you have probably been led to believe. Steve Martin is about the last person you'd expect to see in a film like this but my favorite comedian pulls it off. His character Frank has no idea what is going on. He isn't experienced in the world of greed lust and so on and so forth like Susan ishe is new to it stumbling forward unsure of where to go next. As situations catch up with him he runs farther searching the darkness trying to find answers.This is a fun movie to watch the kind of movie I've been looking for. The beginning credits which show Xrays of the human mouth set the tone for the filmit is a dark movie and leaves you feeling dirty throughout. It is the type of movie where you want to sit back shake your head and make ticking sounds with your mouth. It frustrates you it leads the characters into wrong decision and you want to yell at the screen to stop them from doing what they're doing. But when the dirty feeling of the film kicks in the small laughs along the way provide a balance to the darkness. Novocaine is a very welldone film noir. When the credits start rolling you will feel surges of anger frustration laughter and sadness and then the numbness will kick in on the ride home and you'll feel like you've just been given a dose of Novocaine.".

I watched the featurette on the DVD and director David Atkins explained that he wanted to throw a curve ball at the audience by having Steve Martin play the main character in a dark comedysince audiences are probably expecting something much broader.  I didn't get any laughs out of this film just some mild chuckles.  But whether it's a dark comedy or a mysterythriller it doesn't quite gel.  And ultimately the film left a bad taste in my mouthno pun intended.  It's watchable and at times quite intriguing but it's definitely not a memorable film that I would watch on repeat viewings. The cast is spirited.  Steve Martin never ceases to please whether he's playing a broad comic role or the straight man.  Here he plays more of the latter.  But I wasn't surprised he was able to pull it off.  If anybody has seen Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon you know Steve is a versatile actor who can easily pull off a serious role.  This isn't his first time playing the straight man.  Laura Dern is amusing as Steve's neurotic obsessivecompulsive karatekicking wife.  Helena Bonham Carter is sassy and sexy a totally convincing femme fetale.  Elias Koteas has some nice moments as Steve's blacksheep brother.  And last but not least Kevin Bacon has an amusing unbilled cameo as an actor researching murder cases for his upcoming movie.Danny Elfman's opening theme is wonderfully haunting.  There are certain elements of Novocaine that I liked it does have its moments the twist ending totally caught me by surprise!! but it just doesn't come together. My score  6 out of 10".

In the end she commits a second unnecessary murder and is filmed in the act by an office video camera she knew all about. Martin however manages to fake his own death and abscond to France with his loser girlfriend now miraculously cured of her addiction and full of his child even though it is now completely unnecessary that he run away.I'll stop here not because I can't think of any more flaws but because it's pointless to do so.

When he pulled his own teeth and replaced them in another false set we could really see the sense of it all. The end was the greatest surprise of all.";

I enjoyed it and it never bored me at any moment.The movie seems to be characterized as a black comedy but I felt it was more of a satire. I think Novocaine is commenting on the struggle we all quietly face between living a safe conventional life and pursuing our fantasies. Frank Sangster Steve Martin seems to have it all money and a beautiful fianc with the only glimpse of discontent being and old French movie he plays for the patients but which is probably more for him. When the sultry Susan Helena Bonham Carter sits in his dental chair his fantasies are suddenly triggered. While most men all? would sympathize with Frank for his temptation we are led to believe its cause is more of a gigantic moment of weakness not because he's unhappy with his fianc Jean Laura Dern. Also while Frank is certainly a victim there's nothing particularly noble about his actions during the film and you don't completely sympathize with him. And even when he achieves his fantasy it is so clichd and paid for at such a high price the movie doesn't ennoble Frank's fantasy. On one hand the movie seems to be about pursuing one's dreams but it's fairly cynical about it.One of the best aspects of the movie is the effort given to the minor characters. It felt like they tried to give everyone something interesting to do. Even Kevin Bacon shows up for a small but very funny part. Some of the movie is predictable and implausible but there were enough surprises to keep it interesting and if I want complete believability I'll watch a documentary.If there was any weakness in the movie it's that while we can understand Frank falling for Susan there's not enough effort given to make it convincing that Susan had really fallen for Frank. This may have been on purpose early in the movie to keep you guessing about Susan's intentions but there should have been one scene before the movie is over which tells you why she wants to be with him. And the movie is a bit thin overall on the motivations and personality of Susan. She is apparently a drug addict and having a difficult relationship with her brother but this is passed over too little.If you want to watch something a bit different sort of an antiRoxanne this might be worth renting. On the other hand if you fear going to the dentist you may wish to take care.".

I was expecting a Cohen Brothers style film of sharp wit and beautiful surreality. What I got was 'try hard' wit and ridiculous implausibility.Now this really ps me off because I love Steve Martin I love Laura Dern I love Helena Bonham Carter and I love Kevin Bacon. I really expected more from a cast of very talented very experienced actors. This basically means that the fault didn't lie with the cast. It lay with the severe implausibility of the story . SPOILERS IMMINENT!! REPEAT SPOILERS IMMINENT!! At the film's beginning Steve Martin's engaged to Laura Dern what more could an average Joe want? he's got a good job he's got a very nice home he's portrayed as a stable even tempered middle aged dude. Suddenly Helena BC appears asks for a script to be filled and Steve allows her to scam 10 times the amount of drugs from a local pharmacy! Two or so scenes later when Helena BC steals the entire drug supply from Steve's dental surgery Steve coyly makes up a paper thin story to the authorities that wouldn't stand up to detailed scrutiny by investigators!! This is when Novocaine jumped off the rails of plausibility and Plot' gave way to Series of Events'. To anyone out there who thought these scenes seem logical do you realise how big a crime Steve's committing?? How much senseless risk?? How much all the drugs which Helena stole cost?? If Steve wanted to have some sex on the side it would have been much much cheaper and much less stress to go visit a high class lady of the night every night for several weeks. And as for the climactic scene in the film from which the title is derived I was physically disgusted and really couldn't believe that an tempered stable middle aged dude would be capable of taking out all of their own teeth as well as those of a corpse. Come on!! It felt like the writers thought of that one scene first and tried to create a movie around it. Overall not too badly directed but very immaturely written. Looks like a student film. Steve Laura Hel and Kev all should have known better. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that most child actors don't transition well as they mature. They either end up with childish physical features or an acting style that suffers from an inability to evolve past the primitive roles they had in their youth. Then there's Christian Bale. From Empire of the Sun to American Psycho he has displayed a competent transition into adulthood and has made a fan out of me. And unlike female fans guys who like Christian Bale nine times out of ten are not transfixed on the shower scene in AP.All the Little Animals is yet another competent performance and not only from Christian but for the impeccable John Hurt and the terrifying Daniel Benzali. Christian Bale plays Bobby Platt a twentyfour year old man child. He tells us that when he was younger he was hit by a car and has never been the same since. Bobby is very emotionally fragile and slightly simple minded though not to the degree of a virtual on screen degenerate. This is the key to his performance. Most actors playing the role of the mentally handicapped overplay the affliction thus making their characters completely incapable of functioning in society a la Rainman. Christian's Bobby Platt is 95 normal like any other person but when stressed he starts to cry more like a 10 year old child than a 24 year old man. Coupled with the fact that he is relatively simple and not capable of expressing himself as well as he otherwise would he ends up being victimized by his step father played perfectly by Daniel Benzali whom Bobby refers to as the Fat. Benzali's character is a sadist who suffocates Bobby's pet mouse in order to get Bobby to sign legal documents which Bobby is clearly not capable of understanding. Bobby has enough intelligence to refuse to sign anything and out of fear of the Fat's threat that he will be institutionalized he runs away from home.Bobby eventually comes across Mr. Sommers John Hurt who is an eccentric recluse who goes around Englands small country roads burying animals that have been crushed by motorists. Bobby begs Mr. Sommers to let him live with him and Mr. Sommers reluctantly agrees.As the story unfolds Bobby becomes comfortable enough with Mr. Sommers to reveal his secret that he has run away and Mr. Sommers likewise tells him of his own strangely similar past which I will not reveal. Realizing that running away from the Fat is not a solution to Bobby's problems Mr. Sommers convinces Bobby to return to the Fat sign the legal documents and then live with Mr. Sommers without any more fear of his stepfather. However Mr. Sommers is a bit naive about dealing with the Fat who reveals in the last 20 minutes of film just why he may very well be one of the most evil stepfathers of all time.The ending is unfortunately predictable and unnecessarily long. Also far too much of the film focuses on Mr. Sommers curious work of burying road kill. This would not be so bad had there been more of a story line. Also this film propounds a simplistic moral message about life being precious. Yet the ending completely undermines this moral absolute.This film is plot driven and not a character study and therefore the good performances are not enough to make this film worthy of greater praise. If not for the powerful acting this film would be merely mediocre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came across this film from a review by Roger Ebert. I have grown to respect his opinions most of the time. It was also a big motivator to check out to see Christian Bale and John Hurt on screen together. I'm a fan of both of them. The film starts out well with a good introductory to Bale's character caring for his mouse which he must keep hidden from his step father. However the second the step father appears and comes across as a James Bond villain or Darth Vader especially with the over bearing music I began to get concerned. Evil step father's are often poorly portrayed in films and are over the top but this one takes the cake. It was just ridiculous. Pretty much every character was over the top and felt over exaggerated. You could make a drinking game off of how many times Bale cries in this film. It just seemed the director was stereotyping mentally challenged people as crying a lot. Even John Hurt arguably one of the best Shakespearean actors of all time looks weak in this film. Of course it isn't the actors faults. We all know that Bale and Hurt are amazing talents. It's clearly the fault of an inexperienced director who definitely has not learned the art of subtlety. The concept was interesting and could have lead to a good story in the right hands. In these hands though the narrative is unfocused and poses to be meaningful but in the end isn't. There are plot points that come up that are out of place and have no real point in the film. Towards the end of the film the whole thing goes off of the deep end. We go into pure fantasy with the step father turning into the equivalent of a comic book super villain. He apparently has the strength of a few men is unfazed by injury and can punch through glass windows. It was just so ridiculous. There are so many directions this film could have gone in and they took the worst route imaginable. I really have nothing good to say about this movie other then that Christian Bale and John Hurt did an okay job given that they clearly had nothing to work with. Though it's interesting to look at Bale's performance in this and lay it beside his eerily comedic role in American Psycho which came out only a year later. If you look at both performances side by side you can see that Bale has an incredible range.".

Those people are entitled to their opinions though they're nice fine people!Any how then there's us. We need something... different. Something with a dark humor that works on multiple levels and not Will Smith saying... Who dat? haha. All the Little Animals is along those lines. It seems innocent enough a nice film where a little retarded boy who's 24 follows an old man around to bury dead animals from the highway... but then there's The Fat. The Fat's the boys stepfather. No other name they just call him The Fat. He is the most evil character in any movie... EVER. He's a big fat angry bald gogglesunglass wearing british guy who chases Bobby around the entire film. He wanted Bobby to sign his mother's store to him on the day of her funeral or he'd send him to an institution. When Bobby hesitates The Fat kills Bobby's pet rat Peter stuffs him in a plastic bag and flings it at him which prompts Bobby to run away from home.Excellent film.

What a mean mean man. Despicable. Loathesome. He made me shudder.I stayed up until 2 am watching this film and although by this time I was quite tired I did not at all regret it. After going to bed I laid awake thinking about it for an hour more. It was one of those films which I did not want to end. I only wish I had seen the first few minutes.

I was in luck that for the Palm Beach Film Festival one of the films was cancelled and All the Little Animals was substituted.  I have always loved Christian Bale's acting and he is really great in this one but the entire film is beautiful and captivating.  The cinematography is gorgeous from the streets of London to the forest where much of the film takes place I especially loved a castle resting magically on a hilltop and dreamlike sequences where Bale's character is floating down a river holding a fox. This is indeed a film about little animals mainly ones that are found dead on the street.  This is a risky film in that it tries to balance fantasy and adventure with true horror I guess that qualifies it for the classic fantasy genre of story books in which the endings were not always happy and the events were sometimes brutal making it very questionable for small children. I have rarely been so shaken by suspense at the movies as I was toward the awesomely climactic final scenes here.  There is a human villain in this film who is so outrageously perversely evil that he will come off as a joke for those who are not scared to death by him.  I was.  John Hurt is quite wonderful too as an old hermit who befriends Bale.  I do not want to spoil the plot but I will say that it involves many a dead animal and the moral theme that animals are as beautiful if not more than people from the giant beasts down to microscopic ones.  I got the feeling half way through this film that the late Jim Henson would have loved this  it is not unlike the Storyteller films that he directed for television in the late 80s in which John Hurt played the narrator.  In fact the Hurt character is quite similar to the one he played in those as well.  Here is a film that is great to look at terrifically acted and written and very moral.  It is the best film I have seen yet this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "All the Little Animals is a special strangely beautiful film powerful in its gentleness unforgettable in the depth that lies beneath its simplicity. Watching it one will easily grasp its ideas about being kind to the animals how animals are innocent and humans often evil and the ensuing exploration of good vs. evil etc... However as the story unfolds it becomes clear that the characters the plot and the moral message are all used to much more deeply explore themes that deal with just what humans' purpose here on earth is. I felt compelled to comment on All the Little Animals after reading several reviews where the critics ripped this complex film apart.Christian Bale does a wonderful job as Bobby a 24 year old man with the soul of a child.  He is labeled as mentally impaired but as the film progresses it becomes clearer or at least to me that he has been scarred by pain and fear.  I don't think I can recall a more innocent grownup character in a movie and it is Bobby's very simplicity and innocence that help to continuously identify him with the animals he loves so very much. John Hurt is also very memorable as a man who has devoted his life to burying dead animals or to be more specific road kill all animals that have been killed by humans' carelessness.  Certainly the automobile becomes a prevalent symbol of destruction throughout the film from Bobby being scarred as a child to possible spoiler the later scenes in the film as Bobby's evil stepfather seems intent on repeating the accident.Just to quickly sum up what I got out of this film  Reflections on humans' duty as protectors of animals and of nature in general stemming from biblical times seem to be made here.  There is one particularly haunting dream sequence where we see Bobby as a boy floating down a river holding the red fox protecting it surrounded by all the little animals and some bigger all alive.  There is an almost heavenly quality to this dream which for me raised the question of how humans have gotten from being natural creatures as innocent and harmless as animals to the unthinking beings who so easily destroy animals even other humans and increasingly unconsciously blinded by their own greed and yes growing technologies. Obviously these themes can be explored in depth but since I don't have room here I'll just say that this is a highly thoughtprovoking film that for certain people will be dearly special and unforgettable.  This is the kind of film I love quiet beautiful strange and really makes you think about what exactly you are doing here on this planet and of course to ask why...".

	schema:reviewBody "I will take a stab here and assume Bobby's reference to The Fat is British slang for the stepfather. That is the only thing that makes sense to me.It is set in 1996 because we see that date on the grave marker of his recently deceased mother. As Bobby explains in a voiceover The Fat killed her not overtly but by making her so unhappy that she wasted away. Now The Fat is after Bobby to sign papers that will reject his inheritance and give sole ownership to the London store he ran with Bobby's mother. Bobby is so distraught over this because as she was dying his mother told him not to sign anything. So he ran away.Christian Bale in his early 20s as Bobby Platt. He had a severe head injury when he was younger and as a result comes across as rather simple.

As Bobby explains in a voiceover The Fat killed her not overtly but by making her so unhappy that she wasted away. Now The Fat is after Bobby to sign papers that will reject his inheritance and give sole ownership to the London store he ran with Bobby's mother. Bobby is so distraught over this because as she was dying his mother told him not to sign anything. So he ran away.Christian Bale in his early 20s as Bobby Platt.

Trumbull makes all the necessary repairs to the awesome weapon and blows up the walls of the fortress city...Kramer's movie echoes Sam Wood's 'For Whom the Bells Tolls.' Although the characters in the film made from Ernest Hemingway modern classic were better drawn and motivated... 'The Pride and the Passion' is far superior visually... Blended to the passionate sound of the guitars the voice of a singer and the rhythmic hand claps of the patriots Sophia provides with grace and posture a spontaneous flamenco dance... Epic in scope with a cast of thousands and with ocean of tents stacked rifles regimental banners batteries of cannon rows of cavalry horses and artillery mules massed troops The Pride and the Passion is an adventure spectacle in praise of will over all obstacles...The film opens with a spectacular sequence of the Spanish army retreating in defeat battle torn and dissolute...";

Frequently I lament the fact that in pursuit of movie making that will turn into box office gold the studios especially American ones will ignore historical events or places. This is true about Ancient Greek History pace the two films about Themopylae and the two films about Alexander the Great  where is a decent films about Pericles?. It is also true about 18th19th Century Spanish history. In particular Napoleon's first major military goof his invasion of the Iberian Peninsular in 1808 four years before his better remembered goof his invasion of Russia. War And Peace is such a classic novel that it has been made and remade as film and television series several times so we know what happened in Russia pretty well. But the events in what Napoleon's chancre sore in Spain and Portugal are barely noted. I recall the Jeannette MacDonald  Allan Jones operetta film The Firefly. There is a degree of involvement in the plot of Anthony Adversetoward the end. Later there was that film with Tony Franciosa about Goya at the royal court which dealt a little bit with the inept Count Godoy. But the actual events of the rise and fall of French involvement in the Peninsula are never mentioned. Not even as far as I know  please tell me if I'm wrong a movie about Sir John Moore Wellington's model as a commander and his death in the retreat from Corunna it would have been a great film for British morale after Dunkirk.I don't know how The Pride And The Passion got started as a project. It is based on a minor novel of C. S. Forester and that can be the reason. Forester struck Hollywood gold twice first with his short novel The African Queen about events in British and German colonies in Africa in 1914 and then with Captain Horatio Hornblower the film with Gregory Peck about the adventures of Forester's fictional British Captain in the Napoleonic Wars. I suspect since Peck and his film did well in the movie houses it was thought a land based Forester tale would do just as well. So they chose this idiocy.The plot deals with AngloSpanish cooperation in moving a heavy siege gun to a fortified town in order to breach the walls. The officer sent in command is played by Cary Grant. If his attempt to do American Revolutionary History The Howards Of Virginia showed to be less than his fans expected this film demonstrated he should not do British military history. His performance is dominated by his costume and the scenery. He is supposed to have a romance with the Spanish woman played by Sophia Loren and an actual romance between them began in the course of the film but the visual record does not excite viewers passions. Frank Sinatra played an expriest also interested in Loren she is supposed to have split feelings here. He resuscitates his hesitant and mediocre performance as a priest from The Miracle Of The Bells. If the three leads are fumbling about in the film it is doomed. That plus the boring details of how to bring that huge siege gun over mountains and through valleys is just not the stuff for this film although the later movie Fitzcarraldo demonstrated that a madman's attempts to push an ocean liner through the Amazon jungle to Manaosh shows a great film might be made from a similar story. Looking back the only thing I liked was that the story showed the French as well as the AngloSpanish sides so we watched as the French General Theodore Bikel in the one competent performance in the film tries to keep tabs on the progress and make preparations to thwart its effects.I give it a 3...and that's for a side issue which I liked. Marty Feldman had a funny television show in the 1970s that was briefly shown in the U.S. He did a take off on The Pride And The Passion about two inept soldiers ordered to deliver a cannon to a particular spot who constantly get fired at by the French. In the end the cannon is delivered by the wounded pair they have casts on their arms and legs and they arm it aim it and pull the lanyard. Nothing happens. The idiots go in front of the cannon to check it and it blows up killing them. A voice over suitably basso in tone states They died because they could not live....They live in the clouds forever where stupid heroes die at the ends of movies like this!! For allowing Feldman and his writers to come up with that the movie did have a little redeeming feature to it...albeit one not planned by the production.".

	schema:headline " A Watchable Epic despite its Flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "The Peninsular War has not been a frequent subject for Hollywood but this is one of the few exceptions. At its heart is a huge cannon which has been abandoned by the defeated Spanish army but which has fallen into the hands of a group of guerrillas who are fighting to keep alive Spanish resistance to Napoleon. Their plan is to use the cannon in an assault on the Frenchoccupied city of Avila. They are assisted by Anthony a British naval officer and the only man among them who is able to operate the cannon. Much of the drama concerns the rivalry that develops between Anthony and Miguel the guerrilla leader for the affections of a young woman Juana.The basic premise of this film seems an odd one. Guerrilla warriors after all specialise in lightning hitandrun raids with the aim of taking the enemy by surprise. In order to do this they need to travel light. Huge cannons like the one featured in this film are designed to be pulled by teams of horses into a conventional battle or to be used as siege weapons. For a band of guerrillas to take such a weapon with them would seem to negate the whole purpose of guerrilla war. The large number of people needed to drag the cannon would effectively make them into a conventional army which could be tracked down attacked and destroyed by the enemy in a pitched battle.Besides the film's basic implausibility the acting is not very distinguished. A word that that I have frequently seen used about this film both on this board and elsewhere is miscast'. In my view in fact only one of the three main roles is an obvious example of miscasting that of the passionate Spanish patriot Miguel. Frank Sinatra more at home playing cynical worldlywise Americans is quite unable to convey his character's courage idealism and intensity. It was also a mistake to have Miguel speaking in a bizarre foreign accent. Quite apart from the fact that this at times makes his lines difficult to understand we are presumably to understand that the characters actually speak Spanish to one another rather than English. Anthony states that he has been chosen for the mission because of his fluent Spanish and Miguel an illiterate peasant would have had little or no opportunity to acquire a knowledge of foreign languages. To have Miguel speak English like a native speaker would have been quite acceptable as a way of representing his use of his native tongue.Although the other two main roles are not so obviously miscast neither is entirely satisfactory. Although Cary Grant is not normally associated with period dramas one would have thought that a gentlemanly British officer would be well within his compass. Unfortunately this is not one of his better performances and I would agree the reviewer who said that he looked bored. Sophia Loren was by no means out of her depth as a Spanish peasant girl but the part was not well enough written to enable her to do much with it. Juana is not so much a character as a clich the embodiment of the AngloSaxon stereotype of the proud fiery temperamental Spanish woman. Or for that matter of the proud fiery temperamental Latin' woman in general. As it is a widelyheld belief in both America and Britain that all speakers of Romance languages share the same temperament the casting of an Italian actress in the part must have made perfect sense to the filmmakers. At least Miss Loren looked less uncomfortable than did Ingrid Bergman in a similar role in For Whom the Bell Tolls'.Seen as an action drama rather than a character study however the film has its good points. The photography of the wild Spanish landscapes is magnificent and many of the individual scenes generate a sense of excitement. Particularly notable are the scene where the guerrillas have to manoeuvre the cannon up and then down a mountainside nearly ending in disaster and that where they manage to hide it in Avila cathedral under the noses of the French. Despite the length of the film the action does not drag and tension is maintained to the end. For all its weaknesses this is a watchable epic war film. 610".

Guerrilla warriors after all specialise in lightning hitandrun raids with the aim of taking the enemy by surprise. In order to do this they need to travel light. Huge cannons like the one featured in this film are designed to be pulled by teams of horses into a conventional battle or to be used as siege weapons. For a band of guerrillas to take such a weapon with them would seem to negate the whole purpose of guerrilla war. The large number of people needed to drag the cannon would effectively make them into a conventional army which could be tracked down attacked and destroyed by the enemy in a pitched battle.Besides the film's basic implausibility the acting is not very distinguished. A word that that I have frequently seen used about this film both on this board and elsewhere is miscast'. In my view in fact only one of the three main roles is an obvious example of miscasting that of the passionate Spanish patriot Miguel. Frank Sinatra more at home playing cynical worldlywise Americans is quite unable to convey his character's courage idealism and intensity. It was also a mistake to have Miguel speaking in a bizarre foreign accent. Quite apart from the fact that this at times makes his lines difficult to understand we are presumably to understand that the characters actually speak Spanish to one another rather than English. Anthony states that he has been chosen for the mission because of his fluent Spanish and Miguel an illiterate peasant would have had little or no opportunity to acquire a knowledge of foreign languages. To have Miguel speak English like a native speaker would have been quite acceptable as a way of representing his use of his native tongue.Although the other two main roles are not so obviously miscast neither is entirely satisfactory. Although Cary Grant is not normally associated with period dramas one would have thought that a gentlemanly British officer would be well within his compass. Unfortunately this is not one of his better performances and I would agree the reviewer who said that he looked bored. Sophia Loren was by no means out of her depth as a Spanish peasant girl but the part was not well enough written to enable her to do much with it. Juana is not so much a character as a clich the embodiment of the AngloSaxon stereotype of the proud fiery temperamental Spanish woman. Or for that matter of the proud fiery temperamental Latin' woman in general. As it is a widelyheld belief in both America and Britain that all speakers of Romance languages share the same temperament the casting of an Italian actress in the part must have made perfect sense to the filmmakers. At least Miss Loren looked less uncomfortable than did Ingrid Bergman in a similar role in For Whom the Bell Tolls'.Seen as an action drama rather than a character study however the film has its good points. The photography of the wild Spanish landscapes is magnificent and many of the individual scenes generate a sense of excitement. Particularly notable are the scene where the guerrillas have to manoeuvre the cannon up and then down a mountainside nearly ending in disaster and that where they manage to hide it in Avila cathedral under the noses of the French. Despite the length of the film the action does not drag and tension is maintained to the end. For all its weaknesses this is a watchable epic war film. 610";

Oh if only Sophia could save the casting mistakes and she really tries but with two male leads who each lack credibility and screen watchability in their own rights Sophia can't save the characters so miscast and poorly portrayed. Theodore Bikel appears in somewhat lesser but important role as a French general but it is terribly difficult to distinguish specifically what accent he is using or trying to use. So best advice is to watch the movie uncritically with regard to the main cast and enjoy the drama and magnificent production! Would I watch it again? Sadly no.".

	schema:reviewBody "Really you know you lot are a hard crowd to please.Yes the stars are miscast. Yes they're often unbelievable. And yes the dialogue is crass and wooden.But c'mon it's still good for a laugh. There's some wonderful filming of the Spanish countryside. We have a cast of  well  several if not thousands. And there's plenty of fun if rather campy high drama. There's Frank Sinatra in his prime. There's Cary Grant ageing gracefully. And there's Sophia Loren arguably the most beautiful women in Hollywood history at her ripest and most voluptuous. Now whaddaya want? Yet the real star is mute. And that is the big big siegegun. We almost take it for granted because it's a bit of equipment that has no lines yet it steals every take in which it is featured. The interesting conflicts of logic that it will be heavier descending a hill than going up is eloquently conveyed when it breaks loose and goes hurtling down and across fields flattening everything in its path.The intrigue between this colossal cannon and its elusive nature and the French inability to trace it is one of the fun issues of the movie.Gradually a peasant army is attracted to the thing and the symbol of freedom it represents. Their gun assumes a personality cult as real as that of Lenin or Che Guevera. Simply by existing it generates resistance.Worldweary 'Anthony' played by Cary Grant knows what's in store for these tragic idealists. Despite their huge weapon they'll be slaughtered enmasse. But they're idealists and must take what comes.What comes is victory. Though as was evident to viewers all along it's a very Pyrrhic one. The competition for the heroine is not only resolved by the death of a hero but also the death of the heroine.If I have a gripe with the movie it is with the depiction of the siege itself. Instead of firing directly at the wall the gun is aimed obliquely and the breach requires the attackers to run the gauntlet of the whole side of the undamaged facade with its cannons and marksmen. That's quite absurd. It should have been a headon attack. Still it provides plenty of red drama which is undoubtedly its absurd purpose.There's an inspiring equally melodramatic theme music pitched somewhere between 'March Of The Torreodores' and 'Bolero' that pipes it along and despite the corn you can't help but get caughtup in this wonderful costumedrama. With Frank Sinatra Cary Grant Sophia Loren and one of the most phallic props in movie history how could you do otherwise. This is the perfect mush for rainy Saturday afternoons.Wish for a wet weekend and cheer 'em along.".

And there's plenty of fun if rather campy high drama. There's Frank Sinatra in his prime. There's Cary Grant ageing gracefully. And there's Sophia Loren arguably the most beautiful women in Hollywood history at her ripest and most voluptuous. Now whaddaya want? Yet the real star is mute. And that is the big big siegegun. We almost take it for granted because it's a bit of equipment that has no lines yet it steals every take in which it is featured. The interesting conflicts of logic that it will be heavier descending a hill than going up is eloquently conveyed when it breaks loose and goes hurtling down and across fields flattening everything in its path.The intrigue between this colossal cannon and its elusive nature and the French inability to trace it is one of the fun issues of the movie.Gradually a peasant army is attracted to the thing and the symbol of freedom it represents. Their gun assumes a personality cult as real as that of Lenin or Che Guevera. Simply by existing it generates resistance.Worldweary 'Anthony' played by Cary Grant knows what's in store for these tragic idealists. Despite their huge weapon they'll be slaughtered enmasse. But they're idealists and must take what comes.What comes is victory. Though as was evident to viewers all along it's a very Pyrrhic one. The competition for the heroine is not only resolved by the death of a hero but also the death of the heroine.If I have a gripe with the movie it is with the depiction of the siege itself. Instead of firing directly at the wall the gun is aimed obliquely and the breach requires the attackers to run the gauntlet of the whole side of the undamaged facade with its cannons and marksmen. That's quite absurd. It should have been a headon attack. Still it provides plenty of red drama which is undoubtedly its absurd purpose.There's an inspiring equally melodramatic theme music pitched somewhere between 'March Of The Torreodores' and 'Bolero' that pipes it along and despite the corn you can't help but get caughtup in this wonderful costumedrama. With Frank Sinatra Cary Grant Sophia Loren and one of the most phallic props in movie history how could you do otherwise. This is the perfect mush for rainy Saturday afternoons.Wish for a wet weekend and cheer 'em along.";

	schema:headline " Lenzi's costume epic World War II parable gone awry";
	schema:reviewBody "Umberto Lenzi has almost always been one of Italy's better Bmovie directors delivering consistently entertaining films throughout his career right up to the mid 80's.  Ironmaster was a bit of a turning point with Lenzi working with smaller and smaller budgets and with lesser and lesser known actors.With this deadserious caveman adventure we have most of the old regulars from Lenzi's crime films like Nello Pazzafini Giovanni Cianfriglia Ottaviano Dell'Acqua and Riccardo Petrazzi most of whom were primarily stunt men... a couple other familiar faces like William Berger KEOMA George Eastman KING DAVID Danilo Mattei and Walter Lucchini both from CANNIBAL FEROX and that kid with the wounded leg in NIGHTMARE CITY.  But who did Lenzi's producer Luciano Martino cast as the lead?  The answer is the pretty mysterious case of bodybuilder Sam Pasco who seem to have appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared having never acted in a film since even though he really isn't bad at all in this movie.Anyway the whole thing is a pretty obvious parable of WW2 with Eastman's character Vood as basically Hitler's caveman equivalent though he goes around smashing things while his lady friend does all the talking for him. It's actually not a bad plotline either aided by some sumptuous photography decent special effects some really energetic editing and one of Guido and Maurizio De Angelis's best forgotten scores omitting the really lame title theme.  The movie's main weakness is the heavyhandedness of everything with morals being pitched left and right when the movie is really too low budget and silly to be taken seriously.Almost universally this film is trashed as one of the alltime worst but it really isn't that bad at all.  Much like Bruno Mattei's muchmaligned ROBOWAR and Sergio Martino's SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD which this film recycles some music from IRONMASTER really would have been given a lot more credit had the producers put a little more money into it.  It's still quite a lot of fun and pretty far from boring to say the least.".

Ironmaster was a bit of a turning point with Lenzi working with smaller and smaller budgets and with lesser and lesser known actors.With this deadserious caveman adventure we have most of the old regulars from Lenzi's crime films like Nello Pazzafini Giovanni Cianfriglia Ottaviano Dell'Acqua and Riccardo Petrazzi most of whom were primarily stunt men... a couple other familiar faces like William Berger KEOMA George Eastman KING DAVID Danilo Mattei and Walter Lucchini both from CANNIBAL FEROX and that kid with the wounded leg in NIGHTMARE CITY.  But who did Lenzi's producer Luciano Martino cast as the lead?  The answer is the pretty mysterious case of bodybuilder Sam Pasco who seem to have appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared having never acted in a film since even though he really isn't bad at all in this movie.Anyway the whole thing is a pretty obvious parable of WW2 with Eastman's character Vood as basically Hitler's caveman equivalent though he goes around smashing things while his lady friend does all the talking for him. It's actually not a bad plotline either aided by some sumptuous photography decent special effects some really energetic editing and one of Guido and Maurizio De Angelis's best forgotten scores omitting the really lame title theme.  The movie's main weakness is the heavyhandedness of everything with morals being pitched left and right when the movie is really too low budget and silly to be taken seriously.Almost universally this film is trashed as one of the alltime worst but it really isn't that bad at all.  Much like Bruno Mattei's muchmaligned ROBOWAR and Sergio Martino's SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD which this film recycles some music from IRONMASTER really would have been given a lot more credit had the producers put a little more money into it.  It's still quite a lot of fun and pretty far from boring to say the least.";

I consider it an education watching someone's attempt at making a good movie with a low budget. It shows a love for the art of filmmaking and you have to admire the effort that went into the plot even though there are a few holes here and there. If I were to choose between watching Clockwork Orange and Iron Master again I'd choose Iron Master without a second though. FACT! I like this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "he problem with movies like the Umberto Lenzi film Iron Master is that Lenzi and company have to observe certain rituals about making film palatable to audiences. In other words although this outdoor adventure film is set during the early days of man nobody is bald and the women far too gorgeous. Obviously everybody had to don a wig and they look slightly ridiculous running around in them. The women have to wear lipstick and rouge and they look more like models on holiday than the hardworking dames of the past. Indeed most women in early tribal villages did not conceal their breasts but for the purpose of modesty the dames here but cover up their racks. Despite this problem and an awful looking fake lion head that the villainous George Eastman wears Iron Master isn't as egregious as you might imagine for a lowbudget Italian exploitation epic.First director Umberto Lenzi who has made some genuine skull crushers as Make Them Die Slowly and Cannibal Ferox keeps the action simple straightforward and serious. No Iron Master is no tits and ass camp. The dialogue is far too sophisticated but otherwise it would be laughable. The performances are acceptable and nobody looks that goofy. The theme that weaponry can set mankind free as well as imprison them is good stuff. The chief villain Vood George Eastman of Ben and Charlie wants to be the leader of the tribe but the leader rebuffs him. During a raid on a village Vood attacks and kills the chieftain. The villagers believe that Vood is too treacherous to remain among them so they expel him from of the village. Everybody freaks out when a nearby volcano erupts and Vuud is around when a chunk of steel is vomited out of the mountain in the shape of a sword. Okay it is terribly convenient but it does not slow down the plot. Vood uses this iron stick as a weapon and takes control of the village and attacks Ela Sam Pasco a stud muffin with more quivering sixpack muscles than you can count with his new weapon. Ela manages to get away but he has an ugly looking wound in his side. He runs into a beautiful babe and she nurses him back to health and takes him to her village where there are no weapons.Meanwhile Vood and his men make and equip themselves with iron swords from the volcano and decimate the local infestation of mansized chimps. Think 2001 because the primates resemble those from the Kubrick film. Eventually Vood and his men decide to rule the world and they attack one village after another until Vood learns that Ela is in one village. Ela has a treat in store for his sworn enemy. It is a weapon that makes his army the equal of Vood's sword wielding horde. The ending looks like something out of an Italian film of the era. Okay it is corny at points but you have to compel yourself to over look some stuff so that you can get something out of it. The most extraordinary thing about this French and Italian coproduction is that they lensed some of the story on location at the Custer Park and those buffalo are the genuine thing.".

	schema:headline " Average adventure movie about primitive men during Iron Age based on hokey prehistorical facts";
	schema:reviewBody "This flick deals about the struggle of primitive cavemen and their battle each other  against nature and other creatures as boars  gorillas  Buffalos and lions . A tale that takes place at the dawn of history . This is a story of a long  long ago when the world was just beginning . A young world  a world early in the morning of time . A hard  unfriendly world with creatures that sit and wait  creatures as bison and lions that must kill to live . And man  superior to the creatures only in his cunning . There aren't many men  a few tribes scattered across the wilderness  they discover Iron and weapons and use them for their own survival. Never venturing far  unaware that other tribes exist even  too busy with their own lives to be curious . Too frightened of the unknown to wander . Their laws are simple  the strong take everything . The movie tells the story of a tribe that discovers how to fashion weapons out of iron . However the creation of iron also causes the tribe to battle for possession of the new arms that encounter surrounded by volcanoes in an earthsplitting volcanic eruption . Caveman named Ela Pasco  a bodybuilder in his only film is banished from his savage tribe by a new leader called Vood the tall George Eastman or Luigi Montefiori who starred numerous Spaghetti and horror movies. There is no love between them and confrontation emerges . Ela meets a cave woman named Isa a beautiful Elvira Audray who starred White Slave from a pacific tribe  both of whom trying to make a life for themselves . Meantime  they confront subhuman  cannibalistic apes . Ele finds a brief home among a group of gentle primitive men whose chief is Mogo William Berger  a notorious actor in several B films of the 70s and 80s . A bit later on  they take on rival clan .This is an exciting story of adventure  battles  thrills and romance . The tale provides sweeping and moving entertainment and some FX  being recreated by means of traditional effects . This is a humdrum adaptation based on primitive men existence from a screenplay and story by the same filmmaker  Umberto Lenzi along with Luciano Martino and Alberto Cavallone . This is an acceptable adventure movie though packs absurd situations and cheesy frames . Atmospheric as well as ridiculous caveman movie contains bemusing scenes when appears the bouncing He man and takes place his confrontation to nasty warriors in some lousily made scenes  including corny special effects . In the picture appears various familiar faces from Italian B series such as William Berger  Ottaviano Dell'Acqua  Nello Pazzafini  Jacques Herlin  Benito Stefanelli  Giovanni Cianfriglia or Ken Wood  a Steve Reeves's stunt  a gorgeous Pamela Prati and Pietro Torrisi who nicknamed Peter McCoy starred various Sword and Witchery films . The picture has numerous older technique FX such as transparency  matte paintings rubbersuited men who wear makeup like apes  reversefootage to create certain images  all of them were made by Paolo Ricci and the great Emilio Ruiz Del Rio for foreground miniatures and matte scenarios . You will watch it and think it is either awful  hilarious a masterpiece or all three . It's a slight fun with embarrassing images  naive special effects  campy set decoration and passable art direction . Although critics do not appreciate much this picture  however has a kind of loopy Ed Wood quality that must be endured to be totally considered . The fable is sometimes silly and laughable  though a few naif effects and action are professionally made . Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the violent fights among primitive men and appearance of several animals such as Lions  bison  in fact  a boar and a lion were wrongfully sacrificed in this picture .The tale was middling directed by Umbert Lenzi he used the pseudonym Hank Milestone and Humphrey Logan . Umberto made his directorial debut with Queen of the Seas 1961 . Other piratesword flicks followed starting with Pirates of Malaysia 1964 starred by Steeve Reeves which was part of the height of the career of fictitious tales of historic legendary characters including Robin Hood  Catherine the Great Zorro  Sandokan and Maciste . He subsequently directed a Fumetti titled The mask of Kriminal 1966 . After directing a war film and two spaghetti westerns Lenzi turned to the Giallo genre with Orgasmo 1969. During the 1970s Lenz filmed a number of Giallo and thrillers  among them  So Sweet So Perverse Seven BloodStained Orchids and Eyeball . Lenzi turned to the police thrillers called Polizieschi which rejuvenated his confidence and his popularity . Titles like Almost Human  Free Hand For a Tough Cop and Brothers Till We Die were the most popular and brutal of the thrillers . Lenzi is an expert on wartime genre such as he proved in Desert commandos  Battle of commandos  From hell to victory  Young Lions and Bridge to hell. Prior to the Polizieschi Lenzi directed Man from Deep River  which was the start of the Italian cannibal subgenre . Later on  he directed two very gory jungle cannibal features  Eaten Alive and Make Them Die Slowly which was banned in 31 countries made Lenzi distance himself from the cannibal genre . Then Lenzi directed Nightmare City 1980  a zombie flick  and this Iron Master1983 .".

	schema:reviewBody "Umberto Lenzi is a director I have loads of respect for but his hitrate is erratic to say the least. He's responsible for one of the most enjoyably bonkers giallos I've ever seen in SPASMO one of the most enjoyably bonkers cannibal flicks I've ever seen in EATEN ALIVE and one of the most wait for it enjoyably bonkers 80s slashers I've ever seen in WELCOME TO SPRING BREAK. But he also directed some right loads of boring old tosh  case in point IRONMASTER.This movie is just 90 minutes of random loincloths and bludgeoning with a boneheaded excuse for a plot attached. The whole thing could quite easily be condensed into 60 seconds perhaps even 30. The dialogue and acting is as bad as I expected but didn't give me any laughs. The whole prehistoric caveman thing is not my bag anyway but the complete lack of variation in setting and tone from start to finish made it a snoozefest. Any old director and bunch of actors could've made this thing... it's not offensively bad but Lenzi has done so much more entertaining work.".

	onyx:emotionText "Umberto Lenzi is a director I have loads of respect for but his hitrate is erratic to say the least. He's responsible for one of the most enjoyably bonkers giallos I've ever seen in SPASMO one of the most enjoyably bonkers cannibal flicks I've ever seen in EATEN ALIVE and one of the most wait for it enjoyably bonkers 80s slashers I've ever seen in WELCOME TO SPRING BREAK. But he also directed some right loads of boring old tosh  case in point IRONMASTER.This movie is just 90 minutes of random loincloths and bludgeoning with a boneheaded excuse for a plot attached. The whole thing could quite easily be condensed into 60 seconds perhaps even 30. The dialogue and acting is as bad as I expected but didn't give me any laughs. The whole prehistoric caveman thing is not my bag anyway but the complete lack of variation in setting and tone from start to finish made it a snoozefest. Any old director and bunch of actors could've made this thing... it's not offensively bad but Lenzi has done so much more entertaining work.";

	schema:reviewBody "That sounded so good I'm going to repeat it  A saucy spaghetti romp through 1000000 BC Planet of the Apes and Ator. I have recently seen a few Italian imports. Jewels such as Super Fuzz Raiders from Atlantis and 2020  Texas Gladiators. This movie is part of that same prime lineage.We start this masterpiece with some rhythmic chanting. Feel free to join in. It's quite easy to do hum hum hhaa hum hhaa hum hum. This chanting happens a few times during the movie. You should probably create a game out of it like doing shots or chugging beers at the beginning chant along and then do some more drinking or whatever your drug of choice is at the end. This will keep everyone from hurting themselves or anyone else. It is also a good way to keep from getting into a coma or deriving some enjoyment from a really bad movie. This movie is not that bad I merely state this as public service announcement. So if a bad movie happens to you you'll know what to do. After the chanting is done we get a narrator telling us whats going on. We are somewhere in prehistory and there's this tribe. They seem friendly enough. They're no cannibals or anything. Actually they're in a bit of a crisis for food. During the ensuing hunt the leader is murdered by his son and soon to be announced heir Vood the infamous George Eastman  think of a white Wilt Chamberlin. You may remember George from such classics as the Barbarian Brothers or 2019  After the Fall of New York. At the leader's funeral Vood is exposed as a murderer by Ela the very sweaty and buff Sam Pasco. Vood is banished. This leads into the longest and most painful scene of the entire movie  the erupting volcano scene.In this scene Vood is walking around in exile around volcanic mountains that coincidentally looks like my baking soda and vinegar mountain from my 8th grade science project. We get some stock footage of volcanic eruptions and lava flow from what looks like a 1969 collegiate project. Lava is on the ground and lightning strikes it. This somehow creates iron. The thing that is formed looks like a giant stick or a really really amateurish looking sword. Vood goes ape and starts breaking stuff with his new rock staff. On the way out he encounters and kills a lion. Lith the very attractive Pamela Prati a.k.a Pamela Field then shows up and gives him the idea to conquer. Vood shows up back at his tribe wearing the most ridiculous lion suit he made out of the beast he killed. There's this giant lion head he wears. For reference remember Montgomery Burns from the Simpsons except this is much sillier the episode with the greyhounds where he sings the wear my vest song. Vood and Ela fight. Vood wounds Ela and banishes him to what looks like the Planet of the Apes. He then takes over and begins the war effort. This is Lith's ultimate scene. She goes into this tirade that had me laughing for 2 full minutes. The only way I can describe it is if you think of Valaria's way of speaking from Robot Holocaust. I call the next scene the forging scene. Somehow they figure out how to melt the rocks create molds for the molten iron and a hammer to further shape the rock. Apparently they guessed all this in the missing scene the director cut out. Ela then meets Isa the other hottie in the movie Elvire Audray. The first time she said her name all I could say is Her name is Pizza ?. Strangely enough in this Italian exploitation movie both attractive female leads never bare it all. This all leads to an eventual conflict between Vood  Ela. I won't spoil it. This must be seen to believe. It is nice that they used the same choreographer from 2020Texas Gladiators. Unfortunately that man flunked out of the William Shatner School for Acting and Stunts. The movie has some nice footnotes 1 Nice use of roaming buffalo throughout the Dakotas. This included making the actors run through the pack.2 Almost a total rip of the bone smashing scene from 2001 except with George Eastman in fur leggings and a club.3 Anatomically correct shot of a lion  twigs and berry shot.4 Prehistoric leper clowns.5 George Eastman discovers a new way to get high  eating volcanic rock.6 Numerous homoerotic imagery.7 Ela runs and sits quite daintily for a caveman.8 These cavemen sure look good. They must work out in the cave's gym. They also wear these adorable rabbit slippers throughout the movie.9 Mad lib dialog. Vood verb of motion.10 RUNNING !!! and MORE RUNNING !! There's a lot of running in this movie. I haven't seen so much running since Run Lola Run however in that movie there was a purpose to all that running. All this running is reminiscent to all the driving in Manos the Hands of Fate.This movie is terrible on all fronts. It is so bad that it has actually become one of my favorite Italian exploitation movies. Try not to watch this movie alone or if you are in a bad mood. I could not control my laughter or disbelief. This is definitely great for the disaster watcher.".

And then I'm in a store and see a movie that has George Eastman wearing a giant lion head and killing everyone he sees in a ripoff of Quest for Fire and I just throw my wallet at the closest person in the store and run around the store screaming like a loon.George Eastman's best roles  like Nikos Karamanlis in Antropophagus One in Warriors of the Wasteland and Big Ape in 2019 After the Fall of New York  are beloved because of the moments where he goes fully unhinged and becomes a maniac. In this movie as Vood he's berserk minutes into the movie killing Zod the leader of his tribe in a bid for taking over then murdering the wise elder who tries to make peace. He's sent away from the tribe where he ends up learning how to forge metal in a volcano and make weapons!That's when he meets Lith who shows up out of nowhere to tell him that the fire god Enferon has picked him to take over the world. With his new sword he easily takes over his former tribe and makes all the members his loyal servants. Let me set up this arms race for you he's the first dude and the only dude to have a sword. Vood or Vuud who am I to quibble is basically bringing nukes to a knife fight. Well actually he's bringing a big knife. You know what I mean.He kicks his main rival Ela out of the tribe and ties him to a giant X where he faces off against cavemen. He's saved by Isa and her tribe who are good at medicine but also whose peaceful ways are little match for George Eastman killing everything in his path and demanding that all others do the same.Of course a final battle has to happen between cavemen maniacs and cavemen hippies. There is some romantic intrigue and plenty of blood along the way. What else would you expect from director Umberto Lenzi Ghosthouse Cannibal Ferox Nightmare City Eaten Alive!? This is total entertainment.I may have too many DVDs but this one was so worth getting. This movie is pure garbage in the best of ways.

	schema:reviewBody "Ironmaster 1983  12 out of 4This ItalianFrench coproduction is set during prehistoric days when Vood George Eastman discovers iron which he uses as a sword to break free from his tribe. Ela Sam Pasco takes over and soon he too discovers the iron and before long both sides are trying to create new weapons for power.Umberto Lenzi's IRONMASTER is one of those films that is better made than it probably should have been and it's certainly a lot more entertaining than it has the right to be. The movie is basically a look at two group of people just a notch above cavemen who learn to do battle with much better weapons than what they are used to. Lenzi certainly creates a unique look to the film and for the most part it's entertaining enough for what it is.I think what I enjoyed most was some of the more laughable moments in the picture. Look I'm sure Lenzi wasn't intending on this to be taken overly serious but the highlight for me was a group of ape creatures who are constantly attacking people. These costumes are certainly a far cry from PLANT OF THE APES but at the same time they are realistic in their own way. Obviously these ape creatures are running around without clothes so they male parts are seen at times and I just found it funny that the film gave them penises and that we see them throughout the film.The battle scenes are fun as well. There are a couple good sword fights but the best moments are when the rivals are battling with large rocks and sticks. Performance wise there's certainly nothing great here from Pasco but it's always great fun seeing George Eastman. His battle with a lion is another nice sequence as is the lion's head he wears throughout the film. But be warned there are some animal deaths seen in the film.".

Ela Sam Pasco takes over and soon he too discovers the iron and before long both sides are trying to create new weapons for power.Umberto Lenzi's IRONMASTER is one of those films that is better made than it probably should have been and it's certainly a lot more entertaining than it has the right to be. The movie is basically a look at two group of people just a notch above cavemen who learn to do battle with much better weapons than what they are used to.

But I'm betting it's not to everyone's taste.So this is my advice if you found Storaro's green and redjungle foliage and human remains canvasses in Apocalypse Now unsettlingly beautiful the first time you saw them and wondered momentarily whether still prints were available for hanging before realizing what you were actually suggesting to yourself here's a film for you. If you found Delicatessan's celebration of the paradoxical beauty hiding in human ugliness and stupidity a bit too sanitized for your taste Santa Sangre's rather murkier depths await. You will love this work.If on the other hand you have no taste for painters who work best in human blood as opposed to oils andor don't appreciate a bloody carnality mixed in with your religious metaphor you will quite probably hate it with a passion that exceeds my affection.

	schema:reviewBody "Santa Sangre is one of Jodorowsky's most accessible films. Although not as strange as El Topo and the Holy Mountain it is still very bizarre ..... A colorful horrifying and hallucinatory masterpiece. Many have compared it to Psycho Freaks and Fellini. In my opinion you can't compare it to anything because it's in its own category. Produced by Claudio Argento brother of Dario Argento the film does have a similar color style to Suspiria. Santa Sangre is the story of Fenix a man in a mental institution at the films beginning. A flashback shows Fenix as a child growing up in the circus. His mother Concha is a trapeze artist and religious fanatic who worships an armless god. His father Olgo is a knife thrower who is constantly having flirtatious encounters with the ugly cruel tattooed women. Fenix's closest friends are a mute mime a dwarf and of course clowns. After a circus performance Fenix's mother catches Olgo having an affair with the tattooed lady. In a fit of jealous rage she dumps acid on their genital regions. Then Olgo cuts off Concha's arms like the goddess and then cuts his own throat. Poor Fenix witnesses the death of his father and the Tattooed women drives away with his mute friend Alma. Years later Fenix is reunited with his armless mother she's out for revenge. In order for her to throw knives he has to stand behind her and put his arms through her sleeves. It's as if she controls his arms with her mind. Santa Sangre is very bloody disturbing and surreal but at the same time beautiful and dreamlike. It contains bizarre images such as an elephant funeral chickens falling from the sky and mentally handicapped kids tricked into snorting cocaine. the last being a metaphor for societies corruption of the innocent Because the film is psychologically disturbing it makes me confront my deepest subconscious fears loss of arms genitals or sanity. I have watched the film more than several times and it is one of my favorite movies. Every time I watch it I cringe as I'm challenged by both its beauty and disturbing intensity. So it's not really a horror film but a surreal masterpiece with horrifying images. It will haunt you long after it's over.".

These particular ideas are further tied together by director Alejandro Jodorowsky's continuing preoccupations with circus themes childhood murder and performance art as vivid colours and bold strokes of character and ideology are thrown wildly around the screen amidst surreal visions childhood reflections and elements of satire. It perhaps lacks the obvious depth and esoteric mysticism of his earlier films  that trio of surrealist masterworks Fando and Lis 1968 El Topo 1970 and The Holy Mountain 1973  but it remains nonetheless a visually impressive and psychologically deep experience that manages to be moving and emotionally demanding despite the often grotesque and uncomfortable presentation of theme and imagery.Given the superficial aspects of the narrative many people have chosen to see the film as a work of horror something that is entirely plausible given the definite themes of psychological breakdown madness and innertorment not to mention a number of violent murders that propel the story back and forth between enigmatic moments of nightmarish abandon and more colourful and darkly comic moments of parody farce and cinematic selfreference. However it is wrong to box the film in with such limited interpretations or categorisations of genre given the very obvious fact that the film has a number of more interesting layers at work beneath these more blatant surface elements. If anything I would call the film a psychological fantasy and leave the individual viewer to project their own ideas and interpretations onto it without having their opinions swayed or preled by the hyperbolic platitudes of reviews like this.However even with that in mind Santa Sangre is one of those films that simply demands such discussion and perhaps requires reviews like this one not for the benefit of other people but as an attempt by me to piece together all aspects of the film's bizarre patchwork like approach to storytelling and the deeper themes and references that Jodorowksy toys with amidst the continual barrage of visual and aural stimulation. The presentation of the film involves a number of different aspects some referential others purely fantasy moving from an almost Felliniesque portrait of carnival life and idyllic youth  as we are introduced to our central character as a young boy  before shifting further into the young man's life and becoming something of a darkly comic sendup along the lines of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975 or Bad Boy Bubby 1993. From here the film becomes darker still with Jodorowsky establishing the murderous subplot which reaches something of a peak with one of the most insanely violent murder scenes ever witnessed in contemporary cinema.Nevertheless anyone expecting a straight murder film  something more akin to the work of producer Claudio Argento's brother Dario  will probably be disappointed. Jodorowsky's intentions for the film go beyond such notions as he instead ties together a number of disparate concerns to create a grotesque yet strangely beautiful film that manages to reference the Hollywood melodrama of Sunset Blvd. 1950 and the Gothic horror of the films of James Whale within a story of murder innocence and Freudian psychology. The impact of the film is certainly within its bizarre symbolism and surreal beauty the elephant's deathscene for example is one of the most extraordinarily moving things I've ever seen and ties in nicely with the feelings of the character towards the end of the film in which the ghosts of the past return amidst a series of startling and frightening recollections fairytale like abstraction and moments of absurd humour.The film creates an astounding atmosphere from the very start particularly in the early scenes set within the circus churches and sweaty streets of Mexico City with Jodorowsky demonstrating a real understanding and feel for the place with its sad incongruities of dwarfs and giants and that air of suffocating and claustrophobic dread. The direction production design music and photography really capture the dangerous and somewhat confusing tone of the environment whilst simultaneously retaining a sense of childlike wonderment particularly in one of the film's most astounding sequences in which the corpse of an Africanelephant is carried through the streets in a giant coffin dumped into a ravine by a concoction of carnival mourners only to be savaged and ripped to pieces moments later by a pack of hungry peasants. This scene acts as a grand metaphor for the supporting characters here and how they send our antiherolike protagonist into a spiral of madness murder and forgiveness.".

There is hardly any dialogue but it is all the better without it.  It oozes the emotion that it needs to pass by through camera work style and acting.The story is not your normal story and in fact is a bit creepy.  I will not tell you one single part of it because I only knew very little going in to see it.  But let me tell you that it is not for the weak of mind or heart. But the emotion of the movie is completely there and I highly recommend this to the people who don't mind thinking to be slightly scared.  And this is a movie that doesn't feel it has to explain everything away and so is all the better for it.910".

This all takes place in a circus with clowns as standins and musicians playing music wherever Fenix goes.  There is a very surrealistic scene when the Circus elephant dies of natural causes.  This scene is very spectacular in how it was presented.Later Fenix sees his mom get her arms cut off by his father.  This of course twists his mind into thinking of his Mom as a saint but she is a very spiteful woman.  This puts him in terrible situations and he then cannot distinguish between unnecessary death and natural death.  They make money when he is older by being his Moms arms during performances.At any point in the movie you really cannot tell what is real and what are insane delusions.  It will not be reveled until the last few minutes of the film which will surprise you.Not too bloody if you get the blockbuster version.  You can watch this or watch some guy hurting himself while falling down funniest home videos so I guess it's a matter of taste.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not just a movieTHIS is a cinematic orgasm! For start to finish Santa Sangre stands for one brilliant sequence after another a staggering use of color shades sensational musical guidance disturbing themes and some of the most original story ideas that never ever featured in cinema before! To sum the film up in simply one word it would be AMAZING! I caught myself staring at the screen with my eyes and mouth wide open most of the time and I kept on thinking how I never wanted this movie to end. Santa Sangre unhesitatingly catapulted itself in my top5 movies of alltime and I sincerely think it's there to stay. It's not very often that you encounter a film that is impossible to categorize under simply one genre yet the masterful director Alejandro Jodorowsky here successfully assembles various genres like it's no trouble at all. To define Santa Sangre as just another foreign horror movie would be obvious but at the same time truly shortsighted as it contains an equally large amount of genuine drama that is actually a lot more captivating than most Oscarwinning and hugely overrated motion pictures. And if that isn't enough yet this simultaneously is an immensely artistic and experimental effort that brings forward uniquely bizarre visions and dared symbolism.The story is composed of two main chapters that are set in different eras but both revolving on protagonist Fenix who is briefly introduced as a resident in a mental institution. The fist and most dazzling part of the film is a 40 minutes long flashback in which we get an illustration of Fenix' unpleasant childhood. He's the son of traveling circus artists and a promising young magician himself but they don't exactly form a model family. Fenix' alcoholic and aggressive father has an affair with the obscene tattooed woman and his mother is the leader of a dangerously fanatic cult that worships an armless Goddess. Another violent argument between the parents results in a real tragedy that settles young Fenix up with an everlasting trauma. This brilliantly choreographed flashback is indescribably unsettling and this without showing much graphic images. Tod Browning's classic film Freaks already made clear that a circus can be a truly petrifying place and the wide versatility of eerie characters midgets clowns whitefaced acrobats magicians is well represented in Jodorowsky's imagination as well. Particularly Fenix' father is a disturbing man not in the least because he subjects his own son to bloody rituals that supposedly make a 'real man' out of him. Despite the constant atmosphere of surrealism these were some of the most shocking 40 minutes of my life.The second and larger part of the film is slightly less powerful mainly because Jodorowsky's script tries to convince us of something that clearly is implausible. Under the influence of his mother who returns after many years Fenix escapes the mental clinic and starts to give shows again with a totally new act. The mother is still very dominating though and merely sees her son as an instrument with killer arms that she can use to avenge herself. Only the reuniting with his long lost love can bring some peace and quiet in Fenix' unbalanced life. This second part is far bloodier than the first and the uncanny circus setting has been replaced with grim big city ghettos where drug abuse and prostitution are the most natural things in the world. This surrounding is still disturbing but definitely less overwhelming than the circus also because you're more familiar with it. The clear references towards Freud and the infamous Oedipus syndrome still work but they aren't new things anymore. Thank God everything is still filmed in a hugely fascinating way with camera angles and color shades that pretty much make your head spin and most characters actually evoke real sentiments of compassion and admiration. Especially Alma I loved her! In conclusion Santa Sangre is a terribly neglected movie that deserves a ranking in the IMDb top250 honestly! and I wish I could reward it with a rating higher than 10 out of 10.".

Jodorowsky's film contains the same elements oedipus complex. serial killer etc and he took it to another insane level.  he shows the killers background and his long buried reasons for killing which psycho IV failed to do.  it also contains awe inspiring cinematography and surreal images that will haunt the viewer for days.  this is truly jordorowsky's masterpiece!  if hitchcock were still alive he would remake Santa Sangre because it is ten times the film he envisioned with Psycho.".

She gets her arms cut of after she poors a bottle of H2NO4 which lies around in a cupboard ? on her unfaithfull husband who's about to have sex with a tattooed woman with an enormous ass and there you have the motive this is all presented to you in the first half an hour and then you'll have to sit it through all the way the child grows up and hears his mother constantly telling him to cut of other women's arms or at least to kill them..

Jodorowsky is a seriously cool guy and it is commendable whenever a filmmaker goes out on a limb to make something with zero mainstream appeal. He is probably a genius based on the quality of his comics more so than his movies. But come on. Bad is bad. I never for a single moment forgot that I was watching a movie during this. The histrionic acting was laughable. I did not care about a single character. The symbolism was obvious and clunky. The special effects were cartoonish. I became increasingly bored and had to pause the film twice just to get up the energy to finish it. I did like one scene  the piano scene  which was genuinely impressive. His son apparently can act when given the right material. But the rest of it was insufferably dumb.".

Luckily I had the chance to see it in the latenight screening in a small cinema in my city.The blood in the title reappears in different contexts as theme in the film from colored water claimed as saints blood over that drained in a tattooing resembling an initiation rite to that of murdered women. I would not recommend it for people sensitive to such sights. For others it shows that blood is a very special liquid' in all its metaphysical contexts.There is some very powerful imagery in this film a bleeding dying elephant and its bizarre burial cutoff arms whitepainted corpses etc. images that haunt you not because of their goriness but their unique intensity.The story is based on that of  a Mexican mass murderer so I was a  bit biased before I went to the cinema but was surprised when the story unrolled it was not about some ugly monstrous guy like I expected but that the protagonist was portrayed as a troubled young man for whom one could have sympathies despite his killings. I wont summarize the plot once again just read the summary on  this site for that. What made the film especially interesting is that Jodorowsky packs his film full of different motifs Christian saints cult Freuds Oedipus complex the ancient story of Phoenix. As even names are filled with significance in this film it is no coincidence the main character is called Fenix and has an eagle tattooed on his breast. Resembling the ancient myth Phoenix has to be destroyed first in this case through freeing his own self from his omnipresent mother figure that holds a grasp on his soul before he can be reborn again.".

Overall this film has a very gentle feel with slow fadeouts used frequently in giving this effect. Dunne is wonderful in her playing earlier in a lighter fashion and makes a skillful transformation into the section of the film where she is older and more serious. I had sympathy for her character in spite of the sacrifices she makes for John Boles remaining in the back street of his life.

	schema:reviewBody "BACK STREET Universal 1932 directed by John M. Stahl from the popular novel by Fannie Hurst is not so much a story about a certain street in a certain town but a love story of two people who have each other but are unable to unite as husband and wife. While such a theme might have been a product for a Ruth Chatterton or Kay Francis the heroine in question was awarded to Irene Dunne on loan from RKO Radio based on the strength of her Academy Award nominated performance in 1931's Best Picture winner CIMARRON. John Boles a likable actor and fine singer of screen musicals who made his way through dramas assumes the sort of role suited for prospects as Ronald Colman or Ricardo Cortez. Under Stahl's direction BACK STREET turned out to be a money maker for the studio career advancement for Dunne and further roles in the soap opera school for Boles including another opposite Dunne in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE RKO 1934.The story begins at the turn of the century Cincinnati in the good old days before the Eighteenth Amendment. Ray Schmidt Irene Dunne is introduced as a carefree girl living at home with her father Paul Weigel whom she works at his store stepmother Jane Darwell and halfsister Freda June Clyde. Popular with the men she's loved by the ambitious Kurt Shendler George Meeker who hopes to marry her after investing in the profitable automobile business. Fate steps in when Ray's friend Mr. Bakeless Walter Catlett a traveling salesman introduces her to visiting businessman Walter D. Saxel John Boles at the train station. Their one day courtship turns to love. Although engaged to marry his childhood sweetheart Walter hopes to change all that by arranging Ray to meet with him and his mother Maude Turner Gordonthe following afternoon at Eden Park by the band stand. Delayed due to Freda's personal troubles Ray's late arrival finds her watching the crowd gathering away. Five years later Walter a junior partner in the banking business and Ray employed at a Wall Street firm meet again on the streets of New York. In spite of Walter's marriage to Corinne Doris Lloyd and father of two he finds he cannot live without Ray. Leaving both her job and apartment Walter arranges for Ray to take up residence elsewhere so they can meet secretly and resume their relationship. Posing as a married woman Ray keeps very much to herself during Walter's business or family trips corresponding only with her friendly landlady Mrs. Dole ZaSu Pitts. As Ray befriends a troubled girl named Francine Shirley Grey whose life parallels hers advising her to break off her relationship with a married man Ray continues living her back street existence with Walter for the next 25 years leading to complications when confronted by Walter's now grown children William Bakewell and Arletta Duncan.The success of BACK STREET produced many imitations along with two remakes for Universal 1941 starring Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan the best and most revived version and 1961 featuring Susan Hayward and John Gavin the least inspired in spite of Technicolor and uptodate story. While remakes usually fail to compare with the original the 1941 version is an exception to the rule. Boyer and Sullavan's enactment of Walter and Ray improve over Boles and Dunne each more satisfying playing loyal or long suffering spouses than unfaithful husband and his mistress. Boyer's acting is more direct especially during a scene when confronted by his son about his illicit affair to then order him to mind his own businessas compared to Boles' more polite manner in the same situation. The only time Boles breaks away from his gentle manner is when Ray asks him to give her a baby but even his outrage as to how this could ruin him is more controlled than forceful.Dunne's handling of Ray too is gentle and softspoken throughout except during the opening in a couple of unrelated scenes where she speaks and acts in the manner of actress Barbara Stanwyck. The underscore that sets the tone for plot and characters used to great advantage in the remakes is sadly lacking in this back street of classic love stories. For Irene Dunne greater movie roles I REMEMBER MAMA RKO 1948 included were ahead of her. Out of circulation possibly due to the latter remakes the original BACK STREET sufficed again at revival movie houses in the 1970s public television by 1982 and then on American Movie Classics cable channel in 1991 where it sometimes played on a double billwith the 1941 version before returning to the land of obscurity. Ofthe three adaptations only the 1961 carnation had further exposure with its distribution on home video in the 1990s. 12".

This film and Dunne's performance were the ultimate in soap opera entertainment for the early 1930's and audiences loved it. Boles a wooden actor if there ever was one is actually quite good in this movie as Walter Saxel the man Dunne just can't seem to get enough of. Unfortunately since he's married and raising a family there isn't too much of him to go around. The tearjerking ending is worth sticking around for however and it's a good idea to keep a box of tissues handy. Despite the year 1932 the film tackles an issue that was somewhat taboo for the times i.e. extramarital sex and its consequences. It's all done tastefully and relatively true to the original novel by Fannie Hurst. For those unfamiliar with her work Ms. Hurst was the Danielle Steele of her day although she's largely forgotten now. So is this film but it's worth seeing if only for a view of an early performance by the incredible Irene Dunne. Of course the talented Ms. Dunne went on to star in more famous movies than this one but she gives a worthy effort to the proceedings here and raises the film far above the norm.".

When she runs into him again on Wall Street of all places he's married with children yet still very much in love with her. Setting her up in an apartment and keeping their relationship alive but very private Boles thinks he's got what it takes to make her happy. But she's not content being on this Back Street and takes off back home where he follows her and convinces her to return. Years go by and they end up in Paris after a voyage on a luxury cruise ship with his wife and children also in attendance where even in a Back Street hotel she's loyal to him in spite of a visit from his nonunderstanding son William Bakewell.For the first 34 of the film nothing really much happens except a parade of fashion of the eras which the film covers. But once they get aboard the cruise ship and head to the city of lights the film really takes off. Dunne is certainly lovely more wifely than mistress material so that's where the sadness of this film comes in that a missed opportunity for happiness set him to a new life. Boles playing a likable if somewhat selfish character tries to insert an understanding of what this unhappy husband is going through although his wife Doris Lloyd is barely seen and not at all defined as a character. Bakewell's angry young man manages to insert a bit of humanity and understanding. Wasted in pointless roles are Jane Darwell Zasu Pitts and Walter Catlett although Shirley Grey gets a few opportunities to shine as Dunne's half sister who goes through her own scandalous situation.Directed with style by John Stahl a veteran of 30's tearjerkers this version remains the best of the three although the 1941 version was pretty much done in the same mold. The soapiest version was the 1961 Susan Hayward film which seemed ridiculous trying to get tears out of its audience since its heroine was a lot harder than either Dunne or 1941's Margaret Sullavan and got to suffer living in the lap of luxury.".

	schema:headline " A precode film in which Ray and Walter fall in love...but he's married!";
	schema:reviewBody "Ha...I thought my summary would get your attention! While Back Street is clearly a precode film in its sensibilities it's not THAT openminded. You see Ray is a lady Irene Dunnean oddly named on at that! But she does fall in love with a married man...and that definitely gives the film precode sensibilities. The film begins in Cincinnati around the turn of the 20th century and much of it takes place around Over the Rhinea neighborhood in the northern portion of the city and which was known for its German community and beer gardens now...it's a far more unsavory area...but improving. Because I lived in Cincinnati for 14 years I enjoyed hearing about the areasuch as her lover Walter John Boles who lived in nearby Hamilton as well as their meeting in Eden Park. In fact for that reason the film is a mustsee for Cincinnatians. But should other folks watch Back Street? Read on.When the film begins Ray is a popular lady with many suitors. However she inexplicably falls for Walter and falls hard. However the night they are supposed to meet they somehow miss each other and only meet up again five years laterafter he's married and has a family. Despite this the pair begin seeing each other and Ray throws caution and morality to the wind. He soon rents her an apartment and she's a kept woman...Walter's mistress while he pretends to be a good husband.For me Back Street is a very hard sell...even with its Cincinnati connection. After all it's hardly a romance since the plot is all about adultery. The film does seem to paint it in romantic terms and there is a speech by Walter later in the film where he justifies having this mistress for decades. Romantic...certainly not. Plus so often Ray just comes of as pathetic...especially when she lectures another kept woman about the sanctity of marriage and then literally Walter walks in the door and she drops everything to run to him! As for Walter he's just a selfish jerk despite his lovely speech glorfying the joys of adultery! Well acted and interesting...but also a sad film that is easy to dislike. Perhaps too 'modern' in its sensibilities for an old fashioned guy like me. Slickly made but not a film I enjoyed.".

Irene Dunne understated and excellent is the unfortunate goodtime but not that goodtime as she quite explicitly states to George Meeker she doesn't put out gal of Cincinnati circa 1900 she has the misfortune to meet an upandcoming and already engaged John Boles and ends up being his backstreet mistress. It's refreshingly preCode frank about such things and some good character actorsWalter Catlett Jane Darwellturn up in small roles. I also liked Meeker as the nice guy who loves Dunne but just isn't interesting enough to make her want him back. The trouble is and it mustn't have been as evident in 1932 is that Boles's character is such a jerk. Time and again he'll say something insensitive or do something insensitive to her then beg for an apology and get it. He's not worth wasting a life over and her motives are somewhat unclear. Still it's a solid '30s soap. I like the 1941 Margaret Sullavan version better but this one's miles ahead of the Susan Hayward and less susceptible to unintentional laughter.".

So when popular cheerleader Paris Milian gets into a jam Alvin offers to help her if she pretends to be his girlfriend. But Alvin soon finds out that there's more to popularity than he realized. As Paris puts it Popularity is like a job and you have to work to keep up with everyone else. In the end Alvin learns that it's far more rewarding to just be himself. There's a clich we never get tired of hearing. I thought the acting in the movie was great. Nick Christina and the rest of the cast were believable in their roles but still managed to stay funny. I especially liked Steve Harvey playing Nick Cannon's 'Stuck in the 70's' dad. This movie may not be 1010 great but if you're looking for a good date movie you may want to consider this one.".

For example The Shop Around the Corner In The Good Old Summertime and You've Got Mail are all the same story with the last two being remakes of the first.

Beyond all else I feel a great deal of sympathy for everyone who had anything to do with this and anyone who has tried to fix their eyes upon a screen that was showing it. I don't know where this went wrong. Maybe it was a bad idea to hire some actress to write and helm a flick. I honestly don't know if Milian can act since no one in this appear to have even a smidgen of a hint of talent in the craft and it may at least partially be related to the direction. Heck not everything in this is awful. It's just that the potency of the suck overpowers what relatively little of this that doesn't blow. This is a predictable tasteless embarrassing excuse for a romantic teen sex romp. Nobody gets through with their dignity intact. The barrier between the popular kids and the ones not considered cool is ridiculously excessive in this and you find yourself not believing that much of anything that occurs in this could happen in any conceivable universe. This never made me laugh. The humor is forced and tries way too hard. Stooping to the lowest common denominator seldom looks quite this ugly. The plot slowly unfolds between this cast of caricatures with nigh a single surprise along the way. There's some eyecandy in this. A bit of the music is OK. I recommend this solely to people who watch all they can get near of this genre of sigh movie. 110".

	onyx:emotionText "I have not had any exposure to the original though there is no doubt in my mind that it is superior simply because the opposite would not seem possible. Beyond all else I feel a great deal of sympathy for everyone who had anything to do with this and anyone who has tried to fix their eyes upon a screen that was showing it. I don't know where this went wrong. Maybe it was a bad idea to hire some actress to write and helm a flick. I honestly don't know if Milian can act since no one in this appear to have even a smidgen of a hint of talent in the craft and it may at least partially be related to the direction. Heck not everything in this is awful. It's just that the potency of the suck overpowers what relatively little of this that doesn't blow. This is a predictable tasteless embarrassing excuse for a romantic teen sex romp. Nobody gets through with their dignity intact. The barrier between the popular kids and the ones not considered cool is ridiculously excessive in this and you find yourself not believing that much of anything that occurs in this could happen in any conceivable universe. This never made me laugh. The humor is forced and tries way too hard. Stooping to the lowest common denominator seldom looks quite this ugly. The plot slowly unfolds between this cast of caricatures with nigh a single surprise along the way. There's some eyecandy in this. A bit of the music is OK. I recommend this solely to people who watch all they can get near of this genre of sigh movie. 110";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be fair in saying that I didn't have high hopes for Troy Beyer's Love Don't Cost A Thing a movie that stars Nick Cannon and singer Christina Milian in an urbanized remake of the 1987 romantic comedy Can't Buy Me Love. Original Can't Buy Me Love scriptwriter Michael Swerdlick contributes to Beyer's remake script which features Cannon and Milian in the roles of the geek and the beauty two roles made famous in 1987 by Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Petersen.Cannon plays Alvin Johnson a.k.a. Pool Boy he gets his name because he cleans people's swimming pools and Milian plays Paris Morgan the most popular girl in school. Alvin is a bit of an automotive genius if nothing else since he's trying to win a scholarship to a tech school with the hightech engine that he and his friends have constructed.Alvin is tired of being made fun of by the popular kids and decides that he wants a piece of the action but is unsure of where to search his friends naturally think he's crazy for thinking up such a scheme. But he's not hearing that though and he wants memories of their high school years.He gets his chance when Paris crashes her mom's Cadillac Escalade and he offers to do the repairs. In return however she must pose as his girlfriend  for two weeks. Alvin and Paris of course face the strident scorn of the cool kids and pretty soon Alvin grows pretty attached to his newfound fame.Without really realizing it he forgets what he already had being that he makes pariahs out of his best friends frightens his parents especially the father Steve Harvey with his strange behavior and Paris soon begins to miss the geeky Alvin that she really liked.Love Don't Cost A Thing retreads the familiar territory of most of the high school comedies of yesteryear the uncool guy gets the pretty girl  after his plan has been exposed  and everything gradually returns to normalcy and tries to make amends with his friends that he forgot while on his path to glory.For the first half Love is actually quite fun to watch and even it brought back memories of my high school career which I left behind when I graduated in June of 2004.The second half is where we run into trouble not because of directing and poor scriptwriting or any other technical difficulties but because Cannon's transformation seemed to be really... something. I'll be the first to admit that he does some pretty mean things to his friends and to Paris while on his ego trip of popularity even this is too much and made a little too believable and for that I really despised Alvin for what he did.Cannon and Milian are a great couple and have great chemistry but I remembered where it's all going to lead eventually which is in that same direction that most teen comedies go.The biggest perk out of it all is that Love doesn't resort to grossout humor and sex gags to really win the interest of the viewer and for that I'm grateful. Other than that there's not much else.NOTE There's one scene that never ceases to amaze me and that's when Alvin first serves up his proposal to Paris. He makes his move Paris asks what he wants in return. Alvin looks away and out comes the priceless line Oh what? You think I'm some cheap 'ho? Alvin of course replies No no sex. I just want to rent you. Paris considers and then agrees to being his girl. And she puts her foot down about him not thinking about sex or looking at her booty. Priceless.Love Don't Cost A Thing buys a 510".

I still like the original better and Patrick Dempsey made the character much more believable than Nick Cannon can. Loved the scenes of Nick Cannon cleaning the pool and dancing to Michael Jackson. Christina Millian was okay but the acting was not that great from her. The best actor in the movie were Alvins sidekick friends Kenan Thompson and Kumar from Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. The soundtrack was pretty unremarkable and that was one thing I remembered from the original. It was pack full of classic 80s songs.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was just okay. Not too sure why they decided to remake this class 80s flick. I still like the original better and Patrick Dempsey made the character much more believable than Nick Cannon can. Loved the scenes of Nick Cannon cleaning the pool and dancing to Michael Jackson. Christina Millian was okay but the acting was not that great from her. The best actor in the movie were Alvins sidekick friends Kenan Thompson and Kumar from Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. The soundtrack was pretty unremarkable and that was one thing I remembered from the original. It was pack full of classic 80s songs. Overall the plot was as cheesy as the original and pretty hard to believe. Some of the plot was random such as Christina's boyfriend being in the NBA and cheating on her.

His hope is that through his association with her he will gain entree into the cool' crowd at school.The stereotypes of adolescents that the film presents weren't fresh twenty years ago and they're even less so today.

True to the formula Alvin eventually learns a lesson or two about what being true to oneself really means. There are virtually no funny moments in the film and the scenes between Alvin and his sexobsessed dad begin to border on the creepy.

	schema:headline " A Surprisingly pleasant movie with good performances";
	schema:reviewBody "My thoughts for Love Don't Cost a Thing at first were not good. I really thought this film was going to be another piece of teenage garbage since there were very few teenager flicks this year. I however was pleasantly surprised to be proved wrong tonight as I walked into the 930pm showing of Love Don't Cost a Thing. The movie is about a loser kid named Alvin played perfectly by Nick Cannon. Alvin like most losers always wanted to feel and be like the popular guys at school. I know what everyone is saying we have seen this film before. Yes I will admit we did but the script took this ordinary plot and added things too it. It has a large touch of reality to it but again in the end suffers from the typical happy ending. Well to continue back to what the film is about Alvin falls in love with one of the most popular and prettiest girls in the school. This girl is named Paris played by the beautiful Christina Milian. Paris gets in trouble when she is riding around town in her mothers new Escalade when she gets into an accident and has no choice but bring it to a local shop to get it fixed. Paris finds out the cost is 3000 and she is broke. Alvin knows how to fix cars and makes an offer with Paris that he will fix her car if she pretends she and him are dating. This is where a heartfelt sometimes serious and real life movie begins but sadly ends with the typical Hollywood Ending.The acting for this type of movie was great. The lead role played by Nick Cannon was right on target. I am really starting to enjoy his work. I thought Drumline Nick's first movie was decent although it was basically for music lovers.  His character in that film was very likeable and so was his character in this film. His transformation from Dork to Cool Guy seemed so natural which was very nice to see. Christina Milian was pretty good as the main female lead. This was her first movie and her performance was pretty strong. I think she did a good job. Steve Harvey's character I did not care for. He played Alvin's father in the movie and reminded me a lot Eugene Levy's character in American Pie. He was obviously just put into the film for comedic effect but I feel this did not work well.Michael Swerdlick  Troy Beyer wrote the script for this film. They did a good job with taking the normal loser kid becomes a cool kid script and adding a lot of new scenes to this film. But like I said previously they both seem to fall for that typical Hollywood ending. The script had a very real life feel to it and I can picture most of this actually occurring in real life. I can honestly relate to the feelings and emotions of the characters. I also wish that one day someone would make a film about a dork kid who becomes a cool kid and try not to make it a comedy. This film attempted to do this on the most part but like I said above they threw Steve Harvey in this film to try to get a few chuckles.  Troy Beyer was also the director of this film I think she did a good job directing especially since this is only her second film.So I walked out of the theater feeling good. The film put a smile on my face and I really felt I could relate to this film. It is a typical film for the most part which in Hollywood does not really mean anything anymore. It did however take the normal script and add some new things to it to spice it up and make it seem more like a reality than fiction. This movie is not an Academy Award winner or anything but it's a decent Hollywood release that many should like. The critics once again panned this film which does not surprise me. They always like the Independent films which I normally always agree with them on but when it comes to mainstream Hollywood films they are usually wrong. So In conclusion I liked this movie for the most part it did have a few problems here and there but all in all I really enjoyed it. My final rating for Love Don't Cost A Thing is a 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Were you ever that teenager who wanted to be popular so bad? Did you ever see that one teenager who did anything and everything out of their way just to be a cool kid even if they had to pay for it? If you were that kid or if you knew that kidthen you should definitely go watch this movie because Alvin Johnson was that teenager. Alvin Johnson is the main character in the movie Love Don't Cost a Thing he was played by the one and only Nick Cannon.This movie was a modern day remake of the 1987 movie Cant Buy Me Love.The movie tells a story of a young nerdy teen who offered his life savings to the most popular girl in the school just to be dated for a month. He did this because he thought it would make him popular. For a while he was popular he even stopped hanging with his real friends to be with his new friends. It worked for a while but everyone eventually found out about their arrangements. I believe the reason I love this movie so much is because it has a very unbelievably happy ending. Alvin Johnson and Paris Morgan who was played by the gorgeous Christina Milian were a very cute couple in the movie. The scene that caught my attention most in the movie is when they had a date night on the last day before their breakup. Paris Morgan had looked at Alvin Johnson in a way like none other. It was the look of love lust and passion. She realized that she really did like him and that she did want to be in a real relationship with him. I thought that scene was very cute considering that they were in two totally different social groups at school. It shows that all that really matters is what's on the inside not a person's social status. Another thing that caught my attention about the relationship that they had in the movie was that they had started a real relationship outside the on set of the movie. Before the movie was recorded or even released they were dating.They were in a relationship for over two years during this time period. I feel like the bond they had already created made the movie seem more realistic which in turn made more people attracted to this movie. The high school setting that the director created was quite relatable to the intended audience in my opinion. The movie had described all of the different types of social groups that any typical high school would have. There were the nerdslosers the jocks the popular girls the Asian kids and even the emo and Gothic groups. Most high schools around the country has these different type of social groups and it is greatly appreciated that they put all the different groups in the movie. I state that because in the movie you will see the nerdslosers prospective versus the jocks and popular girls prospective. Not only do you see that but you also see how the other social groups view the jocks and popular girl groups. In this movie it actually gives courage to the boys in high school that may feel like they are lame or too nerdy to have a chance with the pretty girl in school. This movie also can shed light on those pretty popular girls who may feel like they're too good for a certain person. It could also help them realize that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover you never know who may be the one. Lastly this movie teaches you that you should just be yourself and not try to portray someone you're not because at the end of the day everything comes to the light. My all time favorite thing about this movie has to be the soundtrack play list. I really like almost every song that was featured. The songs that I had really liked were Comes to the light by Jill Scott Pass the Courvoisier by Busta Rhymes We Rise by Rama Duke and lastly Luv Me Baby by Murphy Lee. I enjoy these four songs because they were all so catchy and matched every single scene in the movie perfectly. Most of the songs that were played in this movie were either previously played on the radio or the movie made the songs popular. These songs kept me entertained throughout the entire movie. I had even caught myself dancing and singing to the songs throughout the movie. A particular part in the movie Love Don't Cost A Thing that I really liked that was being played was when everyone in the school had found out about Alvin and Paris' secret. The song that was played during this scene was Comes to the Light by Jill Scott. In conclusion this is my favorite movie because not only is it for entertainment but it also teaches you a valuable lesson. I love it from start to finish simply because of the happy ending. This movie is relatable to all high school students or any student that is about to get ready to go to high school. I feel this way because nobody really knows what social group they will end up in until they get to high school. I feel like every student would like to be recognized and noticed for at least something because nobody wants to be considered a loser. The happy ending love story between popular girl and loser boy makes everyone realize that there is somebody out there for everyone and that they may one day have a happy ending also.".

The songs that I had really liked were Comes to the light by Jill Scott Pass the Courvoisier by Busta Rhymes We Rise by Rama Duke and lastly Luv Me Baby by Murphy Lee. I enjoy these four songs because they were all so catchy and matched every single scene in the movie perfectly. Most of the songs that were played in this movie were either previously played on the radio or the movie made the songs popular. These songs kept me entertained throughout the entire movie. I had even caught myself dancing and singing to the songs throughout the movie. A particular part in the movie Love Don't Cost A Thing that I really liked that was being played was when everyone in the school had found out about Alvin and Paris' secret. The song that was played during this scene was Comes to the Light by Jill Scott. In conclusion this is my favorite movie because not only is it for entertainment but it also teaches you a valuable lesson. I love it from start to finish simply because of the happy ending. This movie is relatable to all high school students or any student that is about to get ready to go to high school. I feel this way because nobody really knows what social group they will end up in until they get to high school. I feel like every student would like to be recognized and noticed for at least something because nobody wants to be considered a loser. The happy ending love story between popular girl and loser boy makes everyone realize that there is somebody out there for everyone and that they may one day have a happy ending also.";

	schema:reviewBody "To even think that I actually considered seeing this in theaters when it came out ten years ago. I have to admit I've had a crush on Christina Milian ever since I saw her debut music video AM To PM when I was about 15 and I didn't even realize that she was the same girl who was on Disney Channel years prior who did the Movie Surf bit and I even thought she was cute then. I also watched it for Melissa Schuman who was a member of the girl group known as Dream at one point. Pretty THOSE TWO were the only reasons why I watched it and it's a good thing that I never saw it in theaters because it would have been a waste of money. Even watching it on HBO was a waste of time.Let me break it down like this I learned later on that this movie was somewhat of a remake of Can't Buy Me Love that was released 16 years prior to this movie. The premise is similar. High school nerd pays off a popular girl to pretend to be her boyfriend for a few weeks and then gets cocky with the whole popular lifestyle. I must say that I still have not watched Can't Buy Me Love but I might check it out to see if it's a better movie than this because this movie really has no redeeming qualities.I was never really a big fan of Nick Cannon's to begin with but I seriously was not able to buy him as this high school nerd who people made fun of. Plus what's the deal with the popular territories? So an unpopular person can't walk through a freaking hallway without being bullied? What if someone's locker was in that general area? Oh and what was with the Sean John product placement? I get that anybody popular rocked Sean John but it was overkill. Plus someone who was considered nerdy is bound to be assaulted and no teachers or authority figures are around to stop it? Not a totally realistic view of high school in the slightest.Plus what was up with the ending? I get that Alvin was confessing all the stuff he went through and learned his lesson...or so we are supposed to believe that he did but I certainly didn't quite understand why he needed to mention what he likes to drink and Michael Jackson's Bad album Great album no doubt but what was up with the writing with that line?. It also felt too predictable that Paris would forgive Alvin and go out with him in the end. What I wonder is why. She exposed to him to everybody about how he paid her and everything that he did.Okay I take it back regarding the lack of redeeming qualities. Steve Harvey DID kind of have some moments here and there but that was only it.The rest of the movie is evidence that I really was bored and watched this on HBO to make up for not seeing it sooner but I really wish that it didn't because this movie sucked. I can go on about how this movie sucked. I like Christina Milian. I have all of her CDs but regarding any movies she has done I am not sure what I actually liked. Well maybe Be Cool or those Christmas movies for ABC Family but I guess I'll stick to those. It's better than watching this. And about Melissa Schuman well no disrespect for her she is a good singer but it's no wonder her acting career never got off the ground after being in this.".

The only thing that bothers him is that there is neither any partying nor dating in his life. His father acknowledges the issue and actively encourages Alvin to improve his worklife balance. Unfortunately the dad's motives are not entirely based on what is good for his son. Rather the father actually wants to become a more influential person in Alvin's life. In fact the father goes so far that he even tries to distance Alvin from his nerdy friends who might indeed be nerdy but are at least genuine friends. Eventually the dad realises that he has been pushing Alvin along the road of selfdestruction and rights his wrongs by providing the kind of help and support that Alvin really needs.Paris is the lead female character the most popular cheerleader who used to date a guy who has become an NBA star. A life of luxury as a wife of a famous basketball player is what she thinks would be the best for her. It's not that Paris has no other interests nor is that she is so hopelessly materialistic. Peer pressure and the acute lack of parental guidance and support have brought to where she is. However the cracks are starting to open. First Dru the basketball start boyfriend declares on TV that he is a free agent on the dating scene. Second Paris gets the glimpse of how cruel her friends are when she witnesses how heartlessly they abuse the nerds who dare to walk or sit near them. Third she damages her mother's SUV driving it in direct contravention to her promise to stay clear of that car as she is on her mother's car insurance.Alvin sees that traffic accident as his opportunity to buy his way into the world of partygoers. He offers Paris to pay for the parts worth 1500 and fix the car for free if she would pretend in public that they are dating. At first she is outraged by the proposal but due to the necessity to get the damage to the car fixed quickly Alvin and Paris strike a deal that she would pretend to be his date for two weeks. During those two weeks Paris introduces Alvin to her friends helps him develop social skills and orchestrates his entire makeover. She also comes to realise that Alvin is the only person in her life who encourages her to pursue her real musicrelated interests as opposed to settling for the status of the potential future wife of a cheating sports star. Moreover Alvin impresses Paris with his exceptionally strong intellect decency and sincerity. There is also that curious human tendency to get attached to the person whose life we are trying to change. Therefore it is hardly surprising that Paris falls in love with Alvin by the end of the twoweek arrangement.As it is typical of romantic comedy plots Alvin otherwise being a very clever guy fails to see this obvious development and also fails to grasp the real importance that Paris has in his life. He only values her contribution to his popularity. Therefore he decides to cast her away at the end of the twoweek contract. Furthermore he rejects her when she tries to reconnect with him again. By doing so Alvin not only alienates Paris but he also puts his entire future in jeopardy. He is simply seduced by his ability to not only fit in but also to set the rules evidenced by the crowd's adopting his ridiculous dancing style. Moreover having abandoned Paris Alvin develops a crass attitude vulgar mannerism and egoism that far exceed anything displayed by the snobbish partygoers. He is now fully on the road to a complete selfdestruction.Fortunately for Alvin Paris is the one who helps him return to the right track by publicly exposing their twoweek deal and thereby ruining his illgotten popularity amongst the partygoers. That gives Alvin some space to reflect on how he has got his priorities completely wrong and through his subsequent actions and with a bit of encouragement and the necessary financial support provided by his father everything falls in its place. Finally with a bit of luck he even gets an opportunity to impress Paris again now with his bravery and selflessness which prompts her to give him another chance.

	schema:headline " Vibrant and violent samurai action film from the underrated Sogo Ishii";
	schema:reviewBody "Gojoe 2000 is a typically vibrant and vivid piece of filmmaking from Japanese firebrand Sogo Ishii who remains perhaps one of the most radical and underrated Japanese filmmakers of the last twentyfive years. Ishii began his directing career in the late 1970's when he was still a student at the Nihon University and his work of that particular period with films like Panic High School 1978 Crazy Thunder Road 1980 and Burst City 1982 reflected an interest in performance art and his involvement in the Tokyo punk scene. Though later films like Angel Dust 1994 and Labyrinth of Dreams 1997 saw a greater sense of maturity and more clearly defined emphasis on character and atmosphere he remained a consistent and interesting talent with a truly original vision.Gojoe returns somewhat to the style of Ishii's earlier bold and energetic work combing grand spectacle with clearly defined storytelling with roots in actual Japanese folklore. However the way in which the narrative unfolds is really quite interesting with the story beginning with a scene of murder and the notion that the killing could have been supernatural as opposed to political with Ishii's subtle use of cinematography editing and sound design creating a staggering sense of tension from the very first frame. Added to this there are definitely shades of Masaki Kobayashi's classic anthologyfilm Kwaidan 1964 and Kaneto Shind's masterpiece Onibaba 1964 being developed here with that great atmosphere of supernatural intrigue murder violence and dread being continually juxtaposed against an expressionistic period setting which seems somewhat nightmarish and vaguely ethereal. The violence of Gojoe is occasionally fairly explicit and definitely overthetop but there is a distinct balletic grace to the way in which Ishii captures the action creating something that falls halfway between the overthetop fountains of gore seen in the majority of Japanese Anime or the more extreme films of Takashi Miike with something that is perhaps closer to the heavily choreographed kabuki theatre or interpretive dance.As the story progresses the supernatural elements give way to political intrigue and elements of actual historical fact but the whole arc of this notion seems designed to add some sense to the story of warring rivals as opposed to giving us a fullblown history lesson. Dialog is sparse and character development tends to emerge slowly from the quiet scenes of silent brooding and the more sombre moments that stress a philosophical aspect to the boundless scenes of violence and swordplay. Though ultimately the plot is slight and simplified to the point of near abstraction the film manages to keep us motivated through the continual combination of Ishii's imaginative direction and the fine performances of lead actors Daisuke Ryu who portrays the warrior monk Benkei and the always surprising Tadanobu Asano as the mysterious and deadly Shanao.As an actor Ryu is probably most familiar from Akira Kurosawa's historical masterpieces Kagemusha 1980 and Ran 1985 as well as Takashi Miike's more recent remake of Graveyard of Honour 2002 while Asano has worked with a number of highly esteemed Japanese filmmakers including Shinya Tsukamoto on Gemini 1999 and Vital 2004 Nagisa Oshima on Taboo 1998 Takeshi Kitano on Zatoichi 2003 the aforementioned Miike on Ichi the Killer 2001 and Sogo Ishii again on subsequent films Electric Dragon 80 000 V 2001 and Dead End Run 2004. Though essentially playing antagonists the two actors complement each other exceedingly well creating bold characters that manage to instil a sense of purpose and authority from a film that tends to rely heavily on action and excess. In terms of martial arts swordplay and a greatly choreographed sense of movement the film has certain similarities to director Zhang Yimou's trilogy of historical set martial arts films Hero 2002 The House of Flying Daggers 2004 and The Curse of the Golden Flower 2006 with Gojoe's reliance on historical content culture and subtle shades of politics probably stressing a similarity with Hero in particular.Certainly I wouldn't go as far as to call Gojoe a masterpiece. It has its flaws most of which are in the plotting the heavy reliance on historical context the awareness of the Japanese folklore that inspired it and the over abundance of lengthy fight sequences but still this something that is definitely worth checking out. Ishii's direction is filled with an eerie sense of atmosphere energy and imagination masking the limitation of the budget until a few sadly fake looking FX shots towards the end and offering us some of the most vibrant and violent scenes of action and combat you're ever likely to see.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gojoe 2000 is a typically vibrant and vivid piece of filmmaking from Japanese firebrand Sogo Ishii who remains perhaps one of the most radical and underrated Japanese filmmakers of the last twentyfive years. Ishii began his directing career in the late 1970's when he was still a student at the Nihon University and his work of that particular period with films like Panic High School 1978 Crazy Thunder Road 1980 and Burst City 1982 reflected an interest in performance art and his involvement in the Tokyo punk scene. Though later films like Angel Dust 1994 and Labyrinth of Dreams 1997 saw a greater sense of maturity and more clearly defined emphasis on character and atmosphere he remained a consistent and interesting talent with a truly original vision.Gojoe returns somewhat to the style of Ishii's earlier bold and energetic work combing grand spectacle with clearly defined storytelling with roots in actual Japanese folklore. However the way in which the narrative unfolds is really quite interesting with the story beginning with a scene of murder and the notion that the killing could have been supernatural as opposed to political with Ishii's subtle use of cinematography editing and sound design creating a staggering sense of tension from the very first frame. Added to this there are definitely shades of Masaki Kobayashi's classic anthologyfilm Kwaidan 1964 and Kaneto Shind's masterpiece Onibaba 1964 being developed here with that great atmosphere of supernatural intrigue murder violence and dread being continually juxtaposed against an expressionistic period setting which seems somewhat nightmarish and vaguely ethereal. The violence of Gojoe is occasionally fairly explicit and definitely overthetop but there is a distinct balletic grace to the way in which Ishii captures the action creating something that falls halfway between the overthetop fountains of gore seen in the majority of Japanese Anime or the more extreme films of Takashi Miike with something that is perhaps closer to the heavily choreographed kabuki theatre or interpretive dance.As the story progresses the supernatural elements give way to political intrigue and elements of actual historical fact but the whole arc of this notion seems designed to add some sense to the story of warring rivals as opposed to giving us a fullblown history lesson. Dialog is sparse and character development tends to emerge slowly from the quiet scenes of silent brooding and the more sombre moments that stress a philosophical aspect to the boundless scenes of violence and swordplay. Though ultimately the plot is slight and simplified to the point of near abstraction the film manages to keep us motivated through the continual combination of Ishii's imaginative direction and the fine performances of lead actors Daisuke Ryu who portrays the warrior monk Benkei and the always surprising Tadanobu Asano as the mysterious and deadly Shanao.As an actor Ryu is probably most familiar from Akira Kurosawa's historical masterpieces Kagemusha 1980 and Ran 1985 as well as Takashi Miike's more recent remake of Graveyard of Honour 2002 while Asano has worked with a number of highly esteemed Japanese filmmakers including Shinya Tsukamoto on Gemini 1999 and Vital 2004 Nagisa Oshima on Taboo 1998 Takeshi Kitano on Zatoichi 2003 the aforementioned Miike on Ichi the Killer 2001 and Sogo Ishii again on subsequent films Electric Dragon 80 000 V 2001 and Dead End Run 2004.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies. Many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won't understand why I find it so enthralling so I will try to explain...The movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights and while it has a few minor anachronisms they are completely forgivable. The story is a retelling of the famous duel between the Monk Benkei and the young Prince Yoshitsune on Gojo bridge. During the fight according to legend Yoshitsune bests Benkei and the monk becomes the prince's loyal retainer. This movie is a revision of that story however and involves war dark prophecy and political maneuvering.One of the main themes in the movie is Mappo which is the prophecy by the Buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan after the eruption of Mt Fuji and the civil war between the Taira Heike and the Minamoto Genji that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. It is a time of demons.Next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of Yoshitsune's sword training by the Tenku Raven Goblins of Karuma. Defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off. This is said to be where ninja clans began historically. Yoshitsune's depiction in Gojo nicely accommodates all of this.Then there is Benkei and the various strains of Buddhism depicted including a lot of Esoteric Buddhism of the Shingon sect. These are all depicted quite accurately and just to add a little extra the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story i.e. it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing.Allinall it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly truetolife for the period. The scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic. The soundtrack is great very brooding and ominous. I also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a great brooding antihero Shanao Yoshitsuneis depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power and Tetsukichi the scavenging swordsmith makes for and interesting depiction of the common man and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters.As to the plot to see why it is so good I really suggest you dig up an old book on Japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted Robin Hood vs Little John story into a gory tale of intrigue violence and infernal karma.".

These two movies are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clichs. Gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction.First off I hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie. You cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior says almost every character in Benkei's presence yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself. Instead of character development we get bloated boring gory battle scenes. Asano's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn't know what he is doing there. I know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of Asano's appeal but this movie doesn't serve him.A lot of the camera movement is nauseating. There is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and rather anticlimatic. Its too bad that really good samurai movies aren't being made in Japan nowadays with this type of budget. The colors scenery and costumes were great but the rest is just a loooong waste of time.

The camera won't stop spinning around this guy! There's maybe one or two more cool scenes that I forgot about in this flood of mediocrity but the last duel scene IS NOT ONE OF THEM! It may be because unlike in the earlier swordhandling scenes Shanao isn't maskedbut just because the director couldn't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled Asano Tadanobu doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme closeups of sword clashes!

I personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years. The situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the Japanese media due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority. The movie versions of GTO and Salary Man Kintaro are two other recent examples END SPOILER I don't understand. I just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this. Maybe the worst was lost in the translation.The ending of the movieon which marketing played a lot is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between Shanao and Benkei. But that legend is not the most popular in Japanese folklore and it is so detached from contemporary themes that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques who cares how the director wants to reinterpret the story!? Director Sasaki Hirohisa of Crazy Lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new Japanese directors to ignore Japanese audiences and target their movies for foreign film festivalsin order to gain faster international fame. This works although it doesn't make sense because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countrieswhat kind of movies people WATCH in those countries.

	schema:reviewBody "This story is set in 12th century Japan and shows the fight of a nonviolent monk against a demon protector of the Gojoe bridge. As far as story goes this one is not very interesting. At no point in the movie do you actually care what will happen next. The pace is slow which is successful at times but feel overly drawn out for the majority of the picture.The fighting scenes are not very well choreographed and are truly long and boring with the exception of the finale one. The effortlessness in which the demon slays its victims should have been shown with a few well placed kill instead of a continuous uninteresting placid bloodbath. It is said that the demon wants to kill a thousand souls and the director seemingly tried to show us at least a few hundred kills. I think this was a mistake.As much as the story fails to convey anything substantial the cinematographic work of Makoto Watanabe is some of the best footage I have seen in a while who exploits some interesting visual technics and has an amazing grasp of the power of colors. It also serves to create some distinct moods that can be relatively suggestive and involving. In particular I am thinking here of a scene in which Benkei finds a poor soul on a beach who wants to set himself ablaze. Numerous innovative compositions were also well used by director Sogo Ishii who seems to be given his cinematographer some creative leeway. Unfortunately the director cannot direct the rest of this mediocre story to anything substantial. The real star here is Watanabe who proves to be an ingenious director of photography and explores the art more than your average DOP. If you like artistic cinematography I suggest you endure the tedious story put mute if you want and enjoy some excellent footage.".

I think this was a mistake.As much as the story fails to convey anything substantial the cinematographic work of Makoto Watanabe is some of the best footage I have seen in a while who exploits some interesting visual technics and has an amazing grasp of the power of colors. It also serves to create some distinct moods that can be relatively suggestive and involving. In particular I am thinking here of a scene in which Benkei finds a poor soul on a beach who wants to set himself ablaze. Numerous innovative compositions were also well used by director Sogo Ishii who seems to be given his cinematographer some creative leeway. Unfortunately the director cannot direct the rest of this mediocre story to anything substantial. The real star here is Watanabe who proves to be an ingenious director of photography and explores the art more than your average DOP. If you like artistic cinematography I suggest you endure the tedious story put mute if you want and enjoy some excellent footage.";

It's not a complicated movie device at all yet I found myself feeling nothing for any of the characters. I was clock watching from literally the 12th minute in. The final giant battle like the rest of the fight scenes was also a let down. Mundane doesn't do it justice.The slight saving grace is some and I emphasise some excellent cinematography.

Luckily Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly tragic side of violence as well. Still it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he's making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory.

Another fine example of this genre is Onmyoji 2001. I would place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave Japanese directors.

The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore I loved how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close.I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world.  The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China Korea and Japan and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... Gojoe has the action story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer.

	schema:headline " Another internationally neglected Salvatore Samperi film";
	schema:reviewBody "Savatore Samperi is considered one of Italy's best directors in the comedydrama genre but international recognition has largely eluded him perhaps because international releases of his films have been horribly horribly dubbed into English like his most seminal film Malizia or given wildly appropriate Englishlanguage titles like the exploitative UK title of this one.This movie is set in the late 1940's a few years after the trauma of WWII and during 1948 Italian elections when the Italian Communist Party was surprising defeated at the polls an election many now believe was stolen by the American CIA. The political events are mostly kept in the background however as this story is told from the perspective of a precocious nineyearold boy Ju. His parents are both emotionally damaged from the deprivations of warthere's an uncomfortable scene where he watches his mother Paola Senatore sexually service his father Ugo Tognazzi marks on her backside evident from the switch his abusive father likes to use on his family members especially the female ones. The boy's larger awakening into adulthood however comes courtesy of his orphaned older cousin Nene Leanora Fani who comes to stay with his family. The teenage girl lets him sleep in her bed and confides him about her burgeoning sexuality and the illicit affair she is having with a local mulatto hood.Obviously this movie broaches some subjects AngloAmericans especially are rather paranoid about these days but I don't think it really deserves comparison to the notorious Maladolescenza. This is a serious art film not exploitation. Perhaps some of the confusion is in the casting. Leanora Fani who was actually quite a bit older than she looks here was generally in much sleazier movies i.e. in Beastialita she played a girl romantically in love with a dog. And Paola Senatore later became a bonafide hardcore porn star although only briefly and as the result of serious drug addiction. Both actresses however were beautiful and talented and very unlike the stereotype of porn stars today. And while their respective roles here have a certain sexual frankness they're still a long way from porn or other lurid exploitation. Ugo Tognazzi was more respected actor perhaps but even he did later direct some Edwige Fenech sex comedies and he was in Marco Ferreti's outrageous arthouse hit Le Gran Bouffe. What it really comes down to is that the Italians in the 70's simply didn't ghettoize and compartmentalize sexuallythemed films and the actors that appeared in them the way AngloAmericans do especially today. But I'm not so sure this is such a bad thing.Along with Malizia and Scandalo this is a Samperi film that desperately needs to be released with some decent Englsh subtitles the version I saw looked good but only had Italian subtitles. It would do much to rehabilitate the reputation of one of Italy's most talented 70's era directors.".

He is inquisitive and spies on Nen when she gets together with her boyfriend. And that is how Ju's father found them...This is an engrossing film particularly with the background of postwar political turmoil. The film is funny at times but the underlying atmosphere is one of sadness at the oppression the women suffer.I found the acting quite good but is is particularly the cinematography that impressed.

	schema:reviewBody "Children can not choose their parents This was what came into my mind after I saw this movie.This movie is based on actual incident happened in 1988. It was much more miserable than the movie. A woman was living with a man. She thought he had filed the marriage notification. When their son was born the man said he had filed the birth notification. One day he left her to live with another woman. When the boy reached the primary school age she knew neither the marriage notification nor the birth notification were filed. Facing this situation she decided to hide her children from the society. According to another source the mother told the police that she thought the birth notification of a bastard child would not be accepted.She had met several men and had 5 children two boys and three girls who were not registered and hidden from other people. When the second boy died of sick she hid the corps in the closet. While she works in a department store the eldest son took care of three sisters. When the eldest son was 14 she went out to live with her new man who was 16 years older than her. She gave the eldest son her address. When the children were protected by the police half a year later a girl was dead and the two were debilitated as they were confined in a room and poorly fed. The girls were 3 and 2 yo and still used diapers but they were changed only once every day. It is reported that the eldest boy blamed himself for not being able to take good care of his sisters instead of blaming his mother...Compared to the real story the movie is less miserable. In the movie even the little boy and girl look normal and pretty but in the real story they were very poorly developed. But it was still more than enough to surprise me. What a mother! In a conversation with the eldest boy she says May I not become happy? She acts on this thought without thinking of the same right about her children. Her childish lisping talk describes her immaturity. And of course men were more guilty. Sadly children can not choose their parents.Every child acted amazingly well very natural. Particularly the eyes of the eldest boy Akira are very impressive. The eyes tell many things from their miserable life.".

In the movie even the little boy and girl look normal and pretty but in the real story they were very poorly developed. But it was still more than enough to surprise me. What a mother! In a conversation with the eldest boy she says May I not become happy? She acts on this thought without thinking of the same right about her children. Her childish lisping talk describes her immaturity. And of course men were more guilty. Sadly children can not choose their parents.Every child acted amazingly well very natural. Particularly the eyes of the eldest boy Akira are very impressive. The eyes tell many things from their miserable life.";

	schema:headline " A compelling portrait of the world of abandoned children";
	schema:reviewBody "Nobody Knows is painful to watch. It's a story you won't shake off depicting the most defenseless of humans  four young children the oldest only twelve  trapped in growing poverty and abandonment. It's a processnarrative of devolution that makes you feel helpless and angry and sad. It's saved from mawkishness by the natural energy of the children playing the roles of the four kids. And if it survives its not because of its treatment of a social issue so much as for its evocation of the precise details of childhood.There are two main subjects here. One is criminal neglect the story is loosely based on events that happened in Tokyo in 1988. The other is the private often secret lives of children. Koreeda began as a documentary filmmaker and this seems to have given him exceptional skill in working with people and capturing their natural reactions. The winning tragic children in Nobody Knows four halfsiblings with different fathers and the same childish selfish mother never seem to be acting and often no doubt aren't. Nonetheless the subtlety of expression in the delicate mobile beautiful face of the older boy young Yya Yagira was such that it won him the Best Actor award at Cannes last year.Also important is Koreeda's gift for detail his meditative examinations of fingernails feet a toy piano video games pieces of paper objects strewn around a room the hundreds of little soft drink bottles that are everywhere in Japan plants dirt all the small things children see because they're closer to the ground. And the things they accept because they're defenseless and innocent but also incredibly adaptable.Akira who's only ten and whose voice changed during year spent making the movie is in charge. As their mother's absences become lengthier and the children finally seem to be abandoned for good money runs out. Akira is captain of a sinking ship a somber duty but he and his little sisters and brother keep finding time to laugh and play.Koreeda's a passionately serious filmmaker the two better known of his earlier fiction films deal with death and loss and here he considers as a given the worst of human carelessness and indifference both by society and the individual. Maborosi 1995 was a homage to Ozu but without Ozu's sense of social connectedness it begins with an isolated couple in the city and chronicles a young widow's second marriage in the country through a slow pastiche of observed daily scenes where event and even dialogue are minimal concerns. The content of Maborosi is too thin but the images and color are exquisite and the sequences of natural unrehearsedlooking scenes achieve an impressively rich beautiful zenlike calm. After Life 1998 uses actual recollections of older people talking to the camera to build up a fantasy about dead souls held temporarily in a bureaucratic preHeaven limbo being asked to choose a single favorite memory to take with them into eternity the effect is perplexing thoughtprovoking charming and with great economy of means cinematic.Nobody Knows isn't as brilliant or resolved as After Life or as exquisitely visual as Maborosi but for all its rambling excessive length it delivers a quantity of undigested patient misery and joy that will evoke such noble antecedents from the classic world of cinematic humanism as Clment's Forbidden Games De Sica's Bicycle Thief and the homeless father and son living on garbage in Kurosawa's Dodeskaden.What's new here though is a sense of the encompassing otherness of big modern cities and the stoicism and resiliency of childhood and perhaps also of the Japanese personality. Keiko the childish weak spoiled mother played effectively  we instantly hate her  by You who's some sort of pop star in Japan sneaks three of her four children into the new apartment and tells them they can't go out can't show themselves even on the balcony. In the real event this was largely because they were illegitimate and had no papers but here the explanation is that their noise may get them evicted. Only Akira can leave and she won't let him or the others go to school. They're prisoners of their urban anonymity and of an impersonal contemporary society.As in Andrew Berkin's Cement Garden the children also pretend everything's okay to escape the cruelty of the social welfare system. We watch agonizingly  and many writers say the movie's somewhat too long it does feel thus especially during the first hour  but this time Koreeda's world is more direct and specific than before and there's plenty of talk. The children chatter among themselves. Eventually they go out and mix a bit by day with other children. Akira even talks to himself he has to because there's no adult coaching him so he must impersonate an elder adviser.Whatever its roughness and excess Nobody Knows is intense and powerful filmmaking. Koreeda has put his whole heart and soul into this movie and with it achieves an experience you can't shrug off. Nor will you forget the kids especially the beautiful boy Yya Yagira who may be growing inch by inch into a star even as we speak.".

	schema:reviewBody "Today I went to the prescreening of Nobody Knows a stunningly brilliant film by director Hirokazu Koreeda who also directed the philosophical After Life. What if I were a 12 years old boy and left alone to take care of two younger sisters and one younger brother in a big city like Tokyo and I have to hide them in the apartment so nobody knows about them? That's what I have been thinking when I was watching this film and how the film gets my sympathy for these children. It allows me to experience the ordeal through these children's eyes and the transcending performance by Yuya Yagira who is the youngest actor ever won the best actor award in the history of Cannes Film Festival.Director Koreeda allows the camera to take the time to shoot and he never rushes from one scene to the next. He let me observe let me feel let me be as close to these children as I possibly can until I can no longer take it and until I am drowned by the frustration and sadness. I become as helpless as those children because I simply can not resist the urge to help them. That makes me cry. Through out the film Koreeda masterfully positioned his lenses to ordinary objects around these children such as simply a finger a hand a stain a foot or four empty glasses. But through these zoomed in images I have no trouble to see and feel what's going on in the whole picture. And it tells the story in a more profound fashion and more personal way a story you will never forget along with those images sometimes even the music.The 12 years old boy is played by Yuya Yagira who has a haircut like the Japanese animation character. Yagira's outstanding performance is original and remarkable and simply unforgettable. Through him you see a premature 12 years old boy who is acting as an adult to take care the other kids meanwhile he is still a 12 years old kid who will just like other kids around his age. That's make this movie can be so hard to watch sometimes because no matter how hard your heart is it will be softened by watching his struggle to survive. It's hard to leave this movie with dry eyes.There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best film I have seen this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are very few films I have seen that had the power to affect me as deeply as Nobody Knows. As highly as I recommend it I must also forewarn that this film has power some very serious power. To call Hirokazu Koreeda's Nobody Knows anything less than a masterpiece would be an insult to the story it tells. The craftsmanship we witness here from the masterful direction to the outstanding performances that the children were able to commit to are all something of incredible proportions.Nobody Knows which is a true story tells of four siblings ages 512 from different fathers who live in a small apartment in Tokyo. At first they live in the apartment with their childish Mother who is hardly ever home. With the exception of the oldest Akira the mother snuck the children in to keep the rent lower and prohibits them from ever leaving the apartment even the veranda for fear of them being seen. The children do not go to school. As they look after each other all they do is patiently and affectionately wait for their mother to come home.As the story progresses the children wake up one morning to some money on the kitchen table with a note from their mother saying that she'll be home in a month. As Akira steps up and takes charge of the apartment the bills and his siblings the children still hold hope that mother will be home soon. And then Nobody Knows hits you like a truck and goes right through you. Complete Abandonment. The smiles diminish and the childish affection for a mother that will never return is gone. Gone to play mother to another family it is now entirely up to Akira with money running out.Koreeda's direction of the children is exceptional as if the film was shot entirely candid. The camerawork is sincere as if we were one of the children stuck in that apartment. There are no gimmicks here no slide of hand or postproduction miracles. Nobody Knows is raw and thrives in Koreeda's ability to capture the distinct personalities of all four siblings their hopes and those secretive moments where Koreeda directs the children not for the stories sake but for the sake of the children being children.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Nobody Knows is the performances of the four children. All four children who conjured phenomenal performances were played by Japanese youths with no film backgrounds. After you see the film it is likely that Koreeda preferred it this way tapping into the honesty and energy that such youth had to offer. Their performances are so sincere and beautiful that on several occasions the tears will start to fall the goose bumps will rise and your heart will undoubtedly cry out to rescue these children to grab them in your arms and set them free.Without giving too much away one of the most touching scenes to me is on Yuki's birthday the only thing she wants is to be able to go outside for a walk with her big brother Akira. So when the night comes she puts on her little bear slippers an ear to ear smile on her face and with her hand in her brothers hand they set her heart free for if not only a night.Nobody Knows is a film that I will never let go of. This film impacted me so much and I found it so absolutely remarkable that it hasn't left my mind since it's viewing. I almost feel that recommending this film just isn't enough and all I can say is that I hope everyone gets the chance to enjoy this film for all that it is worth. As sure as it is to invoke emotion it is as sure to please as a piece of cinema.".

	schema:headline " Getting into the child's mind";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Like 99.99 or some such number of the audience I am no child psychologist or any sort of psychologist for that matter but it just occurs to me that we won't fully appreciate Nobody Knows unless we cleanse ourselves of our adult mentality and try to get into the child's mind. We do get some help with the POV shots at low levels as the kids do spend a lot of time on the floor in the apartment which is both their home and their prison. Let me back up a little. A still relatively young mother whose mental capacity is probably not that much more than that of a child had four children with four different men. Renting an apartment together with her oldest 12yearold son the only one of the four that she can reveal to the world at large she smuggles the other three into this new 'home'. Leaving her children with no schooling at all she goes away for weeks to pursue her own life leaving Akira Yagira Yuya to look after his siblings. Her absence soon becomes perpetual as the children can barely survive on the money she sends very occasionally.Such then is the 'story' if it can be called one. But then it is a true story and what we see is close to being a documentary. Director Hirokazu explains clearly with the opening credit however that while the events are true the characters of the children are created for the film. By helping us get into the world of these children Director Hirokazu makes the film less gloomy than the actual events at least during the first half of it.The two little ones are too young to worry about survival or truly comprehend sorrow. Shigeru Kimura Hiei is a little guy with insuppressible spirit and insatiable curiosity. Yuki Shimuzu Momoko is the most adorable little girl there is. In their child's world they quietly accept being barely at the fringe of survival such as having to wash in public fountains when water supply at the apartment has been cut off. What is most heartbreaking is watching Akiru's younger slightly sister Kyoko Kitaura Ayu. While the little kids are 'smuggled' into the apartment in the luggage Kyoko travels by herself in a train to be met by Akiru at night. The first thing she asks her brother is the location of the washing machine because washing is apparently the family duty assigned to her and she is worried that if the washing machine in out on the balcony she will not be able to discharge her responsibility without being spotted by neighbors.

She tries on her mother's nail polish and idling at the small toy piano dreams of the day when she will have her own piano.

Akira is a preadolescent boy growing towards adolescence under the enormous burden of looking after the family in a continuously deteriorating financial situation. He hides a lot within himself as he toughs his way through vicissitudes but the child in him is not totally lost. He lets go at one point allowing himself to be indulged in video games and baseball.

The final trail is a tragic incident for which he must be blaming himself on his temporary absence. Such is the range of emotions that Yuya had to handle and his Cannes award is well deserved.The film starts not without light happy moments particularly as seen through the child's eye in the audience. As the situation gets from bad to worse Director Hirokazu does not drag us through wails and screams as a lesser one would. He doesn't even give that much dialogue. Through the two hours of the film he simply bleeds our hearts with images of these children whom we have come to really care for and goes on to bleed them some more.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers Like 99.99 or some such number of the audience I am no child psychologist or any sort of psychologist for that matter but it just occurs to me that we won't fully appreciate Nobody Knows unless we cleanse ourselves of our adult mentality and try to get into the child's mind. We do get some help with the POV shots at low levels as the kids do spend a lot of time on the floor in the apartment which is both their home and their prison. Let me back up a little. A still relatively young mother whose mental capacity is probably not that much more than that of a child had four children with four different men. Renting an apartment together with her oldest 12yearold son the only one of the four that she can reveal to the world at large she smuggles the other three into this new 'home'. Leaving her children with no schooling at all she goes away for weeks to pursue her own life leaving Akira Yagira Yuya to look after his siblings. Her absence soon becomes perpetual as the children can barely survive on the money she sends very occasionally.Such then is the 'story' if it can be called one. But then it is a true story and what we see is close to being a documentary. Director Hirokazu explains clearly with the opening credit however that while the events are true the characters of the children are created for the film. By helping us get into the world of these children Director Hirokazu makes the film less gloomy than the actual events at least during the first half of it.The two little ones are too young to worry about survival or truly comprehend sorrow. Shigeru Kimura Hiei is a little guy with insuppressible spirit and insatiable curiosity. Yuki Shimuzu Momoko is the most adorable little girl there is. In their child's world they quietly accept being barely at the fringe of survival such as having to wash in public fountains when water supply at the apartment has been cut off. What is most heartbreaking is watching Akiru's younger slightly sister Kyoko Kitaura Ayu. While the little kids are 'smuggled' into the apartment in the luggage Kyoko travels by herself in a train to be met by Akiru at night. The first thing she asks her brother is the location of the washing machine because washing is apparently the family duty assigned to her and she is worried that if the washing machine in out on the balcony she will not be able to discharge her responsibility without being spotted by neighbors. Dutyconscious and extremely goodnatured her dispositions are almost angelic. But she also has all the dreams of a preadolescent girl. She tries on her mother's nail polish and idling at the small toy piano dreams of the day when she will have her own piano. And yet at the very first family that is the four kids' financial trouble she contributes all the money she's been saving for that very purpose.It's 14yearold Yagira Yuya playing 12yearold Akira that won the best actors award at Cannes beating strong contenders in Hong Kong's 2046 and Korea's Old Boy.

	schema:headline " Abandoned Children In A World Run By Adults";
	schema:reviewBody "Hirokazu Koreeda's 'Dare Mo Shiranai' tells the heartbreaking story of four abandoned young siblings who struggle to survive in an apartment. The apartment was restricted to two people where no little children were allowed. It is known that Akira and his mother were the only tenants thus the three other children are living in secret and are not allowed to leave the apartment or make any noise in case the neighbours got suspicious. While Akira is the only one allowed to leave the apartment he is forbidden to go to school. After their selfcentred mother's long term departure due to her 'work' 12yearold Akira the eldest one serves as a parent striving to provide food for his brother and sisters but he too is only a child and how will he in a world run by adults support his siblings? The director tells this unique story in a very heartfelt sensitive way. 'Dare Mo Shiranai' is based on a true event which was far more harrowing but I can see that he might have been inspired by movies like 'Hotaru No Haka' and perhaps William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies'. With the minimal use of music special effects the film has an unpolished look which makes the characters' sense of isolation and despair all the more authentic to the viewer. The whimsical background score is cleverly used and it brings a poetic feel. The child actors are excellent. It is Yya Yagira who confidently carries the film but each one of these kids deliver very natural performances. It's hard to tell whether they were acting. Moreover because the film is sort of shot in documentary format it is easy to forget that one is watching a film. I wonder how the director got the kids to act so restrained. 'Dare Mo Shiranai' is a beautiful film that depicts the importance of a responsible adult figure in children's lives but it also demonstrates that children too are strong even though inexperienced. Yet no matter what the importance of a significant nurturing adult is crucial for a child's development.".

The film based on a real incident in Japan is one of the saddest accounts in memory about children's abuse by uncaring parents.If you haven't seen the movie maybe you would like to stop reading.When we first meet this family Keiko the mother and Akira are seen bringing their things to the tiny apartment they have rented. Little by little we see two young children emerge from two huge suitcases at the risk of suffocating and another one that is waiting at a train station. This mother and the four children seem to be happy being together. Since the lease is for only two persons the other kids must be quiet as they don't want to bring undue attention from the landlord and his wife who also live in the complex.We realize Keiko's love for her children comes second to her life as a woman of loose morals she may be a prostitute although it's left to the viewer's imagination what she does after she leaves the apartment. Akira being the oldest is in charge of the other three. It becomes clear these four children are the product of different fathers. Yet all four function as though they have the same set of parents.Keiko who appears to be just another kid thinks nothing in leaving these four to fend for themselves while she is going out of town with her present beau. Keiko is the epitome of cruelty. How can a mother even dream of abandoning these young kids and expect Akira to assume full responsibility for the situation?Akira is a study of maturity beyond belief. Only in that type of society someone like this boy can exist. Akira is seen in his daily routine going to the store and cook for the siblings and the mother while she's still around. Akira realizes he has a responsibility as he never resorts to stealing even when he becomes friendly with some bad kids from his area. Akira realizes he is the head of the household and must protect those that have been placed under his care something the real mother has neglected to do.The film is a document about children's abuse and cruelty. Mr. Koreeda has been blessed with a cast that do miracles for him. Yuya Yagira does an incredible job as Akira. All the children appear to be non professionals but under the guidance of the director they make us believe they are the abandoned children living alone and eking out a living for themselves.".

	schema:headline " Nasal Whisper";
	schema:reviewBody "No doubt there are others I haven't heard of but for me Dare mo shiranai forms the latest entry in a trilogy of Japanese films based on true incidents involving abusive parents Oshima's 1969 Shonen Boy Nomura's 1978 Kichiku The Demon are the others. Shonen I saw long ago and isn't available. Kichiku I watched barely two weeks ago. Nomura's camera tends to accuse while Oshima's if I recall just watches miming cinema vrit. Koreeda like Oshima tends  I mean this literally not pejoratively  to voyeurism.Knowing the story too well already from difficulttododge early reviews and distributor publicity I couldn't help seeing as ironic the early scenes in which the children's mother Keiko is still a factor. Her voice an almost cute nasal whisper something like that of a child boisterously ignoring a cold compare the whispersinging actress in Swallowtail Butterfly and Picnic or I don't know which Karie Kahimi cut but my favorites are all on Larmes de Crocodile she comes across as a really great mother. The family may be on the outs sneaking two or three gone fetal inside suitcases into a onechild apartment but it's a family of five not four victims and a demon. The unpacking of the children looks clever magical. It's fairytale stuff. So is the chatter the family life those first nights especially in the new apartment. Keiko's one of them and their mother in charge of them all at once. They may complain but they clearly admire something in her and obey her to the letter. They've learned from her a selfreliance that so astounds throughout the film that its slow breakdown is that much more shattering. Not just their compliance but the skill with which they do without her during her increasingly long absences testify to what she's done for and with them. How many children you know could survive this well for this long in these circumstances?Or is what I'm seeing just the actress You's skill with the nonprofessional child actors? I think probably it's both You and Keiko and that Koreeda knew and used this.There's going to be too much written here about this film and on the IMDb message board look for some really knowledgeable comments by YukoK that make my top of the head rambling near worthless by comparison. I try never to repeat or preempt others' contributions but wondered how many would register Keiko's motherskills.Koreeda doesn't shy from deconstructing the closest thing he has here to a protagonist eldest son Akira. After Keiko's whispervoice goes slowly sinister and collapses finally into written notes we watch his will and integrity falter even as he attracts the sympathy of the shop girl and castout Saki. I don't think there's a deliberately sentimental shot in the entire film. The achingly symbolic garden that mimics Akira's decline and the nighttime trek to the burial site may come closest but both are forgivable and may have been unavoidable.

	onyx:emotionText "No doubt there are others I haven't heard of but for me Dare mo shiranai forms the latest entry in a trilogy of Japanese films based on true incidents involving abusive parents Oshima's 1969 Shonen Boy Nomura's 1978 Kichiku The Demon are the others. Shonen I saw long ago and isn't available. Kichiku I watched barely two weeks ago. Nomura's camera tends to accuse while Oshima's if I recall just watches miming cinema vrit. Koreeda like Oshima tends  I mean this literally not pejoratively  to voyeurism.Knowing the story too well already from difficulttododge early reviews and distributor publicity I couldn't help seeing as ironic the early scenes in which the children's mother Keiko is still a factor. Her voice an almost cute nasal whisper something like that of a child boisterously ignoring a cold compare the whispersinging actress in Swallowtail Butterfly and Picnic or I don't know which Karie Kahimi cut but my favorites are all on Larmes de Crocodile she comes across as a really great mother. The family may be on the outs sneaking two or three gone fetal inside suitcases into a onechild apartment but it's a family of five not four victims and a demon. The unpacking of the children looks clever magical. It's fairytale stuff. So is the chatter the family life those first nights especially in the new apartment. Keiko's one of them and their mother in charge of them all at once. They may complain but they clearly admire something in her and obey her to the letter. They've learned from her a selfreliance that so astounds throughout the film that its slow breakdown is that much more shattering. Not just their compliance but the skill with which they do without her during her increasingly long absences testify to what she's done for and with them. How many children you know could survive this well for this long in these circumstances?Or is what I'm seeing just the actress You's skill with the nonprofessional child actors? I think probably it's both You and Keiko and that Koreeda knew and used this.There's going to be too much written here about this film and on the IMDb message board look for some really knowledgeable comments by YukoK that make my top of the head rambling near worthless by comparison.

	schema:reviewBody "'Dare mo shiranai' NOBODY KNOWS is a gleaming little film by writerdirector Hirokazu Koreeda that offers a version of a true story so simply and eloquently that by the end of the film the audience is powerfully moved  without gimmicks without imitation emotional devices without major stars. It just simply works. Though the film is long at 2 12 hours the journey is well worth it and indeed the prolonged length seems necessary to convey the plight of these touching children's plight.The film opens during the titles on public transportation where a youthful mother Keiko the pop star You and her young son Akira Yya Yagira sit guarding an ugly pink suitcase and other bags. Keira and Keiko have rented a poor little apartment promising the landlord that Keiko will make no noise. Once inside their new home the ugly bags are open and two additional children emerge and a trip to the bus station adds yet a third child! Thus 'unknown' to the landlord the apartment contains a family of five! Soon Keiko leaves on a trip to 'make money' leaving some cash with Akira who is placed in charge of his brother and sisters. Of course Keiko doesn't return except for one brief visit months later and leaving the children to fend for themselves.Akira manages to make friends outside gaining food and money for good deeds and good will keeping his little 'family' afloat. Gradually Akira realizes that Keiko will never return and through his friendship with a young girl still manages to eek out an existence the manner in which he keeps his family happy is food for the soul! But despite his constant good intentions to maintain a life for his family one of his sisters dies and he and his girl friend bury her where she can 'watch the airplanes'. And life goes on. There is no ending depicted just continuum.With the subtlest technique Koreeda creates a story so real that it pulsates. The child actors especially Yya Yagira are so natural and fine that they grab our hearts tenaciously. The only music in this film is a few notes form a toy piano and quiet harp music that enhances the feeling of isolation of the children. This is a film of rare beauty one that could have been edited a bit but even that criticism is overshadowed by the impact of Hirokazu Koreeda's overall achievement. Very Highly Recommended.

During the length of the movie the children speak more through looks than through words.Words often fail a childand Koreda shows us the fruitless attempts of Akira and Kyoko trying to express their frustration or getting through to their mother with wordsas she circumvents their precarious protests with the unfairness of fluent verbal diplomacybut not once looking at them and allowing the guilt to reach her.The childrenafter allare not unaware of a sense of abandonment by their motherand in the case of Akira and Kyoko the feeling becomes more confounding as they try to come to terms with it.Kyoko's whisper 'she smells of alcohol' as she passes by her brother as if seeking reassurancebut mostly her wistful expressiontells of her broken desire to believe in her mother's love.Her timid smile as her mother takes on the adventure of painting her daughter's nails though only managing to slop the nailpolish untidily over her nails and onto parts of her fingertips in her current state of inebriation is a heartbreaking moment that speaks of Kyoko's longing to believe that her mother does care.That confused smile brought me back to Francie in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as she tried to make sense of her father's drunkenness and broken promises...if a man spent all his time trying to be like thatthen no matter what else he did...it would be all right wouldn't it?.Later on Kyoko drops the nailpolish bottle in a realization that that moment meant nothing more than just another of her mother's whims.So mostly Koreeda allows his camera to simply focus on the natural expression of the children through looks and gesturesrather than try to pry from their lips emotions which they don't know how to translate into words.Even Akira's friendship with an older schoolgirlSakiwho is relatively welloff but equally isolated from societywas founded on a simple and silent mutual acceptance of each other's existence rather than by meaningful dialogue.Saki becomes a part of their lives and they a part of hersand her unhesitant and straightforward act of earning some money for them by going to a 'karaoke' with a man is a testimony of the deep value of friendship. There are many beautifully poignant scenes in this moviewitnessed silently by Koreeda's unimposing camerapicking up little details of the children's innocent expression of life.As a friend of mine says real life situations often don't lend themselves to pat solutionsand this movie doesn't intend to devise one.The last scene of four children walking away from the camerato goodness knows what futureis charged with a mixed feeling of forlorn uncertainty and sorrowbut also with loveacceptance and optimismall that's left when there are no pat solutions and the will to make a garden out of the discards of their torn lives.After alldid the children ever have a different spirit?".

	schema:reviewBody "Dare mo shiranai 2004 Nobody Knows is an extraordinary film written produced and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda.The basic plot outline is relatively straightforwardfour children are left alone for months in an apartment by their mother.However the actual film is far more complex. The three younger children aren't allowed out of the apartment. The landlord will rent only to the mother and her older son who is twelve. The other children have to be smuggled into the apartment and are forced to remain inside so no one will know they're there. To add to their problems the children are also chronically short of money.The burden of survival is placed on the shoulders of Akira a preadolescent young man of extraordinary good will and intelligence. He has to do all the things a parent would do maintain the apartment purchase and prepare food pay the bills etc. Naturally a normal life is impossible for any of the children but by sheer determination they muddle through somehow as the months pass and their mother doesn't return.No one is overtly cruel to the children and some people actively help them. However as the title implies nobody knows the true situation the children face and in fact nobody tries very hard to find out.Yya Yagira as the older brother Akira is exceptional. All the children are superb actors. The mother played by an actor named You is outstanding as a woman who is still young and attractive and in many ways is less mature than her son. She wishes the children no harmshe just doesn't understand why she can't live as a free and happy single woman. Caring for four young children just doesn't fit her life style.There's an interesting contrast between the mother in this film and the mother in a French film Viper in the Fist I recently reviewed. The mother in Viper in the Fist is a horrible parent because she tries to control and mold every aspect of her children's lives. In Nobody Knows the mother is equally horrible but for just the opposite reasonshe controls and molds nothing. In a U.S. movie the children would meet all the challenges and cope collectively with each new problem. In life things don't always work out in this neat and uplifting fashion. The story is heartwarming in its way but remember that the film wasn't made by the Disney studios.".

He wants to go to school have friends play baseball and even develop crushes on girls. All these aspects of growing up are represented and all of them are shown in Akira's world as unfulfilled desires. He develops some friends who quickly abandon him since his child dominated household is messy and stinky as they put it he gets to realize his love for baseball only when a playground team needs an extra. In each instance Akira must return home to take care of his brothers and sisters who are slowly venturing away from the rules themselves.As Akira runs out of money the electricity and other utilities get shut off. Somewhat inexplicably only once is the rent asked for by a landlord seemingly clueless that a cluttered apartment filled with unsupervised kids is not unusual.By showing Akiras strength the film illustrates how heroic even a child as young as 12 can be. It also shows how tragic a situation can end up when children are abandoned and left to take care of themselves.Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Frame of reference";
	schema:reviewBody "Hirokazu Koreeda has always had a distinctive style of filmmaking. More than others he loves the static shot where action often takes place outside the frame movement in and out of the frame of reference is common while the camera does not move. That's why his movies are sometimes perceived as slow and unevolving.The same with storytelling a significant part of the story takes place outside the story on screen. And even in a scene the whole scene is never completely obvious We often have to fill in the details. The effect requires much attention from the viewer but can also be very interesting or downright shocking.All his movies also seem to restrict the space where the movie plays out. Repetitive shots in Dare mo shiranai  Nobody Knows of the shopping street the stairs the home etc. seem to strengthen this notion in order to tell how restricted the world is for the children portrayed. This is further enhanced by the element of time Time becomes less important throughout the movie as the mother's visits become less and less predictable the use of the seasons contradicts this in a way.In communication between actors much emphasis is laid on nonverbal communication which is superbly done here. In Distance this went even so far that the story was almost completely told in this way.Conclusion Dare mo shiranai Nobody Knows is a rewarding movie but for patient viewers only.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hirokazu Koreeda has always had a distinctive style of filmmaking. More than others he loves the static shot where action often takes place outside the frame movement in and out of the frame of reference is common while the camera does not move. That's why his movies are sometimes perceived as slow and unevolving.The same with storytelling a significant part of the story takes place outside the story on screen. And even in a scene the whole scene is never completely obvious We often have to fill in the details. The effect requires much attention from the viewer but can also be very interesting or downright shocking.All his movies also seem to restrict the space where the movie plays out.

Just the other night the image of the landlady with the cat in her arms standing in the doorway of the chaotic apartment the kids were living in and then just walking away came into my mind. Thinking of a pet store I visited in Japan that had gourmet treats and designer clothes and a special salon for their haircuts. Are pets treated better than children? I wonder if Koreeda was also making a critique of the young women who have been raised to be kawaiicute and childlike and used to having their parents do and buy things for them. The result like the mother in this film is a mother who is unable to mature into a grown woman and who feels incomplete without a man. She also put her own needs over her children's which is extremely repugnant to most people but imagine in Japanese society where the concept of gaman has been so admired how loathed and despised this mother would have been. Interesting to read the actual events as well. I wonder if the film had presented the mother as having been lied to and abandoned with a small baby by her first partner would that have changed the audience perception of her culpability? I felt she was a victim as welleven wout knowing any details I just felt no one who had a happy upbringing would abandon their children like that.I also felt the kids were too good to be true at the beginning not imagining that kids would be able to live so tidily and manage all the adult affairs with no one to guide them. However perhaps that was an effective way to show the decline as time went on.Now I am still left with the lingering feeling...what happened to them? Part of the problem was that the solution meant they would be separated from each other. What happens to these kids in Japan? Where family and koseki is so important how do they get along in society? Anyway an excellent filmthe child actors were amazing.".

	schema:headline " A film of deep compassion";
	schema:reviewBody "Hirokazu Kore'eda's Nobody Knows is a film of deep compassion about four young children abandoned by their mother in a small apartment in Tokyo. Based on a real incident in 1988 the film was written directed produced and edited by Kore'eda whose earlier films Maborosi and After Life were introspective meditations on life and death. Though his latest film is primarily a comingofage film about the transformation of a preadolescent boy no film I've seen in recent memory has filled me with as much sadness for the failure of modern society to provide a coherent set of values for people. While there have been other films about the alienation of big city life particularly by Tsai Mingling The River What Time Is it There? they tend to be cold and impersonal and convey an emotional deadness. Such is not the case here where the children's natural vivacity and warmth make their closeness to each other more real and ultimately all the more heartbreaking.The center of the film is 12year old Akira who must care for his brothers and sisters when his mother leaves the home. Akira is remarkably portrayed by Yuya Yagira who was named Best Actor for his performance at Cannes in 2004. His strong and compassionate eyes reveal a depth of understanding rare in an actor that young. Supporting him is his sister tenyear old Kyoko Kitaura Ayu sevenyear old Shigeru Kimura Hiei and fouryear old Yuki Shimizu Momoko all from different fathers. The children's birth was never registered and they do not attend school. They are the ultimate city dwellers anonymous and alone.As the film opens the mother Keiko Japanese television performer You moves into a new apartment with Akira. Fearing eviction because of too much noise the other children are packed in suitcases so the landlord does not find out they are living in the apartment. Since they are all from different fathers and do not attend school the world does not even know that they exist. Keiko tells the children that they must adhere to strict rules no loud talking and no going outside the apartment even to the balcony. As the children settle in one day Akira finds a note from his mother together with some money telling him that she is going away for a while and asks him to look after the family.Using all natural lighting the film explores the details of the children's ups and downs living by themselves inside a cramped apartment for months. Much of the dialogue is improvised and we are not even aware of the children acting just living moment by moment. Akira has to buy the groceries handle the finances and do all the things that an adult should be doing. He is the only adult in that family says Kore'eda. The mother is much more immature than he is. But he's the adult only because that role has been forced onto him. The only time he is shown being a child is when he plays video games or baseball and has some adventures with some other boys in the neighborhood but it is fleeting.At first playful then gradually becoming passive and withdrawn we watch in dismay as the conditions of their lives gradually deteriorate. The lights and water are turned off because of failure to pay the bills and the children have to wash in public fountains and light their rooms by candle. Though normally this would be very depressing the children convey such feelings of joy especially when they are finally let out to run around the park that our feelings of hopelessness are temporarily uplifted. Kore'eda said children are incredibly resilient to just label these children's six months alone together as pathetic or tragic you wouldn't get any closer to understanding either the children or what they experienced. Yet there is sadness and the more difficult life becomes the more we hope that the children will be rescued though we know that Akira has said that he would not report the situation to any authority for fear of breaking up the family. Nobody Knows has a running time of two hours and twentyone minutes and requires patience yet it's total effect is stunning. In the final sequence the city of Tokyo is shown in silence as if to underscore the emotional disconnection of the modern city where people live in close proximity but nobody knows and nobody cares.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few directors can create settings as developed or as ponderous as Hirokazu Koreeda's and his touch seems perfectly suited for NOBODY KNOWS a film that shows the world through the perspective of 5 kids left to fend for themselves when there is no one else to turn to. Koreeda's work seems to catch everything vital to the story and gets each detail just right. Based on a true story and acted by mostly nonprofessionals the picture has an uncommonly natural perspective of a situation that seems terrifying but is absolutely unquestionably true.It is deeply unnerving to see the ways in which the parents of the 4 central characters rationalize the neglect that has shaped their lives and it is downright horrific to see the ways in which the mother manipulates the children. A child herself the mother knows how to see life from a child's perspective. This allows her to control the children by giving presents and rewards most kids fantasize about while completely denying them everything a responsible parent would give their children. One such instance is how the oldest girl is encouraged to save up to buy a piano while she is denied the luxury of going to school. The kids are made to feel like they must always tiptoe through life they are everybody's burden and should feel fortunate that anyone is looking out for them at all.The film is a heartbreaking tale of child neglect but it is elevated to also be a story about finding your own way despite the odds. Giving the film a bit of depth there are undertones that hint at the story being a social commentary on the price of living in Japan though that theme is comfortably left far beneath the surface. I do not think I have ever seen a film that captured the wondrous viewpoint of the world through a child's eyes as well as this does and that the story kept digging deeper and further past the premise kept surprising me. If you think you know where this one's going you probably don't.The performances are uniformly excellent including the awardwinning work of Yya Yagira as the eldest boy. Undeniably affecting his performance anchors the film and shapes the story's effortless natural heart.  out of  By the way this is smartly being marketed as a horror film but I assure you it is more a domestic drama that just happens to wind up in a very dark place i.e. if you walk in expecting RINGU you'll be disappointed.This also struck me as being a much more approachable film than either Koreeda film I've seen before MABOROSI and AFTER LIFE so even if you have seen his past works and thought they were not your cup of tea I would definitely still recommend this one.".

This was an example of an uncommon but not unprecedented phenomenon known as 'idioglossia' or 'cryptophasia'. 'Nell' tells the story of an even more extreme example of the same phenomenon. An eccentric and reclusive old woman named Violet Kellty is found dead in her home a wooden cabin without electricity or running water in a remote mountain are of North Carolina. The local doctor Jerry Lovell visits the property to certify the death and discovers that unknown to the community Violet had a daughter Nell living with her. Nell is unable to speak English and can only speak an unknown language. Although in her late twenties she has never been outside her home and the forests which surround it and knows nothing of the outside world. A psychiatrist Paula Olsen sent to investigate the case decides that Nell is mentally retarded but Lovell who is becoming increasingly fascinated by this strange young woman contests this diagnosis. The judge responsible for deciding Nell's future decides that she should be kept under observation for three months so that more information can be obtained. Jerry and Paula move into the woods to observe and gradually start to find out more about Nell's past. They learn that she had a twin sister May who died as a child and that her seeminglystrange speech is actually a mixture of distorted English learnt from her mother who had a speech defect as the result of a series of strokes and words remembered from a private language spoken with her twin. The question they have to resolve is whether Nell should be committed to a mental institution or allowed to continue her life in the woods. In order to do so they find that they need to learn how to communicate with her. The most outstanding feature of the film is Jodie Foster's performance in the title role a remarkable one even by the standards of this talented actress. Throughout the film Foster speaks only in Nell's unearthlysounding private language but is able to use this together with gestures and facial expressions to convey a full range of emotions. The nearest parallel is probably Marlee Matlin's equally remarkable performance in 'Children of a Lesser God' another film about difficulties in communication. What emerges most powerfully here is the traumatic nature of Nell's position hitherto happy in her limited world she is suddenly confronted with a range of people and situations she never knew existed. Foster certainly deserved her Oscar nomination whether she deserved to win I cannot say as I have never seen 'Blue Sky' the film for which Jessica Lange won the award. At the heart of the film is a triangular relationship between Nell Jerry and Paula. Paula initially leans towards the view that Nell belongs in an institution and clashes with Jerry who takes the opposite view but as the film progresses she comes to share his opinion and his concern for Nell. The two first become friends and then fall in love brought together by Nell who forms the third side of the triangle. One can say that there are also loverelationships between Nell and Jerry and Nell and Paula but because these relationships are platonic rather than sexual in nature they serve to bring Jerry and Paula together rather than divide them. This means that Jerry and Paula play key roles in the film fortunately Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson both play their parts very well although in a more understated manner than Foster. Many of the criticisms which have been made of the film are I believe due to misconceptions. The film critic of The Guardian for example criticised it for being overly politically correct in its treatment of the 'mentally challenged'. Apart from the fact that that is an odd criticism to find in a newspaper which is one of the strongest bastions of political correctness in Britain it is made quite clear in the film that Nell is neither mentally ill nor mentally handicapped. She merely speaks a different language both literally and metaphorically from the rest of the world. Some have taken exception to the brief scenes of nudity but the purpose of these is not eroticism but rather to demonstrate Nell's innocence.Another criticism which I have seen made of this film both on this board and elsewhere is that it is pushing a trite or simplistic 'message' normally along the lines of 'nature is better than civilization' or 'ignorance is bliss'. In my opinion this criticism is misconceived 'Nell' is not a didactic film of that sort. Certainly Nell herself has many admirable characteristics gentleness the ability to love and to be loved a capacity for joy and a love of nature but nowhere in the film is there any argument that one has to be ignorant or a feral child of nature in order to share these characteristics. If there are villains in the film they are not abstractions such as 'civilisation' or 'modern society' but rather those individuals who want to exploit Nell for their own ends the journalist hungry for a scoop the rowdy town youths who want to use her either for mockery or for sexual pleasure and the academic Alexander Paley. Paley is keen to have Nell committed he tries to justify this as objective concern for her welfare but his motives are really selfseeking. He sees Nell as a firstclass subject for research which will bring him kudos in the world of academia. What gives the film its power is not any obvious 'message' but its deeply poetic and spiritual tone deriving both from the acting of the three central characters and the exquisite photography of the North Carolina landscapes. It is a film from which different viewers will draw different conclusions some may see it for example as a religious allegory about the redeeming power of love while others may view it in a more literal way. It may be too quiet and poetic for some tastes but in my view this is an unjustly neglected work one of the finest and most powerful films of the nineties. 1010".

	schema:headline " Clearly Foster put more effort into this movie than the writers.";
	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen or read the play 'Idioglossia' on which this movie was based but its title indicates where the emphasis was probably placed... on the attempt to communicate and understand this woman who was raised under extraordinary conditions.  Movies don't usually thrive when done in the same tight focused manner of a stage play so it's customary to expand adaptations with additional locations events and subplots.  Unfortunately for 'Nell' these are utterly conventional filled with stereotypes and a sampling of the usual cliches.  This takes time and attention away from the fascinating core story and the superb performance by Jodie Foster.The story begins with the discovery that a reclusive old woman has died and has left a grown daughter alone in their remote cabin.  Originally she is thought to be a wild child since she doesn't understand English and only utters what sounds like gibberish.  Besides that her behaviour is very peculiar and everyone's first impression is that she is also somewhat retarded if not mentally ill.But the movie and Foster display an understanding of their subject matter almost unique in a Hollywood movie.  A true wild child that is a child who grows up isolated from human contact without learning a language pretty much never can learn to speak normally or function independently in society. But this isn't the case for Nell.  She lived with her loving mother all her life and did indeed learn to speak as any child would.  It's just that the language we hear her speak is unique to herself the definition of 'idioglossia' which was caused by a couple of different circumstances.Her mother had suffered a stroke if I recall correctly which drastically affected her own ability to speak clearly and this was the model for Nell's own speech never having heard any other.  Nell also had a twin sister who died when they were children.  Typically twins develop their own language twin speech to talk to each other when they are very young.  Also typically they tend to outgrow and forget this language as they grow older. The movie postulates that Nell and her sister never discarded their language not implausible considering their circumstances and that Nell retained into adulthood much of that language even after the death of her sister.The final elements of Nell's seemingly odd behaviour is simply a matter of a clash of cultures.  Nell and her family were essentially a people unto themselves living in isolation and out of contact with the rest of society. Some of their customs and beliefs were generated from the traumas suffered by the mother others spontaneously arose from simply living the life they were leading.  These seem peculiar to outsiders from our own very different culture though it's just ordinary life to Nell.  Even more peculiar is the outside world to Nell.  The shock and recoil that she often undergoes comes from being suddenly confronted by inexplicable unimagined and overwhelming events totally beyond a lifetime's experience and coming directly on the heels of the death of her mother.When the movie centers on these elements it is entirely engrossing.  Foster is fully convincing in her role and clearly understands the complex nature and history of Nell.  Despite everyone's first impressions Nell is never anything but an intelligent adult woman confronting a strange and often hostile world and attempting to adapt to it as best she can.  Her interactions with Neeson's and Richardson's characters are often complex and traumatic enough to keep the film moving in the absence of the other extraneous elements.Had the movie concentrated more intently on this interaction and devoted more time to it which is really the whole point of the film or had it done a better and more original job of expanding it's vision during it's adaptation to film those parts involving the sheriff's wife showed unexploited potential 'Nell' could have been a great film.  Certainly the superb cinematography shows one of the great advantages of film over the stage.  But there was too much time spent on weak scenes for the movie to ever fully blossom. So overall despite its flaws 'Nell' is a good film with many fascinating elements and an excellent performance by Jodie Foster.  And that makes it well worth watching.".

	schema:headline " There's a definition to great art.";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't think of another movie better than this one that I have seen anyway so I nominate it for a ten. The thing about great art is it engages the consciousness of the perceiver creatively with the same amount of energy the perceiver invests. That might sound like a lot of pseudobabble so let me try again. What you see is what you get with great artand this relationship happens unpretentiously. In an ideal creation there is nothing presumptuous about the art. No doubt there are moments of stereotypes but these could be just as easily blamed on bad acting from the supporting cast or simple lapses in composition. I don't think anyone could seriously say stereotypes are a fundamental weakness of this flick mainly because the use of stereotypes is serving a larger purpose to the storyat least as I see it. This is probably one of the most complex multilayered movies I have ever seen. We witness all the archetypes of good storytelling utilized in evermeshing ways. How sexual violence is a fetish and how an innocent mind sees it as simple playing. And in every scene we are given the meaning of Foster's character and what she represents grows. The ending under these terms is truly remarkable and frankly a surprise if witnessed representationally. I mean these are heavy comments on reality folks. I didn't see the play the screenplay was based on but over and over again I kept thinking Who the hell wrote this thing? Who directed this? It is masterful and if you can't see it that way I don't know go read some books on critical theory on the development of human consciousness on Aristotle's's poetics etc. It is counterpoint perfectionextremely well crafted and a powerful commentary on not only our culture and civilization but what it means to be human in this contemporary moment. Oh yeah Jodi Foster is outstanding. We could make a case that she and her character are the center of this movie except that it is the world unfolding around her that makes this such great drama. I think I have to go back to her Disneyera movies to think of a truly awful movie she has made. But that shouldn't count either. I never thought those movies were all that bad but then I simply watched them as a kid.".

It is powerful poetic and astonishingly beautiful with a beautiful message and an overwhelming use of angelic material that makes my heart ache from how wonderful the attributes that this film tries to get across to it's audience are. The story is a bit familiar yet they add so much pizazz that it makes it seem fresh and brand new.It really does handle all the subject matter so well and it is exquisitely executed. The directing and writing were amazing and I thought the performances in particular were absolutely brilliant. Jodie Foster gave such character life and believability to Nell that I don't think anyone else could have gave any better she is truly spectacular and deserved that Oscar nomination maybe even the win. The characters are well done and really likable for the performances and screenplay behind them so you actually care for them which is what more movies need to try and do make you care for the characters.Like I said Nell is dramatic to the point where it's painful in a good way sort of to watch this woman's innocent undisturbed life play out and unfold and you wish for anything that you can just make everyone see her point of view and you really hope everything pulls through for this brilliant character in the end. Nell definitely makes us wonder who are the real monsters of this world. The cinematography is excellent also and I found myself completely caught up in how aweinspiring everything in the movie is at times whether it's the cinematography characters or story which the story is absolutely gripping and fascinating if you have not caught that by now.Nell seems to be a really overlooked film because most people do not see it for it's full potential of delight and cleverness. It has a few fans but I never hear any talk of how wonderful it is from anyone. I thought it was excellent and an astonishing watch no adventure that I would love to live out again sometime soon.".

How she didn't get an Oscar for her performance says more about the Oscars than about the enormous range and empathy of this superb actress.She was assisted by a wonderful complementary and vulnerable performance from Liam Neesom and the sensitive exploration of a very difficult subject by Michael Apted. I found myself crying without immediately understanding why. I then realised that the film had plumbed the depths of my humanity to levels I did not realise existed. It confronted the question of what it is to be a fully individual human being going beyond our place in a so called civilised society to our almost instinctive spiritual responses to the natural world and to relationship. This is a truly deep and rewarding film which deserves a wide audience. My only criticism is that the transition to Nell's independence was hurried towards the end in the interests of dramatic denouement.".

Although my hunger for a more comprehensive story was not to be satisfied I was more than compensated for this imagined shortcoming when I finally realized what the movie was really about. To me the essence of the story of 'Nell' is Nell's ability to look deeply into a person's eyes to communicate from her soul to yours letting you know absolutely that she cares about you. Although this ability of Nell's constitutes only a small part of the story I believe it is responsible for the miraculous recovery of the Sheriff's wife from the depths of her long time depression.

I sat through the whole precious fey numbingly predictable piece of claptrap dumbfounded that this normally intelligent and thoughtful actress could have experienced such an extended bout of temporary insanity as was needed to give this particular performance.  Everyone's entitled to mistakes I guess.  The jawdropping thing is that some people actually like this movie and not just as camp!  By the way it also features Liam Neeson at his most constipated and Natasha Richardson's along for the ride too though its hard to notice either of them while Jodie's so busy making funny faces and gurgling.";

And Jodie Foster was definitely miscast here. She inspires determination selfconfidence and ...feminism so how the h could she be right for the part of a feral child? Sure her acting is great but why cast her in such a role? It's like casting Julia Roberts as a brain surgeon or Jessica Lange as Margaret Thatcher.

Apparantely Jodie Foster did her homework playing a feral child quite well despite her miscast but the writer and director were so keen to deliver a final touching scene that they forgot all about realism there. The outcome of the movie is also fairytale material. And the movie is somehow very unbalanced in its elements story actingdirectiondialog.

The thing that bothers me the most is that the average hillbilly in the mountains of North Carolina are much worse off than she is and yet she is the one with new clean clothes and perfect teeth while they are the ones with none. You want to make a movie about hillbillies in NC then just go into the woods and film an average family in those hills you don't need to drag Jodie Foster in with 25 makeup artists to hide blemishes. We have her in a cabin near a road that some local bikers have found. Are they the first people who ever stumbled on that cabin?

	schema:reviewBody "Well it may not be everyone's cup of tea and it certainly has it's flaws  but for me at least Fortress is one of the most fun Bmovies released in the nineties and that's no surprise considering it's helmed by the great Stuart Gordon! One of the main reasons why Fortress works so well is because it puts its focus in one place and every imaginative element of the film goes towards furthering the central plot. The title refers to the impregnable privately owned prison of the title. We are introduced to this penitentiary and its various pitfalls right from the start and while it's not hard to see where the film is going to go it does at least make you wonder how it's going to get there. The central characters are John and Karen Brennick  a couple sent to the Fortress after she becomes pregnant with a second child thus breaking a futuristic population control law. However John isn't happy to just rot away in jail and despite the numerous pitfalls that makes the Fortress escape proof  along with his fellow prisoners he plots to escape with his wife.The basis of Fortress is your classic prison escape movie the only difference being the prison at the centre of the tale. The Fortress itself is certainly made good use of as the inventive methods in place to stop the prisoners escaping are constantly kept at the forefront of the audience's mind. The film really is never boring for a minute if there isn't something directly going on in the movie then Gordon is using the time to build up the situation that the prisoners find themselves in. The film features a good Bmovie cast with 'Highlander' Christopher Lambert taking the lead role. Lambert is hardly a great actor but he at least looks the part and his athleticism serves him well. Loryn Locklin isn't given much to do as the leading lady but the rest of the support cast includes the likes of Lincoln Kilpatrick Vernon Wells who coincidently was also in the 1986 Australian movie of the same title! and Jeffrey Combs who is just great as always. Kurtwood Smith is probably the biggest standout however as the maniacal head of the Fortress. This film really features everything you could ever want from a Bmovie  constant action imagination and some hilarious performances. It all boils down to a suitably over the top climax and while this might not be the best film ever made  its one hell of a lot of fun and I certainly recommend it!".

The Fortress itself is certainly made good use of as the inventive methods in place to stop the prisoners escaping are constantly kept at the forefront of the audience's mind. The film really is never boring for a minute if there isn't something directly going on in the movie then Gordon is using the time to build up the situation that the prisoners find themselves in. The film features a good Bmovie cast with 'Highlander' Christopher Lambert taking the lead role. Lambert is hardly a great actor but he at least looks the part and his athleticism serves him well. Loryn Locklin isn't given much to do as the leading lady but the rest of the support cast includes the likes of Lincoln Kilpatrick Vernon Wells who coincidently was also in the 1986 Australian movie of the same title! and Jeffrey Combs who is just great as always. Kurtwood Smith is probably the biggest standout however as the maniacal head of the Fortress. This film really features everything you could ever want from a Bmovie  constant action imagination and some hilarious performances. It all boils down to a suitably over the top climax and while this might not be the best film ever made  its one hell of a lot of fun and I certainly recommend it!";

	schema:headline " Interesting scifi from Stuart Gordon";
	schema:reviewBody "Stuart Gordon began his career as a director with ReAnimator a classic horror comedy that has a huge cult status and deservedly so. Fortress was his first entry to nonhorror oriented field even though Fortress still has many horror elements too. Christopher Lambert plays a military officer in the near future where it is allowed to have only one child per couple. He and his wife broke that order and they are sentenced to high security modern prison Fortress set in the middle of desert. There are many inmates there and everyone wants to get out but if someone breaks the rules the punishment will be death or torture by the sadistic boss and wardens..This was surprisingly great film and Gordon did fine job with the film. It was filmed entirely in Australia and the film was first big budget movie for Gordon. He said that he wanted to do a scifi action film with brains too and that he wanted to discuss some topical issues with his film. These issues are over population and alarmingscary development of technology and even though the film is not too deep or philosophical it has these aspects of commentary about society and our everyday world and what it should not be. This is not as satiric or intelligent as Paul Verhoeven's Robocop for instance but still it is little more than just average blast 'em action film set in the future. The settings are very great and technically this film is fantastic as there are no flaws in camera use and editing. This reminded me little bit of Robocop's future cities and both films are marvelously staged. The action is plenty and it is exciting and professionally done and shot. Occasionally the film reminded me also of Paul Anderson's Soldier the nonstop action mayhem film starring Kurt Russell. Christopher Lambert is not as multi leveled actor as possible but still he has certain kind of charisma and he is easy to watch in his films. Kurtwood Smith played the bad guy in Robocop and he plays bad guy in Fortress too but not as NEAR as bad as in Robocop's manic performance.Due to the film's violence and fierce moments this is pretty close to Paul Verhoeven's style of making action films as couple of scenes are very violent and almost too violent for this kind of mainstream production and as far as I know this had to be trimmed by two violent scenes to get the R rating in US and this slightly cut version has been released also on DVD in US and Europe. I saw the uncut version on VHS and there are couple of overthetop bloody shootings and two gory stomach explosions of which the second is VERY gory. It is easy to see the film is directed by the man behind the hilariously ultra gory ReAnimator. The violence in Fortress isn't funny in the tradition of ReAnimator It is serious because the film itself is serious not the kind of half comedy like ReAnimator.The film is perhaps little too slow moving in the middle part but for most of the time this works fine and pleased me very much and proves the talent of Gordon in other genres than horror too. I give this 710 rating and recommend this to anyone interested in scifi and action cinema. It's not a masterpiece but still very noteworthy piece of 90's science fiction and action cinema.".

	schema:headline " Futuristic prison film is a highlight of the cheesy Bmovie genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a version of those classic prison movies  PAPILLON THE GREAT ESCAPE THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION  updated violently into a futuristic setting and what you'll have is FORTRESS a gungho ride full to the brim of action. And it's a blast. The feel of the film is very similar to that of TOTAL RECALL and the pair are almost companion pieces. While relatively low budget the film has something rarely seen these days  imagination! What makes the film so enjoyable to horror aficionados is firstly the talent involved and secondly the level of extreme violence which certainly spices up the action. Since when did you see one of the prisoners in THE GREAT ESCAPE have his stomach blown out? Christopher Lambert will never win any awards for acting but he is a solid enough presence as the film's hero and his wooden acting is on par with other luminaries like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Doug McClure how we love them all. And really he is given little to do except fight one thing after another which of course he does with relish.Locklin brings warmth and compassion to the film as his wife and shows probably the best acting in the entire film but since when did we watch these kinds of films for acting anyway? Kurtwood Smith steals the overacting awards as the oily prison head strangely his toupee makes him look years younger. Although this isn't the nastiest best performance of his career that honour goes to ROBOCOP he makes for a compassionate villain a man with a longing for love.A motley bunch make up Lambert's cellmates which include a wise old black guy Tom Towles the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake bringing cult value as a brutal thug type while horror star Jeffrey Combs is virtually unrecognisable underneath thick glasses and long hair. Still it's not really the acting talent that makes this film so enjoyable or the plot which is as I said is merely an updated version of the old escape films. The set design is excellent and the various mechanical hazards including the roving cameras and laser beams the psychedelic dream sequences and also the androids while tacky are all great fun. Weirdness prevails when an android's helmet is removed revealing the rubbery halfhuman face underneath! The main gore highlights are the intestinators kind of like an updated ALIEN chestburster for the 1990s and they are literally showstoppers. We haven't seen this kind of gut busting since the cheapo days of CONTAMINATION! Added to this are a man who has his chest literally blown out an extraordinarily bloody fight scene probably the bloodiest I've ever witnessed on screen as people's heads are smashed into walls bars etc. and spray and pour blood like a lowrent Bruce Willis from the DIE HARD series a man ripping out his own eyes and lots of shooting and chests erupting with bullet holes.The bookend to the film a pyrotechnic stunt involving an exploding truck is also done very well. FORTRESS certainly was never likely to win any Oscars but the nonstop action cheesy dialogue and inventive situations all presided over by steadfast direction from Stuart Gordon REANIMATOR make this one hell of a bloody rollercoaster ride. The prison movie to end all prison movies in the cheesy Bmovie fan's mind.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly good for a cheap 90's action film";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll get this out of the way first the budget of this film isn't fantastic. Nearly all of the action takes place in the titular Fortress which consists of a handful of sets used two or three times over. There is also a truly awful make up job  a 'tattoo' that more resembles an enthusiastic black marker.That aside...Despite said bad make up Fortress features some extremely good practical effects. While avoiding spoilers some very messy deaths are involved with characters being literally blown apart. These look frankly fantastic especially as I'm sure you've heard from every other critic ever compared to CGI deaths in PG13 films today. There's something visceral and authentic about them...the idea that what you're seeing is really happening.And despite being restricted to one location Fortress certainly makes the most of what it has. The Fortress is very well designed packed with containment systems that the protagonist turns against it. Granted there is some silliness involved  apparently there is only one nonlethal way to subdue prisoners and after that it's straight on to 'blowtobits'. But and this is important all of it is for a reason. You don't get the sense that something is there just to facilitate someone using it to escape and indeed the design appears to be based on a reallife idea from Britain  the Panopticon emphasising prisoners' fear of being watched more than actual effort spent watching them.Characters then. Honestly Christopher Lambert's acting is the worst part of the film. In fact I get the impression that a certain sequence was made just for him since all he needs to do is zone out for a few hours. It's as if his batteries ran out one day but the crew had to keep filming so they quickly wrote in an instory excuse. His character isn't that interesting either  exarmy highly decorated a typical 90s interchangeable backstory with little impact on the plot. However this is more than made up for by the antagonist Prison Director Poe.Unlike normal villains of the genre Poe isn't a cartoon character given form  indeed Kurtwood Smith is rather subdued even by normal villain standards contrasting with his earlier role as Clarence Boddicker. And also unlike Boddicker Poe's actually a fairly interesting character  though an aloof even sadistic Warden we do see what little personal life he has and are continually reminded in his scenes that he's still a person  he has tastes even loves and by the end of the film it's not even clear whether he's the real bad guy. The rest of the supporting cast do an okay job  I can't think of a stand out performance though everyone does their jobs well. Honourable mention goes to the writers and the director for giving a female character many good action scenes and half of a subplot even when it would have been incredibly easy to neglect her as postvictory booty.The setting I should mention has a very nice atmosphere. Too many films forget that these days instead going for a more realistic bland appearance  comparing the first and second of Nolan's Batman trilogy shows it blatantly. Fortress has a dark smoky look which helps greatly both to maintain an oppressive cyberpunk feel and hide bad FX which is a nice bonus.This isn't a 'bad but fun film' in my opinion though some may see it that way. It has that look sure and if the creators had cast Arnie in the role then it well may have turned out like that. But it has some depth  beyond the exploding bodies and in places absent acting there is thought. If anything I'd liken it to a Paul Verhoeven film  entertaining but still immersive maybe even though provoking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoiler Attached   At first glance this film is just another scifi flick with a mediocre plot and sometimes dull dramatics.  The pundits have been less than generous with their praise of a movie that fails to deliver what the trailers promise. Fortunately it has a few redeeming features.The premise of a society with boundaries on conception is not a new one infact at the time when this film was released China was very much in the news for limiting couples to one child only. But while trying to deal with a very real scenario albeit in the 'global' future the film crew and management had their own brush with Australian authorities regarding the use of 'local' talent preferentially on the Aussie set.  Despite the associated delays and bad press the film was completed much to the delight of scifi aficionados.Christophe Lambert portrays an exmarine John Brennick who's wife Karen played ably by Loryn Locklin is expecting her second child.  Their first child died and during an attempt to cross the border into Mexico the land of the freesic they are taken prisoner.  Transported to an underground prison they fight technology hard labour no pun intended and a prison warden called Poe believably evil and portrayed by Kurtwood Smith.  It would seem that Poe has been reading too many of his namesake's books leading to a rather deviant bent a lust for married women and psychedelic dreams plus due to genetic enhancement the inability to hold his drink.Once Brennick decides he's had enough he attempts a breakout with his cellmates in tow.  One by one they are eliminated by various cyborgs until there is just the Brennicks and Nino Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez heading for the border in the truck that brought them all to the prison.  The ending is a little bland with one version showing the Brennicks and baby while the other shows Nino being terminated by the truck.  Does this all sound a little implausible?  Tough....it's scifi.... what else do you expect?Actually once you get past the bad acting by some of the Aussies and some very plastic props the film isn't that bad.  It deals with complex social issues those of overpopulation which generally means first world values foisted on third world countries incarceration in prisons run by private companies a concept currently being adopted worldwide and the love of a man for his wife and child.Christophe and Kurtwood are both capable of creating stylised characters something they succeed in doing shame that Kurtwood later lost the plot in That 70's Show.  If you are into scifi futureworld or true kickarse action then watch it.".

I've never seen him in anything that wasn't a Bmovie and as far as I know he hasn't done one single nonBmovie for his entire career. This particular Bmovie however is more interesting and entertaining than that of the typical Bmovie the story revolves around a few people in the nottoodistant futurethe year 2017 if I remember correctly who are in a futuristic gigantic prison which is said to be impossible to break out of. So naturally they try to break out. The plot is OK it moves along at a pretty good pace never really loses your interest or bores you. The acting is all bad but what do you expect from a Bmovie? It has plenty of action to keep you distracted from the horrid acting so it probably won't bother that many people. The characters are all cliches but again what do you expect? The action and scifi parts of the film are reasonably entertaining and pretty good for a Bmovie. The film depicts a gloomy futuristic fascist world but that's nothing that hasn't been seen many times before. All in all a pretty typical Bmovie just a notch higher in quality than most others. I recommend it to fans of actionscifi Bmovies andor Christopher Lambert. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing Fortress and Fortress 2 ReEntry for a bargain of 100 each so I though okay. I'm a fan of Lambert in the Highlander films and the plot seemed interesting so I bought them both. I watched it and loved it it may be a lowbudget film but it was great.Lambert does a great performance as John Brennick a man sent to the Fortress because he wanted another kid with his wife Karen. The law in the future says you can have only one child and that's it.Kurtwood Smith does an equally great performance as the warden Poe who gets pleasure out of watching the inmates sexual dreams but dreams are not allowed in the Fortress. Each prisoner is implanted with a device that shocks them if they break the rules and also kill them if they misbehave too much.Jeffery Combs is good as DDay a computer genius his performance in ReAnimator was great too.Fortress is a great scifi film that wont disappoint. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Of course anything directed by Stuart Gordon ReAnimator From Beyond Dagon has to be good. Well he excels himself here. My favorite actor Christopher Lambert Highlander is the hero and central character in this film. Another of my favorites actor Kurtwood Smith Robocop is the villain in this film and gives a thoroughly professional performance. Loryn Locklin is the female lead in this film and she also gives her best performance. A regular in Gordon's film veteran actor Jeffrey Combs Reanimator Trilogy From Beyond is solid throughout the film and really gets into his role as always. Vernon Wells Commando The Road Warriors makes a short appearance as prisoner Maddox.Other notable actors in the films are Tom Towles Halloween 2007 Clifton Collins Jr. Still Waters and Lincoln Kilpatrick Bulletproof.Lets get on with the plot Set in a dystopian future the year 2017 in the USA an exUS Army officer John Henry Brennick Christopher Lambert and his wife Karen S. Brennick Loryn Locklin are attempting to cross the border to Mexico to have a second child. Strict onechild policies forbid a second pregnancy but the couple believe it justified because their first child died at birth.Brennick is caught Karen escapes initially and sentenced to a private maximum security prison that is owned and run by the MenTel Corporation for 31 years. The prison is very high security and to maintain discipline all inmates are implanted with Intestinators which cause pain for violence minor violations etc. and death in the case of escapees. The prison is corun by Director Poe who oversees Zed10 a computer that monitors daytoday activities and represents MenTel. The prison itself is located in front of a deep pit that can only be crossed by a retractable bridge with the prisoners being kept in cells secured by laser walls. However the prison is also overcrowded.John is put in a cell with three other convicts  Abraham who is awaiting parole DDay a machine and demolitions expert who was turned in by his criminal partners after he destroyed both a bank's safe and its money Nino Gomez and Stiggs a particularly tough inmate who initially tries to extort John and has a tough friend called Maddox who is killed in the beginning of the movie.Brennick also learns his wife has been captured as well and is being held in a separate level of the prison with his unborn child who being illegal is now officially owned by the MenTel Corporation and will be confiscated on its birth.Poe having become infatuated with Karen summons her to his quarters telling her that if she lives with him there he will treat John well. She accepts resolving to help John as best she can. Seeing a diamond map which would show the prison map using a laser light she gives it to Abraham to pass on to John pointing out that Poe was never going to grant parole and was only using the incentive to control him. Meanwhile in their cell DDay dismantles the intestinator from Maddox which he managed to grab when Maddox was shot and uses a magnetic component to pull out the others.The next day during their work shift digging a new level John's group places their Intestinator on a large air duct and stage a brawl causing Zed to trigger them and blow open the duct. Poe promptly flushes the duct with steam however making it unusable and sends in Strike Clones which are implied to be the result of experimentation with the convicts' illegal babies. Stiggs is killed and the rest of the group kill a Strike Clone and steal its weapon which John uses to kill the remaining clones.Poe alerted to Karen's betrayal by Zed orders her taken away for a fatal Caesarean and strangles Abraham Abraham's Intestinator having been removed.Hijacking one of the gun turrets which move up and down the Fortress's various levels they travel to Zed's control room. Taking Poe hostage John orders him to release Karen. Though Poe gives the order Zed refuses to obey stating that MenTel does not negotiate in hostage situations and a gun turret under Zed's control shoots Poe. DDay hacks into Zed and accesses a virus confiscated at the start of his sentence. He is fatally shot by a clone before completing the command but uses his last moments to activate the virus causing a systems crash and all automated security to fail. Rescuing Karen just before she gives birth John and Gomez hijack a truck and escape to Mexico.Original ending  The original ending of Fortress has been cut from some versions of the film. After reaching Mexico Brennick his wife and Gomez end up near a barn where Brennick's wife starts going into labour. Gomez goes out to get a blanket for the baby when it comes thinking one might be in the truck. The Fortress or similar computer manages to establish a remote linkup with the truck by that time overriding its internal controls  and the truck suddenly comes to life all on its own. The truck runs Gomez over and kills him. Brennick attacks the truck with the machine gun he procured from one of the Strike Clones. He sets it on fire with the machine gun's flamethrower attachment and it crashes into the barn exploding. He climbs into the burning ruins and finds his wife  sitting against an old and rusted tractor clutching her blanketed baby.1010. Buy it on DVD NOW!!!".

I will name a few that stayed in the memory to this day Speed Hard Boiled Under Siege 1 and 2 Terminator 2 Highlander Braveheart and this movie Fortress. Fortress stars Christopher Lambert in his best role yes even better than Highlander. In the future you can't have more than one child or something like that and he and his wife are sent to a new super prison where escape is impossible or so it seems! I have a problem with the tagline 'the only thing it couldn't hold was an innocent man'. Lambert is not innocent. His wife is pregnant again and no matter how stupid the law is he broke it. So I suppose the only thing it can't hold is a group of guys who plot to escape using the explosive stomach bombs that are planted in them on arrival. Yes you heard correctly stomach bombs! If you go out side the perimeter...BOOM! Kurtwood Smith makes a great turn as the Head of the Prison and as the pawn of the complex computer system that runs THE FORTRESS! I loved this movie as a kid and I watched it recently. Guess what? I still love it. It's got character to make up for it's clichs and a whole bunch of originality to make up for Lambert's FrenchCanadianLambert accent. His acting is what I call Lambertesque. The non stop action makes this movie a great watch for any 1 man 2 fan of 80s90s action 3Lambert fan 4Anyone open mindedI highly recommend it.".

The story is quite ridicules and filled with some highly unlikely moments and plotholes. I mean really if this is supposed to be a future thought out and created to perfection it should be back to the drawing boards for the scientists and world leaders who came up with this stuff and laws.It was still a pretty awesome movie to watch when it came out. All of the effects and sets were pretty decent looking for its time and they helped to give this movie a real futuristic feeling though when you watch it now it all mostly is being ridicules. It got made back in the days when Christopher Lambert was still quite a big name in the business. This movie got really made as a vehicle for him as the main actionhero of the movie. He just isn't the most compelling actor that ever lived. Kurtwood Smith is the main villain of the movie and he did a pretty decent job with restraining himself to not go overthetop with his character like probably a lot of other actors would had done. The movie also has some other decent actors in it that fits their roles fine such as for instance Jeffrey Combs Lincoln Kilpatrick and Vernon Wells.The story and its storytelling are at times really quite messy and bad but when you can look all past that Fortress is still some good mindless fun for you.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

'The Good Earth' is of course the finest of its genre for any number of reasons.From the very beginning of the picture right after the lion's roar we see the poignant tribute to Irving Thalberg and we know that we are embarking on an important viewing experience. The scope of the story is very wide and the filmmakers are up for the task. I was always struck by the abruptness of the final scene but its power and beauty form an excellent example of the art achieved within the often cynical Hollywood film factory. And Lotus  the strangeness of her and her dance contrasted with the goodness of Olan!Aside from the oftmentioned attributes of acting photography and special effects a major element in 'The Good Earth' is the score. Herbert Stothart may not be in the ranks of Hollywood's 'mighty handful' Alfred Newman Steiner Tiomkin Waxman Herrmann but his 'MGMsound' scores regularly deliver the goods. True Stothart had no hesitation in applying the syrup at first opportunity one can imagine Louis B. Mayer positively ordering it but in this picture syrup gives way to sympathy. One of the pleasures of Hollywood's Golden Age films is that all the elements of a given film support each other and great scores support not only the characters but the entire film. Stothart's score is so sympathetic and so sincere from the Main Title all the way through and it enhances the story and the performances so naturally and at times transparently that it must be considered a classic score. No great 'tunes' specifically but plenty of effective mood atmosphere and unabashed emotion. Many of today's audiences may find little to enjoy in such a combination or they may be embarrassed by it but I revel in it as cinema such as this which is delivered with such heart and good will is especially in these times nothing short of a gift.The issue of nonChinese playing Chinese characters has already been discussed on these pages but I can only add please viewers consider the film within the era that it was produced. The same kind of incongruity still happens today perhaps not so much racially but certainly culturally Brad Pitt in 'Seven Years in Tibet' Keanu Reeves in 'Little Buddha' and other Americans getting plum roles in Britishoriginated stories that become Hollywoodized etc. When making 'Bhowani Junction' George Cukor considered using Indian actors but vetoed any candidates in favor of familiar Hollywood faces. Never mind that in the 50s as today India had a huge film industry. It's just that those actors didn't fit into the Hollywood scheme of things. That speaks of box office more than political incorrectness. There is no doubt that fine actors like Philip Ahn should have gotten lead roles in pictures like 'The Good Earth' but at least we can enjoy them in supporting roles which carry a lot of weight in their own right. As time goes on the context of past eras fades while the films themselves the really good ones live on. There's plenty of opportunity for revisionist theses about issues like racial inequality in 1930s Hollywood but for 138 minutes it is compelling and moving to absorb onesself in the story and the atmosphere of 'The Good Earth'.".

Muni plays Wang a Chinese farmer who is about to take a wife Rainer. From the start he treats her with respect during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help. Without giving too much of the movie away they go through the highs and lows of all relationships and even though the story may take place in late 19thearly 20th centurythe story and much of their feelings seems credible.Other than the fact that the movie is about 510 minutes longer than it needs to be and the performances of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical 1930's cartoon characters this is a really wonderful movie that unfortunately has become a victim of political correctness.9 out of 10".

Having seen Muni in only one film where he was quite hammy I expected the same type of performance here.  I was happily proved wrong.  Although some might criticize him as being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of Asians I thought he was just right in the role.  Keye Luke if he'd been given the chance to play a lead role might have played him in much the same manner.I was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes especially during the sacking of the palace where OLan was once a slave. The graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite unlike others of the same time where it was all glitz and glitter.  I watched this film from beginning to end enthralled.  I can't say the same for the epics of today.".

	schema:reviewBody "What Irving Thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again. Making a Chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of Paul Muni Luise Rainer Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly among others.Perhaps it's partly because the story was written by a westerner Pearl Buck who got a Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Ms. Buck daughter of Chinese missionaries probably brought China closer to the consciousness of America than any other person. Not the political struggles of China but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in The Good Earth. Unfortunately later on Pearl Buck became an apologist for the Kuomintang China of Chiang KaiShek in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of her literary output never matched The Good Earth.In The Sundowners there is a great description of comparing China to Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked the difference Ustinov said China was very big and very full and Australia was very big and very empty. That's what you see in The Good Earth China very big and very full of people more than she can deal with at times.The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung Paul Muni as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave. The woman OLan Luise Rainer bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have drought famine revolution and a climatic locust plague.Luise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars for portraying OLan. She may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player Oscar performance with the least amount of dialog. Everything she does practically is done with facial expressions her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles. I think only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man.Muni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture. Rainer helps in the field bears and raises the kids does the housework. When Muni becomes a man of property he takes a Chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief. Still Rainer stoically bears it all. Still Muni is not a bad man and it's a tribute to the film and his acting and Buck's writing that you don't hate him and the culture gap is bridged. We've got a group of oriental players now who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised The Good Earth of all films has not been remade at this point. I'll bet the Chinese government would even let some American company do it on an actual location.Till then we've got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.".

While it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped nevertheless it was superb. Pearl S. Buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature comes alive under the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with an excellent script recounts the story of peasant farmer Wang Lung whose father obtains a bride for him a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's story Wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and the love of the land. In the end he comes to realize that his wife like the land is the source of his wealth happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the prefeminist world. The Germanborn Luise Rainer brings a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan. Muni likewise captures the naive but honorable Wang eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry from the Wizard of Oz Walter Connelly as the mewing conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son but this time not Charlie Chan's.A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. If that's indeed the case this film is a classic no doubt whatsoever.".

It relates the story of Wang Lung Paul Muni a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the 'Great House' where he has taken a slave woman called Olan Luise Rainer and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. During the following years OLan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husband's toil troubles and changing fortunes. Through the passing years they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine. Indeed it's at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship loyalty and Love. With the changing times their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives like their Uncle Walter Connolly who is a scoundrel and charlatan but is compassionately tolerated. Wang has his 'Old Father' Charley Grapewin to advise and remind him of life's fragile and fickle nature. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are Keye Luke who plays Wang's Elder Son and Phillip Ahn who plays a Nationalist soldier. The film is in Black and White and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ".

	schema:reviewBody "In our modernday PC culture it seems downright distasteful to see actors like Paul Muni Luise Rainer and Charley Grapewin done up in yellow face to play Chinese farmers Rainer's baldfaced German accent is especially humorous. But don't let that stop you from watching and enjoying this movie. It's remarkable that a film like this would even have been made in isolationist 1937 America and that studios would have assumed there would be an audience for it. Though it might not pass today's standards of cultural sensitivity The Good Earth makes a solid attempt at a thoughtful and intelligent peek into Chinese culture.Muni and Rainer play the husband and wife of an arranged marriage who struggle together to eek out an existence in a harsh climate. The film is more sympathetic to the wife's point of view and the film is even rather feminist in its way. We see a simple woman who has few choices and who largely accepts the patriarchal culture to which she is born but we also see an emotionally strong and pragmatic woman who all along is making quite conscious and difficult decisions about what is best for her family while staying within the boundaries of acceptable husbandwife relations. Rainer gives a raw physical performance speaking very little but still managing to communicate much to the audience about what's in her mind. Muni is good too with a showier role even if he seems much less authentic as a rural Chinese peasant.The film also makes some interesting and relevant commentary about what wealth and affluence do to people. While this family remains poor they certainly struggle plenty and face much hardship but they retain a strong sense of community and family. As soon as they come into wealth and their material problems go away they begin to squabble over petty differences. It's a testament to something I've always believed which is that if you take away a person's problems he's just going to invent new ones to replace them no matter how comfortable he is or how much material wealth he has.Rainer became the first person to win backtoback acting Oscars when she received the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance in this film. Karl Freund received an Oscar for Best Cinematography for capturing a locust swarm on film among other impressive set pieces. The Good Earth was also nominated in the categories of Best Picture Best Director Sidney Franklin and Best Film Editing for Basil Wrangell's propulsive montages.Grade A".

The principle characters played by Paul Muni and Louise Rainer are wonderful in their roles even though they are not Asian. This is a story of the struggles of the people of the earth to make do. As farmers everywhere can attest the harvest is never a done deal and so many factors can destroy it. Here there is a sense of fortune which is part of the Chinese culture. Pearl Buck lived in China and knew the ways of the people. Things are cyclical so when the man prospers it is fortune and wise living that works. Like so many men as his wife ages he begins to seek greener pastures but again he is defying fortune. Soon there is a deconstruction of the fabric of his family having to do with a sense of betrayal by his son. This is a magnificently filmed production with very fine acting by all involved. It's a benchmark film from a very fine book.".

	schema:headline " Solid epic filmmaking and Luise Rainer";
	schema:reviewBody "The Good Earth is an engrossing tale of the hardships endured by a family of Chinese farmers and their surrounding community.  When one hears the word epic one knows to expect a story with various ups and downs over an extended period of time.  But these events are staged well by the director and interestingly shot by famous cinematographer Karl Freund.  The film achieves a certain amount of realism by using a large number of extras and by incorporating an effective scene of swarming locusts in the film's climax.  I also noticed several sequences of rapid montage scattered throughout that made me think of Eisenstein.  But the best part of the film is Louise Rainer's portrayal of OLan.  Although she doesn't cover an extended range of emotions her performance is quite moving perhaps because of its simplicity.  She has wonderfully expressive and soulful eyes that elicit the viewer's sympathy something about them or her appearance is slightly reminiscent of Falconetti's Joan of Arc.  Of course the performance and the film are not of that caliber but if you enjoy Hollywood epic filmmaking I don't think you'll be disappointed.".

They are entitled to their opinion but they missed one of life's most important lesson's Humility and loyalty.I was fortunate to see this film when it was FIRST released  in 1939. It's wonderful story Pearl S. Buck written for film Talbot Jennings has stayed with me all through my long life. I saw it in a theater then I found it in the garbage bin in WalMart this year 2011 and bought it immediately....I had it in a huge collection I gave to a library in Los Angeles when I moved to Florida. The copy I have now was made from the original cut  there are black screens between big scenes. I don't remember that after all these years but accept it was the way the early release looked. It doesn't bother me  it gives me more time to think of what I have just viewed and anxious to see what's next. To me the story is so engrossing the length of the film doesn't even occur to me  I would have liked the ending to be longer because Olan you are the earth told the entire reason for the story of true love and devotion to the extreme.....I'm not even bothered by the question so many people asked of why Paul Muni Wang Lung and Luise Rainer Olan were cast insteadof Asians  I had never seen Ms. Rainer in any film and have no idea why her Hollywood career faded. She was considered to be a great beauty. Paul Muni I've seen in other films but he wasn't one of my favorites. Yes I have always wondered how Gone with the Wind  beat it out of an award actually I thought The Good Earth was filmed in color. Now I'm not even concerned about that  the STORY the ultimate entirety of the film's huge scenes and huge cast dismisses any negative comment I could think of or read.Walter Connolly Uncle and Charlie Grapewin Old Father were perfectly cast and played their roles with great skill. All of the cast were consummate in their roles director Sidney Franklin held a strong grip of the totality of the film and got it all right. As time progressed into a more modern era the characters became more modern except Olan stayed the wonderful woman she was.However  Ms. Rainer stole the entire movie. A good actress does not always need words to say. I feel the story of a peasantfarmer and his exslave wife all of the troubles they encountered and defeated the entire cast presented an accurate portrayal of the story in those days  China. It is hard for me to visualize any remake could be better and feel any CGIs would be completely unnecessary. It is also hard for me to realize China's last emperor was alive when I went to Hawai'i in 1969......living a peasantlife just as did Wang Lung and Olan.Anyone who views The Good Earth and doesn't readily understand that life is bigger than any of us haven't really lived. It gets a 20 from me  I recommend it to every living soul.".

Charley Grapewin brings his grizzled oldtimer persona he used in many films to this one. He's great fun to watch whether he's in China or Oklahoma. Also winning an Oscar was the great cinematographer Karl Freund possibly best known today for his Universal horror films. It's a beautifullooking film. Obviously the elephant in the room is the casting of white actors as some of the Chinese characters. That's going to be a dealbreaker for politically correct types.

	schema:reviewBody "THE GOOD EARTH is a difficult movie to assess today more than seventy years after its initial release. I think in order to assess it properly we have to make some distasteful concessions.There was really virtually no chance that the leads would be played by Asians in a Hollywood film in 1937. For starters the book was a major bestseller and it did not come cheap. Add to that an epic story line that involves at least one extended crowd scene it is in fact the scene of a riot and the locust invasion God only KNOWS how they pulled that one off.So they were sinking serious money into this project and the brutal truth was that they needed names. Paul Muni was at the top of his game in 1937 and Luise Rainer had won the Oscar the year before as Anna Held in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. Some decisions are made with the eye firmly on the cash register.So it comes as a great surprise that this movie turned out to be so good. Yes you have to overlook the fact that many of the actors are about as Asian as apple pie though to be fair the makeup department probably got them as close as anyone could to looking the part but the funny thing is that the mixed bag of ethnicities in the cast quickly becomes lost in a grand sweeping brilliantly filmed and acted epic story of a Chinese peasant farmer and his family.Muni who was in a sense the male Meryl Streep of his day scores big as Wang Lung. He was too tall and they could not do anything about that but they wisely did not try and before long thanks to Muni's deeply committed performance suspension of disbelief becomes that much easier.But at the end of the day this film belongs to Luise Rainer. As OLan she would become the first actress to win the Best Actress Oscar two years in a row. The first one was for THE GREAT ZIEGFELD another splendid performance though the role was so small that it really belonged in the supporting category. As OLan she is triumphant. I read the book many years ago in high school and loved it so I sort of avoided a movie that contained so many Western actors in Asian roles. But Rainer plays the stolid silent and uncomplaining OLan exactly as she is written in Pearl S Buck's novel it is almost at times as if she is channeling her. A good many people at the time thought Garbo was going to win for CAMILLE but I've never been able to stand her an oldguard overactress if ever there was one she chewed more scenery than Davis Crawford and the notorious Miriam Hopkins put together.The rest of the cast thanks to Irving G Thalberg's taste and eye for quality is equally good. This was to be Thalberg's final film before his premature death at thirtyseven and it was dedicated to him as his last great achievement. Not without reason. Despite the slight awkwardness in the casting and a script that toward the end veered into sentimentality quite unlike the novel but for a Hollywood movie it's a small deviation this is a mesmerizing film that takes a good close look at the harshness of poverty. In that sense it can be considered a precursor to John Ford's THE GRAPES OF WRATH three years later. And while Ford's film is clearly superior to its predecessor it is quite possible that without THE GOOD EARTH THE GRAPES OF WRATH would never have been made. Hollywood in those days liked fluff and happy endings it would be several more years before realism became more commonplace in American cinema largely due to the film noir movement.I have to say it I love this movie. It captures the heart and soul of the book and falters only slightly at the end and despite the casting has not dated nearly as badly as one would have thought. And for a Hollywood film with mostly nonAsian actors playing Chinese peasants that really IS something of a miracle.".

	schema:headline " Mixed feelings about this adaptation of Pearl Buck's The Good Earth...";
	schema:reviewBody "Although there are faults THE GOOD EARTH manages to hold the viewer's interest in a lengthy film because of George Sidney's smoothly competent direction and the performances of PAUL MUNI as the naive farmer Wang Lung and to a lesser extent LUISE RAINER as OLan his peasant wife. Helpful too is the fact that the film's atmosphere is artfully crafted with sets and costumes that look lived in. I've never been much of an admirer of Miss Rainer's acting style but at least she seems credible in the role. However her character is so passive that there are times when she appears to be sleepwalking through the part in an attempt to portray the completely submissive and meek nature of her lowly character. It gets tiresome after awhile and too onenote to stir much sympathy. She uses those big eyes and downcast expression to convey emotion but has very little to say about anything which leaves Muni with a lot to do.By contrast PAUL MUNI is almost a little too animated as the young Chinese farmer who takes a wife because in a male dominated culture she'll help him harvest his crop and bear his children. But he has much more acting to do than Rainer and ten times the amount of dialog and does it well. He too was deserving of an award but instead he was nominated that year for another film.CHARLEY GRAPEWIN and WALTER CONNOLLY are not exactly examples of good casting for the most prominent supporting roles as Asians. Both of them are hardly recognizable beneath their makeup especially Connolly as the greedy nonworking uncle. I didn't know it was him until I read the credits. KEY Luke is fine as the eldest son and TILLY LOSCH makes an interesting exotic creature as Lotus the dancer.But the story itself is a bit depressing since it deals more with the hardships and bitter struggle against nature that all farmers have to endure than it does with any reward they have for their efforts.The big crowd scene at a palace where Rainer almost gets shot as a looter is handled very effectively and of course the plague of locusts swarming across the fields is something spectacular to watch. These scenes have the sweep of an epic but the story is more intimate and is really an examination of man's fortitude against nature.For all of its trials and tribulations and its simple story of a man and woman who depend on the earth for a living this can be highly depressing rather than inspirational in that there are many more grim scenes of failure than brief moments of success. The story is structured in such a way that you can almost see the downbeat threat looming over every scene. In other words the gloom and doom elements of the story are going to alienate some viewers.But serious moviegoers who love the classics of the '30s will probably be able to sit through this without too much trouble although some cutting would have helped during the first hour where the pace is much too slow.".

Supporting players range from slumming it Charley Grapewin as Wong's crusty father to decent Keye Luke and Roland Lui as the couple's adult sons whereas dancer Tilly Losch's turn as the concubine Lotus is mostly sanitized along with the intramural seduction a woman's shoe becomes a telling metaphor. At least several ChineseAmerican actors are hired but if one wants to detect any sign of consanguinity between sons and their father it is a lost cause in other sense THE GOOD EARTH is an impressive adaption triumphant in its scale and aesthetic ambition which means it is in dire urgent for a BluRay refurbishment its central story might taste stale but its visual undertaking merits plaudits plus Hollywood actually withholds their exploitative guideline in an ethnological portrait that is not a cinch looking back 80 years later.".

However the acting of the wife was not like this i saw her and i no longer felt i was watching a cheesy epic but that i was witness to an actor that can transcend time. second because of the good acting on the part of the wife the message of the movie was clear. the fact that The father switched back and forth over the course of the movie to show the audience that he had it right the first time seems trite it's a trick that pulls the plot along but not the viewer no surprises and we have seen it all before. on the other hand what is less trite and this is what i think makes the message clear ultimately is that the wife can pull off a humblebynature type person who shows us constantly that she actually is better off even when her husband is seemingly much more successful.Humble thyslef in the sight of the lord and love the land you have and it will love you. seems to be the sign hanging around the movie's neck this sign is what makes it trite it makes the message obvious and the viewer stupid.

	schema:reviewBody "Well well well what do we have here? Another one of Bertolucci's earlier films? Yes and No. This is one of Bernardo Bertolucci's earlier films 1979 but it is unlike anything that he had done before or ever did again.La Luna is something that is a gem of filmmaking history even though it is virtually impossible to get on video and it will most probably never be shown on Television again.It tells the sad depressing yet beautiful tale of a young boy's growth into adolescence  while experimenting with drugs and eventually as they always do ends up becoming addicted to Heroin.His Motherplayed ever so beautifully by Jill Clayburge in an effort to try and 'wean him' off the drugs develops an incestuous relationship with her son.Shocking as the description above may sound at first please do not let it put you off seeing this fantastic film as it is only a small slice of the cinematically glorious outing that this film is!The photography portrayed in this film is the best that bertolucci has ever achieved Yes even the fantastic The Last Emperor and Little Buddah. When I say a film is utterly breathtaking I am a hard person to please when it comes to films just read my other reviews here! then you know you're in for a treat and a half.But what is the point of this review unless people have a chance to witness the sheer beauty for themselves?I saw this film when I was 15 years of age. I am now 26 and have never forgotten a single FRAME of La Luna. Every word every scene sticks in my mind like a vivid memory and I in some ways feel that I was in the film somehow and was able to feel all the anger all the pain and all the love that surrounded it.For a film to make this much of an impression on someone and for that impression to still be fresh in the person's mind eleven years later you also know this film has to be a good thing.You people I am very sad to say will probably never have the chance to see this film as it has not been released on Video  I have tried nearly every day for eleven years to find a copy!!!.But let what I have said stick in your mind just as La Luna hopefully will some day...".

	onyx:emotionText "Well well well what do we have here? Another one of Bertolucci's earlier films? Yes and No. This is one of Bernardo Bertolucci's earlier films 1979 but it is unlike anything that he had done before or ever did again.La Luna is something that is a gem of filmmaking history even though it is virtually impossible to get on video and it will most probably never be shown on Television again.It tells the sad depressing yet beautiful tale of a young boy's growth into adolescence  while experimenting with drugs and eventually as they always do ends up becoming addicted to Heroin.His Motherplayed ever so beautifully by Jill Clayburge in an effort to try and 'wean him' off the drugs develops an incestuous relationship with her son.Shocking as the description above may sound at first please do not let it put you off seeing this fantastic film as it is only a small slice of the cinematically glorious outing that this film is!The photography portrayed in this film is the best that bertolucci has ever achieved Yes even the fantastic The Last Emperor and Little Buddah. When I say a film is utterly breathtaking I am a hard person to please when it comes to films just read my other reviews here! then you know you're in for a treat and a half.But what is the point of this review unless people have a chance to witness the sheer beauty for themselves?I saw this film when I was 15 years of age. I am now 26 and have never forgotten a single FRAME of La Luna. Every word every scene sticks in my mind like a vivid memory and I in some ways feel that I was in the film somehow and was able to feel all the anger all the pain and all the love that surrounded it.For a film to make this much of an impression on someone and for that impression to still be fresh in the person's mind eleven years later you also know this film has to be a good thing.You people I am very sad to say will probably never have the chance to see this film as it has not been released on Video  I have tried nearly every day for eleven years to find a copy!!!.But let what I have said stick in your mind just as La Luna hopefully will some day...";

If you enjoy films mainly concerning characterisation in which the emotional complexities of human beings are not served up in easily chewable chunks then you will probably enjoy this film. Even given the above you might still be disconcerted by the rapid plot changes and narrative swings. Two points are valid here Bertolucci directed this during the time when he was heavily into psychoanalysis  and secondly someone quite lucidly stated that Bertolucci's Spider's Stratagem was a movie with a linear narrative shown in a nonlinear manner while La Luna was a movie with a nonlinear narrative shown in a linear manner. Viewed in this manner one can enjoy the film with its many beautifully crafted scenes.I love how the film presents the craziness of life with its contradictions multiple meanings and emotional messiness. The irrational and problematic behavior of the characters may make the film harder to follow but seems to me a truer view of life than the explicit logical road map given to audiences in most films.The film does date itself clearly in the 1970s so you have to accept some scary clothing moments such as Jill Clayburgh walking out of a building into a bright Rome day wearing sunglasses so big only a comedian would wear them these days. But on the whole this does not distract from the overall effect.Finally opera lovers will enjoy the set piece opera scenes which are very ingeniously shot and beautifully staged.".

An elegant production  not one lame or wasted moment. New Yorkbased American diva Jill Clayburgh a true celebrity is married to it could happen! Fred Gwynne. Her only child a teenage son Matthew Barry accompanies his parents to a plush rental home in Italy where Clayburgh's opera career has taken her and where his biological father lives.  Though hobnobbing and partying with the rich and famous in Rome Clayburgh nonetheless is worried about her son because of his distance and solitude  he doesn't take to his stepfather  his general teenage angst and his pending reunion with his real father. Clayburgh's motherly instincts kick in and she soon learns her loving son has indeed fallen in with the wrong crowd.  Mamma mia!  He is on his way to being a junkie and Clayburgh takes rather extreme steps to get the boy's mind off heroin and other cheap thrills.  Not for the kiddies but entertaining for grownups who like something different and have open minds.The adult theme is rather tame relatively speaking and is handled well and not explicitly especially compared with the moronic garbage being spewed out in American movies and TV today.  Certainly not in the nearlyxrated category of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris for example. What I want to know is whatever happened to the hauntingly handsome thenyoungster Matthew Barry?  He could have had a promising film career based on his good looks and his performance in Luna. I saw this on Cinemax in the early good old days early 1980s when it aired great movies especially foreign films.  I have tried but been unable to buy it sad to say.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not many discuss Bertolucci's La Luna as one of his most challenging films but I beg to differ. In 1979 I presume the film's campy allure had not been registered but today it's all to be seen call it kitsch or ironic but la Luna encapsulates two worlds Bertolucci tried to negotiate in most of his films  the world of appearances and surfaces against the inner world of the protagonist. La Luna plays both against each other as a masquerade because what we think we are getting is not what we really are seeing. Bertolucci presents the first part as a postFreudian fable in late 70s Rome where an Opera singer and her son indulge in an Oedipal relationship. Bertolucci then introduces the lost but real father to the scene as if to eradicate Freudian psychoanalysis as a spurious retelling of Greek myth. It seems the son only wants his father's recognition and love while the mother is marginalized. It's a very masculine thesis for Bertolucci one that reinforces the illusory fundamentals of Patriarchy while negating the matriarchal as a mere bypass to the final journeyfather's love.Jill Clayburgh's acting is offkey most of the time but this unwittingly invests the film with its latterday camp quality while Matthew Barry looks dazed and confused throughout the entire film. Rome is undoubtedly the best part of the film as well as the sumptuous visuals that capture its sundrenched beauty and decaying but grand monuments.".

	schema:headline " it's a flawed schizophrenic artistic feat";
	schema:reviewBody "In a way I feel sorry for Bernardo Bertolucci's La Luna though maybe more for Bertolucci than the film itself. Having come off of the monumental undertaking of 1900 he probably wanted to still keep the challenging creative juices flowing and in doing so concocted an idea surrounding a mother and son who lose their closest significant other and go to Rome only to get dragged into their own created mire of drug addiction selfabsorption and incest. This of course sounds quite meaty dramatically at least when first heard. Executed on film it's another story and the final script is probably what ends up making the film one of the weakest if not THE weakest I've seen from the director yet. This still means that there's good chunks in there even really wonderfully sordid moments of incredible familial dysfunction between mother and son. But unlike for example Malle's Murmur of the Heart there's a lack of cohesion to any sense of firm psychology with either mother or son and while things are fascinating and potent in dramatic spontaneity in the first twothirds there's a moment when things start to go downhill. By the end I wondered if Bertolucci was about to break into the end of 8 12.We're given a character study that's for sure and quite the two fed up characters. The mother is Caterina Jill Clayburgh a quasi Diane Keaton lookalike however only sometimes talented and convincing who's husband in a great bit part by Fred Gwynne dies suddenly while driving a car. Though both mother and son are devastated they go to Rome so she can sing in the opera there. The son meanwhile is at that absolutely abhorrent age in anyone's life 15 and at first is into some nothingness abound with a girl and soon enough into a deadend mindset of heroin. This alarms her mother to be sure and perhaps the most perfect scene of the film whether this means it will shock or unsettle is another matter is when the son plays piano for a moment when the mother tries to get her son to tell her about his drug problem peers for a moment under his shirt and then he erupts at her with physical violence. Finally it ends and she goes to one side of the room with a look like 'what the hell just happened' and he goes off to do more junk. There's even the brilliant little insinuation which is all that's needed of a notion of desire when she's trying to peer at his arm.Now if there had been more scenes like this consistently it might even be one of Bertolucci's masterpieces. But however this is not to be. Towards the middle things even become shaky as the same randomness of mind and spirit with the mother and son this chronic sense of equal parts of nihilism despair gallows humor and the oddness of bourgeois discontent with dark pasts becomes something that Bertolucci isn't fully able to grab a hold of. And unlike in Last Tango in Paris there's no Marlon Brando here to make things incredibly appealing with totally believable dread in the face of loss. Matthew Barry is decent in the part of Joe the son but also teeters on being annoying which maybe is part of the desired effect but still. And the sense of how their push and pull relationship with his drug addiction as the center isn't fully resolved with the mother. Clayburgh's Caterina just isn't sympathetic or empathetic enough to get into her mindset because despite being interesting in her part of a somewhat unfit parent who loves her son perhaps in the worst possible ways and that both are crazy it isn't enough to sustain what happens at the 23 mark...which is when Bertolucci and his writers pull out the son I'll take you back to your roots and find your real father who made you a bastard card and everything goes downhill from there.It's a mark of downhill quality that has almost been building and it's troubling especially since a lot DOES work in morbid detail of the characters and how operatic intonations somehow become involved in their plights. But Bertolucci tends to put the hammer down in both technique and substance and only in the former does it really work. His and Vittorio Storaro's eye in this film is just as sharp and succulent as in their other collaborations with the camera gliding seamlessly in some crucial ways providing movement to just the slightest moments of emotional upheaval. Yet even in the least effective spot of the film there are the moments like when Joe plays drums with his fork and spoon at the table. Or the very awkward silence after the mother's sexual advances go very unheeded. In the end La Luna becomes more worthwhile to see for what doesn't work as opposed to what does. While some might come away from it feeling that it's an uncompromising work of genius I wouldn't though it's not a failure either. It's a curious work of bravura testing of the limits of what people in this case Americans can be in such a European environment and that the psychologies therein are as wobbly as a bad table leg.".

It was my first introduction to Bertolucci but it convinced me immediately of his powers! The storyline is simple yet it is complex let's call it simply complex for arguments sake!. It involved the character of an opera singer played magnificently by Jill Clayburge and her son played equally fine by Matthew Barry.Some people have frowned upon the film for it's incestuous content  yet I would beg to differ. Although there most certainly are incest scenes in the film there is really only one or two which 'shock' yet they are primary to the storyline and they do help with filling out the flesh of it all so to speak.Heroin addiction is another aspect of this film which may disturb some people especially from a character so young but being an ex heroin addict myself these scenes did not bother me but bought back some pretty painful memories as did the incest ones and they are done with beauty and not overindulged at all.Put simply this film needs to be seen by everyone and you must truly see it for what it is  a magnificent piece of artistic cinema in it's most purest form.".

Although there most certainly are incest scenes in the film there is really only one or two which 'shock' yet they are primary to the storyline and they do help with filling out the flesh of it all so to speak.Heroin addiction is another aspect of this film which may disturb some people especially from a character so young but being an ex heroin addict myself these scenes did not bother me but bought back some pretty painful memories as did the incest ones and they are done with beauty and not overindulged at all.Put simply this film needs to be seen by everyone and you must truly see it for what it is  a magnificent piece of artistic cinema in it's most purest form.";

She was young and beautiful and he remembers seeing her face and then the moon in a way that both seemed to blend together for some moments. The bonus shows us Bertolucci being interviewed in different phases of his life. He is very intelligent and human and has really something to say.La Luna is a very beautiful film that can touch a delicate subject with tenderness and poetry. Jill Clayburgh and Matthew Barry are outstanding as mother and son and I must confess that during the film I wished Jill Clayburgh were my mother. Oh Yes! I didn't like the ending so much but I think that maybe Bertolucci wanted an operatic ending to La Luna it is a matter of taste anyway.".

From the very first minutes we can witness the connection between mother and son a bond so strong that goes beyond words. This movie has been badly reviewed and analyzed until this day. I will humbly try to correct some points made by others. The young kid in the movie begins his descent into drugs not because he misses her dad but because he wants to numb himself and escape the sexual lust and feelings he has towards her mom. You can watch it very clearly in the scene between them when he couldn't inject heroin in his arm due to a lack of a needle and it's all covered in fever. He then proceeds to guide her mom's hand to his groin. It's clear then the real motive why he was in that condition. Another point most people don't seem to recognize is that the mother doesn't recur to the incest to get close to his son. She does so because she shared the same sexual desire towards him. She had witness an incestuous relationship between his boyfriend and his mother and accepted it because deep inside she knew she had it those impulses in her too.This movie's themes and subject matter are taboo to this day but I for once I'm grateful that those kind of themes are covered at all in an elegant profound and nongraphic film such as this one. This is not a soft porn flick nor it is made for titillating audiences. The photography the music and Jill Clayburg's performance are like the icing on a cake.

She is accompanied by her young handsome son Joe Matthew Barry who soon grows in the habit of taking drugs. The mother begins an incestuous relationship with her lonely son so that he could overcome his addiction This motion picture from Bernardo Bertolucci is a flabbergastingly inconsistent opus which does not shock anymore and whose composition resembles a mashed frog smeared on one's wall. The film is generally flawed owing to being lamely scripted and having the horrendous dialogues which prejudice the material even more. By reconceiving the concept from Before the Revolution from 1964 Mr Bertolucci perchance intends to exhibit the putridity of haute bourgeoisie as well as a complicated relationship between the mother and her infant but he fails to convey anything but cheap gestures scenes swaying between solemnity and instants of quasihysterical exultations reminiscent of a bottomdrawer vaudeville performers who turn up for no reason whatsoever a great deal of pointless moments which do not add anything to the already muddled plot. Bertolucci seems to be smug to disclose some bond between opera and cinema yet to my way of thinking the upshot is downright pathetic and deprived of essential ingredients such as likable leading figures. Instead a viewer is constrained to sit through over two hours with two crass hedonists endeavouring to find happiness in their narcissistic lives. The flick welters in its excesses and it is only palatable once the opera sequences come in sight unfortunately these are few and far between. The characters in la bte noire by Bertolucci are provided with no depth and constitute just furnishings in this beauteously framed film shot by the great Vittorio Storaro. The personalities of the main heroes i.e. the opera singer and her son are contrived unreal but most of all there is no chemistry in the realm of their interactions and all the protagonists do is quarrelling and making up. This repetitiveness will prove quite an ordeal for some. Ultimately we are stranded in this vortex of soap opera seasoned with munificent portions of soap paltry discourses ubiquitous aimlessness and directional complacency. Towards the denouement the opus embarks on being slightly better on account of Tomas Milian's agile performance but it is too late to revive the already embalmed content.Jill Clayburgh is not too bad as Caterina Silveri although her appearance in this movie does not render the things any better. Matthew Barry is the one who feels rather inexperienced in his role and as a consequence he pronounces his lines virtually phonetically. Tomas Milian is the best member of the cast and his subtle performing infuses some realism into the frenetic work. There are some other dexterous actors e.g. Franco Citti Alida Valli Renato Salvatori and Roberto Benigni who almost seems to be perpetuated on the celluloid by accident his part is very very insignificant and unnecessary.The cinematography by Storaro is ravishingly enthralling as always. Storaro captures the beauty of landscapes like a painter considerately constructing the image in detail one element after another. Notwithstanding if you are exasperated by the dissipated narrative texture asinine conversations the insipid vagabond script and you don't find the film any better than I do you might be insufficiently attentive to his dcor. The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is not memorable at all but it certainly unnerves and prompts some sort of foreboding.I am certain that there are people who appreciate this flick but as far as I am concerned this blague does not appeal to me forasmuch as it implicates unlikable onedimensional characters loads of senseless sequences needlessly prolonged running time contrived dialogues and the enragingly pervasive ambivalence. How to express it all in a couple of lines? At one point in the movie Joe Silveri prepares supper for himself and his mum. Once he tastes the meal he has just cooked he winces and utters God it's awful it sucks. This epitomises La luna for me. It genuinely sucks.".

You'll love the scene where Clayburgh rubs Barry's penis through his jeans mmmmm....appetizing no?

	schema:reviewBody "I always try to see as many European movies as possible. That has nothing to do with the fact that I'm a European myself. It's because I want to keep an open mind on as many kinds of movies as possible. I certainly do not dislike Hollywood movies but I find the Asian and European movies sometimes more original and stylish. Especially the Italians seem to have a feeling for creating a beautiful stylish and colorful movie so when I got the chance to see La Luna a movie directed by Bernardo Bertolucci I didn't have to think twice...La Luna tells the story of the recently widowed American opera diva Caterina Silveri. She takes her teenage son Joe who believes that it was his father who died while in reality it was his stepfather with her on a long singing tour to Italy. But she is so absorbed by her hectic work schedule that she doesn't pay much attention to him. Soon she discovers that her troubled and lonely son has become a heroin addict and in her attempts to get him of the drugs they start an incestuous relationship. Still these problems may also result in a meeting between Joe and his real father whose existence she has always kept a secret but now reveals in a desperate attempt to make her son act normal again.I understand that many people will raise an eyebrow after reading this resume but I guess that's exactly what I mean about keeping an open mind towards as many movies as possible. I'm sure you'll never see such a movie in Hollywood but that doesn't mean it can't be any good does it? And yes perhaps the subject will not appeal to many people but in my opinion it still is worth giving a try.I've read in other reviews that this may well be the best movie Bertolucci has ever made better than The Last Emperor and Little Buddah his more famous movies. I really can't tell you whether they are right or not because I haven't seen those movies yet but what I can say is that this is a good movie. The acting and the photography make this movie look better than average and make the disturbing subject bearable to watch. That's why I give this movie a 710. It's probably not to everybody's taste but it certainly isn't bad.".

The child acting is not Oscar worthy. The adult acting is child like but for a kids movie it is perfect but none of that matters. The seal is a scene stealer.

Wongwhich led to me deciding to find out if the stinkers really do stink.The plotBeing deeply embarrassed by a gang of his students allowing a remote control aeroplane to go out of hand and almost hit his carsecond grade teacher Morgan Brinway decides to punish the group by calling their little gang Stinkers and also to ignore almost anything that any member of the gang says to him.Placed at the back of the busas the whole school heads off for a visit to Springville aquariumthe Stinkers decide to take a closer tour of the aquariumwhen they spot Brinway being completely distracted.Keeping an eye out for Brinwaythe gang quietly look round behind the scenes of the aquariumwhich leads to them catching a glimpse of a man attempting to steal a sea lion called Slappy from the aquarium.With Brinway having told them all that he would ignore anything that they tell himthe Stinkers decide that the only way to save Slappyis for them to do it all on their own.View on the filmFocusing on the Stinkers for most of the moviethe screenplay by Bob Wolterstorff and Mike Scott sadly fails to build any supported feelings that the viewer may have for the gangby making each member of the group very annoyingly and also lacking any distinctive personalities.Whilst sadly only having supporting roles in the movieB.D. Wong and Jennifer Coolidge each give charming performanceswith Wong showing a keen hand for slapstick as Brinwayand Coolidge also giving the movie an unexpected bit of class as assistant teacher Harriet.Along with Wong and Coolidgedirector Barnet Kellman gives the movie a real boast by including some delightful spoof moments of other movieswhich help to thankfully stop this film from stinking as much as it easily could.".

Wongwhich led to me deciding to find out if the stinkers really do stink.The plotBeing deeply embarrassed by a gang of his students allowing a remote control aeroplane to go out of hand and almost hit his carsecond grade teacher Morgan Brinway decides to punish the group by calling their little gang Stinkers and also to ignore almost anything that any member of the gang says to him.Placed at the back of the busas the whole school heads off for a visit to Springville aquariumthe Stinkers decide to take a closer tour of the aquariumwhen they spot Brinway being completely distracted.Keeping an eye out for Brinwaythe gang quietly look round behind the scenes of the aquariumwhich leads to them catching a glimpse of a man attempting to steal a sea lion called Slappy from the aquarium.With Brinway having told them all that he would ignore anything that they tell himthe Stinkers decide that the only way to save Slappyis for them to do it all on their own.View on the filmFocusing on the Stinkers for most of the moviethe screenplay by Bob Wolterstorff and Mike Scott sadly fails to build any supported feelings that the viewer may have for the gangby making each member of the group very annoyingly and also lacking any distinctive personalities.Whilst sadly only having supporting roles in the movieB.D. Wong and Jennifer Coolidge each give charming performanceswith Wong showing a keen hand for slapstick as Brinwayand Coolidge also giving the movie an unexpected bit of class as assistant teacher Harriet.Along with Wong and Coolidgedirector Barnet Kellman gives the movie a real boast by including some delightful spoof moments of other movieswhich help to thankfully stop this film from stinking as much as it easily could.";

We know enough of how sports and martial arts can coexist in movies either in comical fashion like Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer or played in a more deadpan idolmovie like manner with the Jay Chou vehicle Kung Fu Dunk. Joining their ranks is this latest action film directed by Thanakorn Pongsuwan which fuses an illegal underground basketball league and Muay Thai fighting.For those who want to organize their own tournament here are the extremely simple rules as explained in the movie. It's your standard 5 on 5 basketball on a full length court except that when the whistle blows you can brawl with your opponent immediately which makes it something like a WWE Royal Rumble only faster and more brutal. To win you still have to put the ball into your opponent's goalbasket it's still basketball after all but it only takes one dunk to win. Either that or the team with the last man standing will be the victor. Killing your opponent is allowed but only within the court anything outside equals to punishment for the team but there's no replacement players allowed as you progress through the stages. Which means survivors get to split more cash between them but suffer from numerical disadvantage. Weapons are optional too.Which makes the film perfect as an all out actioner and Pongsuwan doesn't think twice about indulging the audience into detailed well executed fights which take precedence over a decent game of basketball. While watching the film I felt it was a throwback to the 80s Bloodsport type of movie with gladiators battling in an arena sans plot and character development where the focus is to let the fists and feet do most of the talking. That said the fight sequences were nicely shot and tightly choreographed though it seemed more like an allout street brawl than sticking to Muay Thai principles. Fans of hardhitting action will definitely appreciate the ringside seat to all of the action here which is relentless in pace and powerful in execution.Storywise it tells of the tale of Tai Preeti Barameeanat who has recently been released from prison because twin brother Tan got him out of jail by raising required funds for bribery but at the price of fighting for his life in a coma at the hospital. Tai learns from Tan's main squeeze Pang Khanutra Chuchuaysuwan who provides a cursory and unnecessary romantic angle that Tan often got himself badly knocked up and discovers that his twin was actually knocked comatose by an opponent in a Fireball tournament. So like a JeanClaude Van Damme movie Tai adopts Tan's identity and finds himself looking for a team to join for the tournament seeking revenge.Enter Boss Den Phutharit Prombandal who recruits Tai's Tan into his Fireball team led by captain and best fighter of the lot Zing 9 Million Sam yes you read that right! with Muk Kumpanat Oungsoongnern K Anuwat Saejao and teenager IQ Kannut Samerjai as the ragtag hastily assembled team with trust issues amongst one another and personal issues each from the doldrums of society mercenaries for hire if you like eyeing that prize money at the end of the rainbow in order to lift their lot. Throw in some matchfixing potential which is defacto in any underground fights and nasty opponents with no qualms for un sportsmanship behaviour and you're all set for a nonstop action film where the drama in between becomes an excuse to glue the multifaceted fight scenarios together. One of the best involves a training sequence where the boys play a friendly in and around a narrow and cramped apartment block resembling a parkouryamakasi piece.Given knowledge that a prequel will be made I can't help but to think that this film could end up as the middle movie since it ended the way it did with doors opened for a sequel and of course the story of Tan provides ample room for scenes before the opening shot here. The players too are likely to be similar for the prequel and it could follow John Woo's A Better Tomorrow where you can bring back the key actor from the excuse that we're looking at the twin  likeness resembling relative which this film had all set up and set subsequent movies back in time too.That said as a basketballtype movie Fireball would not muster any merit for layups and slam dunks. But as an action film then yes it will satisfy any action junkie who misses the good old days of no holds barred fights multiplied by the number of players on the court all happening at the same time.".

There are several lengthy Fireball matches but it is virtually impossible to work out who is punching or kicking who making the film an extremely frustrating and utterly boring experience. In between the 'action' Pongsuwan pads out the running time with cloying emotional drama but since I couldn't care less about any of his horribly clichd characters this did nothing to help improve my opinion of the film as a whole.So bad it makes the barely above average Kung Fu Dunk 2008 look like a work of pure genius by comparison I have no reservations in giving Fireball the lowest possible rating of 110.".

In between the 'action' Pongsuwan pads out the running time with cloying emotional drama but since I couldn't care less about any of his horribly clichd characters this did nothing to help improve my opinion of the film as a whole.So bad it makes the barely above average Kung Fu Dunk 2008 look like a work of pure genius by comparison I have no reservations in giving Fireball the lowest possible rating of 110.";

	schema:headline " Violent basketball tournament? Sure why not?...";
	schema:reviewBody "When I bought this movie from Amazon it was mostly because of the cover and the costumer reviews I glanced through there. However I did fail to pick up that this movie was about a weird combo of martial arts and basketball. Had I known that I probably wouldn't have picked it up. And one of the major factors in the decision for buying it was that there are some really amazing fighting movies coming out of Thailand.Now having seen this movie I sit here somewhat puzzled. The movie had a lot of fighting in it as expected and the scenes were quite nicely executed and brought on the screen. However I do think the scene where one team was using metal pipes in the fight was a bit tame especially because a lot of the time you could see that they weren't even aiming to hit the opponents with the pipes they were just randomly striking at the air to make it look choreographed. That was sort of lame.Then the whole thing with the basketball tournament mixed up with brutal fighting well... That really didn't work out all that nicely for me. It was like a weird hybrid version of Rollerball.The story in Fireball is pretty thin though I suspect that was to be expected of a movie of this caliber as you watch this for the action and fighting not the storyline and plot. Basically it is the story of a guy entering a brutal competition to raise money for his brothers brain surgery. And that is it the rest is just action fighting and violence.Fireball is worth watching for the fight scenes if nothing else however mind you they are not on the same level as the ones seen in Ong Bak.The acting in the movie was alright actually. I wasn't overly familiar with the actors and actresses here in the movie but I do think they did do alright with their given roles and characters.All in all Fireball is an adequate movie if you are looking to be entertained in the way of constant action and fighting. However if you like a movie with more depth and stuff to think about this might not be the movie for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hate when you watch a film that not only feels like a waste of time but when you lament that time could have been spent elsewhere from watching a better film or cleaning the toilet. I knew not to expect an Ong Bak or a Chocolate. Also I recently enjoyed the Legend of the Tsunami Warrior which was not a great film but you can see the maturity of the Thailand popular cinema in terms of special effects and film techniques so I was curious on this film. Sometimes curiosity is dangerous.Many times when you are watching a martial arts film sometimes this goes with musicals as well you can forgive an inane plot idiotic characterizations and pretty much everything else if the fight scenes are sagacious. Usually when they are not it is because you are presented with actors andor choreographers who know nothing about showcasing the proper aesthetics and the artistic ability to convey the beauty that makes martial art cinema great. Sometimes like in this film the actors have the martial arts ability but it is the director editor and cinematographer that help make this film an irritable exercise in how long can you sit at a time while watching this before you change and watch something else. I can forgive the film quality which has the feel of a low budget TV movie. I cannot forgive besides the plot the elliptical editing the cinematography which seems to be done by a 300 pound exalcoholic after running a mile who is suffering delirium tremens and the soundtrack with exception of the cool Thai rap heard early in the film. Honestly I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish with the editing. Were they trying to outdo Michael Bay? The plot was not much better. Here we have Tai Preeti Barameeanat a criminal who was set free because of his twin brother's Tan's same actor cash contributions that left Tan in a coma. Tan was making money with the underground basketball game called Fireball. Tai takes his identity and gets back into the game to find out who was responsible for his brother's condition as well as try to make money to pay for an operation for his deteriorating brother. In the meantime he is falling for his brother's girlfriend. I like the idea of having an underground basketball game featuring Muay Thai and run by drug lords. But the execution of it could have been better. Allowing weapons to be used really made it silly and stupid. I know I should not be thinking but who would put themselves into that situation without much money or without having their family held hostage? Ultimately the best situation for this type of game where you win by scoring once or dispatching all of your opponents would be to hire very fast players who could score right off of a fast break even with individuals trying to beat you up since a good basketball player should be able to do a layupdunk even with two or three guarding and not getting hit. With full disclosure I am a basketball fan  I have no idea whether that would predispose my thinking one way or the other for this movie.One of the benefits of lower budget films is that much is done on location. You get to see a lot of city life and as a byproduct of the frenzied fight scenes I found myself enjoying the surroundings more it is usually a bad sign for a film when you start paying attention to things like background people possibly product placement and anything but what you are supposed to be focusing on. The attempt at creating a commentary on the socialeconomic conditions of these youths ultimately did not work because of a few plot threads that either made you to hate the drug lords yet put your sympathy on the one upcoming drug lord who recruited the protagonist and a few others who you get to see a bit of their daily lives.The Lionsgate release had no issues though it does seem that there are dubtitles  so there is an English dub along with this as well. Special Features include a trailer for the film additional Lionsgate trailers Wushu Death Warrior Four Dragons Bodyguard A New Beginning Never Surrender and a Behind The Scenes which lasts around 11m 44s. The Behind The Scenes is in Thai with intercut scenes of the movie in English dub and even has some outtakes and behind the scene footage where wires are shown. It has the director Thanakorn Pongsuwan talking about the origin of the story the plot of the film and choice of actors. Also featured are the producer Sangar Chatchairungruang can't believe he stated that goal of the film was creating fun the lead actors Preeti Barameeanat from Clash Band actor Sam Kasem Zing in real life he is a Thai boxer who fights in Japan and actor Arucha Tosawat Tun.".

	schema:headline " One of the most bizarre films out there";
	schema:reviewBody "Like everyone that has reviewed this film before me I am going to sing it's praises however unlike those before me I'm not quite sure why.  This film did everything it was supposed to do as a horror film.  It scared me in a few areas it was quite gory in others and it was easily one of the ten most quirky and bizarre films I have ever seen.  I can't tell you why anything transpires the way it does in here I can't even tell you why people do the things they do but I don't really think that is the point of the film. Like David Lynch's Mulholland Drive this is more of mind altering experience or a dream that just doesn't make any sense.  Perhaps this is a film that is esoteric by design and if that is the case then perhaps I should just watch it over and over again until I do have some sort of puerile grasp of it. Dictionary.com's definition of a phantasm is in Platonic philosophy objective reality as observed by the five senses.  Another definiton it gives is simply a notion.  And if you watch this film from beginning to end you will see why this makes all the sense in the world yet it is still an abstruse concept that is meant to be exactly what it is.The film begins with a funeral of one of Jody Bill Thornbury and Reggie's Reggie Bannister best friends.  Jody's little brother Mikey  A Michael Baldwin is a precocious kid who can't seem to stay in one place and follows his big brother everywhere he goes.  Hence he is at the funeral but is surreptitiously hiding out in the bushes.  As the funeral ends he sees the caretaker lift a casket all by himself and put it into his truck.  This is the nascency of the bizaare rituals that encompass the film. Michael decides to investigate the strange looking mansion where the cemetery rests.  Once he breaks into the house he is chased by some strange Jawa looking creatures and by a sphere that seems to come out of nowhere and drains your head of blood.  He does escape and finally gets his big brother to believe him when he says that things aren't quite right up at the Morningside Cemetery.  Now up until this point the film is quite linear. You have your classic setup a spooky looking mansion where the dead are taken and your typical stupid characters that do the traditional scary movie things like going to investigate a haunted house all by yourself gratuitous breast shots some eerie music and dark nights.  But that is where the title typical horror film ends and it crosses over into Rod Serling territory.  From here on out it just goes weird but in a goosebump inducing way that keeps you frozen in your seat.Don Coscarelli can take all of the praise andor blame for this eccentric film.  He wrote produced directed was the DP the editor and as another reviewer so aptly pointed out he probably swept the floors at night and fetched coffee for those on the set.  This is his incarnation.  I also happen to agree with other viewers that say that this film has one of the most haunting yet mellifluous scores which is on par with Carpenter's Halloween theme.  Both are intricate pieces to the presence of the film. Words like haunting eerie creepy and forbidding all come to mind when you hear the score.  It is also uncanny to see some of the similarities to A Nightmare On Elm Street and Phantasm.  Nightmare was a little more clear with what it was trying to say but both films have an overtly murky and dream like exploration into realms that many of us have yet to understand.The underlying theme in this film is the unsolved questions that plague many of us when we wonder what happens when you die.  Most of us believe that you go to Heaven or Hell.  But those are just theories.  And if theories are unproven then what is stop you from believing that this movie could really be the answer to those questions?  As the tag line for the film so poignantly points out If this one doesn't scare you you're already dead. What if all of this was true?  What if you could be stolen and made into something that you did not ask to become?  Who is the Tall Man and what is he doing here in our world?  One of the most harrowing yet well done plot pieces is when Mikey goes to the girl's house and finds an old picture of the Tall Man sitting on a horse carriage looking like it is circa 1776. This leaves the viewer ripe with questions.Phantasm will leave you with more questions than answers but I will say this about the film.  In a day and age where you get prosaic banal and myopic efforts like  take your pick of most of the horror that has graced our screens since the Scream and Blair Witch craze and you compare them to films like Halloween Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Phantasm you quickly realize that the 70's and early 80's was the genesis of the horror film.  I realize horror probably dates back to Nosferatu and it became respected with Psycho but to look at the films that were born in the 70's and 80's it's a veritable indefeasible list of some of the most revered and imitated horror films of all time.  Now that I have seen Phantasm I can easily see the mark it has left on other films.9 out of 10As I said I still can't tell you what this film is all about nor can I tell you what it all means or how it all ends all I can say is that it made me feel something strange with it's disingenuous stroke of the brush.  This is a film that absolutely demands a second and third viewing....which is what I am about to do right now.  BOY!!!!!!!".

And if you watch this film from beginning to end you will see why this makes all the sense in the world yet it is still an abstruse concept that is meant to be exactly what it is.The film begins with a funeral of one of Jody Bill Thornbury and Reggie's Reggie Bannister best friends.  Jody's little brother Mikey  A Michael Baldwin is a precocious kid who can't seem to stay in one place and follows his big brother everywhere he goes.  Hence he is at the funeral but is surreptitiously hiding out in the bushes.  As the funeral ends he sees the caretaker lift a casket all by himself and put it into his truck.  This is the nascency of the bizaare rituals that encompass the film. Michael decides to investigate the strange looking mansion where the cemetery rests.  Once he breaks into the house he is chased by some strange Jawa looking creatures and by a sphere that seems to come out of nowhere and drains your head of blood.  He does escape and finally gets his big brother to believe him when he says that things aren't quite right up at the Morningside Cemetery.  Now up until this point the film is quite linear. You have your classic setup a spooky looking mansion where the dead are taken and your typical stupid characters that do the traditional scary movie things like going to investigate a haunted house all by yourself gratuitous breast shots some eerie music and dark nights.  But that is where the title typical horror film ends and it crosses over into Rod Serling territory.  From here on out it just goes weird but in a goosebump inducing way that keeps you frozen in your seat.Don Coscarelli can take all of the praise andor blame for this eccentric film.  He wrote produced directed was the DP the editor and as another reviewer so aptly pointed out he probably swept the floors at night and fetched coffee for those on the set.  This is his incarnation.  I also happen to agree with other viewers that say that this film has one of the most haunting yet mellifluous scores which is on par with Carpenter's Halloween theme.  Both are intricate pieces to the presence of the film. Words like haunting eerie creepy and forbidding all come to mind when you hear the score.  It is also uncanny to see some of the similarities to A Nightmare On Elm Street and Phantasm.  Nightmare was a little more clear with what it was trying to say but both films have an overtly murky and dream like exploration into realms that many of us have yet to understand.The underlying theme in this film is the unsolved questions that plague many of us when we wonder what happens when you die.  Most of us believe that you go to Heaven or Hell.  But those are just theories.  And if theories are unproven then what is stop you from believing that this movie could really be the answer to those questions?  As the tag line for the film so poignantly points out If this one doesn't scare you you're already dead. What if all of this was true?  What if you could be stolen and made into something that you did not ask to become?  Who is the Tall Man and what is he doing here in our world?  One of the most harrowing yet well done plot pieces is when Mikey goes to the girl's house and finds an old picture of the Tall Man sitting on a horse carriage looking like it is circa 1776. This leaves the viewer ripe with questions.Phantasm will leave you with more questions than answers but I will say this about the film.  In a day and age where you get prosaic banal and myopic efforts like  take your pick of most of the horror that has graced our screens since the Scream and Blair Witch craze and you compare them to films like Halloween Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Phantasm you quickly realize that the 70's and early 80's was the genesis of the horror film.  I realize horror probably dates back to Nosferatu and it became respected with Psycho but to look at the films that were born in the 70's and 80's it's a veritable indefeasible list of some of the most revered and imitated horror films of all time.  Now that I have seen Phantasm I can easily see the mark it has left on other films.9 out of 10As I said I still can't tell you what this film is all about nor can I tell you what it all means or how it all ends all I can say is that it made me feel something strange with it's disingenuous stroke of the brush.  This is a film that absolutely demands a second and third viewing....which is what I am about to do right now.  BOY!!!!!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Phantasm is possibly my favourite film of all time.Why? It's not about the budget or the hype of a film but mainly about how this film makes me feel. Phantasm director Coscarelli crafted a little gem of a horror movie that has bought me more enjoyment than any major Hollywood film I can remember. I first saw Phantasm as a kid in the 80's and it has stuck with me ever since. It was great to rediscover this film on a beautifully mastered DVD.For me Phantasm combines a nightmarish quality that few horror movies achieve with a nostalgic trip back in time to the late 70's. The central theme is that of young Mike being abandoned by his brother Jody and overcoming his fears. The cryptic nature of the Tall Man's presence adds to the tension and Myrow's eerie soundtrack is the perfect finishing touch.Like a nightmare there is no explanation or attempt to pander to desires for a logical conclusion.  The little touches such as Jody and Reggie's jam session add to the homely feel of this movie  it's like a well worn pair of jeans. It's crystal clear that no studio executives were in the editing room at the last minute trying to turn Coscarelli's vision into another mediocre horror film . For the director this film was clearly a labor of love. Coscarelli is still an outsider from the Hollywood system. I am grateful that he hasn't been sucked into turning out mediocre movies for major studios but has stayed somewhat true to the original spirit of Phantasm.Many of the comments here on IMDB criticize the film for weak FX and poor acting. When viewed in the context of a genre film made by young industry outsiders for 300000 in 1979 I think the technical values are exceptional. Critics who claim otherwise have no idea of the work involved in the process of creating a movie especially before the advent of video.I've seen Hollywood blockbusters made for many millions of dollars with great technical values and yet I can't think of one that I can enjoy time and time again like this film. If you consider yourself a fan of horror movies you owe it to yourself to own this classic on DVD.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Phantasm is about a young teenager Mike who just recently lost his parents. He is worried about losing his older brother so he follows him everywhere including a funeral. While hiding in the bushes during the funeral Mike sees The Tall Man played by the creepy Angus Scrimm the man who runs the funeral home pick up a casket by himself. Mike begins spying on the man afterwards fascinated with uncovering the strange events surrounding the funeral home. While investigating Mike discovers a strange world within the walls of the mortuary including flying metal spheres with sharp arrows that drain the blood from your head and many other horrors. Turns out the Tall Man is from another dimension and is taking the bodies of the dead and reincarnating them in his world for slaves. Mike teams up with his older brother and the local ice cream man Reggie to stop the Tall Man's gruesome work.I remember my mother telling me about how much Phantasm scared her when she was a teenager and she rented it one day and I watched it along with her I was about nine or ten at the time and it was genuinely one of the most bizarre movies I've ever viewed. Written as well as directed by Don Coscarelli Phantasm has become something of a horror classic over the years and deservedly so. Coscarelli's writing here is so unique that it hurts. Everything in this film is surreal and dreamlike and the entire plot line is so out there that I can't think of another film that can quite compete in terms of strangeness. But despite it's strangeness this movie works in it's own weird little way. The script is solid and the characters are believable there are some reallife situations thrown in as well so there is some sort of viewercharacter connections that can be made even though about ninetynine percent of this film is something of pure fantasy. But it's quite a scary fantasy and that's for sure.There are many elements in this film that have become somewhat legendary among them being the murderous silver spheres and The Tall Man's Boyyyyy! line. The thing is among all of the randomness that is Phantasm this is quite a terrifying movie. A dense feeling of helplessness and foreboding is hiding in every scene and the cinematography and locations add to this quite a bit. The imagery is bizarre and often very spooky and the settings are perfect especially that creepy old funeral home. The viewers themselves are easily caught up in the engrossing story and the atmosphere is very scary. Michael Baldwin plays our lead hero well with Reggie Bannister as the ice cream man and Bill Thornbury as Mike's older brother Jody. And Angus Scrimm plays his signature role as The Tall Man and his presence alone makes this film scarier than most of it's genre. And then there's the score to the film which is equally as effective and just as chilling. The film concludes leaving many questions openended and unanswered but honestly  can you really expect genuine fulfilling answers when the movie itself is so strange? I think it's good that this film does leave some loose ends because it goes along with the movie's overall feel.Bottom line  I don't think this movie is for everyone and it might be just a little bit too weird for some. Honestly one of the strangest most outthere films I have ever seen but in my opinion that's a good thing. The story is strange but well crafted and the bizarre imagery and atmosphere make this a painfully unique scary experience. I can see why Phantasm has become such a classic of the genre. For me this film remains a nice little piece of spooky and original nostalgia and I'm glad my mom decided to scare the daylights out of me with it at such a young age because I grew to love this movie later on. 1010.".

With the help of his older brother Bill Thornberry the boy hopes to cut the tall man down to size.Many years later Don Coscarelli is now seen as a master of horror and Angus Scrimm somewhat of a horror icon though to a lesser degree than say Robert Englund. While the plot I have outlined above may sound silly the actual execution of this idea makes it clear why this film has really lodged itself in horror history and spawned numerous sequels all starring Scrimm.This film captures the feeling of the late 1970s and early 1980s horror with the young boy stumbling upon a plot of large sinister proportions. Horror geared towards the youth of a generation who have parents who may not believe them or in this case an older brother. I really like this theme much like The Goonies The Monster Squad and Lost Boys  a kid's film without being childish.Phantasm has become known for the silver balls and believe me  when Angus Scrimm puts one of his balls in your face you won't be happy about it. A bloody mess is all you will get! I really enjoyed the effect of this remember this is 1979 when effects still took some creativity. Some of the tricks they pull off are impressive considering computer technology of the day and also considering Coscarelli himself was writing and directing at the unthinkably young age of 23.Now some things I did not understand. For example why are the midgets bleeding macaroni and cheese instead of blood? And more importantly why does the tall man have to transform into a woman to stab people in the cemetery? If he is super strong and has those silver balls he really does not have to be very sneaky about the whole ordeal does he? But these are issues that can always be addressed in sequels.Some of the acting is cheesy  people deliver their lines in a way that sounds forced and Jody the older brother looks like he belongs behind the wheel of the General Lee. And Michael spends half the film looking like a girl. I have met the entire cast and I can assure you that Baldwin grew out of this phase.But seriously check this film out. Created roughly in the same time period as Halloween you are left with a similar feeling. Only this one is more lighthearted and feel good and less the embodiment of evil. I suppose it depends on your personal taste or your mood for the day. Myself I like a little bit of the unusual thrown in to a movie just to keep me guessing. And edging out Halloween this may be the longestrunning horror franchise running from 1979 through 2016 37 years!. Over the years Phantasm has been released in a variety of ways but I think the definitive release finally exists thanks to Well Go USA. I asked Coscarelli why he went with Well Go known for their martial arts movies rather than Arrow Video or Scream Factory and his answer was quite simple  they had the most enthusiasm. And they have put together a nice package too. The remastered Bluray looks sharp. WGN host and superphan Nick Digilio screened it in Chicago in August 2016 and audiences were shocked to see individual raindrops. The new scan is better than the original print. The disc also contains a vintage interview with Coscarelli and Scrimm circa 1979 and an episode of Graveyard Carz where Coscarelli and Baldwin drive around in a Barracuda tribute car.".

The film suffers from some hammed up acting classical 1970s character naivety makeshift and jimmyrigged special effects that don't quite work a score that might as well be a series of MIDI files and a plot that's all but coherent however Phantasm maintains a certain original charm and resourcefulness that larger budget films frequently lack.The above paragraph really isn't a complaint despite how it may sound. On the contrary I'm impressed with what director Don Coscarelli managed to accomplish with the hand dealt to him. Phantasm could have been an utterly forgettable film on all levels but instead he managed to leave a number of positive impressions.For one the frame composition and some key scene transitions transcend budgetary implications in particular the Tall Man in the cemetery and the Tall Man slowmotion shot by Reggie's ice cream truck come to mind. Fred Myrow also comes to the forefront with intriguing and memorable synthetic score. My only complaint on the music is the synthesizer it was performed on sounds like an old 80386 game. Still the notes played transcends the quality of the instrument it's played on. Phantasm's trademark bladed sphere effect however did genuinely bother me when they stuck into their victim's skulls. The fact that the soontobedead have no physical reaction after being slapped in the forehead with a fastball goes beyond my ability to suspend disbelief and to my dismay the effect has never been amended in later sequels. A simple flinch is all that's needed to sell the effect! Something tells me that the effect as it stands is part of the Phantasm trademark part of the Phantasm charm for the cult followers anyway and won't ever get a more realistic edge. Minor silly plot elements aside Jawa grave robbers anyone? my only major gripe deals with the sheer open endedness of the Phantasm universe vastly exploited in later sequels. Phantasm is not unlike a comic book where nothing that happens seems significant since a character can so easily wake up to another reality. Anarchy governs the Phantasm series no rules apply so reality fantasy and parallel universes coexist in such a fashion that nothing seems to matter anymore. It's like playing a game with Coscarelli in which we must abide by the rules he sets down and he sets the rules down as he goes when situations apply to him. Why bother playing? Why care?Still the film has its charms and there's something fun in the sinister eyebrow raising and growling Tall Man played effectively by Angus Scrimm. I'd caught bits of Phantasm 3 in the past and came into this film expecting to hate the Tall Man and this entire franchise yet I found myself grinning at each of his lines. I say if someone can look below a cheap and cheesy surface Phantasm is full of a pleasant surprises.".

	schema:headline " The Chrome Sphere is 70s classic";
	schema:reviewBody "There are two things that stand out in this film. The Tall Man played  by Angus Scrimm and the chrome sphere with hooklike blades that stick  out of it. Those are the two main elements when it comes to this horror  series directed by Don Coscarelli.  The Tall Man comes from another dimension where he takes some of the  earth's dead back to his home planet reincarnates them and turns them  into slaves for his world. He even occasionally murders some earth  people in order to speed things up. Why wait for them to get old and  die natural deaths. That would take too much time right? And what  better earth profession he can hide his identity behind than that of a  funeral parlor director.   Everything goes smoothly for the Tall Man until Mike Pearson Michael  Baldwin witnesses him carting a body away that's supposed to be buried  in the ground. At first his brother Jody Bill Thornbury doesn't  believe him but when Mike shows him a cutoff finger surrounded by  'yellow blood' in a little wooden box he had saved as proof Jody  starts to believe him.   Excellent scene of the chrome sphere zooming down the funeral parlor  hallway and 'accidentally' digging into the skull one of the Tall Man's  henchmen. A little screw appears out of it and starts to bore a hole  through his skull ejecting the excess blood out a hole in the back of  the sphere. I wish there was more of the sphere although we'll get to  see a lot more of it again in PHANTASM II 1988.  I also like the portal gateway scene where if you go through the two  chrome poles you'll get to see the Tall Man's alternative universe  where the slaves are busy carrying caskets down a stone pathway. We  even get to see Ice Cream Man Reggie Bannister almost get sucked  through it as well.  I won't give away the ending but let's just say the Tall Man is  temporarily disposed of until the next sequel comes out although the  dream element that's supposed to encompass the whole sequence of events  in the film is a big negative against it. In fact it brings it down a  notch unfortunately.  Even so I consider PHANTASM to be one of the best horror films of the  1970s. It managed to keep AvcoEmbassy in business so they could bring  us later horror stuff like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK 1980 THE FOG 1980  and DEAD AND BURIED 1981  The MGM DVD also has a lot more extras on it than you would expect from  other DVDs released by the same company including 8mm  behindthescenes footage of the making of PHANTASM a 1979 interview  down in Miami with director Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm an appearance  at a 1989 Fangoria convention by Scrimm and movie  TV trailers for  the film.   It's a labor of love by the truest fans of this film.   7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Phantasm an apparition of a ghostly appearing figure Simply put Phantasm is a visual nightmare transformed into a person's sketchy reality. The emphasis on sleeping and dreams is exactly the message it is getting at. With a perfect score and a quintessentially frighteningly written Horror villain 'The Tall Man' the only downfalls of Phantasm are its lack of quality acting script pacing and cheap 1970's horror clichs. In fact the acting and characters become so irritating it is the only element of Phantasm that takes it away from being considered a true Horror classic by most Horror buffs or maybe it's George Lucas' unauthorized use of Jawa's?.When one scans the Horror elite those films have pretty atrocious acting problems too so why should Phantasm fail so much? It shouldn't really because Phantasm is just as good as the classics. One of the reason why Phantasm is such a unique film is the well established characters unlike most Horror films whilst the acting is somewhat absent from the strongly written character it's still enough to redeem the awkwardly delivered lines odd facial expressions and comical snappy reactions. The films score is also perfect and mesmerizing that fits well by Fred Myrow it was in fact one of the most powerful elements of the movie that really had me engaged. The stunning visuals and the concept and imagery of The Tall Man wonderfully portrayed by Angus Scrimm are authentically creepy like something one would encounter in a nightmare. in fact I had a dream where I was in Hell and I encountered a priest that had been shrunk and dissected by a demon and this was before I saw Phantasm I know I would be pretty hysterical if The Tall Man was stalking me.It's these points of the film that for me makes Phantasm an atmospheric and creepy horror gem in fact it brings me back to when I was a five year old child in a video store in the 90's traumatized by the VHS covers for Hellraiser and The Blob only to eagerly await the day I was old enough to view them. Another reason why Phantasm's atmosphere works so well is the use of white and brightness instead darkness Phantasm's surreal mortuary is a nightmarish treat of white marble walls lined with drawers of the dead gaping large hallways and The Tall Man's shoes trudging along the tiles that make you feel he's going to jump out of the television screen. From the flying silver balls to the void to another dimension Phantasm's concept of a ghoulishly eerie tale about a soul keeper is wonderfully mastered and pulled off.No matter how jammed with 1970's horror clichs the use of the shoestring budget and surrealism incorporated into Phantasm makes it a pure Horror gem. It seems all the love goes to over rated films only because they're so talked about and not actually analysed. This movie has creeped me out more than any other Horror classic ever could now and I'm far from the age I was when I used to be scared those films. Phantasm is highly recommended to surrealist horror and cult fanatics.".

	schema:headline " I LOVE this movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember staying up late to watch this movie on TV when I was a kid.  It scared the hell out of me.  Then for 15 years I forgot all about it. Recently I found a 5 VHS copy in the discount bin of my local drugstore and thought What the hell?  That was the best 5 I ever spent.Phantasm may not make a lot of sense the story is confusing and seems to have been made up as it went along but that's kind of the point.  It's like watching someone else's fever dream...and that's exactly what it's supposed to be like because it IS someone else's fever dream.  Phantasm is a classic nightmare totally unpredictable claustrophobic paranoid and frightening.13 year old Michael Baldwin was perfect as the young protagonist an amazingly refreshing unannoying child actor.  I was totally convinced by his performance as the lonely teen desperately chasing after his older brother and displaying just the right amounts of anger confusion and frustration yet never giving in to panic even as his world spins out of control.  Bill Thornbury as older brother Jody seemed mysteriously detached yet after repeated viewings I realized how correct this was in light of the twist ending.  He is indeed a ghost that Michael simply refuses to give up.  Reggie Bannister was completely irresistible as the sweet and gentlemanly Reggie the Ice Cream Man who manages to remain innocent and lovable even as he suggests ramming a stake through the Tall Mans heart. And the Tall Man Mr. Angus Scrimm himself...BRRRRR!!!  He doesn't have many lines other than the nowinfamous BOYYYYYYY! but he doesn't need any. His very presence is chilling and the scene where he stops dead in the middle of a suburban sidewalk in the middle of the day and turns ever so slowly to face Michael through a mist of frost emanating from Reggie's ice cream truck is more frightening than any murder scene set in the dead of night.  And need I mention the flying balls?  What an original ingenious invention!  This is such an amazing blend of scifi horror and fantasy that I really did not care if it didn't make a whole lot of sense.  The flying balls the dwarves the yellow blood and THAT FLY IN THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL!!! Wow.  If nothing else you simply have to give this film and its makers credit for originality. After watching my 5 discount bin copy enough times to remember what a GREAT little movie this is I went right out and bought the special edition DVD.  More money very well spent.".

	onyx:emotionText "I remember staying up late to watch this movie on TV when I was a kid.  It scared the hell out of me.  Then for 15 years I forgot all about it. Recently I found a 5 VHS copy in the discount bin of my local drugstore and thought What the hell?  That was the best 5 I ever spent.Phantasm may not make a lot of sense the story is confusing and seems to have been made up as it went along but that's kind of the point.  It's like watching someone else's fever dream...and that's exactly what it's supposed to be like because it IS someone else's fever dream.  Phantasm is a classic nightmare totally unpredictable claustrophobic paranoid and frightening.13 year old Michael Baldwin was perfect as the young protagonist an amazingly refreshing unannoying child actor.  I was totally convinced by his performance as the lonely teen desperately chasing after his older brother and displaying just the right amounts of anger confusion and frustration yet never giving in to panic even as his world spins out of control.  Bill Thornbury as older brother Jody seemed mysteriously detached yet after repeated viewings I realized how correct this was in light of the twist ending.  He is indeed a ghost that Michael simply refuses to give up.  Reggie Bannister was completely irresistible as the sweet and gentlemanly Reggie the Ice Cream Man who manages to remain innocent and lovable even as he suggests ramming a stake through the Tall Mans heart. And the Tall Man Mr. Angus Scrimm himself...BRRRRR!!!  He doesn't have many lines other than the nowinfamous BOYYYYYYY! but he doesn't need any. His very presence is chilling and the scene where he stops dead in the middle of a suburban sidewalk in the middle of the day and turns ever so slowly to face Michael through a mist of frost emanating from Reggie's ice cream truck is more frightening than any murder scene set in the dead of night.

	schema:reviewBody "Phantasm had a lot of potential. The premise is scary two kids fighting a wicked mortician and his evil drones. Unfortunately this lowbudget horror outing that spawned incredibly two more sequels is way too confusing to be frightening. I watched as characters disappeared for long stretches before reappearing for no good reason. People die then are miraculously alive again in the next scene. Some characters are evil then good then evil again. Not to mention it's all directed so that the action zooms along at a brisk pace not bothering to explain anything. All in all the movie inspires more headaches than fear. The film focuses on two uninteresting kids who investigate weird goings on at the local mortuary where their deceased friend was just buried. They come upon the Tall Man an evil fellow who kills people with flying silver spheres and turns corpses into his zombie minions. Most of the film has the Tall Man chasing the younger boy around after the kid learns of his secrets.As lowbudget horror movies go I've seen far worse. Phantasm is imaginative if nothing else and has some memorable scenes the first appearance of the flying orb is great but in order to scare people you must have coherency. Phantasm plays like the filmmakers know everything that's going on but they feel like keeping the viewer in the dark.".

In fact some of the plot holes that a bigger budget would have filled in actually work in the movie's favor. By not really understanding who the Tall Man is or why he does what he does Phantasm assumes enigmatic dimensions that practically beg for explanation through further sequels. Coscarelli who I think is planning yet another sequel in this franchise has also made a few other films over the years the recent Bubba Hotep and the ubiquitous cable favorite The Beastmaster are the most memorable.Reggie Jody and Jody's younger brother Mike soon learn strange things are afoot at the Morningside Funeral Home. After a funeral service for a friend of Reggie and Jody Mike sees the eerie undertaker at the funeral home heave a three hundred pound casket in the back of a hearse all by himself. Intrigued Mike begins to investigate the funeral home and this puzzling figure fondly known to fans of the series as the Tall Man and unearths a whole heap of weirdness. Before long Jody and Reggie get caught up in the madness of the Tall Man's world. What they discover behind the walls of the funeral home is a nightmare of endless dangers twisted angry little creatures clad in robes a portal to another dimension and small flying spheres that seek out human flesh with disastrous and bloody results. As the three attempt to put together the odd pieces of this puzzle the Tall Man and his minions always lurk in the background ready to do serious bodily injury to the interlopers. What Reggie Mike and Jody discover is hardly reassuring the Tall Man is some sort of other dimensional being roaming our world in search of corpses. He then reanimates the bodies and transforms them into stunted little creatures so he can transport them into his dimension. Why does he do this? Who knows but it is fun watching our three heroes battle the Tall Man in this film and the subsequent sequels.One of the best elements of Phantasm is the characters. You have the Tall Man Angus Scrimm a lumbering giant of a man dressed all in black and sporting a perpetual scowl. He delivers his lines of which there are few in this movie but more in subsequent films in a growling tone full of dark menace. Scrimm is creepy as the Tall Man and I think this character may well be one of my favorite horror film bad guys. The actors who play Reggie Jody and Mike appear in all of the sequels with a minor switch in two an important continuity because it gives the Phantasm franchise a real contained universe feel lacking in most horror series. It was fun for me to watch the original film after seeing the later sequels because the guys are so much younger here. Jody sports a '70's coif that would do Starsky and Hutch proud and Reggie looks so young that it is almost frightening.Phantasm films always contain elements that make for a great downbeat atmosphere. The music is absolutely fantastic and if I had to compare the background beats of Phantasm with the sound of another horror film it would have to be something along the lines of Kubrick's The Shining. The movie sounds creepy and when matched with the mostly shot at night scenes and the wickedly gory rampages of those metallic spheres the whole film takes on a most memorable feel. Coscarelli does not rely solely on gripping horror however as there are many humorous scenes throughout the film. The scene where Mike and Jody do battle with the severed finger is one of the funniest I have seen in a horror movie. Even the fake looking bug and the gruesome little minions of the Tall Man are amusing in their own right.If you want to buy just one DVD because of the extras you should get Phantasm if you can track down a copyit's gone OOP now. I couldn't believe how much stuff they packed on one disc! You get lengthy deleted scenes a commentary with Coscarelli and the film's actors a long interview with Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm made years ago with some film professor a short film of an appearance Angus Scrimm made at a horror convention trailers a disco version of the theme song ! poster and lobby card pictures a kooky promotional ad made by Angus Scrimm for the Australian market and a widescreen picture transfer. I especially enjoyed the footage of Scrimm speaking at a horror film convention. Even though it was a bit corny he quickly ran through all of the lines the Tall Man said in the Phantasm films and since most of his dialogue in these movies is so memorable it was great to hear him say them in character. Overall it felt like it took longer to view all of the extras on this disc than it did to watch the film! If you haven't delved into the dark world of Phantasm start here and rapidly move on to the excellent sequels.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as horror films go Phantasm is a film with much on its mind. It is at once an elegiac meditation on life and death a poignant story of a boy on the verge of manhood while also serving as a macabre funhouse ride bouncing recklessly between reality and the dreamworld offering a robust mythology encompassing alternate dimensions zombie dwarfs and most iconically flying silver spheres that drill into the brains of their victims.The story is set in small town America circa the late 1970s and focuses on two young men 13yearold Michael and his older brother Jody in the wake of the tragic death of their parents. Jody has taken a break from his exciting life as a musician on the road to take care of his little brother who idolizes Jody to the point of following him around town in the fear that he will one day abandon him as their parents did. Michael's constant surveillance of his brother leads him to Morningside Cemetery where Jody attends a friend's funeral after which Michael witnesses Morningside's enigmatic undertaker known only as the Tall Man scoop up the 200pound casket in his arms toss it back into the hearse and drive off leaving an empty grave. From there the film's focus turns to Michael's investigation of Morningside eventually uncovering the Tall Man's fiendish plot to wipe out the entire town in order to resurrect their corpses as demonic dwarfs and use them as servants in his evergrowing army of the undead.The loss of liberty characterized by enslavement and brainwashing is the central issue in the film. Those unlucky enough to be buried in a Morningside Cemetery plot are dug up by the Tall Man shrunk down to dwarfs and resurrected only to serve for all eternity as the mindless minions under his control tasked with furthering his reign of terror and harvesting more cadavers for his army of ghouls. It is no coincidence that the Morningside Funeral Home greatly resembles a Southern plantation the shooting location was the historic Dunsmuir estate in Oakland just as the Tall Man is dressed impeccably as a Southern gentleman of considerable means for the character is playing the role of slavemaster and his dwarfs gravediggers and murderous spheres are his slaves.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Phantasm' has always been close to me and I don't remember a single week I lived without it. What make 'Phantasm' different are slow offthetone and sometimes absolutely fast nightmarish sequences that kill the crap out of you. The film is remembered as a cultclassic now and there is a fairly good reason behind it. After watching this film you'd feel like you'd just lived a nightmare to the fullest. The 'Tall Man' is one of the most haunting villains one would ever wish to see for real. Don Coscarelli is a great craftsman who has the ability to get down to the subconscious levels and explore the underlying fears of the human mind. It's been more than 30 years now since its release but it holds a charisma that wouldn't fade with time. This truly is nondegradable.The film begins with Morningside cemetery where Tommy is busy making love with a vampiric blonde. Moments later the scantily clad blonde transforms to a vicious looking old man The Tall Man Angus Scrimm. The Tall Man kills Tommy and we soon land at his funeral. Jody Bill Thornbury and Reggie Reggie Bannister are friends and members of a band. They are here because Tommy was their friend and a band member. Jody's brother Mike Michael Baldwin is prejudiced with a thought that Jody would abandon him in near future. Long back after the demise of their parents Mike was looked after by Jody. Mike doesn't want to lose Jody but his fears torment him. He sneakingly follows Jody and Reggie at the funeral and notices something strange at the Morningside. He also gets a glimpse of the unholy undertaker of the cemetery. The Tall Man takes Tommy's dead body back to his hearse after the attendees leave. Mike wants to find cure for his trauma and seeks help of a local fortune teller who asks him to give up his fears regarding Jody. Mike is followed by ghoulish dwarfs who are after him for no apparent reason or this is what Mike thinks. Jody disregards Mike's strange story about the Tall Man. Agitated by the belief that his fears are not baseless Mike heads to the cemetery. There he is chased by the Tall Man and his henchmen satanic spheres and ugly dwarfs. During the fracas the Tall Man happens to cut his finger that squirts yellow goo instead of blood. Mike takes the finger along and shows it to Jody as evidence. Jody Reggie and Mike join hands to finish the Tall Man and his minions. They eventually discover that the Tall Man is an interdimensional being who has a portal to his own scorching and hellish world at the Morningside cemetery. The Tall Man harvests townspeople and enslaves them by transforming them into dwarfs. Everything goes on surreptitiously until our men decide to have their final showdown with the Tall Man.'Phantasm' is more like a dream than a movie. You must have dreamed something bizarre at least once in your life and 'Phantasm' is the same eccentric trip to the unknown depths of metaphysics. Don Coscarelli has made use of heavy symbolism to show the nihilistic worth of a matter or incident. The disappearance of money and magic box gloomy mortuary setup silence prevailing inside the mausoleum the dwarfs and their journey to other dimension and finally the angel of death in disguise 'The Tall Man' are all symbolic. Mike is a victim of his own fear the death itself. He believes Jody would leave him someday but Jody as Reggie tells Mike had already died in a car crash. Was Mike unable to accept Jody's death due to inherent attachment with his brother? Did Jody already die before these bizarre incidents? We can't really know and neither could anyone. This freaky ride is enough to create a long lasting terror as 'Phantasm' is more like a doorway between the two worlds. The first world is our own mundane world which we can see and perceive while the other world is located in a different dimension which has its own laws and regulations but certainly all the otherworldly incidents and beings can neither be understood nor analyzed with rational eyes. 'Phantasm' has been crafted with a nonnoetic expertise and we should remember that it all started in our own world. 'Phantasm' qualifies itself to be a perfect cult flick with one of the greatest atmospheres and vivid representations of death. The 'Phantasm' sequels were loosely aligned with the main story where the Tall Man has been depicted as an evil force that misuses the powers solely for diabolic purposes. This film offers a great combination of 'Body Jody Reggie and Mike Mind The Tall Man is actually the personification of fear and death and Soul the dwarfs who are condemned to the hell forever. Don't even think about missing this film because this would sure have a great impact on you and would give you a deeper insight about the real horror that always stalks and ambushes life.......The Death! So.....Your Funeral May Begin Anytime Sir!".

For lovers of eccentric training routines there's no need to worry the wooden men are out in force and the weasel with the glasses and the crap voice makes his presence well and truly felt. If you're a kung fu fan and haven't run into this one yet this is the business up there with Prodigal Son.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sammo Hung's classic 'Warriors Two' features Korean superkicker Casanova Wong in his biggest role as Cashier Hua the 'Zhao Qian Hua' of the title who works in the bank run by Banker Mo Fung HarkOn. One evening just as he was about to pack up for the day he inadvertently hears a discussion between Mo and some of his other employees where he plots to take over the whole town and become the new Village Head by disposing of the current one.Hua tries to warn the Village Head but instead falls into a trap where some of Mo's henchmen beat him up quite badly. But Hua escapes albeit seriously injured and bumps into Fei Chun Sammo Hung who hides Hua in the home of his master Mr Leung Tsang the 'Zan Xian Sheng' of the title played by Leung KarYan a Wing Chun master and healer.Mo and his cronies go about trying to lure Hua out of hiding by murdering his last remaining family member in Chinese customs of the period it was traditional to avenge the deaths of murdered friends or family  something exploited in a lot of the period kungfu movies of this era but Fei Chun eventually makes Hua see sense that he doesn't stand a chance of avenging death as his fighting skills aren't good enough. That's where Mr Tsang comes in  but Hua's quest for revenge makes Tsang reticent about teaching Wing Chun to him as kungfu like all martial arts is not supposed to be used aggressively. Will Fei Chun be able to make Tsang capitulate and become his Sifu?This movie was where Sammo's early promise as director and action choreographer shown in his directorial debut 'IronFisted Monk' comes to the fore as he steps up the quality of the fight choreography and overall structure of the film and came up with a true masterpiece. Sammo's ability to choreograph the performers in such a way that they come across as powerful as they would ever look onscreen is something that fans of his work are used to even his former Peking Opera classmate Jackie Chan has benefited from Sammo's excellent choreographic genius and 'Warriors Two' is no exception with some superbly crisp fights that contain shots where fighters perform well over ten carefullytimed moves before a cut occurs! But what's most amazing is that Sammo has actually managed to transfer Wing Chun to the screen successfully some arts don't translate that well to the screen without some minor changes due to the limitations of film  something that Hong Kong filmmakers especially those of Sammo's ability have acknowledged over the years and allowed for accordingly and has actually depicted Wing Chun very accurately in a way that you would appreciate even if you're not a dedicated martial artist.Casanova Wong's acting ability is a bit limited but in my mind is not enough to completely hamper the film as a whole and his kicking combined with the hand techniques his character would learn throughout the movie is superb. The bit most people talk about is his amazing jumpspinning back kick over a table in one shot! which even I rewind and watch again and again!As Banker Mo Fung HarkOn gives what I believe to be his best badguy role outside of Jackie Chan's 'Police Story' 1985 with a menace he never really matched again. His character even provides a bit of a twist at the end!'Warriors Two' features an allstar cast including Eric Tsang who would appear as Roundhead in the 'Lucky Stars' series Lau KarWing Liu ChiaYong he's the reallife brother of Liu ChiaLiang Fung HarkOn the late Lam ChingYing Yuen Biao who would later cochoreograph the action in 'Shanghai Noon' Mang Hoi a.k.a. Randy Mang! Dean Shek... Oh and let's not forget Lee HoiSan as seeminglyinvincible Iron Bell fighter Ya Chao!Being a Sammo film there are also some moments of broad comedy some of it dark but it works within the film and was still fairly unfamiliar in Hong Kong movies in 1978.Mark my words 'Warriors Two' is a castiron classic. It doesn't QUITE have the polish of Sammo's other Wing Chun movie 'The Prodigal Son' 1983 but it's still an enjoyable film in its own right and is different enough from the other kungfu movies out there to help it stand out and it still looks wonderful all these years later.".

Once the fight scenes start happening this movie doesn't let up much just constant people beating the sht out of each other its pretty awesome. The fight styles and whatnot are badass as expected the acting good the stuntwork is great cinematography isn't that bad either.

The earmarks of the style developed at Shaw studios include heavy use of elaborate soundstage exteriors very steady camerawork with occasional handheld closeups for effect a particularly atmospheric lighting that nonetheless emphasized primary colors. A particular aspect of Shaw narrative style is that the villain would usually be either of aristocratic stock or would have certain aristocratic qualities that would make him admirable if he weren't so greedy or power hungry. The Shaw heroes were always remarkably virtuous and usually had a sidekick as noble and sometimes as skilled. The typical Shaw film involved an elder sometimes of aristocratic background sometimes simply aristocratic in quality and usually wellknown as a martialarts master unfortunately this elder is always doomed to be the villain's chief victim thus setting the heroes out on their quest for revenge.All these elements are here  every last one  and accomplished with a high quality professional finesse. with this film Hung demonstrated his command of the medium as Hong Kong film audiences understood it according to the highest standards held for it at the time. And of course it must be admitted that the film is riproaring fun for any real fan of the martialarts genre.Not necessarily a classic but certainly looks as good as one!".

The Praying Mantis defies gravity.If not for the fact that Sammo Hung managed to ruin a lot of this film with comic reliefs this would have been a 1010 movie.";

	schema:headline " Drew Barrymore at the lowest point in her career...";
	schema:reviewBody "Drew Barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods not only in her career but in her personal life too. After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality. While she has recovered from that dark past this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days.The movie starts with an interesting premise very reminiscent to Brian De Palma's Raising Cain with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horrorthriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother.Suddenly her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love. In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend Patrick Highsmith George Newbern will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past.Unlike De Palma's underrated thriller Doppelganger is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it's purpose it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance. The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad overthetop performances although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them.The script is full of clichs and De Palma's influence is quite obvious. While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn't do any good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effects.The makeup effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie. However the bizarre overuse of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing.The fact that this is a BMovie is no excuse for it's low quality as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie. Sadly all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second. Worthy for Barrymore's beauty. 310".

While she has recovered from that dark past this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days.The movie starts with an interesting premise very reminiscent to Brian De Palma's Raising Cain with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horrorthriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother.Suddenly her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love. In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend Patrick Highsmith George Newbern will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past.Unlike De Palma's underrated thriller Doppelganger is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it's purpose it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance. The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad overthetop performances although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them.The script is full of clichs and De Palma's influence is quite obvious. While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn't do any good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effects.The makeup effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie. However the bizarre overuse of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing.The fact that this is a BMovie is no excuse for it's low quality as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie. Sadly all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second. Worthy for Barrymore's beauty. 310";

Leslie Hope's character is memorable but so irritating that you will want to forget her.The plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated one story arc is psychological realism the other is supernatural horror outlandish climax which is so badly conceived acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously.Overall the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan's first undergraduate film class. The acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them  at least until the film derails utterly and completely.My recommendation  send your doppelganger but avoid a firstperson encounter.".

There is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy.The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly don't understand it.

	schema:reviewBody "Doppelganger The Evil Within is a watchable if slightly disappointing affair.SPOILERSMoving to Los Angeles Holly Gooding Drew Barrymore takes a roommate position with Patrick Highsmith George Newbern an aspiring writer. When he makes mention of seeing her around town without recognizing him she immediately recognizes the danger and secretly calls Doctor Heller Dennis Christopher her old psychiatrist about the problem. She starts bringing him along as she investigates her past and reveals that she has a doppelganger a ghostly twin that is haunting her and has confused each other. Deciding to stay roommates she starts to become haunted by the visions of the doppelganger and she slowly starts to loose her grip on reality. When she is soon accused in a vicious murder spree her friends start to work together to get her off the hook before the doppelganger is exposed to the wrong authorities.The Good News This is a minor disappointment but it does have some good points in it. One of the main points is that it's weirdness is compelling instead of annoying. The film is filled with all sorts of images such as the continuous times the sunglassesclad Drew doppelganger is seen standing in the window of the deserted mansion or outside a caf and the eerie scene where the hero follows her into a culvert that add a genuine weirdness. Then there is the everso headspinning moment where he spends the night with her only to be told in the morning that they didn't do anything and they can do all the dirty things you want together and warns him to don't confuse the two. This is quite surreal and really works to see the film. It's also filled with some great jolt surprises. The moment where the FBI agent is revealed to be not who he is and the everso mindboggling moment where just about every character in the film is revealed to be a mannequin in the mansion are just some of them. There's practically no shortage of them in the film and those are the best ones. There are all sorts of surreal dream sequences where she's taking showers in blood or the hero entering the apartment to find it trashed her crucified to the wall and the doppelganger coming after him with a knife that really sticks in the mind for good reason. The last ten minutes inside the church where all the revelations occur is quite fun and overthetop resulting in some spectacular special effects and a lot of gore really sending this out on a high note. Even though it has nothing to do with the plot there are several times we see the heroine's breasts first the scene where the they takes in a shower scene where the nozzle starts spraying blood spraying all over her naked flesh while her breasts bounce up and down in slow motion and then in a sex scene with the hero. It's nice and sleazy which does help out. These help to make the film watchable.The Bad News This here is a disappointment and there are several reasons for this. There's a large amount of just deathly dull scenes in here that grind the pace of the film down substantially in the second half. The first half is where most of it's good parts come from there and it just drags out until the ending and is filled with scenes that go on and on without getting to any conclusion. This makes the ending half of the film incredibly slow and dull. By not even having a real lot of action scenes in there in that section it's rendered even more of a distressing series of events. When it's not being dull it's being confusing. Most of this is a result of the heroine. She has some sort of spells at times which makes it seem like she is being possessed. In those scenes shots of trees are shown for some reason. I have no clue why those shots are in the movie. The trees seem to be spinning around in those shots and they did make me a little dizzy. Beyond that there is something that isn't really resolved in the movie. Just what is going on with Holly? Did she have a doppelganger? A split personality? Was she being possessed? Was she really a killer pretending to have some kind of mental problem to get away with her crimes? All of these are brought up and certainly plausible and while some things are explained near the end of the movie the fact that there is a lot still unsure of and that is quite hard to get away with. These are big problems in the film and really lower the film despite their not being a lot of problems with it.The Final Verdict It's a real disappointment especially as it's got potential and a couple good moments but the majority of the time this is a really dull film. If it sounds like something which has entertainment value then seek it out but it won't change you're world if it's skipped.Rated R Graphic Language Violence and Brief Nudity".

They're barely scraping by. And then they visit Santa Maria where the local tough The Turk is no push over. His betrothed is desperate for him to win enough for their wedding. Antonella Costa as The Turk's intended Adriana is every bit as skillful and unforgettable as the two main leads and in some ways the whole film rests on her performance.This is a real find which I intend to pass on to others whenever I get the chance. It's not flashy or grandiose but it nevertheless is totally affecting. I marveled at how effortlessly it was played out almost as if everyone involved were born to play their part.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Day to Go Fishing 2009What a terrific movie. It's filled with a slightly improbable likable colorful quality you have to watch even if you don't quite care. But you do eventually care. You want these quirky main characters to somehow succeed. Even if you don't know how they can do that.It's set in South America but in an unanchored place called Santa Maria. Could be anywhere but much of the filming took place in Uruguay. The main two characters are a pair of scam artists with good hearts and somewhat simple methods. One is an impresario with a flair for convincing people of things. The other is an aging wrestling champion from Germany of all placesthis is Uruguay right?. And so the two of them enter this town with their usual plan.Except that their method of having a show and winning a finale matchoff with a local big man wrestler gets off track when the challenger is a seriously huge and buff young man. And he can't be bought off.This is enough but it hardly does justice to the huge array of really convincing and slightly exaggerated figures. There is the newspaper man wise and quickly savvy to what's going on but willing to let it unfold on its own. There is the first challenger who turns out to be perfect and a drunk. There is the woman who wants to get married above all and needs the money. There is the town itself filled with nostalgiait feels like it's set in 1970 maybe with old cars and old ways and no cell phones or modern connections that might change the feel of it all. There is the idea of a strong man and wrestler in the first place played by a rather woeful drunk himself. And there is the impresario played brilliantly by Gary Piquer. He holds it all together sad and wickedly charming and seemingly intelligent. He seems to have a good heart and yet he's scamming the town. And maybe at times leading on his main attraction who also is his best and only friend.In fact this becomes more and more a movie about the relationship the two traveling men have together. It takes a turn convincing and emotionally satisfying at the end. There are shades in the most abstract way of how the two leads related in Midnight Cowboy so that it's not the circumstances that win the day but these two flawed and beautifully interesting people.This movie took me by surprise. I'm not sure why it gets so many low ratings. My suggestion is to go into it without expectations and to let the characters slowly build. And to enjoy the scenesthe set design old cars and general lost in time quality is great all by itself.This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. Give it shot!".

Wrong. They do not make a good living. They are living a precarious existence. Jacob a shadow of his former self and Orsini a conman who does not even have the 'mil dolares' to back up and finance his bets. They are leading a terrible life are both alcoholics and both know it. Orsini is a selfdescribed Italian Prince but no one dare ask what he is doing taking seedy bus trips promoting a washedup wrestler all over South and Central America.In any case it's an excellent film. Jacob has become brain damaged from his years of wrestling and self abuse he has reverted back to the mental state of a child. Not only that he is bipolar or has other mental issues which he takes medication for. As if that were not sad enough Jacob also has some serious health issues. Although it has many comedic moments it is nonetheless a sad film. It takes place in a fictional backwater town in Uruguay in 1962. The acting and cinematography are all top notch. Jacob is somewhat devastated when he finds out the Orsini has been fixing matches for him and handpicking opponents that insure Jacob wins the matches every time. The ending is brilliant and everything leads up to the final match at the end where due to events in the town of Santa maria Jacob must face a very tough opponent.".

The strong writing and acting create characters that are believable and richly developed with subtlety and detail but are not at all transparent. The viewer is invited into their experience yet still kept somewhat at a distance. What is innermost remains inaccessible as events unfold and build toward a climax. The film strikes a nice balance between character study and suspense. There is a simple plot  the film does more that just paint a picture though that aspect in itself would be enough to make this a decent film.The visual elements serve the story very well  dark colors support the emotional content perfectly. The world that is portrayed is not glamorous but livedin and decadent. Two very different perspectives are evident in the film  the feeling of life on the road for the wrestler and his manager and the poverty and boredom of the local people. Excellent costuming also helps define the characters and their environment.This film succeeds where many others that build toward a single event fail  it creates an emotional investment for the viewer  but one that may be ambiguous. Ultimately the characters are somewhat ambiguous themselves  but not due to any concealment on the part of the filmmaker. The characters simply are that way. We can't penetrate them or know their inner motives.The film makes a point  but it is far too subtle and enjoyable to be called a message film. The point is that events are easily understood  people aren't.".

	schema:reviewBody "An aging European wrestler Jacob Van Oppen has seen better days. We find him with Prince Orsini a seedy promoter as they come into a small Uruguayan town. Orsini who claims he comes from a noble Italian family is an unscrupulous wheelerdealer who operates on the premise that a sucker is born every day. He wants to stage an event in which Jacob will fight anyone for a prize of one thousand dollars if Jacob loses.In order to create interest in the fight Orsini goes to the local newspaper where the editor is sympathetic to the idea of a challenge. His paper serves to generate hype for the event which will take place at the local theater on a Saturday. Orsini realizing his wrestler is in bad shape tries to get a local man to go through the motions and let Jacob win. The scheme backfires on him when the man proceeds to get drunk with the money he got for the bribe. There is someone that is really interested in getting the prize money. She is Adriana a woman that figures her strong companion Turco will defeat Jacob. Adriana figures her man is younger stronger and in better shape than the European. At the same time she has her doubts Prince Orsini is on the level. She wants to see the money before the thing gets out of hand.Orsini who has no means to pay anything counts on the proceeds from the gate to make some money. Not content with that he decides to try his hand at gambling at the local tavern a poor choice as it turns out he loses what he had. Trying to appeal to Jacob to skip town on an early bus has the opposite effect. Jacob's pride is hurt he wants to fight plus unknown to his manager he has the funds to pay off if he loses.Director Alvaro Brechner's first full length film surprises by showing a fine style and by infusing the story with the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested in the amazing finale. The director adapted Juan Carlos Onetti Jacobo y el otro with some help from its star Gary Piquer. The result is one of the most satisfying films that have come from Uruguay in recent memory. Mr. Brechner involves the audience without any tricks or superfluous incidents in the narrative. The film is original in that it does not rely in tried formulas despite the fact one has an idea how it will play at the end.An intense Gary Piquer whose resemblance to American actor Harvey Keitel is remarkable steals the film and makes it his own. The actor does not have a false moment he is that reptilian person living from the faded glory of a man that is no longer in his prime. Mr. Piquer is perfect as the man without scruples who will stop at nothing to get what he wants while sucking out the life of a man that is no longer what he was. Others in the film include Jouko Ahola a Finnish actor that does great work for the director. Same can be said about Antonella Costa's Adriana the calculating woman who does not care about what happens to her man.Alvaro Brechner shows a great talent and one wishes him to go far in his future endeavors.".

This is the story of a washedout champ with Hemmingway it is usually a bullfighter here it is a wrestler who's way past his prime and just doesn't know when to quit. But he is not so over the hill that he can't be used by someone  in this case a con man calling himself Prince Orsini. Orsini takes the pathetic think washing in public fountains and wailing loudly in churches exathlete on a tour of South America. They go from town to town where Orsini offers a 1000 reward to anyone who could last 3 minutes in the ring with the champ. Then he normally bribes the local strongman to accept the challenge and throw the fight and of course charges everyone in town for admittance. But in the town of Santa Maria the duo lucks out the local strongman turns out to be not only very strong but also very honest he won't accept a bribe. Orsini afraid of losing both the reward money and his champ to boot leaves no stone unturned in an attempt to get out of the fight. I won't give away the ending but it very well done  one of the best most satisfying endings in any movie I've ever seen. In all this is a masterpiece with many comedy moments and an excellent character development. You don't have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy I'm not and you won't be able to help reflecting on the fact that all of us will one day be past our prime.".

It has no pretense and is gritty and wonderful with a striking dose of pathos...transports you to someplace possibly existent yet strangely off the beaten trail. Acting and casting are superb. On the surface it's a story about a friendship which you suspect is a condition of exploitation but as it plays out you become aware it's about true friendship and a condition of brotherhood between a manager and his aging athlete. It's also about the indomitable spirit of a contender no matter how far he's fallen from grace. It's about life love despair con men and the human spirit. Don't miss this film ".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of A word of warning before the review I highly recommend Retroactive and suggest you go out of your way to see it in widescreen because the numerous action scenes and breathtaking desert cinematography are cramped and a pain to watch in panandscan.Relegated to a straighttovideo release Retroactive is a smart and entertaining thriller that deserves a wider audience. The film features a relatively simple but clever premise Superhottie Kylie Travis stars as Karen Warren a police negotiator who's on vacation in Texas. She gets into a car accident and has to hitchhike with a somewhat odd but seemingly friendly couple Frank and Rayanne James Belushi and Shannon Whirry. But everything goes horribly wrong when Frank discovers Rayanne has been cheating on him and he murders her right in front of Karen's eyes who proceeds to run to the nearest building a governmentowned complex run by a single occupant a scientist named Brian Frank Whaley. There he accidentally activates the time travel device he was working on sending Karen back twenty minutes just as she's been picked up by Frank. She then becomes determined to stop the horrible crime for occurring but unfortunately the body count grows even larger and she must go back again to prevent an even larger massacre.Retroactive's appeal holds mainly to scifi action fans. The plot has a lot of twists and turns which keeps the film unpredictable and suspenseful. But the real treat is for action fans who should strap in for an adrenalinepumping thrill ride. From the moment Travis is sent back in time the film deliver nonstop excitement. There are tense shootouts and fastpaced car chases the latter of which boasts some of the most exhilarating stunts since The Road Warrior. From a visceral pointofview Retroactive surpasses most of Hollywood's recent summer blockbusters. The film still has its flaws none of them surprisingly having to do with a sense of repetition considering each action setpiece has the same basic setting and situation car chase on a lonely desert highway shootout at a gas station. Credit director Louis Morneau for keeping each sequence fresh and taut with suspense. The setup may be the same but the results and resolutions considerably differ. Rather what I do have a problem with is some technical error during the shootouts. Belushi is shown firing a sixbullet revolver at one point but clearly fires more than ten rounds. Another similar blatant miscalculation occurs again near the end. Plot holes and leaps of logic are expected in this kind of film but the number of shots fired from a gun shouldn't be that hard to keep track of.As the film's tough heroine the absolutely gorgeous Kylie Travis is refreshingly intelligent and strongwilled. She occasionally has trouble holding back that British accent of hers but still comes across quite well looks great in that black tanktop too. James Belushi is a lot of fun as the psychotic villain clearly relishing the overthetop role even though his character does lose menace through some ridiculous oneliners. Frank Whaley is quite good as the young scientist hampered only by a single scene that requires him to forget the logic of his own device which Travis corrects him on.With blistering fastpaced action and a fun story Retroactive proves to be a highly enjoyable way to spend ninety minutes. Most of the running time features a tight tanktop and pants wearing Kylie Travis kicking ass so that alone is enough to recommend the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the wake of an unfortunate incident which lead to six people losing their lives smart gutsy but severely guiltridden hostage negotiator Karen Warren strongly played by Kylie Travis quits her job and goes driving cross country to get her head together. Problems arise when Karen wrecks her car in the middle of a swelteringly hot and empty stretch of barren Texas backroads. Karen's given a lift by foul boorish obnoxiously hostile and hottempered redneck psycho criminal Frank Booth a fabulously forceful and flamboyant portrayal by James Belushi and his timid browbeaten wife Rayanne a topflight turn by erstwhile 90's directtovideo erotic thriller starlet Shannon Whirry. Frank kills Rayanne in a fit of rage when he finds out she's cheating on him. Karen narrowly avoids being bagged by Frank seeking shelter in a secret government compound where token nerdy scientist Brian a charmingly boyish Frank Whaley is experimenting with time travel. Karen goes back twenty minutes in time and attempts to stop Frank from killing Rayanne with even more disastrous results. Bound and determined to get things right Karen goes back in time again. And then again when things go even more awry ...Director Louis Morneau working from a highly sharpwitted and imaginative script by Michael HamiltonWright Robert Strauss and Philip Badger ingeniously blends elements of a gritty crime thriller a grungy road movie and your basic ripping'n'rousing actionfest with a nifty central science fiction premise into an excitingly dynamic absorbing and oftentimes literally explosive handy dandy multigenre combo synthesis. The extremely exhilarating action sequences are staged with heartstopping brio and ability the suspense is dexterously stoked to the nervefrying ninth degree the admittedly funky special effects are used with laudable judiciousness and the furiously forwardho headlong pace never once flags or falters during the film's fiercely zesty 91 minute running time. George Mooradian's bright sunbleached cinematography adds considerably to the sweaty tension. Ditto Tim Truman's lively rattling pulsepounding score.Kudos as well to the uniformly firstclass acting from a swell cast. The always welcome and invigorating M. Emmet Walsh contributes a cogent cameo as a weaselly gas station proprietor. James Belushi's deliciously riproaring hogwild histrionics as the dangerously volatile Frank are a riot to watch injecting a hilariously crude'n'rude sense of blackascoal humor to the generally serious proceedings. Most impressive of all is Kylie Travis' fiery performance as Karen whose deepseated need for redemption and exceptional bravery make her a very moving and sympathetic tragic heroine. A multiple award winning feature at numerous foreign fantasy film festivals this bangup terrific indie sleeper favorite deserves all the acclaim and accolades it has garnered abroad. It's a sheer delight that's eminently worthy of cult status.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a 'small' film that's easy to dismiss based on its obvious faults. But those faults are entirely superficial and if you can overlook them not difficult it has a great deal to offer.The clever thing here is the marriage of tight little Twilight Zone gimmick with a typical Die Hard action scenario. The heroine a police negotiator fresh from a failed hostage crisis finds herself endlessly reliving a calamitous twenty minutes out on a desert highway... trying desperately for a better outcome yet somehow only making things worse and worse. The eventual conclusion is beautifully restrained passing up all the usual Hollywood clichs and thereby making a surprisingly thoughtful statement about how sometimes you just can't make everything work out perfectly.The only real problem with the film is some slightly heavyhanded direction. Yes yes I know the heroine absolutely should have picked up the gun instead of running. Several times. My guess is that the script specified that she had to run and the director simply wasn't careful enough in placing the dropped weapon so as to make clear she couldn't possibly grab it instead. It happens in much biggerbudget movies than this. There's also the issue of Belushi's seeming indestructibility but this I assume is deliberate. The situation is nightmarishly predestined so it makes perfect sense that only those die who must die.Aside from these few moments though the direction is pretty sharp. The pace is unhurried yet relentless armed confrontations are genuinely tense and the various explosions are very gratifying. Do cars really blow up like that? Who cares! Every genre has its conventions... The story twists and turns delightfully like the heroine we often get just what we want but rarely quite what we expect.Performances by a cast of unknowns and secondstringers are uniformly fine. But Jim Belushi rarely thought of as Oscar material is truly memorable as the bombastic Texas psychopath both funny and frightening. This is easily the best work I've ever seen from him it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job in this role.No Retroactive isn't perfect. But its strengths far outweigh its minor weaknesses. Perhaps with a bigger name attached to it or more CGI effects it would have been a blockbuster. As it is the limited scale only increases its charm. This is that rarity a thoughtful action film exciting amazing amusing... and satisfying on every level.".

	schema:reviewBody "RETROACTIVE is one of those hidden gem films! A straighttovideo release it is much better than a high percentage of what Hollywood churns out in theaters! I first saw it on cable years ago when it first came out and was immediately enamored by it. It drew me in from the start. I just love its premise! Really one of the best timetravel movies you'll ever see. Well plotted paced and executed! RETROACTIVE stars uberhot Australian model Kylie Travis who does a great job carrying what is essentially an action film as a Chicago psychiatrist Karen who at the film's start has left her job because 6 of her patients were heinously gunned down in a hostage crisis. Her helplessness has forced her leave for less grisly surroundings. On her way across country her car breaks down on the desert highway and she is picked up by a bickering couple Frank James Belushi in the best role he's ever had! and Rayanne played with heartbreaking solemnity by Shannon Whirry. It's obvious to Karen that Frank is an abusive boyfriend to Rayanne and in her efforts to save her from him Frank kills Rayanne and then goes after Karen who ends up in a supersecret government facility and next thing she knows it's 20 minutes earlier and she is in the car with Frank and a very much alive Rayanne again!Genius! The plot is so incredibly simple yet so immediately manipulative! You can't help but want to know what happens next! Turns out the facility is overseen by a brilliant scientist named Brian solidly played by Frank Whaley who has discovered time travel. So Karen tries to change the situation so that Rayanne survives and Frank is taken down. Each time she tries and goes back the situation worsens. RETROACTIVE is one of the best examples of a movie where I have seen the snowball effect happen. Each worsening scenario is brilliantly thought out and constructed and unique from the previous one. Just one little change from the previous timeline makes a small difference in terms of immediacy but a huge difference in terms of the final outcome! The ending is actually satisfying and powerful! RETROACTIVE is a lost gem in the scifiactiontimetravel genre...Highly recommended viewing!".

It's obvious to Karen that Frank is an abusive boyfriend to Rayanne and in her efforts to save her from him Frank kills Rayanne and then goes after Karen who ends up in a supersecret government facility and next thing she knows it's 20 minutes earlier and she is in the car with Frank and a very much alive Rayanne again!Genius! The plot is so incredibly simple yet so immediately manipulative! You can't help but want to know what happens next! Turns out the facility is overseen by a brilliant scientist named Brian solidly played by Frank Whaley who has discovered time travel. So Karen tries to change the situation so that Rayanne survives and Frank is taken down. Each time she tries and goes back the situation worsens. RETROACTIVE is one of the best examples of a movie where I have seen the snowball effect happen. Each worsening scenario is brilliantly thought out and constructed and unique from the previous one. Just one little change from the previous timeline makes a small difference in terms of immediacy but a huge difference in terms of the final outcome! The ending is actually satisfying and powerful! RETROACTIVE is a lost gem in the scifiactiontimetravel genre...Highly recommended viewing!";

It's not like say a James Bond movie where a similar facility would have been staffed by a teeming army of hundreds of technicians and workers all of whom would have added to the tension of the story. Wow just think of the money they saved by not having to hire a cast of extras!!I also liked looking at the heroine played by Kylie Travis. She looks great. But I couldn't help but wonder why the scientist guy played by Frank Whaley didn't do more with her. I mean he has this supergizmo apparatus that can send her back in time couldn't he at least have found a way to make the machine remove her clothes and put her in a black bikini??No matter. It is a fun movie that both scifi as well as action fans will enjoy. You'll get to see lots of stuff get all blowed up. And it has several endings only one of which is a happy one.".

Probably the only thing I disliked about the film was the first 10 minutes. In that period of time there was the set up for us to get the plot idea. However it dragged out waaaaaay toooooo lonnnnnng. I actually felt as if I had been hypnotized as I could not remember for the life of me what I was watching....until it kicked back in. So....do not be discouraged with the beginning. Stick to it. Probably the only complaint I have. Besides the regular 'she had the opportunity to do this' or 'he could have done that' BUT does that not occur in everything we watch? I believe it does.I can tell you this movie has an offbeat style as mentioned previously. Not many around like it. Jim Belushi fits the part perfectly! He scared me  I didn't know he had it in his acting skill set to be such a psycho bully. The women were great. All round well done edge of the seat OMG this is crazy what's next kinda flick.If you like something a bit different from mainstream this is for you. Enjoy!".

Having quit the force she's traveling through rural Texas when she has car trouble and is then picked up by jovial sleaze bag Frank James Belushi. When Frank realizes that his wife Rayanne erotic film star Shannon Whirry has been unfaithful he murders her in cold blood. While Karen runs from Frank she comes across an isolated government complex where lonely young scientist Brian Frank Whaley has been conducting time travel experiments. Karen then realizes that here is a situation where she can go back in time and do things over...so she does. The only problem is she actually makes things WORSE. So she ends up back at the complex and goes back in time again. And so it goes while she stubbornly tries each time to make better decisions.Yeah...this does indeed sound like a serious scifi version of Groundhog Day much like an an earlier TV movie titled '1201' starring Jonathan Silverman. But the premise is amusing and director Louis Morneau actually does a very creditable job at keeping things very taut and compelling. The movie has a breakneck pace to it a respectable intensity level and characters about whom we can actually give a damn. Travis is quite good in the central role while Belushi relishes the opportunity to go over the top in his portrayal of a hairtrigger tempered piece of scum. Whaley is very likable as the scientist and Whirry earns our sympathies as the timid wife. It's also nice as it always is to see M. Emmet Walsh as he plays cheerful gas station proprietor Sam. Jesse Borrego Con Air Sherman Howard Day of the Dead '85 and Guy Boyd Body Double costar.Retroactive is slickly photographed in ClairmontScope by George Mooradian and has an appropriate sun baked look to it in all outdoor scenes. Special effects are decent and not overdone. I don't know if the script credited to Michael HamiltonWright Robert Strauss and Phillip Badger will bear any close scrutiny but at least while this thrill ride is still going on the viewer may not mind too much. It does give in to some clichs such as characters missing their targets all too often when they shoot or guns that take forever to run out of ammo but the action is firstrate and our protagonist and antagonist do set off some big sparks.Seven out of 10.".

Whaley is very likable as the scientist and Whirry earns our sympathies as the timid wife. It's also nice as it always is to see M. Emmet Walsh as he plays cheerful gas station proprietor Sam. Jesse Borrego Con Air Sherman Howard Day of the Dead '85 and Guy Boyd Body Double costar.Retroactive is slickly photographed in ClairmontScope by George Mooradian and has an appropriate sun baked look to it in all outdoor scenes. Special effects are decent and not overdone. I don't know if the script credited to Michael HamiltonWright Robert Strauss and Phillip Badger will bear any close scrutiny but at least while this thrill ride is still going on the viewer may not mind too much. It does give in to some clichs such as characters missing their targets all too often when they shoot or guns that take forever to run out of ammo but the action is firstrate and our protagonist and antagonist do set off some big sparks.Seven out of 10.";

It's the first collaboration between director Teshigahara writer Kodo Abe and composer Toru Takemitsu who went on to make the more widely available WOMAN IN THE DUNES and FACE OF ANOTHER.  It's not quite as strong as WitD but is on par with FoA.  This is a satire about a deserted town who's inhabitants are ghosts swallowed up by corruption.  Teshigahara's direction is solid and Takemitsu comes up with another appropriately dissonant score balancing tension and humor.  It's worth seeing for anyone interested in the three principal collaborators particularly since opportunities to see it are rare.  Takemitsu in particular could almost single handedly make a movie worth watching.".

	schema:headline " The premeditated murder of solidarity";
	schema:reviewBody "Divide et impera is an old game used by those with power against their subalterns. In Pitfall an employer who owns two mines has had to deal with one big union in the past. So the employer conjures up a plan to divide his mine workers. He lays off some from one mine and doesn't layoff any at the other. The members of the one big union are supposed to come to each other's aid in solidarity when trouble with the employer erupts and this is one such occasion. However when the miners of mine number one ask miners of mine number two for class solidarity in their strike to get lost jobs back the miners of mine number two refuse and keep working as the employer has told them that they will not suffer layoffs. Bingo! The miners in one his mines have been pitted against the miners of his other mine competing for what they think are a limited number of positions. The consequence is that the one big union splits into two competing unions. It's much easier for the boss to make deals with two small unions for they are weaker than one big union. Message to the employing class divide and rule. Lesson for workersunity.What happens though when the employer wants to get rid of even those two unions weakened by distrust one for the other? The answer to this question is large part of what director Hiroshi Teshigahara's Pitfall is about. Teshigahara wasn't alone in creating this film. To be sure Pitfall was also the work of author Kb Abe. In fact Pitfall was originally a stage play by Abe. One must keep in mind when watching this film that both men were leftists influenced by surrealism and it shows in the direction screenplay choice of music and cinematography. Both men saw how the social relations of capitalist class rule kept the producers weak poor and in wageslavery. Both also saw the existential theme of alienation between people which is part and parcel of the the system of wagelabor. But neither of them was about to produce a piece of nihilist fiction which is what many reviewers of this film seem to think Pitfall is about. Teshigahara and Abe are depicting life under the rule of Capital and showing how it works to keep workers at each others' throats. As the film opens a father and his young boy wander a stark landscape in Kyushu industrially pockmarked by mines and the scattered wild remnants of a supremely indifferent Nature. This is an environment like our own one which has suffered from the neglect of civilization's modern rulers. The father is a rootless proletarian in search of an employer and on the run because he has 'deserted'. The film's audience is never told what he has deserted from but whatever it was there are other workers who have deserted from it too. We know this because the father is being accompanied through part of the film by a fellow mine worker who is also on the run a selfproclaimed 'deserter'. We also know because in one scene from a mine worksite a man is fallen upon by two other men authorities who take him away after a scuffle. The miners who view this in a stunned atomized silence agree the man must have been a 'deserter'. The father's young son has been brought up as witness to the fact that authority can never be trusted. He has seen too many ordinary working people hurt in some way by people who wear the clothes and uniforms of officialdom. When he spies a man in a pristine white suit riding through the mining town on a motor scooter the only motor vehicle around which isn't a truck he hides.The father his son and their companion the other mine worker leave one job secretly in the night and go on the road to look for another. They fear discovery as 'deserters' as their employer seems like he might be catching on. No chances can be taken. Both land a job at another mine site some distance away and it looks to be a good job too. The father has always dreamed of working for a union mine and of the better more comfortable and secure life this would mean. This one's not bad but one of his supervisors tells him that a new boss awaits him at another mine with an even better job and so he and his son take off on foot with a simply sketched map in hand.However the new mine doesn't seem to exist. Instead the father is led by the written map given to him by his former supervisor to an abandoned mining town where only one person lives a woman who owns a candytrinket store. The woman is as isolated and lonely as the father. She too is waiting for something a letter from her exlover a summons to a better place. In the course of their conversation we find out that the ghost town has been abandoned because of all the mining accidents which have happened. Unsafe working conditions have their consequences. Still the father wonders what went wrong with the directions he got from his old supervisor. He's sure that he's in the right place the one given to him on a piece of paper by foreman of the mine he just left. The candy store owning woman suggests that he might be looking for another mine just over the hill.Be prepared for ghosts doubles and dastardly planned murders most foul. Be prepared to see and even hear in a jangling musical score a movie which will intrigue and surprise and may cause you thereafter to continually question the motives of your rulers divide et impera.".

The film is technically superb on the DVD box available and it is highly recommended. This film is not for everyone it is for people who are interested in serious Japanese cinema. There are nuances in this film that show the mark of a great director though. Again be prepared This is not happy go lucky. It triumphs mostly because of its persistence of vision.

There is no reason why the victims come back from the dead as ghosts but this mining community is a veritable ghost town. The fate of the main character in the film a common mine worker who shifts from town to town with his young boy in search of better working conditions is sealed when he is mistaken by the hitman posing as an innocuous photographer for the secretary of one of the unions and ends up face down on a beach before the eyes of his own passive son.The other notable inhabitant of the ghost town is a female candystore owner who is perennially waiting for news from her faraway lover. To make ends meet she agrees to act as a witness to the murder of the mine worker but after being raped by a sleazy police officer she ends up on the hitman's list as well lest she decides to sing about her involvement in the murders. Ironically she is killed just moments before the postman indolently delivers the longedfor letter from her lover and the sequence when her failure to clutch the letter with her fingers brings about her realization that she is in fact dead is a moving highlight. The mine worker seems resigned to his fate of suffering eternal hunger since he died on an empty stomach! but the woman can't accept the fact that she was taken away from this world just as her life was about to take a turn for the better her incessant questioning and screaming after the hitman riding away on his motorcycle is not easily shaken off.The second half of the movie deals in more detail with the machinations of the two miners' unions which are being pitted one against the other by some unknown force. Towards the end of the film there is a lengthy impressive sequence of a clandestine meeting between the two secretaries one of whom suspects the other of having hired the hitman to terminate him which turns into a gritty fistfight between the two and ends with their two ghosts haunting the seaside spot were earlier on the mine worker met his doom. This time however the miner's son is moved to tears by what he witnesses and bewildered and alone runs off aimlessly in a stunning fluid camera move which ends the film on a high note.The occasionally elliptical narrative may be explained by the fact that we see the events unfolding before us through the eyes of the child and the film's most arresting image is that of the boy's eye peering through a crack in the wall of the wooden shack spying on the woman being raped. PITFALL's subject matter and lack of major stars may limit its appeal but for adventurous film fans it's a satisfyingly existentialist and Kafkaesque journey.".

Japanese newwave ferried to its logical conclusion even as it takes its first baby steps.Based on a story by Kb Abe PITFALL explores the myriad possibilities that emerge from the space where life and death overlap as a poor miner is murdered under mysterious circumstances in the marshes near an old ghost town. His murderer an alluring whiteclad figure buys off the silence of the one witness a woman operating a candy store in the ghost town district and disappears as mysteriously as he appeared.

Personal interpretation is very important in any work and particularly in something as haunting as this. Who is the killer? Why is he doing it? Questions left open the character cleverly typed as a seriocomic grim reaper of sorts riding around in his moped a manifestation that invokes notions of fate by the very nature of his acts. Is there not meaning when one is not aware of it? Teshigahara pits the dead against the dead the living against the living and everybody against each other ghosts quizically examining their corpses and wondering the reason of their deaths the living deaf to their protestations and too busy being suspicious of each other.

Construction works photographed in all their derelict abandonded glory a ghost world for the dead to haunt. Notions of hell on earth.

	schema:headline " A flawed debut";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll skip the synopsis and go right for the flaws. The little boy was sketched as a weak caricature. Our hero the murdered man was given some very weak dialog. The subplot about the divided miners' union was verbose. The confrontation between the two union heads came to an unbelievable conclusion. The man in white was not as much of a mystery as the film seems to think he is. At the end with four principles dead we expect them to meet at last and discuss what has happened with one another but instead the movie watches the boy run crying down a road and damn it the movie isn't about the boy! paragraph The film sets up the murdered man to slowly come to realize the fact that there will be no justice for his murder and that it is better once one has died not to torture oneself by watching the world he has left behind. That the movie ends before he comes to this realization makes the ending very unsatisfying. Of course the film doesn't allow him to realize as much as the viewer feels he should. Perhaps that is the greatest flaw. Or perhaps it is the fact that the two union heads fight each other to the death when at least one of them should know that it is more important for them to unite against a common enemy. Then there's the man in white. The movie seems to think he's a mystery but it's pretty obvious that he's a representative of the mining company looking to crush the unions. The murdered man our hero does not realize this nor does the movie seem to think the viewer does but the viewer does know and with all the murdered man has heard by all rights he should too. Instead he spouts weak dialog about his murder. He recites his stilted inner monologue like a man in a stage play and it doesn't work. Really he's too complacent. He passively watches people talk about him. He does not put up any kind of fight to make the living world hear him. He doesn't undergo the process of accepting that he cannot interact with the living world. At the end he's even trying to speak to a living man even though he should have come to realize that it's impossible. And as I said before he hasn't made any progress toward accepting the fact that he must forget the world of the living and accept his fate. His story arc feels very unfinished. The script needed a rewrite.".

	schema:headline " Thrilling tragic slightly untidy Pitfall";
	schema:reviewBody "Opening with two men and a boy fleeing in the darkness from some unseen threat with an ominous silence punctured by wolves barking it is clear that the film will be unpredictable in both style and content. Moving on from this we follow the man a miner and his son as he tries to find work until eventually he is set up in a complex murder plot. Stalked by an unnerving immaculately suited assassin he is soon slain brutally and left for dead in a move reminiscent of Psycho and its quick dispatching of the main character.Following this the character we thought dead rises up from the ground to a standing position. The simple technique of playing a shot backwards recalls another early 60's Japanese film Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo while there it was used as a slight character moment here it completely reinvents the film's narrative  melting away all we've seen and reforming into something much more ambitious.Pitfall contains elements of social realism surrealist experimentation crime procedural conspiracy thriller and fantasytragedy. Teshigahara's roots in documentary filmmaking and strong leftist political view provide reason for his sympathies with the struggles of miners shown through the exploitation of the miner and his son and the two union's confrontation. Selfishness pervades the film the individual selfishness of the exploitative old man hiring the men to do a mining job the boy taking a candy from his dead father's corpse and the political selfishness as seen in the confrontation between the two unions.Duplicity and division are chief devices in Pitfall. Cinematographically we see this through the sensual distance of Teshigahara's camera at once close tracking exploring the personal space and frame of mind of the characters other times distanced and merely observing displacing the individual as they get lost in the harsh world around them. The lack of structure in the films cinematography is a benefit sumptuous compositions guerrilla handheld movements deepfocused long shots erratic zooms and pans the assortment of shots is astounding the film is simply a visual treat. The welding of extreme social realism at one point real documentary footage of impoverished miners is inserted and the surrealist imagery of ghosts left in the town carrying on their lowly routines with no effect and of the many dead characters inspecting their own corpses quizzically studying the circumstances of their deaths and often probing the living creates a fusion of misery  both in life and forever in death. In ghost form the miner laments his hunger  something he no doubt would've done often in life.Despite all these many seemingly contradictory modes and random storystrands Pitfall holds together well. As Teshigahara's first feature film this as a major outlet for his artistic visions and consequently the film is slightly untidy structurally the film lacks a successful linking of the many elements at play they seem to popup randomly sometimes without reason. For example the conspiracy hints littered throughout the murdermystery plot seem to go nowhere. Rough around the edges it may be Pitfall is a genuinely fascinating thrilling involving picture from beginning to end possessing the visual tenacity and narrative complexity of a firsttime director finding his feet and unleashing his cinematic imagination.".

	schema:reviewBody "Teshigahara's debut at least as a feature length director of fictional films. Like his most famous work his sophomore feature A Woman in the Dunes Pitfall is based on the work of Japanese author Kobo Abe. While Pitfall is far less famous than A Woman in the Dunes it is at least as good. It's been a while since I've seen Dunes but at the moment I'd rate Pitfall higher. The story is about a man and his son who arrive in a mining camp to start a new job. The child notices a lanky man in white following them about. The father Hisashi Igawa notices nothing. Following orders Igawa goes down to the beach. The man in white follows and attacks with a knife. The child hides watching his father's murder from afar. The film is a murder mystery. It is also a ghost story as Igawa rises from the dead and wanders the camp looking for answers to his murder. The child hides and avoids contact with the human beings around him. The film plays out as an existentialist nightmare people wandering through empty landscapes surrounded by distant hills of dirt and rocks abandoned settlements and seemingly unmanned mining equipment. The filmmaking style is very cold very distant very geometrical in its compositions and editing. It's quiet and frightening. It's incredible sad. And it's one of the best films I've seen in a long time.".

Whatever that reason is it is never shared with us. It's sad enough that the characters in this movie are so lost but that someone would care enough about them to seek them out and kill them. The man in the white suit has a book and after carrying out his hit or setting one up he quietly writes things in that book. Is he the grim reaper? Does he represent organized crime? Is he a solo player? He is magical in a Satanic sense. He comes between two warring labor unions creating enough distrust to destroy what they fight for and them also. One of the strangest characters is a little boy the son of the first victim who seems only intent on eating throughout the movie. At one point he catches a frog smashes it on the rocks and then pulls off its skin. He seems immune to emotion and we only know that he is a little eating machine. This is a film that you will think about for a long time if you can find it. It is unsatisfying on the one hand and highly provocative on the other.".

It's sad enough that the characters in this movie are so lost but that someone would care enough about them to seek them out and kill them. The man in the white suit has a book and after carrying out his hit or setting one up he quietly writes things in that book. Is he the grim reaper? Does he represent organized crime?

	schema:reviewBody "The film is daring not only narratively but technically employing many styles using real documentary footage using reverse emotion photography and numerous other technical feats that all serve the story there is no ostentation only utility unlike say the films of Jean Cocteau. And this makes one wonder why so many films are so straightforward and dull visually when the very usage of such techniques actually complexes a rather simple narrative quite dramatically. Some critics have carped that the film is not that realistic in its depiction sof its characters especially the dueling union heads who end up killing each other. But as someone who has spent decades in such labors the film is depressingly accurate in its portrayal of how easily a dastardly company can pit labor interests against one another. In fact I would say that in the less philosophic aspects of the tale the film is amongst the most realistic portrayals of unionism going in many ways more so than even a film like Norma Rae. And the portrayal of the companyhired assassin recalls that other great corporate malfeasance film Akira Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well while the ironic bleakness recalls Kon Ichikawa's Fires On The Plain.The DVD package from The Criterion Collection Three Films By Hiroshi Teshigahara comes with a fourth disk of supplements the main feature of which is a documentary about Teshigahara and his Kobo Abe's lives and collaborations. There are also four short early documentaries by Teshigahara none of which presage his fictive films. They are Hokusai Ikebana Tokyo 1958 and Ako. The actual disk with Pitfall on it contains the theatrical trailer and a video essay by film critic James Quandt on it. Overall it is a solid video package with a few early blemishes shown in a 1.371 aspect ratio although the lack of an English language dubbed track would have been a great help because the white subtitles blanche out against many of the ultrawhite shots of the film. The booklet features a career overview by Peter Grilli an interview with the director and essays on the films. Hiroshi Segawa's cinematography is very daring and the scoring by Toru Takemitsu is always apropos to the scene underscoring emotions never exaggerating them and often adding to the scenes with an askewness to what is seen which throws a viewer into a different state of mind aiding the feeling of alienation many of the characters feel.This alienation is at its greatest when one realizes that the first two murders of the miner and the candy saleswoman are incidental to the real 'meat' of the film. And in this way Teshigahara is offering up his version of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho wherein the character the viewer presumes is the film's main character is not. He is merely a plot device whose raison d'etre is left hanging. The same cannot be said for his son who witnesses four murders and the brutal sex between the cop and the candy saleswoman. In this way the film also neatly sunders the convention of a close father and on the road as portrayed in such films as The Bicycle Thief and Il Grido. That both of those films were influenced by documentary forms as was Teshigahara's work is no coincidence as is Teshigahara's will to break with the tried and true.Pitfall is a film that is great because it is daring it does not bite off more than it can chew it provides a strong narrative but leaves enough mystery for the viewer to cogitate on through multiple viewings is technically strong in all areas and provides solid enough acting never great that its just mentioned framework of excellence never frays. It provides a narrative for those drawn to plot first films yet also has a philosophic heft that works on many levels from the existential to the ethical and touches upon identity the layers of the self and what is and is not private and is and is not evil. It may be a bit less daring than Teshigahara's later The Face Of Another as well as lacking in as much razzledazzle and narrative complications but it is also less flawed and this latter quality is why it stands taller as a great work of art than the later film. However both films evince an undeniable fact Hiroshi Teshigahara was a force of great talent and achievement in Japanese and world cinema and the world of art and that at large is poorer for his absence and the absence of his creative descendants. Hence sometimes less really and only is less.".

Henry roams from school to school imparting modes of knowledge but never staying long enough to form any semblance of sentient attachment. A perfect profession for one seeking to hide out in the open. One day Henry arrives at his next assignment. Upon his entry into this particular school a secret world of emotion is awakened within him by three women. A girl named Meredith in his first period. A fellow teacher Ms. Madison and a street hooker named Erica whom Henry has personally granted brief shelter from the streets. Each one of these women like Henry are in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! I was not expecting this movie to be this engaging. Its one of those films that leave you sitting in silence for a while when the credits roll much like excellent Dramas like Requiem for a dream or Downloading Nancy.This one spells it out pretty clear with the line Henry Barthes is all of us... its hard to grasp how the realization that we are indeed all the same can be so painful.On the surface Detachment deals with the crumbling American education system through the eyes of substitute teacher Henry Barthes played by Adrian Brody who starts a new assignment in a new school with new teachers in a new class with new pupils like he is obviously used to.The beginning shows him trying to get into this new class around the bullies threatening him and other pupils making it hard to teach anything. At first it looks like all those good teacher turns around a bad class movies but its not. You soon realize that the school is just the backdrop for a larger story about a teacher who tries to do his job by taking a role outside the play. Barthes makes clear that he is hollow and words can't hurt him which is his way of coping with a hopeless situation by neglecting his private life and detaching from the world. Like him every teacher seems to have developed his individual coping mechanism. For some its cynicism and dark humor happy pills are regularly mentioned too and for others its just swallowing their emotions until they erupt. You see the teachers coping with their daily routine while hearing an answering machine in the background every now and then with other teachers resigning or parents shouting for better grades for their kids.Its pretty tough stuff seeing kids void of hope interest or enthusiasm and teachers trying to get to the few who are still to be reached in the classroom. But its here where it all falls apart because of hollow politics parents that do not care or are just as dysfunctional as the kids they raised and dropped into the public education system and idiotic social rules and conventions we are all used to. When you see the pattern in all the peoples private lives and their desperate tries of holding on its obvious that Detachment is not just about the public school system but about our whole society about each and every one of us.When Barthes meets a young street hooker he decides to take her in with him and do his job outside school. Its quite heartbreaking to see him trying to make a change against all odds. At times Barthes comes across like a modern day Jesus when he sleeps on the floor of his small apartment and lets the girl sleep in bed. Some might say that Detachment is too light on the teachers because most of the blame falls onto parents and politicians. There is hardly an unsympathetic teacher in this movie. Yet there are scenes that show Barthes is no Jesus at all... like when he violently shouts at a nurse in a retirement home after an incident with his dying grandfather. Barthes is indeed like all of us cracking when he struggles to cope and lashing out to get out the pressure just like the parents at school push their pressure to the teachers.And this is where the detachment cracks... amidst all the failures Barthes manages to connect to the girl as well as to an outcast girl at school. And he connects through emotion and personal attachment but soon has to realize that it does not work. The scenes of him sending away the girl to a foster home when he tells her he cannot be her family or when he has do send away the outcast girl when she tries to share her sorrow with him are gutwrenching. There are so many honest and deeply emotional scenes in this movie its hard to keep track. His grandfathers death with his total forgiving Barthes monologues trying to make the pupils understand why they need basic education for their own sake are as brilliant as Lucy Lius Characters breakdown in which she shouts out her desperation and sadness towards a seemingly not caring girl.The relationship between Barthes and the girl is stunning and constantly rocked by misunderstandings... plain because you don't expect it to be nonsexual with all the pedophile stories sexual harassment laws and stereotypes. But against all odds it is and you realize that when there are no parents like in the haunting parents night scenes with teachers waiting and no one coming someone else must fill this void... how empty have we become that we cannot expect someone to help out of honest interest for his fellow man... or rather child?!Detachment is a bleak and painful movie but it has some hope and even some humor the cynic teachers way of teaching a girl about the dangers of STD with a picture of a rainbow and a picture of a disease ridden vagina is one of those much needed lighter moments.Its like when Barthes says in one of his many off commentaries... life is an ocean of chaos and the realization that you are the one supposed to throw the buoy while struggling to stay afloat is devastating. But its the honesty about his own struggle that makes him connect with others. Its when they realize we indeed are all the same all struggling and they are not alone in their strife that gives them their humanity. But thats what life is... so what can you do but be honest and hope for the best.... Its all going to be OK!".

Let's clear things out this film is not about a school or the basis of education this is about trying our best not to give a damn about others as most of us just go around doing everything in our power to be happy ourselves with a lousy job a loveless marriage a constant sense of abandonment or basically a crappy life all of the above portrayed marvelously in the film.Films by Tony Kaye tend to be really visceral with a thin slice of optimism in the undertones I think this time he just went mental about everything in the end you'll leave the theater with a slight sense of hopelessness almost as if you're destined to watch daily misery without the power to control anything but your own life as if the only battle you must fight is the constant reminder that even when everything falls apart and slowly turns into dust you can't change the world you just have to avoid the world from changing youThis exposed stunningly in the final sequence of the movie.Do yourself a favor watch this film!".

Let's clear things out this film is not about a school or the basis of education this is about trying our best not to give a damn about others as most of us just go around doing everything in our power to be happy ourselves with a lousy job a loveless marriage a constant sense of abandonment or basically a crappy life all of the above portrayed marvelously in the film.Films by Tony Kaye tend to be really visceral with a thin slice of optimism in the undertones I think this time he just went mental about everything in the end you'll leave the theater with a slight sense of hopelessness almost as if you're destined to watch daily misery without the power to control anything but your own life as if the only battle you must fight is the constant reminder that even when everything falls apart and slowly turns into dust you can't change the world you just have to avoid the world from changing youThis exposed stunningly in the final sequence of the movie.Do yourself a favor watch this film!";

	schema:headline " Windswept and desolate school hallways";
	schema:reviewBody "The truth about high school is that it's worse than you remember it.Watching Tony Kaye's enthralling Detachment you can't help compare your high school to the one on screen. You remember the terrible teachers you had the sterile hallways the asinine classmates and the absurd assignments. You can remember the weight that presses on everyone as Mr. Henry Barthes played by Adrien Brody tells his class.If you can just hang on everything will be alright. Mr. Barthes is that hero teacher that we love tell stories about. He's the Christ the Buddha. He's meant to save us from ourselves. The problem? Mr. Barthes is a great teacher because he has no life outside of teaching. Like Socrates Christ Buddha Gandhi and countless other mythologized teachers Barthes is a detached island to himself without spouse children or personal life. He's a lonely dude.As a public school teacher sitting in the audience at the world premiere last night in Tribeca I have mixed feelings about telling you that Tony Kaye has masterfully succeeded in capturing public school in a macabre and beautiful chalkboard sketch. His lush mannerist portrait brings a gorgeous but searing light to the lonely reality of the teaching profession. Mr. Kaye's Detachment presents school the way so many of us on the inside see it a windswept wasteland scourged of its humanity by a culture that burdens its underfunded and unfairly censured teachers with rearing policing and institutionalizing our children. I hate to say it public school really is this bad. The few great teachers that our system manages to attract are barely hanging on from year to year knocked senseless by a society that demands way too much from them.Adrien Brody is riveting as a seemingly serene but deeply damaged substitute teacher. His sloping eyebrows sometimes treacly or overwrought in other performances here convey an inchfromthecliff hopelessness without ever becoming a mask. Mr. Brody's Henry Barthes is sweetly but searingly honest with his students even as sadly skulks among the halls of his school. Barthes is also furious enough to throw desks in his classroom and scream at a late night nurse at his grandfather's assisted care facility. In closeup documentarystyle interviews Mr. Brody's eyes flash like lightning one moment and then become as dull as concrete the next daring us to try to understand how one can care so much and so little. His Barthes has a teacher's countenance in this film acutely aware of how important yet futile his work is. It's a career performance.Barthes' determination to be disconnected keeps him the perennial substitute in the classroom and in his personal life. Barthes tends to his grandfather but has more than enough time to help out two young girls a young prostitute and an overweight loner. Despite his earnest efforts almost none of it works out well. The complicating plot lines all involving family surrogacy around Barthes serve the notion that teachers must be dispassionate and alone in order to perform their jobs. The story survives its few yet regrettable school clichs by sticking to this thesis. Despite the fact that the number of big names threatens to make the movie look like a cameofest Lucy Liu? Christina Hendricks? Marcia Gay Harden? Blythe Danner? James Caan? Really? the ensemble gels together surprisingly well. After all weren't your teachers an impossible cast of characters? Every character seems just barely above water as each trudges to the blunt beat of the school bells ringing. The performances are just fine largely but two are particularly successful. While Mr. Caan's grinning jester provides a refreshingly necessary gallows' humor in some of the film's darkest moments it's Ms. Liu's imploding truthteller that lends undeniable heft to the story. As a guidance counselor faced with yet another unreachable knowitall teen Ms. Liu's character finally breaks down berating the student with a bleak prophecy of the child's future. You will NOT be a model! You will forever be on a carousel competing with 80 of the country for a minimum wage job for the rest of your life! the guidance counselor screams uselessly at the apathetic teen.It's grim stuff made more grave by the undeniable ring of truth.The ancient Greeks tell us we suffer our way to wisdom. By the end of the film you'll hope that is true for most of these characters. Somewhere on screen between a silent hug and the opening lines to Poe's Fall of the House of Usher you will find a glimmer of hope. But you have to work for it. School as the film has drawn it is a Munchesque desert of detachment where the best anyone teachers and students can do is survive. But the fact that Barthes and teachers like him won't give up and the fact that Mr. Kaye made this movie tells us that hope is alive if not well. The hope rests almost entirely in our lonely detached teachers.".

The kids led by Sammi Gayle who should get more story lines on Blue Bloods and Betty Kaye with that very small but well written part for Rene Felice Smith brought this story to the top for me. The story was outstanding and really put things about our lives and even our education system in focus. This film deserves your attention and I think any awards it has received have been well deserved.

	schema:headline " Desperation and Despondency as a Wakeup Call";
	schema:reviewBody "I had no idea how ill prepared I was to experience Detachment. Here is a film that plunges headfirst into the depths of disillusionment despair and failure and almost never resurfaces for air. You will experience emotions normally repressed during movie watching. You will be saddened shocked and above all angered. You will see things you wouldn't ever want to see and hear things that should never be heard. You will wade through a sea of bleakness desperately searching for some small shred of hope to cling on to. At the end of it all you will be so psychologically drained that for a time it may seem as if you will never be happy again. At the same time you will also get to thinking and that's exactly why I'm recommending this movie so highly.A few months ago I snubbed my nose at the critically acclaimed thriller The Grey an equally hopeless and depressing but also nihilistic story about men who must fight against wolves and themselves in the snowy Alaskan wilderness. Unlike that film which reduced its compelling ideas into a cheap and shallow thriller Detachment uses its desperation and despondency to make a point. I don't see it as a movie so much as a wakeup call a way for audiences to understand not just the world but themselves as well. At its essence it's an examination of behaviors that are perpetuated by people that have the power to stop it. It might not seem like they have the power. In fact it might seem like absolutely everything is working against them. There's no question that rising above adversity is a challenge. Nevertheless it's one that must be faced.The main setting is an inner city public high school one that exemplifies with horrifying detail the failure of the No Child Left Behind act of 2001. Most of the students are poorly educated violent and foulmouthed. They have no respect for others but more to the point they have no respect for themselves. They have in fact degenerated into pure apathy. This has rubbed off on the faculty for they know that all their years of teaching and guidance haven't made the slightest difference. They're constantly berated by furious parents for being so lousy at their jobs. It's almost as if they have relinquished themselves of the responsibility of actually raising their own children. Is your son or daughter a problem? Don't take the necessary steps of working towards a solution  simply dump them off at school and let the teachers do the dirty work.Bearing witness to all of this is a substitute teacher Henry Barthes Adrien Brody. He struggles to make a difference all the while knowing that he's failing miserably. He sees nothing but people who have given up and he's within of inch of giving up on himself. His personal life is a mess his grandfather Louis Zorich in the advances states of some kind of dementia languishes in a nursing home staffed by people who simply don't care. He has flashbacks of a childhood scarred by the absence of a father an alcoholic mother and a deep tragedy. He eventually takes in an underage prostitute named Erica Sami Gayle. He's saddened by her situation and even helps her in a few important regards but he doesn't coddle her like a frightened puppy. He wants to get through to her that she has value as a person that she's so much better than giving oral sex to men on the bus. He's also tortured by the fact that their arrangement can't last forever.Several distinguished actors make appearances in this film mostly as faculty members. These would include Marcia Gay Harden Tim Blake Nelson James Caan Lucy Liu Blythe Danner Christina Hendricks Isiah Whitlock Jr. Bryan Cranston and William Petersen. All are in various stages of professional and personal breakdown Nelson plays a teacher who isn't noticed by anyone Caan plays an administrator who can only get through the day on medication and biting wit and Harden plays a woman who knows that the end is near. In one of the best scenes Liu lashes out at a student for her disrespect and indifference at her own future. She gets nothing but kids like this day in and day out. What is the point of pointing out their academic shortcomings when they obviously won't take the steps to better themselves?Of all the actors that appeared in the film the most compelling is Betty Kaye as a student named Meredith who observes the school through the lens of her camera. She creates dark collages with her photos. Her creativity is labeled by her unseen but clearly heard father as unnecessary teen angst. Believing only beautiful people are worthy of attention he cruelly harps on her about her overeating the way she dresses and her social isolation. Meredith an intelligent young woman makes a connection with Barthes. Unfortunately her selfesteem is so low that she misinterprets his encouragement as personal affection.The film intercuts linear scenes with multiple narrative techniques none more resonant than Barthes' documentarystyle confessionals. The final scene begins with him reading the opening sentences from Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher which should already tell you everything you need to know. The message of Detachment is simply one of responsibility and caring. If you're a parent nurture your children and allow them to be themselves. Don't expect a school system to raise them for you  as they say education begins at home. Before you point out someone else's flaws first recognize your own. Understand that you're not perfect. Be thoughtful of others. And above all know that you matter. There is no tragedy deeper than giving up on yourself. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

If emotions were like colors on a palette the movie is a painting masterpiece. The pain and suffering that each character goes through the search of an identity the burden of past mistakes redemption and forgiveness the heartwrenching pain of separation and the exuberant joy of reunion and so much more...It really made me feel that through this project the actors and everyone else associated with this movie would have actually experienced 'the weighing down' effect of living that we all feel one or the other time. It had a deep impact on me. After watching this movie I felt that I have a responsibility to do something to reduce human suffering. If not anything else at least a prayer. Thank you Tony  Adrien for an emotionally charged thoughtprovoking experience!".

	schema:reviewBody "As classroom dramas go this may well be one the finest I have ever seen. A compelling insight into Americas failing education system and the beleaguered teachers that inhabit it.The story centres around Henry Barthes a substitute teacher who spends three weeks at a high school where the students are as troubled as their teachers. Barthes portrayed brilliantly by Adrien Brody finds himself surrounded by individuals who have become jaded to the point of breaking. His tale becomes even more complex when a chance encounter with a teenage prostitute Erica develops into an unconventional friendship. It's within this custodial dynamic that we see some of the films most poignant and heartbreaking moments as well as some outstanding acting from Sami Gayle who plays the vulnerable young girl that society has abandoned. The film employs a three part cutaway technique with Henry Barthes providing a narrative in the form an interview as well as flashbacks to his childhood  which allows us an insight into why he such a brooding and melancholic character. The flashbacks are often juxtaposed with scenes involving Barthes grandfather with whom he visits in hospital through out the film. The third cutaway is an animated chalkboard sequence which I felt conveyed a sense of culpability and lost innocence.The film also boasts an extraordinary supporting cast including James Caan Marcia Gay Harden and a very brief appearance from Bryan Cranston as well as a surprisingly fine turn from Lucy Liu the schools doctor. The staffs sense of disillusionment and frustration due to the students perpetual indifference to their own fate is vented brilliantly by Liu in a scene that begs the question where and when did it all go wrong? Though dealing with very bleak subjects and despite the characters ceaseless sense of defeat and abject loathing for their profession there are still some heart warming moments in the film. And though it offers no suggestion as to how we can amend such failings in our education system and that parenting has in so many avenues of society become bereft of any moral guidance and adequacy it still left me reassured that there are those who are still prepared to undertake such a daunting and thankless task.If you're looking for an entertaining piece then I suggest you look elsewhere but if you wish to see a brilliantly thought provoking film that raises more questions than it provides answers and you're prepared for some uncomfortable moments then you'll be rewarded with a film that is excellently written and directed and has some outstanding performances. A great film!".

The role played by Sami Gayle is astonishing where she found that character is beyond me.

The cast was outstanding especially Brody and the one that kept bringing my thoughts back to it Toni Gayle as Erica in her first feature film performance. As the director Tony Kaye said hers was the first character he cast because she is the central pin for the storyamazing given a cast loaded with familiar faces and names and incredible talent.I can't say too much about the story without spoiling it. It does have memorable dialogue a very interesting story and humor is not absent but I think is suffers with audiences because the central character Brody is a deep person with a lot to offer but is stuck in a sad shallow outward personality. If I'd had to leave before the end I might well not have gone back to finish it. Others have watched it thinking it was going to be another American History X but they're just two different movies both with something big to say this more so even than X in my opinion. My only minuscule nit to pick is I'd rather have had Brody do the head shots as voice over narration. Above all if I didn't say anything else I'd say this....stick with it.The only flaw associated with this movie given all is positives is criminally atrocious marketing. It's like displaying Van Gogh's Starry Night in the basement of the Museum of Modern Art where only the occasional patron wanders in and happens to lift its covering. To help the reader judge how I weigh film ratings I've seen between 510000 movies but this is only my 14th 1010.".

Adrien Brody gives his best performance since The Pianist and what a supporting castJames Caan is hilarious Marcia Gay Harden is amazing and Lucy Liu of all people is so vulnerableI didn't know she was capable of that. It seems like actors we have come to rely on for solid performances decided to experiment and step outside their comfort zone under the direction of Tony Kaye American History X.The film itself is a harsh look at the realities facing inner city schools. Brody plays a substitute journeyman teacher Henry Barthes who a little too Dangerous Minds connects with his misguided students but as opposed to trying to confront his students or make them read poetry like 5 million other lame movies he seems to share his own pain and anger with the world in order to connect..It really works. On them and on us.I don't want to give anything away but this is a film that confronts both psychological and physical tragedy where every character seems to be up against their own feeling of helplessnessstudents teachers administration and a young prostitute who doesn't attend school that Henry decides to help. One especially powerful scene is ParentTeacher night. Shocking subtle and effortless. That's how I would describe this whole movie.Ultimately Detachment was very thorough at examining the ins and outs of the schools problems through individuals and as a collective. But it also feels like a character piece about this tormented substitute. The movie jumps a little too much maybe but I don't really care. Tony Kaye does what he does best here delivers a gritty edgy shocking and ultimately important film. This is a director that should be making more films. I hope to see Detachment in theaters soon and I hope some of these performers will be in the conversation come awards seasonthey deserve it.".

He is one of those very rare actors who can emote so effortlessly. The sadness and melancholy that he expresses is so natural that he should be given a award for the saddest face in Hollywood.The rest of the cast is equally good. The soundtrack of the movie is so congruous to the movie that at times the background score will move you.I would suggest this movie to anyone who thinks about their problems a lot does not matter how old you are.I salute everyone who was a part of this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Some of us believe we can make a difference then we wake up and realize we failed. Henry Barthes Brody is a substitute teacher who is all but dead inside. His grandfather is in a nursing home and close to death. He has no other family and the only job he can get is substitute teaching. After taking a position at a severely under preforming school he does everything he can to make a difference. Finding a way to connect to the kids is not only what they need but also a way for him to find out who he is. There have been a ton of movies about a teacher who comes in to try and fix the students. Even including the true stories Dangerous Minds and Lean On Me this is easily the most realistic portrayal of a teacher trying to help I have ever seen. Not wanting to give anything away it's not a movie where he comes in and starts to rap and all of a sudden everyone gets A's nor is it him coming in and being a hard ass until everyone gets it. This is what most teachers would try and do I think and I didn't think it was possible but this movie give me more respect for what they go through on a day to day basis most of which is unnoticed or unappreciated. This is a movie that you just need to see and every high school kid who thinks he is a thug needs to see and understand. As well as parents who seem to not care about their kids education. Another movie that deserves to be noticed and seen by a bigger audience then it will get. I highly recommend this movie. I give this an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "Such a strong storytelling such real performances. Adrien Brody is brilliant way better than any words can describe. If he wins an Oscar for The Pianist what higher prize would you give him for his performance for Detachment? There is no single instant of time during the movie that you feel he is acting. He loses himself entirely in his character. The opening lines are from Albert Camus' The Stranger And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world. I cannot think of any better expression to portray this marvellous movie of Tony Kaye. It is not just about high schools students and teachers it is about unbearable vulnerability of being human at any age facing our problems not knowing how to handle them holding our guards high building walls around us to try to protect ourselves and finally surrendering hopelessly or hopefully. You will see those different choices people are making. This movie perfectly answers the question in Ray LaMontagne's soulful soundtrack song Empty Will I always feel this way? So empty so estranged? Watch it to get your answer... Life is so chaotic not always in a bad way. It may bring happiness too unexpectedly. This movie is one of those good things in life.".

	schema:headline " a powerful and moving tale of a substitute teacher and the intersecting lives in a high school";
	schema:reviewBody "Tony Kaye is not known for having happygolucky tales that leave you feeling better about the status of our world. Even in light and glorious colored shots Kaye tells stories with deeper inner conflict and demanding commentary about our society. His most famous work American History X a project that he famously wanted his name taken off of after being upset by edits star Edward Norton made to the film was a film that showed these dark struggles and issues in a film about a neo nazi group and their attitude towards the world.In his new film Detachment a film he has kept his name on Kaye and first time writer Carl Lund tell the story of a substitute teacher who travels from school to school trying his best to help the lives of his students his own life and the community he is in. The substitute is Henry Barthes played by Adrien Brody who is a man that has his own inner struggles and past conflicts that he fights with daytoday. But Henry must try to put these issues aside when he enters the classroom at this school a school at which the students don't care the teachers struggle to educate and everyone takes a toll from the experiences.What Lund does so brilliantly in his writing is creating a story that doesn't give one perspective of the situation. He tells the story through the eyes of Henry the students the parents and even a young prostitute Henry befriends. In fact even as Henry is the main character of this story we still get perspective from many of the other teachers played by James Caan Tim Blake Nelson Christina Hendricks Blythe Danner Lucy Liu and Marcia Gay Harden. The student stories range from a young girl who struggles with weight problems parents pressuring her and bullying to students who act tough and thug and threaten harm to the teachers. What results from this is a multifaceted story that gives many perspectives and tales. Like The Wire inside a high school.As the tale moves along we get to know each of these characters deeply and care for them a great deal. From the relationship that forms between Henry and the young prostitute named Erica to the conversations between teachers discussing how they could be better the film places us within this harsh world of a school and asks us what can be done about bettering our youth bettering our communities and bettering ourselves.The film also touches briefly and comments on the outside factors that affect daytoday school life. From advertisements and social norms telling us how we should act and who we should be to apathetic parenting that leads to a Parent Night with almost no attendees Kaye and Lund construct a film that demands us to want more shows us some of the factors that lead to these problems and confesses there are no easy answers. As Henry begs his students to think for themselves and care for something more than just them Kaye and Lund bring in the outer conflicts that impact these kids and cause the inability for them to think this way. This is no easy road with a simple answer. It is complex with many different intersecting avenues.Outside of the strong construction of the story by Lund and the beautiful cinematography and strong directing from Kaye this film also benefits deeply from the acting performances specifically from Adrien Brody. While Caan Nelson Hendricks Danner Liu Harden and newcomers Sami Gayle Erica and Tony's daughter Betty Kaye the bullied Meredith are all brilliant Brody is absolutely enthralling. While Brody's career has not blown up since his Best Actor Oscar for The Pianist a few Wes Anderson films The Brothers Bloom King Kong The Village Hollywoodland and Splice on the short and not extremely noteworthy list he is so powerful and strong in Detachment. With the ability to say so much with so little and controlling every scene he is in Brody reminds us why he is an Academy Award winner while making us laugh and cry with him throughout this film.Detachment is an extremely effective and emotional tale that will both warm and break your heart. The story lines of the film intersect and converge like a graceful car crash. The pain of one interaction morphs into the joy of a different one. Haunting memories of the past bring up pain in the present. With careful construction of the world of this school along with Kaye's masterful direction and photography and some brilliant thespianism by Brody and the rest of the cast Detachment is a film that can impact a person in so many ways. Just as Henry tries to have an influence on all the lives he meets in the short period he substitutes so does Kaye educate and ask questions to his audience and demand that we think a little more about ourselves those around us and the community we are all a part of. That we must not stay detached but become an important and productive member for ourselves and everyone around us.Read more Film reviews and more at CustodianFilmCritic.com".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most rancid cinematographic formulas is that one in which an unusual teacher achieves raising the conscience from hisher apathetic students inspiring them to overcome themselves and fight against any external or internal obstacle which interposes on their road to education. The truth is that that subject feels a bit spent specially when it lacks of conviction and is only employed as a forced ingredient to produce emotion and tears. Before watching Detachment I thought it was going to be one of those films fortunately the reality ended up being very different because even though I didn't find it always sincere it undoubtedly represents an audacious and innovative interpretation of the miraculous teacher subject which deserves to be seen not only because of its valid message but also because of its excellent performances and solid direction. We needed something like this after the atrocious Bad Teacher...In other circumstances I would be frustrated by a movie with such many characters such many subplots and such little time to fully develop them as Detachment. However screenwriter Carl Lund handled the story with pretty much eloquence painting the events and relationships with broad strokes in order to later fill in the holes with economic but potent details of a big emotional force. As a consequence when we reach the ending the story feels simultaneously satisfactory logical and inspiring without submitting itself to the classic happy ending from Hollywood. The actors make a perfect work starting by Adrien Brody who transmits the melancholy which has eroded his character's soul through the years without the need of words. The supporting cast is also worthy of applause highlighting James Caan Lucy Liu and Marcia Gay Harden.I would also like to mention the excellent score from the Newton Brothers and Barry Alexander Brown's precise edition which complement the directing style from Tony Kaye who had left me amazed in the late90s with the extraordinary American History X which is simultaneously simple and meticulous. On the negative side from Detachment a few scenes and situations feel excessively convenient and simplified particularly there's near the ending a tragedy I found totally gratuitous predictable and unnecessary. I also found some monologues a bit pretentious and forced. Nevertheless I liked Detachment pretty much and I definitely consider it worthy of a recommendation.".

Beyond getting the money the basic goal of each con is to ensure the mark is so scared by what has happened  usually being an accomplice in a murder  that he won't come back looking for the money. Jake learns the hard way that their latest mark Louis Dolby who they fleeced for 150000 was carrying money for a criminal named King who takes a no prisoners approach in getting even he who knows who stole his money. Instead of returning the 150000 to King money which he no longer has anyway Jake convinces King to parlay that money and a bit more into a bigger con against a mark of King's choice that person being banker Morgan ...";

The drama can't be too funny and the comedy can't be too sad. Action flicks can't be too deep and serious movies have to be somewhat boring.On the rare occasions when some movie comes along that breaks these rules we usually get cinematic excellence. But with Confidence don't be expecting any deviation from the format. Confidence is a fun enjoyable light caper movie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. And for what it is it's not half bad.Edward Burns plays a con man Jake Vig. Together with his crew of seasoned confident fellow con men he scams people out of money. Lots of money. And of course sooner or later he's bound to pick the wrong person to scam. In this case it's a seemingly innocuous accountant who just happens to work for a mob kingpin cheesily called the King but played brilliantly by Dustin Hoffman. In a tight spot Jake agrees to do a con and split the proceeds with the King to get him off his back. What follows is the usual series of crosses doublecrosses and triplecrosses while everyone tries to figure out who to trust and who's about to screw who over.When I say that Confidence follows the rules I mean it. Crime capers must have wisetalking characters. This does. Crime capers must be stylish. This is. Crime capers must have the token female whose role is to be sexy but not too sexy. Rachel Weisz fills the part here and does a decent job at it. Other such token women included Julia Roberts in Ocean's Eleven and Angela Bassett in The Score. Crime capers must make the audience scratch their heads trying to piece it all together but must not make them think about any deeper moral issues of right and wrong. Again Confidence lives up to that deal on both counts.Still it was fun escapist entertainment. And without giving away too much of the ending let's just say that I'm always impressed with a movie that manages to surprise me. That alone makes it worth seeing.".

And we also have a pair of the LAPD's Not Finest adding a humorous dimension not often found in tough rogue cops on the take.And then there's Rachel Weisz  I've been a fan of her acting since About a Boy and Enemy at the Gates.  Certainly she's an emerging star and it's her acting ability plus her beauty that's taking her to leading roles.  An English actress she joins Cate Blanchett and Nicole Kidman  Down Under natives  in flawlessly speaking like a Yank or a SOCAL denizen not quite the same thing.Don't look for a true mystery here.

'Confidence' stars the personable Edward Burns as Jake Vig a confident con artist who heads up a gang of trickeryconsumed swindlers.

It's safe to assume that somewhere along the way somebody's getting the rug pulled out from underneath him. Somebody's getting conned. Unfortunately in this instance the audience is getting somewhat conned as well. It's a movie of tricks a movie which wants to impress you with how smart it is. But it's not nearly as smart as those involved in making it would like to believe. It's all too predictable and thus in the end not nearly as dramatic as would be hoped. As any good con artist movie would this one has all kinds of twists and turns to try and throw you off. But you can see where this is headed a mile away. The movie tries to fool you but it telegraphs its ultimate destination very early on. The big surprises are ultimately not surprising at all. And thus the movie fails.If the story ultimately lets you down you would hope that the movie at least works as a good bit of fun. But we are denied even that pleasure. It's rather dull moments of true excitement are very few and far between. The whole movie suffers from a lack of personality which is best personified by the lead character of Jake Vig played by Edward Burns. This is the character at the heart of the movie it's his story he even serves as the film's narrator. And the character just doesn't work. Burns obviously was going for cool calm and collected in his portrayal of Jake. In that he succeeds but in doing so he has created a character that's rather boring. There's no spark to this guy no reason why the audience should identify with or care about him. There's nothing memorable about him. On the other end of the spectrum there's Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of the crime lord known only as The King. This character is to put it mildly an eccentric fellow. A little too eccentric to take seriously. We're supposed to find him menacing but that's quite a stretch. It's another key character which just doesn't work. Which leaves very little left to potentially salvage the movie. Some of the supporting performances notably those of Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz work better but they are not nearly enough to prop this movie up. The key characters don't connect there's very little in the way of fun or entertainment and after jerking you around all the way through the story lands with a resounding thud.

	schema:headline " Los Angeles and two smoking barrels";
	schema:reviewBody "Everyone probably thought they had seen the last of the caper movies when Sinatra et al. made the original Oceans 11 forty years ago. Not so as this film inter alia is abundant proof of its reemergence. The Brit Gangster revival cycle initiated by Lock Stock and two smoking barrels seems to have cross germinated with the Oceans Eleven remake and spawned a genetically modified caper for the 21st. century of which this film is but one of many.Normally my John Bull heart would swell with pride as Pinewood influences Hollywood but not so in this case. Guy Ritchie's shtick does not travel and this film just does not quite work on a number of levels.I have described this film as a caper but I think the director has tried to make something more than a simple caper movie. However there are problems with this approach. First of all it seems he cannot decide what tone it should take. Is it ironic or parodic or a comic book adventure a pastiche or a spoof? No one can tell. The director probably feels that the film dances nimbly between all these categories artfully evading any pigeon hole. However as a humble viewer I just felt it was a mishmash that lacked the courage of its convictions to set out its stall in any particular category. It did not convince as an example of irony or a comic book adventure or an exercise in cool.I think someone defined a caper movie as one in which the people making the film had more fun making it than the audience had watching it In that case the film falls straight in the middle of the caper bracket. the film is too slick and too knowing. These are common afflictions in contemporary films which you would probably overlook if the film was good enough in other respects. Although this film has redeeming features they do not compensate for these shortcomings.It has some great character actors in the cast who give good performances Giametti Guzman Garcia in fact everyone except the two main actors portraying the central couple Edward Burns and Rachel Weisz. The character played by Burns is supposed to be the hub around which the whole film revolves but I am afraid in this case the axle is broken. Burns cannot carry the film and is constantly outshone by the actors that surround him. I get the impression that he is supposed to be the oldfashioned straight in the old sense lead whose looks offset all the ugly character actors. However he radiates zero menace or malevolence or evil or anything that might make him believable in the role. Things to do in Denver when you're dead survived without a good looking bland central character so why does this film need one. Maybe the guy is box office as I believe they say but I have never heard of him so how exactly did he add to the film.And so on to the vexed subject of Rachel Weisz's performance. It amazes me that Americans tolerate my fellow nationals doing lame nonspecific nonregional faltering American accents. She came across as a Helena Bonham Carter for the 2000s. If this had been done by Merchant Ivory then she might have fitted right in but it wasn't and she didn't.I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone but a couple of the set ups for con tricks were just poor. I will mention one episode which is not intrinsic to the plot where a rich customer in a jewellery shop gets reeled in. It is a popular misconception in films that rich people are stupid dupes who are easily parted from their money. This is lazy plotting. Rich people are usually not rich by accident unless they are lottery winners of course. They are rich because they know how to get money and then how to hold on to it. Is it really that easy to part them from their money? A lot of con artists doing time might suggest otherwise.My final issue with the film is the first ten minutes which are as wooden as any episode of Murder she wrote. Is this a stylistic device or are the first ten minutes of the film just really badly made. The jury is out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Everyone probably thought they had seen the last of the caper movies when Sinatra et al. made the original Oceans 11 forty years ago. Not so as this film inter alia is abundant proof of its reemergence. The Brit Gangster revival cycle initiated by Lock Stock and two smoking barrels seems to have cross germinated with the Oceans Eleven remake and spawned a genetically modified caper for the 21st. century of which this film is but one of many.Normally my John Bull heart would swell with pride as Pinewood influences Hollywood but not so in this case. Guy Ritchie's shtick does not travel and this film just does not quite work on a number of levels.I have described this film as a caper but I think the director has tried to make something more than a simple caper movie. However there are problems with this approach. First of all it seems he cannot decide what tone it should take. Is it ironic or parodic or a comic book adventure a pastiche or a spoof? No one can tell. The director probably feels that the film dances nimbly between all these categories artfully evading any pigeon hole. However as a humble viewer I just felt it was a mishmash that lacked the courage of its convictions to set out its stall in any particular category. It did not convince as an example of irony or a comic book adventure or an exercise in cool.I think someone defined a caper movie as one in which the people making the film had more fun making it than the audience had watching it In that case the film falls straight in the middle of the caper bracket. the film is too slick and too knowing. These are common afflictions in contemporary films which you would probably overlook if the film was good enough in other respects. Although this film has redeeming features they do not compensate for these shortcomings.It has some great character actors in the cast who give good performances Giametti Guzman Garcia in fact everyone except the two main actors portraying the central couple Edward Burns and Rachel Weisz. The character played by Burns is supposed to be the hub around which the whole film revolves but I am afraid in this case the axle is broken. Burns cannot carry the film and is constantly outshone by the actors that surround him. I get the impression that he is supposed to be the oldfashioned straight in the old sense lead whose looks offset all the ugly character actors. However he radiates zero menace or malevolence or evil or anything that might make him believable in the role. Things to do in Denver when you're dead survived without a good looking bland central character so why does this film need one.

Principally the biggest draw is Dustin Hoffmans performance. His character the mobster King a sleaze bag with a volcanic personality reminded me a lot of the character he played in the understated 1970's classic crimedrama Straight Time which if you have not seen you really should check out. The scenes of Hoffman simultaneously threatening and coming on to Ed Burns are tense and darkly humorous.At other times the movie tries to be quirky and with its jaunty musical score gives the film a frustratingly uneven tone. Edward Burns is fine as the leader of the scam artist crew but i didn't buy into the other crew members one of whom should really stick to comedy. The addition of Rachael Weisz to the crew failed to impress me. When you consider strong female roles that make an impression in for example The Grifters and House of Games Weisz really comes up short. The snaring of their mark for the sting to pay off King does not ring true. The promise of a honey trap is floated but the banker does not even have to sleep with Weisz in order to be suckered in and this is not believable. Andy Garcia pops up in an extended cameo to harass the two goonish cops who are helping and skimming Ed Burns but again this facet is played mostly for laughs.The ending was entirely predictable when it should have left you guessing and again not enough Hoffman.".

The movie is only 97 minutes and it keeps the audience engaged throughout. The story is nothing special but is believable due to some solid acting from the leads.

He also neglects to mention the federal marshal on his trail who could land the entire lot of them in prison.Like he did in Glengarry Glen Ross Foley demonstrates considerable skill working with an ensemble aptly balancing the characters with the needs of the story. As a technical exercise Confidence is welltuned and the 98 minute running time feels just about right. The script brims with terrific dialogue which the cast takes great relish in delivering and the uniformly excellent performances never become forced or mannered .Dustin Hoffman gives a fresh and original performance that should have landed him at the very least an Oscar nomination. Like the length of the film is just about perfect. It's incredibly fast paced. This one movie that has rewatchability written all over it and an excellent flick that should not be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is really just another con game movie like The Sting or House of Games and the only thing that really stands out is the fun performance of Dustin Hoffman. Story is about a con man named Jake Vig Edward Burns who along with his crew bilks money out of people by faking murders but one day during a scam they learned they conned 100000 dollars out of a bagman who works for The King Hoffman. Vig comes to learn that they are in deep trouble if they don't give the money back because of the reputation of The King. Vig confronts The King at his strip club and tells him he will get his money back in due time but also wants him to finance him for another scam. The King agrees and sends along one of his henchman and a woman named Lily Rachel Weisz to watch them. Vig needs some dirty cops to help them and knows of two and they also agree but they don't know that an agent named Gunther Butan Andy Garcia has been tailing Vig for a long time and tells the two cops to help him. There is the usual double twists in the story and you never really know who to trust and of course Vig and Lily get romantic. For me their are two things that I did like about the film. The first is the sharp dialogue that is written for the characters. Its colorful and the characters are given some biting phrases that reminds one of David Mamet At least a little bit!. The other thing is the performance of Hoffman. Its a treat to watch him as a mob boss and its a well written role as we see all the personality flaws that he exhibits. He talks of attention deficit disorder and of having to take pills to keep him in line. But their are things in this film that cannot go unnoticed. Burns just seems to be to young and to smart to be doing cons for a living. There are guys in his crew that are twice his age and they all seem to be capable of being in charge of their own gang. Why follow this young guy around? A role like this needs an actor who looks like a guy that has been around the block and been in tough scrapes before. A veteran like Bogart Deniro Hackman Douglas and guys like that. Not some young buck who looks like he should be in college. Very familiar story that is pretty well made and thats because of the talent of director James Foley who I think is a very underrated artist. No where near as good as House of Games but its a decent effort by all. I do recommend this film but I hope viewers don't expect anything original.".

Also being a sap for redheads they are not bad luck but that whole sequence in the movie is pretty funny nonetheless.Anyway now for the good things. The film as a whole was pretty well made presenting some interesting angles and lighting schemes that just beamed with charisma. It felt perfect for the seedy underworld these people were living in. Once again though Weisz was the only beacon in a film full of cartoonish performances. Fortunately Luis Guzman and Donal Logue provided some relief from the onslaught.

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know much about Invasion before I walked into this movie. I heard the bad reviews from critics but hell who listens to them? While watching this movie I wasn't aware that The Invasion was refilmed and rewritten. Apparently they rewrote it to add the twist in the end as well as they added more action sequences with faster and betterangled camera work.So the movie starts off right away with Carol Bennell Nicole Kidman scattering around the medicine cabinet in a Pharmacy whispering stay awake don't fall asleep to herself. The neat fastpaced camera work kept you right into the movie from the beginning but sadly the amazing beginning just doesn't match up to the pathetic ending. It seemed like they got tired of writing the movie so they decided to end it off with a simply and quick ending.Some organism from a different planet crashed down to Earth and took over the citizens of the world. When the organism comes in contact with a human they will become a different alienish like being obsessed with capturing people and affecting the world with their plague. When each person was affected they would turn into these emotionless mindless and painless zombies while they sleep. In search of her son Carol Bennell gets affected and must stay awake so she would be able to save her boy. With help from Ben Driscoll Daniel Craig and his team of doctors they go on the search for a cure to save humanity and especially save Carol.I find that this movie gave off the message it was trying to but in the process it failed at almost everything else. I was expecting before walking into this movie that it would be filled with suspense with my heart jumping ever so often... but I wasn't scared or thrilled once. The suspense scenes had great music playing had the great camera angles but was just missing the spice to make it really work. And in regards to the end of the movie... I can promise you the writers got tired of having to rewrite a story and just through in a quick painless ending. Course the quick painless ending resulted in annoyance for the audience.While I walked out of the theater I was thinking about this movie and how I would interpret it. One thing came to my head and it was that the new directors did what they were supposed to  make me think and remember this movie once I leave the theater. This was NOT a forgettable movie rather quite memorable. Sure there was a bad ending but my eyes were attached to the screen throughout the whole film. I didn't look at my watch once and for me that gives this movie a big bonus.".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually went into this movie with pretty high expectations considering that the Wachowski brothers were involved and it seemed like an interesting premise from the trailers. Well as it turned out somehow all of that potential was utterly wasted. From beginning to end this movie is boring predictable and terribly clichd. I kept hoping until the end that at some point it would get better but bit for bit everything in this movie is the epitome of all that is trite and stale in scifi movies and little to nothing of what is interesting and original. Every crummy scifihorror movie starts out with little hints of whatever fantastic thing is supposed to happen later and so did The Invasion. Except in The Invasion this whole section keeps pointing out things to the audience that were mindnumbingly obvious. My husband is not my husband anymore... Oh really? Well surely she's just some nutcase and it has nothing to do with the storyline that's been explained on TV commercials and in movie trailers for the past several months! I honestly don't understand why filmmakers like these frequently feel the need to spend half of the movie beating the audience over the head with information that they could and probably already did find in a one sentence synopsis of the film. Per the typical trite scifihorror movie formula there's also a scene where the main character brings a same of something weird to a scientist and he examines it and conveniently explains everything that the audience needs to know about the substancediseasealien race in a straightforward uninteresting way. There are so many scenes like this where the characters are supposed to be revealing something new and interesting but it just comes out as if the writers think that the audience is a a bunch of slobbering morons who can't take a simple hint. Here's one detail that particularly struck me for its idiocy about a third of the way through the movie there's a scene where the Russian guy who cares what his name is basically explains through a convenient monologue the thesis of the movie which goes something like a world without newspapers constantly talking about violence and hatred is a world without humanity. Later on there are some segments showing on a TV that say that fighting has ended in Iraq and then Daniel Craig's character gives another speech that is very obviously supposed to be a counterpoint to the first one that goes something like in our world there is no need to hurt one another. At the end after the aliens are nearly destroyed Daniel Craig talks about how 87 people just died in Iraq. As if ALL this information wasn't enough to make you draw some sort of a connection they just have to drill it directly into your skull by replaying the Russian guy's quote again. I could mention plenty more things like this but I'm starting to get annoyed.".

And what they did was to add car chases crashes helicopters fires and senseless violence in general. Inserted into the original movie at close intervals to keep people amused or so they thought. Now there are a few good directors who can pull out a combination of slow burn and crazy action. But a patchwork movie made of two different directors' bits guys with widely opposed instincts and goals no wonder the result is a flop.If anything is to be learned from this it's how little do Hollywood executives know about what makes a good movie. Granted a nonstop mishmash of violence and fifthdrink bar philosophy like The Matrix can earn the big bucks but you can't expect Matrixlike bits to improve what was intended to be a slow paced moody film.

I have read some critical reviews questioning the casting of Kidman in this role mostly due to the fact that her icy demeanor is seemingly miscast in a role that calls for emotion. However I believe that it is this very demeanor that allows her to be believable in this film. She plays an extremely smart psychologist who catches on to the situation fast. She is an analyzer and it is her lack of deep emotion that allows for her to think quickly and critically without it she would have easily succumbed to the body snatchers and there would have been no movie. There is indeed a liberal undercurrent through this movie. It questions our role in Iraq but more importantly it questions our actions as a species our emotions our anger our selfishness and their effects on our society. To create a world in which everyone is equal rational no war no disease no famine no inequality is what the body snatchers are offering...and for this movie goer there was at least one point in the film in which I found myself asking whether that would be so bad.

	schema:reviewBody "I admit that I was hesitant about seeing The Invasion after reading some poor reviews and coming to this message board. I also was leery after learning that part of it was reshot by different directors which is usually a very bad sign. Plus the fact that they give Kidman a kid in this film had me leery for I often grow weary of female leads in suspenseactionhorror films having to protect children instead of other adults like male leads do especially if the kids are annoying.So I almost didn't see The Invasion after reading and hearing all of the complaints about no plot no real character development bad acting and poor directingediting.Yet I finally agreed to just go with my gut and take a chance on a matine show of The Invasion. Boy am I glad that I did not only because I did not have to pay the outrageous full price of ten bucks but I actually liked this film.Despite what some are saying this film does have a plot. People are actually doing things that lead to other plot points like the whole deal with Veronica Cartwright's character and Kidman's character leaving her son with the exhusband. These two story lines lead to important discoveries and actions that happen later on in the film.Also there is character development. Kidman's character does develop because she's forced to change in order to survive and to protect herself and her son. The warm relationship between Kidman's character and her son and Ben also is established.So beyond these relationships do we really need to dwell on the other characters for too long? After all this is a plot driven movie not a character driven movie. Besides if they had taken time to thoroughly get into everyone else's back story people would be whining about the movie being too long. But I digress.Also I thought that all of the actors did a good job especially Kidman. She showed good range from being a caring psychiatrist to a loving mother to a terrified woman to a desperate mother who would do anything to protect her child. I also like the mood and tone of this film. Granted the Pod People in the 1956 and 1978 versions were a tad bit creepier but I liked this film better than the 1978 version overall and I didn't miss that crazy scream. However the 1956 version is definitely a classic.Sure The Invasion is not perfect and it has it flaws and I feel that the studio probably should have left the original version alone. After all the majority of the film is stronger than the last half which is obviously where the reshoots took place. Still despite the unnecessary out of order time cuts and a tad too many car crashes the film still worked for me. I was definitely entertained.Now that's saying a lot especially since I went in with low expectations.".

Plus the fact that they give Kidman a kid in this film had me leery for I often grow weary of female leads in suspenseactionhorror films having to protect children instead of other adults like male leads do especially if the kids are annoying.So I almost didn't see The Invasion after reading and hearing all of the complaints about no plot no real character development bad acting and poor directingediting.Yet I finally agreed to just go with my gut and take a chance on a matine show of The Invasion. Boy am I glad that I did not only because I did not have to pay the outrageous full price of ten bucks but I actually liked this film.Despite what some are saying this film does have a plot. People are actually doing things that lead to other plot points like the whole deal with Veronica Cartwright's character and Kidman's character leaving her son with the exhusband. These two story lines lead to important discoveries and actions that happen later on in the film.Also there is character development. Kidman's character does develop because she's forced to change in order to survive and to protect herself and her son. The warm relationship between Kidman's character and her son and Ben also is established.So beyond these relationships do we really need to dwell on the other characters for too long? After all this is a plot driven movie not a character driven movie. Besides if they had taken time to thoroughly get into everyone else's back story people would be whining about the movie being too long. But I digress.Also I thought that all of the actors did a good job especially Kidman. She showed good range from being a caring psychiatrist to a loving mother to a terrified woman to a desperate mother who would do anything to protect her child. I also like the mood and tone of this film. Granted the Pod People in the 1956 and 1978 versions were a tad bit creepier but I liked this film better than the 1978 version overall and I didn't miss that crazy scream. However the 1956 version is definitely a classic.Sure The Invasion is not perfect and it has it flaws and I feel that the studio probably should have left the original version alone. After all the majority of the film is stronger than the last half which is obviously where the reshoots took place. Still despite the unnecessary out of order time cuts and a tad too many car crashes the film still worked for me. I was definitely entertained.Now that's saying a lot especially since I went in with low expectations.";

Despite all the heavy and quite ugly criticism this movie received it had a fair cast and it isn't too often that Nicole Kidman is in something completely awful. Let it be known as well that I am a big fan of both the original and the 1978 versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It is reasonable to speculate that fans of either of those two films will be disappointed with this latest stab at the body snatcher storyline.However I asked myself is the point to compare this film against its predecessors or should I evaluate this film on its own merits alone? I decided the latter was the right course and with this in mind I watched The Invasion.The film opens with a very frantic Carol Bennell played by Nicole Kidman rummaging through the shelves of a pharmacy. She is searching for sleep suppressants. We are then taken back in a recent past where a space shuttle crash lands into the countryside. The shuttle's wreckage has brought back something with it. From the moment that Bennell's exhusband played Jeremy Northam pricks his fingers on a foreign organism life becomes a serious drag for the evidently terrible human species. Bennell who is a psychiatrist doesn't get it at first when one of her patients played by Veronica Cartwright who also starred in the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers irately claims her husband isn't her husband. But it doesn't take long before Bennell figured out that all is not right in Everytown USA.This film was not awful. This was by no means the worst of the snatchers makeovers. 1993's Body Snatchers is my nominee for that award. There were some moments in this film that worked well such as a brief but tense scene when Bennell and her son played by Jackson Bond are unsure whether the other is... them. I also liked the attempt at a different approach to the body snatching method. All in all for me what kept me watching was Kidman. No not just because she's a superhottie although it never hurts. She adeptly became Bennell and breathed life into her character. I actually thought this was one of her better performances. This could have been an excellent film but as is all too often the case these days character development was not a priority. Beyond Kidman as Bennell character development was nonexistent. How people are being snatched also is never adequately not even remotely explained. Wherein the other snatcher films while the victim sleeps their body rotted away and their alien replacement is created within a giant peapod in The Invasion the process is never identified. This makes for a very weak ending. Truly with today's SFX this could have been an extraordinary revelation. What was most disappointing was the attempt at social and political commentary. Good grief! I cannot think of a more articulate adjective then just plain...lame.".

Considering the talent involved in this project however I'm actually a bit disturbed at how bad it turned out. Oliver Hirschbiegel directed the outstanding WWII film Downfall a few years ago and Nicole Kidman is among Hollywood's greatest actresses of this or any other era. Baffled by how terrible the film turned out to be I did some research. Apparently the producers of the film weren't happy with Hirschbiegel's vision so they went ahead and had a completely different director James McTeigue director of V for Vendetta reshoot entire scenes. This was clearly a terrible idea but probably not the only reason for it's failure.The plot presented here as thin as it is to begin with basically goes nowhere at all. Kidman's character contracts the 'virus' from her exhusband in an attempt to take her child from him to a treatment center of sorts. What's worse is that nothing of even remote interest happens before this and we're not exactly treated to edge of your seat suspense afterwards either. Kidman spends the rest of the film in search of this socalled treatment center while finding out along the way that her son is somehow immune to the virus. The virus for the sake of information can only fully convert you after you enter REM sleep. It's alien nature and motive are barely touched upon at all. There is of course the obligatory sub plot of lovers unconvincingly played out between Kidman and Craig that are best friends but really think it's best if they stayed that way even though they clearly want to be with each other. You know the usual Lifetime network effect. We're also given a handful of mediocre to terrible supporting characters that are each given their share of awful dialogue to delight us with.I suppose it's not among the worst films I've ever seen but it is without a doubt a miserable one. There are a few solid scenes with Kidman that quite literally save this from being a complete and utter waste of 93 minutes but even those are few and far between. On the whole the film fails at literally every genre it attempts or presents from SciFi to Action and worst of all Horror. This is the least horrifying Horror film I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. I hope for the sake of film that this talented director chooses to build on the promise he showed in Downfall by putting this embarrassment as far behind him as possible. To his credit though I would have to assume that whatever Hirschbiegel originally filmed was at least a few steps above the final product that was somehow unleashed upon the viewer.".

The newest thing here is that the zombies sometimes kind of spitvomit on their victimsa new thing that i just couldn't appreciate!The best new variation here is the addition of a story plot stating the fact that her kid couldn't be contaminated and therefore has to be eliminated.This then gaves a very powerful motivation to escapea motivation that anybody can understand.The additional scenes involving what seems to be a two part car chaseone with fire on the car and one withoutis just too little too late to turn this average film into a must see film.".

	schema:headline " Too many cooks";
	schema:reviewBody "This updating of Jack Finney's 'Body Snatchers' story directed according to the credits anyway by Oliver Hirschbiegel of the gripping lastdaysofHitler film 'The Downfall' clumsily interweaves a lowkeyed mood piece with some loud mayhemnoisy car chases and a helicopter rescue in which Nicole Kidman proves to be a mean racing driver. She also on several occasions kills some people in cold bloodrare moments of fun for an audience starved for a little violence relevant to the original plot. There isn't a lot else happening on screen despite the fact that masses of Americans are being turned by an alien virus into soberly dressed tidy zombies whose aim is to create a more orderly peaceful world. The ironythough clearly underdevelopedis that this positive transformation isn't what people want. They the infected ones are trapping people infecting them and taking away their personalities. They sneeze on them and the virus takes effect during their REM sleep. There's a new twist somewhere here about how visions of a better world get compromised in the execution but it gets lost in the botched result.There are no monsters or gooey ectoplasm just little sheaths of clear tissue and some people whose faces glaze overall of which from the horroractionmovie standpoint comes off as pretty tame. And the creepy psychological elementsand the ideas about various social and political issuearen't allowed to develop fully either.This new scaling down of the old story appears to have all the earmarks of a low budget piece except a low budget. With big crowd scenes and the likes of Craig and Kidman signed on it must have cost a few bucks. Actually Craig did this before he got the 007 franchise which explains a lot. In any case the technical package reads as mediocre. Lacking is the spectacular excitement of the 'Alien' movies or earlier 'Body Snatchers' onesor the military ironies and fast action of the recent '28 Weeks Later' which like this which is set in DC is full of political references. But in the case of '28 Weeks' the political satire is integrated into the action in ways that are far more cinematic and satirically effective. What went wrong here?Apparently what happened to 'The Invasion' was too many surgeries by opposing doctors. Hirschbiegel originally had a lowkeyed horror movie going on we feel its chilling menace in the early sequences. Then because of some poor test audience responses the producers called upon the Wachowski brothers to inject some action into the piece. This was when uncredited subdirector James McTeigue came along. The disconnect is superevident. Implausibility would have perhaps been inevitable in this story anyway but the clumsy patchwork destroys the mood and resolves everything with superconventional rescues and a tooeasy offscene medical solution that restores everything to normal. Oliver's little friend Gene Eric Benjamin who had turned into a nasty little monster is suddenly cured at the end and having lost his parents now lives with them. That's unintentionally creepy and a sign of how poorly structured the screenplay wound up being with too many cooks.The tiein between the alien virus and the leads is simply made. Carol Bennell Kidman is a psychiatrist. People are certainly beginning to act strangely and as a behavior professional she's qualified to note that. Those who've turned don't sweat or show emotion. Ms. Kidman says My patient's husband was infected by an alien virus and all I did was prescribe an antipsychotic drug. What an idiot I am! Yes but how was she to know? Her exhusband Tucker Jeremy Northam has turned and when Carol suspects this Tucker's sudden desire to have their little boy Oliver Jackson Bond spend time with him after a twoyear absence is deeply sinister. This movie might not be good for small children whose parents have separate households. Carol's boyfriendwait make that best friendBen Daniel Craig is a doctor who luckily knows Dr. Stephen Galeano Jeffrey Wright a brilliant actor completely wasted here an ace virus scientist. The creepy menace of early scenes which is truly disturbing is thrown away with a tooeasy resolution when vaguely referenced government efforts come together the invasion is eradicated off screen and little Oliver is saved from his creepy dad.A movie like 'The Invasion' which takes an old zombiealien theme and injects it with some political references incidentally makes one realize why Phillip K. Dick's writing is so often adapted to the screen Dick's books and stories are packed with original and provocative ideas. The thinking behind The Invasion is sloppy and skimpy. It seems to be talking primarily about how chilling and oppressive dogooders can be. This could be seen as a dark vision of how projects to make the world better may be compromised by authoritarianism. Jeffrey Wright is in the lab finding a cure and as Americans get their humanity back violence starts up again. The way to stay human is to keep the world a mess. The irony is heavy handed. Iraq Iraq Iraq comes at us from TV screens then as those infected with the alien virus begin to take over there is peace. The idea of a conflict between wanting to change for the better and clinging to our old animal instincts is potentially an interesting one. But it's not helped in this movie by throwing in references to other current stuff like distrust of government fear of a medicineresistant pandemic and squabbling with other exbloc nations in the Russian embassy. And none of these themes is well integrated into the actionnor do the events themselves seem menacing or exciting enough to outweigh the skimpiness of the ideas.This is a clear example of what happens when a studio tests a movie on an audience worries that it's too arty or subtle and calls in a team of fixers. The result is a hack job that has good moments but ends up not fully satisfying any audience.".

	onyx:emotionText "This updating of Jack Finney's 'Body Snatchers' story directed according to the credits anyway by Oliver Hirschbiegel of the gripping lastdaysofHitler film 'The Downfall' clumsily interweaves a lowkeyed mood piece with some loud mayhemnoisy car chases and a helicopter rescue in which Nicole Kidman proves to be a mean racing driver. She also on several occasions kills some people in cold bloodrare moments of fun for an audience starved for a little violence relevant to the original plot. There isn't a lot else happening on screen despite the fact that masses of Americans are being turned by an alien virus into soberly dressed tidy zombies whose aim is to create a more orderly peaceful world. The ironythough clearly underdevelopedis that this positive transformation isn't what people want. They the infected ones are trapping people infecting them and taking away their personalities. They sneeze on them and the virus takes effect during their REM sleep. There's a new twist somewhere here about how visions of a better world get compromised in the execution but it gets lost in the botched result.There are no monsters or gooey ectoplasm just little sheaths of clear tissue and some people whose faces glaze overall of which from the horroractionmovie standpoint comes off as pretty tame. And the creepy psychological elementsand the ideas about various social and political issuearen't allowed to develop fully either.This new scaling down of the old story appears to have all the earmarks of a low budget piece except a low budget. With big crowd scenes and the likes of Craig and Kidman signed on it must have cost a few bucks. Actually Craig did this before he got the 007 franchise which explains a lot. In any case the technical package reads as mediocre. Lacking is the spectacular excitement of the 'Alien' movies or earlier 'Body Snatchers' onesor the military ironies and fast action of the recent '28 Weeks Later' which like this which is set in DC is full of political references. But in the case of '28 Weeks' the political satire is integrated into the action in ways that are far more cinematic and satirically effective. What went wrong here?Apparently what happened to 'The Invasion' was too many surgeries by opposing doctors. Hirschbiegel originally had a lowkeyed horror movie going on we feel its chilling menace in the early sequences. Then because of some poor test audience responses the producers called upon the Wachowski brothers to inject some action into the piece. This was when uncredited subdirector James McTeigue came along. The disconnect is superevident. Implausibility would have perhaps been inevitable in this story anyway but the clumsy patchwork destroys the mood and resolves everything with superconventional rescues and a tooeasy offscene medical solution that restores everything to normal. Oliver's little friend Gene Eric Benjamin who had turned into a nasty little monster is suddenly cured at the end and having lost his parents now lives with them. That's unintentionally creepy and a sign of how poorly structured the screenplay wound up being with too many cooks.The tiein between the alien virus and the leads is simply made. Carol Bennell Kidman is a psychiatrist. People are certainly beginning to act strangely and as a behavior professional she's qualified to note that. Those who've turned don't sweat or show emotion. Ms. Kidman says My patient's husband was infected by an alien virus and all I did was prescribe an antipsychotic drug. What an idiot I am! Yes but how was she to know? Her exhusband Tucker Jeremy Northam has turned and when Carol suspects this Tucker's sudden desire to have their little boy Oliver Jackson Bond spend time with him after a twoyear absence is deeply sinister. This movie might not be good for small children whose parents have separate households. Carol's boyfriendwait make that best friendBen Daniel Craig is a doctor who luckily knows Dr. Stephen Galeano Jeffrey Wright a brilliant actor completely wasted here an ace virus scientist. The creepy menace of early scenes which is truly disturbing is thrown away with a tooeasy resolution when vaguely referenced government efforts come together the invasion is eradicated off screen and little Oliver is saved from his creepy dad.A movie like 'The Invasion' which takes an old zombiealien theme and injects it with some political references incidentally makes one realize why Phillip K. Dick's writing is so often adapted to the screen Dick's books and stories are packed with original and provocative ideas. The thinking behind The Invasion is sloppy and skimpy. It seems to be talking primarily about how chilling and oppressive dogooders can be. This could be seen as a dark vision of how projects to make the world better may be compromised by authoritarianism. Jeffrey Wright is in the lab finding a cure and as Americans get their humanity back violence starts up again. The way to stay human is to keep the world a mess. The irony is heavy handed. Iraq Iraq Iraq comes at us from TV screens then as those infected with the alien virus begin to take over there is peace. The idea of a conflict between wanting to change for the better and clinging to our old animal instincts is potentially an interesting one. But it's not helped in this movie by throwing in references to other current stuff like distrust of government fear of a medicineresistant pandemic and squabbling with other exbloc nations in the Russian embassy. And none of these themes is well integrated into the actionnor do the events themselves seem menacing or exciting enough to outweigh the skimpiness of the ideas.This is a clear example of what happens when a studio tests a movie on an audience worries that it's too arty or subtle and calls in a team of fixers. The result is a hack job that has good moments but ends up not fully satisfying any audience.";

	schema:headline " Projectile Vomit isn't just a feature of this movie  it's the perfect summary of what this movie is!";
	schema:reviewBody "Note It was not my choice to give this movie one star. I would have chosen to give it zero stars but there is no option to do so.The Invasion is a very badly done remake of 3 previous Invasion of the Body Snatchers films. Each of the 3 prior films was a masterpiece. The Invasion is simply put projectile vomit.Why does projectile vomit come to mind you may be wondering. The reason is because projectile vomit is literally spewing out of everyone's mouths constantly  gratuitously in the movie The Invasion. You see in The Invasion they have done away with the sophisticated method for turning people into emotionless zombielike drones from the 3 previous films. In the 3 previous films there was a process called podification that accomplished this. An alien plantlike pod would discreetly start growing next to and entangling itself with a host body while he or she slept and then it would create an exact clone body of his or hers and then destroy the host.But all that is way too outdated and not nearly so hip enough for The Invasion remake from 2007 in which the whole podification process is discarded and in it's place you guessed it projectile vomit. The aliens the pod people from all the previous 3 films are completely absent in The Invasion and in it's place you have humans who turn each other into drones by literally spewing projectile vomit onto each other. If you think it sounds disgusting you are right. Actually having the misfortune to be subjected to it in the movie is far more disgusting than me describing it though so if you read this review then decide that a movie based on projectile vomit is not your cup of tea then I have done you a favor by disgusting you somewhat now to save you from being even more disgusted from seeing it live onscreen. Oh word to the wise don't let that cup of tea anywhere near the virus carriers in this movie as they have been known to spew projectile vomit into tea cups as their one and only stealth tactic. Although usually they spread the virus simply by projectile vomiting into each other's faces. It is notable that while the other 3 films featured an alien race invading and taking over the Earth The Invasion only features a virus no aliens. Despite being entitled The Invasion! Go figure. Maybe they got so excited by their brilliant projectile vomit filmmaking innovation that they forgot the title no longer fit the movie they were making. The trademark scary muchbeloved alien shriek and finger pointing from all 3 previous films is also absent from The Invasion.The acting in this movie is universally terrible across the board. Nicole Kidman appears as if she is an emotionless drone in every single scene of the movie starting with the very first one. But she is supposed to be playing a normal woman not a drone so you can see why the whole movie slips on it's own projectile vomit and falls flat on it's face when the lead actress is required to be emotional for the premise of the movie to work yet due to the actress chosen for the role she is incapable to be emotional. There has been some compelling suggestions that perhaps it is botox that Nicole Kidman has injected which has caused her face to become incapable of moving in recent years. One thing is certain her face certainly does not move at all in The Invasion and there is little if any discernible way to tell Nicole from a projectile vomit drone victim at any point in this movie. They are equally emotionless due to bad acting on Kidman's part.Whilst driving in this movie Nicole Kidman completely turns around  while the vehicle is moving  to look at and talk to her son who is in the backseat. This is an act of lunacy. But it is played off in the movie as a normal thing to do. Not only is this bad for the character in the movie it is also socially irresponsible that the lead character the role model the hero of the film is shown to be driving in a ludicrously reckless way. If anyone watches this movie and then comes to think that to turn around to look at and talk to someone in the backseat while driving is acceptable behavior that could tragically lead to unnecessary fatalities in reallife. I suppose the projectile vomit innovation taking up most of the film makers' thoughts is again the reason why they didn't bother to pay any attention to this.This movie was extensively reshot by the brothers who made the Matrix films. Perhaps the original cut of the movie was somewhat sophisticated. But The Invasion that was released certainly was not. All the Matrix brothers did was add some extravagant car crash special effects to the movie. That's it. I suppose if you want to see some expensive car crashes this movie might be for you. But if you are expecting a decent story decent acting aliens or a movie that lives up the legendary brand name of Invasion of the Body Snatchers you will be sadly disappointed with The Invasion.Needless to say The Invasion is easily and by far the worst Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie. It's not even a good movie on it's own even if one pretends the other Body Snatchers movies don't exist.Do yourself a favor. Pass on The Invasion and rent all 3 of the previous Body Snatchers films each of which is vastly superior to The Invasion in every conceivable way. And best of all they don't have any projectile vomit.".

Same for Matt Dillon  totally unexpected but nice the same. Liked the atmosphere  setting which adds to the allure. A shame this was not better promoted as seems to be somewhat unknown.

Same for Matt Dillon  totally unexpected but nice the same. Liked the atmosphere  setting which adds to the allure. A shame this was not better promoted as seems to be somewhat unknown. Regardless people should really give this a chance  check it out. Will be purchasing this as I could watch many more times. Truly unique.";

Instead the FBI and its agents are portrayed as evil and devoid of integrity.

It is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back. The performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare. The trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects.This is a breakout role for Adam Sandler. While he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with PunchDrunk Love and Spanglish this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor. He deserves an Oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as Tom Hanks did and Jim Carrey is also doing. In this role he seemed to be trying to channel Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than Sandler's traumatized character both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of childlike isolation and confusion.Don Cheadle's performance is less surprising but just as good. After Hotel Rwanda and Crash we've come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from Cheadle. He has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role. But he too is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as Sandler's character. Cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist. Together the characters played by Cheadle and Sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do in a way that reminds me of Matt Damon and Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting. They are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again.Reign over Me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year. The soundtrack which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful. The filming in the streets of New York  a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself  is also quite beautiful. The supporting roles by Jada Pinkett Smith Liv Tyler Saffron Burrows in a very odd role Donald Sutherland and Mike Binder himself are all quite good.WriterDirector Mike Binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels. This is a story about grief family healing male friendship mental health and the meaning of love. Reign over Me does not disappoint. The film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters. Hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more characterdriven charming films like Reign over Me.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears. Many movies try to do this but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did. Adam Sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down. I'm not going to ruin anything but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering. Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance but is outshined by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances but nothing in the line of the two leading roles. Sandler's humor is still present which actually saved this film from being borderline depressing. There are several laughs to be had but don't think you will stay there long because it gets serious again without much warning.I could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains but I will cut this one short. I feel there is no need to tell you anything more. Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD it's 100 worth the time. A deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face...unless of course...you are a heartless soul.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears. Many movies try to do this but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did. Adam Sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down. I'm not going to ruin anything but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering. Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance but is outshined by Sandler.

	schema:headline " Can we get Chinese now?Reign Over Me";
	schema:reviewBody "Love hurts. That I think is the main message Mike Binder's newest film Reign Over Me brings across. Whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts. The great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future. No one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can't free themselves from alone. There is some heavy subject material here and I credit Binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay characterbased and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead. What could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 911 effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret.This is a new career performance for Adam Sandler. I like to think that my favorite director Paul Thomas Anderson was the first to see the childish pentup anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically. The juvenility of a character like Billy Madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around hima man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell. Anderson let Sandler do just that in his masterpiece PunchDrunk Love and Mike Binder has taken it one step further. Sandler plays former dentist Charlie Fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the World Trade Center on 911. That one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn't remember anything that happened before that day. He really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds. Always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his iPod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember.Reign Over Me is not about Charlie Fineman though it is about dentist and family man Alan Johnson. A man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony Johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate Charlie does. Played perfectly by the always brilliant Don Cheadle Johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life. He has no friends and when he sees Charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasn't felt in 15 years. He revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family. Cheadle's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and Sandler's doesn't mind because all that was before he met his wife. The two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives. Once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the faade they have created for themselves.The supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads. Jada Pinkett Smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with Cheadle that really showed me something different and true. Liv Tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting. The many small cameos are also effective even writerdirector Mike Binder's role as Sandler's old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film. Last but not least is the beautiful Saffron Burrows. She is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorce trying to put her life back together wonderfully. A role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come.Binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies I have seen in a long time. The direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion. Even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by The Who did Binder feel the need to use the inferior Eddie Veddar remake for the end I don't know but it did unfortunately stick out for me. Reign Over Me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope.".

	schema:headline " Good flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Reign Over Me is a success due to the powerful work by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. While comedic actors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction Sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles. Most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment. He might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems. However this performance has some considerable dramatic weight unlike his roles in less comedic fare like PunchDrunk Love and Spanglish.In the film Alan Johnson Cheadle runs into his old college roommate Charlie Finerman Sandler whom he hasn't seen in several years. Five years before Charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash. Charlie barely even recognizes Cheadle's character due to the repression of his memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident. It isn't until Alan persists in engaging him in conversation that Charlie remembers who he is. Their renewed relationship that follows will allow Finerman to have a friend who doesn't speak about his loss eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has suppressed on his own terms.Though writerdirector Mike Binder doesn't show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a bit awkward he does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from his actors while being a talented and funny writer. He shot this film with a digital camera as more and more filmmakers are doing today enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting. This kept the colorful backgrounds of New York City in focus but resulted in creating frequent digital grain which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screen.Almost every main character in Reign Over Me gives a great performance. JadaPinkett Smith and especially Liv Tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to Cheadle's character and a psychiatrist. However it is Sandler and Cheadle that give some of their finest work to date. They completely owned this movie. Sandler actually plays a character that doesn't outwardly resemble or act like himself at all partially credited to his Bob Dylanesquire wig. Though Cheadle's character has more screen time than Sandler they both should be considered to be leading roles as they equally support and help each other throughout the film.Music also plays a great part in this film especially the title song Reign Over Me or Love Reign O'er Me by The Who and later covered by Pearl Jam. In one of the most powerful moments of the film Binder shows Sandler using music to shut out his feelings and memories but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing his anger it incites his emotions. All an all Reign Over Me is an enjoyable sad yet many times funny film driven by its amazing leading performances.".

Adam Sandler stars as Charlie a man who lost his family in the 911 tragedy and has since lost his career his reason to live and arguably his sanity. Don Cheadle costars as Sandler's former Dental School roommate who appears to have the perfect life that Sandler apparently had prior to 911.Of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on display in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge that is. Watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt. WriterDirector Mike Binder The Upside of Anger and Sandler's accountant in this film really brings a different look and feel to the film. Some of the scenes don't work as well as others but overall it is well written and solidly directed.Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in Punch Drunk Love but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle.Support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith as Cheadle's wife Liv Tyler as a very patient psychiatrist Saffron Burrows in an oddly appealing role Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's inlaws.The film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some great shots of NYC you have to love any film that features vocals from Chrissy Hynde Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder impersonating Daltrey. Not exactly a chipper upbeat film but it is a quality film with an unusual story.".

For someone who plays primarily comedy roles he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input. I especially loved the scene in which Adam and Don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city. I familiarized with the moment because it seemed like Don was witnessing one thing Adam does to get away from it all. With his video games music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying at the young age of 34 I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated as he was NOT sick he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary his carotids blew out he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from police cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in. I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back. My children were as traumatized as I was so in love with a good father figure as he. I had three small children no education no financial support. I took it very very hard. Within two years my inlaws attacked me verbally physically emotionally and spiritually demanding I grieve not in front of the children and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see not show them my pain during holidays... Nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday except of course the grief therapist I was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul. My inlaws didn't get it! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them and I have never been back for a holiday. This is only one example of how my grief was disrespected! My own new husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared from my soul. I collapse can not breathe hyperventilate and generally am defunct for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain. Now about this movie...Today my soul was stirred my heart broken. My fears and pain resurfaced from the real demons this movie presents how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within. Adam Sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face overcome and most of all work through on your own time! This movie dredged up all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with. You see when something harms your soul so profoundly so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life in a dead state. The bible has a scripture Romans 826 that I have clung to that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for that God's Holy Spirit carries that agony to the feet of God I need not speak. Sandler portrayed that to perfection! There is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing for mental health commitment purposes and he goes back in to face his inlaws familiar to me and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by per Se that he can't get over. It's a profoundly strong and mighty performance. I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand my precise motions while trying to hold it all together a lesson for him my youngest who barely remembers his daddy. It's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my inlaws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires instead of respect to my own. I write this so that if you are a griever you are prepared for this movie but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance Sandler gave. If you are not yet a griever please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain. Go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in... to your soul!".

There is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing for mental health commitment purposes and he goes back in to face his inlaws familiar to me and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by per Se that he can't get over. It's a profoundly strong and mighty performance. I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand my precise motions while trying to hold it all together a lesson for him my youngest who barely remembers his daddy. It's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my inlaws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires instead of respect to my own. I write this so that if you are a griever you are prepared for this movie but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance Sandler gave. If you are not yet a griever please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain. Go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in... to your soul!";

The acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the Writing and directing of the film. This film focuses on the real Americans the past generation no stereotypes or Racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and coping. Instead of picking on Psychiatry it defines it not as someone who heals you magically but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you but rather will guide you though your thoughts.

Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion.I won't bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. He was funny and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies. Don Cheadle was believable as always.This movie isn't funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it. I'd say 90 of the audience laughed for most of the film. Midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together.I also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friendwhite friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would never have expected much from a film starring Adam Sandler Saffron Burrows Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smitn. Not that they're bad actors by any means. It's just that I have hardly found any movie that centred around their characters interesting at all. This is Sandler's first dramatic performance I've seen mind you I have not seen 'Punch Drunk Love' yet. The addition of Don Cheadle makes a difference where expectations were concerned but it is Sandler who springs a surprise with a very effective performance of a former dentist suffering from a severe form of posttraumatic stress disorder while coping or more correctly not coping with the loss of his family and living in a selfimposed isolation. His nuanced performance is a combination of restraint and subtle comedy. There are moments when he 'explodes' but it applies well to the context and Sandler stays within character. This is not to say that Cheadle was less impressive. The reason why he's less surprising is that one can almost always expect a good performance from this actor. What makes 'Reign Over Me' work most is Sandler and Cheadle's on screen camaraderie as they share the right chemistry. Cheadle's character too is suffering a difficult marriage and complications at work and his reunion with Sandler's Charlie provides a form of escape but at the same time helps him to deal with his own problems. This way both friends gradually find that pieces of themselves which they have long lost. Liv Tyler does well as Alon's confidant friend. Jada Pinkett Smith is quite adequate. Saffron Burrows is weird in an odd role but her sequences do provide comic relief. Melinda Dillon has a small but complex role and she shines. I liked the soundtrack very much. Not only are the tracks impressive it also gives a voice to New York a city which suffered the same tragedy as Charlie and flows brilliantly with the film. Binder's direction is solid for the most part. However the inclusion of a courtroom sequence including the whole Donald Sutherland track seems forced and makes 'Reign Over Me' slightly clichd. Perhaps this integral sequence could have been done a little different without involving a courtroom. Nonetheless 'Reign Over Me' has heart and it does tackle several different concepts in a subtle and suitable way. The way the comedy was wonderfully layered into the screenplay is quite an achievement for Binder. Strongly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "911 is a day that will live in the hearts and minds of everyone around the world. It was a day of change heartbreak and for many people it was a day of uniting with others to seek solace compassion and strength. And the events of that day form of the backbone of Mike Binder's astonishingly powerful film Reign Over Me starring Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle.Sandler plays Charlie Fineman a young man whose wife and children were on one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on September the 11th 2001. His whole world destroyed he broke down and retreated into himself becoming an odd hermit and recluse. He constantly obsesses over redoing the remodeling in his apartment and playing the video game Shadow of the Colossus. Fans of the game will understand how symbolic and provocative this detail is and how important it is to the story. Charlie is barely able to function in any sort of social norm suffering bizarre outbreaks of anger and paranoia and is almost completely unable to hold a normal conversation.Cheadle plays Alan Johnson a dentist who was friends and roommates with Fineman in college. Johnson is a normal man dealing with normal problems turbulence in his family life the death of his elderly father and the bizarre affections of a patient whom has fallen for him despite the fact he is married and won't cheat on his wife.After a chance encounter on the street leads to Johnson and Fineman reconnecting the film plays out as a heartbreakingyethopeful Odyssey as Johnson tries his best to help Fineman rebuild his life while trying to repair his own life at the same time.Other roles include Jada Pinkett Smith as Janeane Alan's wife. Liv Tyler as a psychologist Alan is familiar with whom decides to try and help Charlie and supporting roles by Donald Sutherland director Mike Binder Ted Raimi Saffron Burrows and others.This is very much an actor's movie. There are no big action sequences or laughoutloud setpieces. This is a subtle picture about the way lines are delivered and the twitches and undertones of the faces of the performers. And everyone in this film is remarkable. From tiny roles played by Binder Raimi Burrows etc. Everyone delivers fine performances.But Sandler and Cheadle are the heart of the film and I honestly feel both deserved Oscar Nods for their work here. Cheadle says so much in role and it was an admirable strong performance. And Sandler continues to prove his talent as a dramatic actor after his appearance in the incredible Punch Drunk Love. Sandler lets Fineman envelope him and he transforms himself so much he's near unrecognizable from his normal comedic roles. Sandler is a revelation in this role.Everything else about the film is top notch. From wonderful subtle direction to a heartbreaking and heat rebuilding script to some truly astonishing music this is a darnednearperfect film.I adore this movie. Reign Over Me is a triumph of human drama and I'd highly recommend it. An obvious 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reign Over Me 2007This might be the best movie to deal with the 911 attacks out there. At first that isn't clear but once you are done you realize that's all that matters. Out of nowhere a tragedy and its personal consequences.Of course this is also a movie about a very unselfish friendship. Don Cheadle leads this movie top to bottom this is the Adam Sandler movie that is really a Don Cheadle movie. And his unshakeable kindness and patience with exroommate Sandler is beautifully rendered. Cheadle's acting has a whole range of subtle gestures and hesitations that are clearly his beyond what any director might offer. As the successful dentist in his late model Volvo wagon he represents what Sandler the man suffering from loss and psychological instability once had. Sandler is sort of perfect as a choice in this role partly because he's cast against type and that's the dynamic of the moviea man who should be very different from what you see. The whole time you can picture the lively loving Sandler and not the wreck before you. He plays the part with the quirks and inwardness you might expect and it's not quite brilliant. He ends up supporting the shine of Cheadle's lead.Another aspect to the movie probably not unintended is the beauty of New York and the romantic lure of its ordinary streets. There are no landmarks here just regular life in regular Manhattan. The one slight drag on the whole affair and I'm not sure how this could have been avoided without a wholly different plot is the attempts to bring Sandler out of his hole. One aspect is professional psychiatry which makes sense and is pretty well done. I found the depiction of an accomplished shrink by Liv Tyler really good. But the other aspect meant I suppose to add some spice to the cast is the nutty and sharply beautiful presence of an outlier character a woman who just happens along first into Cheadle's world and then by extension and some unbelievable coincidence into Sandler's. Saffron Burrows plays the part well but it seems forced into the sceneat times funny and poignant but as with several other minor characters like the inlaws mostly caricatured or out of place.Not that anything is ever quite out of place in fiction. Fiction with a strong strain of truth giving it its depth. Director and writer Mike Binder has managed to pull together a gem that refers ever so gently to 911 and to some deeply caring New Yorkers who all as a larger group all suffered from the attacks. Reign over Me did not get the attention you might have expected. It's possibly because it's such a depressing movie whatever its upbeat moments. But it's beautifully sad like maybe we imagine some of the best European films to be and I really recommend it on those terms.".

There lives followed the same pattern even after losing touch once graduated until the morning of September 11th 2001 where Sandler loses his whole family. The story is a touching journey of how Cheadle and Sandler find each other and reconnect at the same time allowing each other to escape there own problems in their lives. Cheadle as per delivers a great performance surprisingly Sandler portrays the role fantastically. In one particular scene he finally opens up to Cheadle and tells his tale of sorrow which is one of the most powerfully acted and most moving pieces of film i have seen recently.

He runs into his former college roommate Alan Johnson Don Cheadle and the two rekindle their friendship. Alan vows to help his old friend come to terms with the terrible loss. This is a simplification of the basic story of Reign Over Me. This movie is however a story of how fate intercedes in our lives when we ourselves may be powerless do any thing about our own states of being. Alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling. He feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality. He is unable to communicate with his wife and his associates at work. He can't express his feelings and as a result feels lost and distant from his own world. He chances upon Charlie on the streets of Manhattan while driving from his job. Eventually he meets and discovers that Charlie who originally does not remember Alan is living in a false reality of his own. Charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family. He lives as if he were still a student playing in a rock band collecting vinyl records of the 60s and 70s bands and playing video games. He has escaped to a better and safer time in his life where there are no bad guys and he has a lot less to lose. Everyone in this movie is affected in some way by the tragedy that has affected Charlie and his remission to a formerly different and better ? place. His landlady is his protector and great enabler. His inlaws are subtracted from his life because they would take him back to the reality that his family is now gone from his life. And Alan is most affected by him because Alan wants to in at first a selfish desire to escape from his own reality to be with Charlie as a means to subtract himself from his own stifled reality and then he wants to find a way to help Charlie begin to recover from his selfinduced guilt and denial of loss. It is through this relationship that not only is Charlie able to begin to heal himself but that Alan in fact learns to communicate and sate his true desires with his associates at work and eventually is able to admit to his wife he has not been able to communicate his real feelings to her but that he strongly wants to because he does love her. It is in fact a poignant moment in the film when the stuff has hit the fan and Charlie is being confronted with the reality of being put away that he and Alan are talking about the situation together over Chinese that Charlie states that he is in fact worried about Alan and not himself. This movie will if you let it take you through a river of emotions and leave you thinking. It will have you laughing at how Charlie uses his words like people really do in everyday life to make a comical statement of fact about a real situation. It will leave you on the verge of tears in my case actual tears when Charlie confronts his grief and begins to come to grips with his tremendous loss. And that in fact the tragic reality is his guilt and loss has really never left him and he dealt with it in the only way he knew denial. It will make you curse at the cold unthinking actions of a young prosecutor trying to win his case as I actually did at Charlie's hearing! And it will make you smile at the commonsense of a old and wise stern judge Donald Sutherland who is great at his short distinct role and gives the best performance of a wise stern person in the legal profession since Wilford Brimley played an Assistant Attorney General in Absence of Malice.This movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons 1 I never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film. Which means it had me from the beginning to the end 2 Although the cast was interracial this fact was not important to the playing out of the roles of the characters in the film. Race was a nonfactor to the performance of the roles in this movie. Amazing people can actually interact with out this fact being brought out! and 3 the only real reference to 911 is when Charlie's financial attorney refers to the tragedy of Charlie's loss as what Charlie had become on 912. Time will be the true test of how this movie will stand out in the future but if the purpose of a movie is not to just entertain but to make one think and have that movie stay with you long after you leave the theatre then Reign Over Me succeeded phenomenally as far as I am concerned. I have not yet forgotten this wonderful thought provoking film and I will wait impatiently for the day I can purchase it as a DVD.".

Even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating and this crap doesn't deserve to be in the same universe with them.";

I especially liked some of visual shows shown in the House of the Artists.The film continuously unsettles the viewer.

But this is not a movie for the actors to shine but a movie in which the script the story is what matters. The actors are here just as Medem's mediums. In fact Medem has curated this film to the smallest detail.You cannot watch this movie as if you were watching a normal movie not in the same mood or with the same intention or attention.

Manuela Velles as Ana is enchanting and lights up the screen Charlotte Rampling turns in a good performance in her first ever Spanish speaking role Bebe provides much laughter and Asier Newman is simply hypnotic exuding vulnerability and charisma. Sequences are at times Chaotic as per the title but are necessary to build emotional attachment to the story.

Beautiful sexuality strange and exotic visuals stunning landscapes and a chequerboard of interlocking story pieces that sometimes sort of connect.

The ravishing paintings done by his late sister alone are worth seeing.Here in the U.K. I've not seen any of the regular actors of Medem's in any other director's films. So it was nice to see the reassuring maturity of Charlotte Rampling and her character as the Patron of the Arts that takes Ana under her wing perfect for her and she plays it superbly of course. Chaotic Ana isn't my favourite Medem flick The Red Squirrel is.

It has visual expressions of this from Caliban's Tempest cave through modern New York to Greenaway like quantifications. Sea. Desert. But the order is broken and I see that has put off viewers all over the world. This gives the impression that it is halfbaked that it is not finished. For instance there's a mirroring of desert Indians and displaced Arabs that doesn't seem to work. There's a confluence of several types of violence that seems as if it could have been powerful but is not.

There is a retroactive disorder that ripples back through time to perturb the movie that probably once was as perfect and powerful as Sex and Lucia.Its that perturbation that is the art.

	schema:headline " Opening doors";
	schema:reviewBody "This is really something. Any Medem film is a true event. Being able to watch such a master evolve film by film is a privilege. Medem is on the top of cinematic innovation and exploration today at this moment and this film may be his highest achievement so far.So this one is built with oppositions scale oppositions characters temperament oppositions landscape oppositions. Ana is herself chaotic she holds inside the quietness of anonymous lives and the burden of women's heritage. The first scene with the birds apparently so detached from the rest Ana and the dirty senator Ana and Linda her friend.NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION Medem's films have been always a reinvention of the love story at once concerned about tenderness human mind and visual cinematic storytelling innovation. The human soul is a huge iceberg from which we only see a short tip and Medem's cinema always cared about the vast mass we don't see. This still matters here. But adding to that there's a whole new dimension. This is a mark in Medem's career and i would say in cinema since he depicts new scales and new ambit to his cinema. He globalizes and puts context into his once only dreamy beautiful and tender world that of Lucia y el sexo and Los amantes... One can't stop thinking about what this one shares with Babel this is Medem's version of a contemporary global world.And he is so deep here. He freely works with time and space in several dimensions. Let's check . He works global space in being able to bring coherence to multiple stories excerpts of lives that pass all through Ana's mind and Said but Woman is the theme here. By global space i mean the world let's call it realities different countries and cultures no matter when we place it. He works linear time the one that carries Ana from the beginning to the end of her physical journey also made by global spacial exploration. Here is Medem as we had seen him before in Lucia... dream like editions always putting the audience looking for what happened. The genius stroke Medem adds historical time working at once with various epochs various times various contexts. Medem's own woman centered mythology finds in Ana the gate or the passing point of every memory. This is the word Medem brings memory to life.CINEMATIC CONCERNS All this would be just intellectually ambitious but it is all put together in such a cinematic way that i do believe this film will prevail as a mark to a new approach. This is fresh and unseen before. the cinematic devices the edition in the almost psychedelic moments in which all women from all times suffer at once check the careful photography always adequate to the situation but always coherent with the global work duality once more. . the presence of cinema as a mood that enforms all actions in the character and mostly in the Camera of Linda she always films Ana always watch the films as well as a crowd and many times those films as well as some scenes come worked out as the installationsperformances of the students from the art school. And there's a particular moment in which this becomes clear as water and which is when we watch the heads of an audiences in a room wathching one of those films this scene will only work in a theater preferably with other people sitting in front of you. This will lead you to another dimension that may already not be cinema but performative art in which you are participating. Genius. . the unexpected use of animation which intelligently starts flat and than becomes deep multidimensional just like the whole construction as soon as Medem introduces his use of historical time.THEMES Ultimately this is about paying attention to fundamental though many times forgotten issues we came from somewhere and that enforms who we are today forgetting that is rejecting Culture capital C. Medem cares.This column is doric I am Greek says Ana after being hit by a corrupt politician with a small doric columnMy evaluation 55 this is a cinematic essay on my list of most important.httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	onyx:emotionText "This is really something. Any Medem film is a true event. Being able to watch such a master evolve film by film is a privilege. Medem is on the top of cinematic innovation and exploration today at this moment and this film may be his highest achievement so far.So this one is built with oppositions scale oppositions characters temperament oppositions landscape oppositions. Ana is herself chaotic she holds inside the quietness of anonymous lives and the burden of women's heritage. The first scene with the birds apparently so detached from the rest Ana and the dirty senator Ana and Linda her friend.NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION Medem's films have been always a reinvention of the love story at once concerned about tenderness human mind and visual cinematic storytelling innovation. The human soul is a huge iceberg from which we only see a short tip and Medem's cinema always cared about the vast mass we don't see. This still matters here. But adding to that there's a whole new dimension. This is a mark in Medem's career and i would say in cinema since he depicts new scales and new ambit to his cinema. He globalizes and puts context into his once only dreamy beautiful and tender world that of Lucia y el sexo and Los amantes... One can't stop thinking about what this one shares with Babel this is Medem's version of a contemporary global world.And he is so deep here. He freely works with time and space in several dimensions. Let's check . He works global space in being able to bring coherence to multiple stories excerpts of lives that pass all through Ana's mind and Said but Woman is the theme here. By global space i mean the world let's call it realities different countries and cultures no matter when we place it. He works linear time the one that carries Ana from the beginning to the end of her physical journey also made by global spacial exploration. Here is Medem as we had seen him before in Lucia... dream like editions always putting the audience looking for what happened. The genius stroke Medem adds historical time working at once with various epochs various times various contexts. Medem's own woman centered mythology finds in Ana the gate or the passing point of every memory. This is the word Medem brings memory to life.CINEMATIC CONCERNS All this would be just intellectually ambitious but it is all put together in such a cinematic way that i do believe this film will prevail as a mark to a new approach. This is fresh and unseen before. the cinematic devices the edition in the almost psychedelic moments in which all women from all times suffer at once check the careful photography always adequate to the situation but always coherent with the global work duality once more. . the presence of cinema as a mood that enforms all actions in the character and mostly in the Camera of Linda she always films Ana always watch the films as well as a crowd and many times those films as well as some scenes come worked out as the installationsperformances of the students from the art school. And there's a particular moment in which this becomes clear as water and which is when we watch the heads of an audiences in a room wathching one of those films this scene will only work in a theater preferably with other people sitting in front of you. This will lead you to another dimension that may already not be cinema but performative art in which you are participating. Genius. . the unexpected use of animation which intelligently starts flat and than becomes deep multidimensional just like the whole construction as soon as Medem introduces his use of historical time.THEMES Ultimately this is about paying attention to fundamental though many times forgotten issues we came from somewhere and that enforms who we are today forgetting that is rejecting Culture capital C. Medem cares.This column is doric I am Greek says Ana after being hit by a corrupt politician with a small doric columnMy evaluation 55 this is a cinematic essay on my list of most important.httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com";

	schema:reviewBody "After the wonderful Lovers of the Arctic Circle and his masterpiece Sex and Lucia the last almost seven years ago my expectations on Julio Medem's follow up movie were very high and for that reason I rushed to see CAOTIC ANA at the Toronto Film Festival. To my disappointment this movie is just as its title CAOTIC. A sad demonstration that some interesting or even original ideas by no means end up as a good movie.Ana is a young painter living in IBIZA with his widow father. One day she meets Justine the great Charlotte Rampling who offers education and economic support to perfect her artistic skills if she moves to Madrid. Ana starts feeling the big city and the new life it is a sensorial feeling she is be far from shy or at least she has no problems in being nude for art's sake or to take a bath in the ocean or for many other reasons. One of her new feelings is Said a young Arab and fellow student which Ana gets involved and obsessive in love like Lucia in Sex. In short time Ana starts having strange daydreams and seizures until a professional hypnotist finds out she had lived many previous lives and all of them ending with terrible deaths at a very young age around 22 years old. This discovery plus something said by Ana she speaks different languages while hypnotized causes Said to run away without any explanation. In order find out what happened with Said she accepts being part of a hypnotic treatment trying to investigate her previous lives and deaths. The only condition she does not want to remember anything about the session unless is related to Said. Many more things occur and for reasons that do not make a lot of sense she ends up in USA where she is submitted to the last session to find out the truth. Even when the idea looks interesting the unrealistic chain of events many of them too forced harms the narrative. No character in the movie which includes very well known European actors like Rampling or Luis Homar has any deep or definition. They are mostly pieces put there to generate a situation or a dialog we do not get to properly know Ana since her only motivation seems to be finding Said and even this mystery which drives the movie  is easily predictable. Medem like Bergman in his own way has a personal concept about love and human relations and all his movies make reference to the stupid choices and things people do and consequences in everybody's lives. He never really made a lineal or realistic story just a chain of events aligned to show his theory. This concept worked fine in previous movies because in some way everything albeit not always logically got connected and made sense which is not the case here. Many ideas seem to be thrown in the mix not all of them really good or original but like water and oil did not blend at all. Cohesion is missing in many moments like the missing reels in GRINDHOUSE. The perfect example is the scene with the USA government functionary a scene many people will probably enjoy aside for the disgusting but has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie. It is really sad because technically the movie is excellent the paintings and the animations are outstanding the locations are pure beauty but while Ana had many souls this movie has none.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this last month at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. The premise of this film was done before back in 1968 in the film Candy. You take a lovely nymphlike girl with a lot of hair and a beautiful body and build a series of disjointed ridiculous sketchlike stories around her with the help of a big name actor or two and pretend it's a comedy. This film does the same except it pretends to be a drama. The films title character Ana Manuela Vells is a gifted young artist living with her father Klaus Matthias Habich in a cave near Ibiza Spain. Yes they live in a cave but it's quite nice and richly appointed for a cave dwelling. Newcomer Vells almost didn't have the role as it was originally attached to actress Mara Valverde who wisely bowed out and you can only imagine if it was her refusal to do a certain scene in this film. One day a wealthy art patron from France named Justine veteran international talent Charlotte Rampling discovers the artistic potential in Ana and wants to cultivate her talent by setting her up in her exclusive art colony she runs in Madrid. Ana meets Linda Bebe Rebulleto who becomes her best friend and Said Nicolas Cazal who becomes her boyfriend. Ana discovers the doors to past lives through regressive hypnotism by an young American hypnotist named Michael Asier Newman. The movie has you hooked for a while and you wonder where it's going to go but once she heads for New York it rapidly falls apart as a film trying to hard to be an art film with a political and social message. The film looks great with art direction by Montse Sanz and cinematography by Mario Montero and direction from the talented and celebrated international film festival award winning Julio Medem. The film is dedicated to Medem's sister Ana Medem whose actual artwork are featured through the film. Her Picassoesque style painting were to be shown at an exhibit in Valencia when on her way there she was tragically killed in a car accident. I hate to be critical of a film dedicated to someone who represents such a personal loss to it's director but the story written by director Medem is so bad that I can't help it. Watching this film you realize that this guy knows how to make a film but you wonder why he didn't make one this time. It features some nudity and some prolonged unnecessary violence and I would give this a 5.5 out of 10 and not recommend it to a general audience.".

As the movie continued I began the think that perhaps the movie was made with the intended audience being adolescent girls. For example the guy who puts Ana under hypnosis to bring out her repressed memories is clearly too young to be taken seriously and the way the women talk about sex would not be considered sophisticated by most adult women but in both cases might be interesting to 13 year olds. I was thinking that if the movie's target audience was young girls then based upon that it wasn't a bad movie. However as the movie continued and began to makes it's political views more explicit I concluded it had actually been made by an adolescent girl. It's not the politics or the moral point of view that's silly it's the fact that the director obviously thinks he's telling us something we don't know Ex men are responsible for all the wars in history! Hmmm...what a shocking new idea!Oddly enough the final climactic scene which is utterly naive and blatantly antiAmerican actually saves the movie. The silliness of everything that goes on before doesn't prepare you for as brutal a political statement as could ever be made. I don't agree with the statement to say the least by the way but I have to admire the courage to put in on film. However the movie is incredibly silly and if you're a moderately wellread person it probably won't have much to offer.".

	schema:headline " A movie that will leave you wanting to leave the movie theater";
	schema:reviewBody "You know how sometimes a movie really reminds you of another movie you saw not because of obvious reasons such as plot similarities duplicated characters suspiciously identical quotes etc. but because of another reason a little less evident but existent nonetheless. I associate Chaotic Ana with Stealing Beauty a romantic drama by Bernardo Bertolucci that made Liv Tyler a household name. seemingly one has to be slightly hallucinated to associate Stealing Beauty with a fantasyoccult movie and like I said earlier the reason is subtle but it still exists. Ana the mindblowingly beautiful Manuela Vells in a good performance is a painter who lives with her father in a cave seriously an actual cave when one day she is spotted by an artists' patron Charlotte Rampling  who immediately identifies her talent and asks her to join the artists greenhouse she runs in Madrid. Ana who is very close to her father is a little reluctant at first but ultimately decides to cultivate her passion for art preferably in a modern day dwelling. Ana is acquainted with other artists that share her artistic vision and propensity to avoid coherent statements I will elaborate about that later on but one man draws her attention Said pronounced SaId an enigmatic painter who grew up in a rural area of a north African trauma ridden country. How he got from there to the artists' house is anyone's guess. Ana and Said fall in love and conduct a passionate and highly explicit romance. One day though Said disappears for no reason. At the same time Ana discovers that her dreamless sleep and peculiar visions originate in a startling fact in her past. To avoid spoilers I will not elaborate too much on that fact but like I stated earlier this movie deals with the occult so if you hate the sixth sense because you're too old to believe in ghosts this movie is probably not your cup of trufflesjuice no tea in this movie it's way too normal to be consumed Ana aided with the French patron and an American occult professional Asier Newman Who unfortunately struggled too much with his coarse Spanish to give a good performance decides to search her destiny in light of these revelations. These revelations are abundant with cultural references Flashbacks scenery shots etc. but they all lack one crucial ingredient sense.Sense is usually a missing ingredient in the films that deal with the occult but the sense I refer to is not the fact oriented sense. It's the sense of the characters state of mind and disposition that makes them genuine. The endless theories about the nature of men and women might seem offensive to some or ridiculous to others but to me they seem the clear cut symptom of the film's artificiality. Hearing the characters lay out their philosophies listening to them converse and watching them react to certain situations make you wonder in what bizarro world this code of conduct is considered common or even acceptable. And if that's not sufficient enough to depreciate the film's cinematic worth the blunt and redundant sex scenes as well as the stereotypical background stories deteriorate the film to good guysbad guys dichotomy usually common in Road runner cartoons. By stereotypical stories I mean the stories that are too clichd and metaphorical to be authentic for example Said that was abducted from his family by soldiers Ana's friend Linda that was abandoned by her father the encounter American official who made the war no I don't know what that means either and the list goes on and on. I feel a bit reluctant to criticize a film that was made from such a personal and painful viewpoint the director made this movie in his deceased sister's memory and incorporated her paintings throughout the film. I can't think of a more difficult task to translate personal loss to the big screen. I have no knowledge or skill to determine whether the character of Ana is based on Hulio Medem's deceased sister but I can say with a great deal of confidence that the world depicted in this movie doesn't fit to the planet we all live in.If you recall which I doubt it I mentioned that this film reminded me of Stealing beauty Liv Tyler's big breakthrough. That film was highly acclaimed at the time so I rushed to see it and ended up bitterly disappointed. I believe that many critics who wrote in glowing terms of Stealing beauty's behalf spent the movie mesmerized by Liv's infinite charm and sex appeal and overlooked the film's overall qualities. Manuela Vells has the same undefinable quality and I can only assume her name will be known to many in the future.Hopefully in more coherent films.4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.".

	onyx:emotionText "You know how sometimes a movie really reminds you of another movie you saw not because of obvious reasons such as plot similarities duplicated characters suspiciously identical quotes etc. but because of another reason a little less evident but existent nonetheless. I associate Chaotic Ana with Stealing Beauty a romantic drama by Bernardo Bertolucci that made Liv Tyler a household name. seemingly one has to be slightly hallucinated to associate Stealing Beauty with a fantasyoccult movie and like I said earlier the reason is subtle but it still exists. Ana the mindblowingly beautiful Manuela Vells in a good performance is a painter who lives with her father in a cave seriously an actual cave when one day she is spotted by an artists' patron Charlotte Rampling  who immediately identifies her talent and asks her to join the artists greenhouse she runs in Madrid. Ana who is very close to her father is a little reluctant at first but ultimately decides to cultivate her passion for art preferably in a modern day dwelling. Ana is acquainted with other artists that share her artistic vision and propensity to avoid coherent statements I will elaborate about that later on but one man draws her attention Said pronounced SaId an enigmatic painter who grew up in a rural area of a north African trauma ridden country. How he got from there to the artists' house is anyone's guess. Ana and Said fall in love and conduct a passionate and highly explicit romance. One day though Said disappears for no reason. At the same time Ana discovers that her dreamless sleep and peculiar visions originate in a startling fact in her past. To avoid spoilers I will not elaborate too much on that fact but like I stated earlier this movie deals with the occult so if you hate the sixth sense because you're too old to believe in ghosts this movie is probably not your cup of trufflesjuice no tea in this movie it's way too normal to be consumed Ana aided with the French patron and an American occult professional Asier Newman Who unfortunately struggled too much with his coarse Spanish to give a good performance decides to search her destiny in light of these revelations. These revelations are abundant with cultural references Flashbacks scenery shots etc. but they all lack one crucial ingredient sense.Sense is usually a missing ingredient in the films that deal with the occult but the sense I refer to is not the fact oriented sense. It's the sense of the characters state of mind and disposition that makes them genuine. The endless theories about the nature of men and women might seem offensive to some or ridiculous to others but to me they seem the clear cut symptom of the film's artificiality. Hearing the characters lay out their philosophies listening to them converse and watching them react to certain situations make you wonder in what bizarro world this code of conduct is considered common or even acceptable. And if that's not sufficient enough to depreciate the film's cinematic worth the blunt and redundant sex scenes as well as the stereotypical background stories deteriorate the film to good guysbad guys dichotomy usually common in Road runner cartoons. By stereotypical stories I mean the stories that are too clichd and metaphorical to be authentic for example Said that was abducted from his family by soldiers Ana's friend Linda that was abandoned by her father the encounter American official who made the war no I don't know what that means either and the list goes on and on. I feel a bit reluctant to criticize a film that was made from such a personal and painful viewpoint the director made this movie in his deceased sister's memory and incorporated her paintings throughout the film. I can't think of a more difficult task to translate personal loss to the big screen. I have no knowledge or skill to determine whether the character of Ana is based on Hulio Medem's deceased sister but I can say with a great deal of confidence that the world depicted in this movie doesn't fit to the planet we all live in.If you recall which I doubt it I mentioned that this film reminded me of Stealing beauty Liv Tyler's big breakthrough. That film was highly acclaimed at the time so I rushed to see it and ended up bitterly disappointed. I believe that many critics who wrote in glowing terms of Stealing beauty's behalf spent the movie mesmerized by Liv's infinite charm and sex appeal and overlooked the film's overall qualities. Manuela Vells has the same undefinable quality and I can only assume her name will be known to many in the future.Hopefully in more coherent films.4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.";

Nevada Kid Jeff Cameron gets unexpected support from a bounty hunter Gordon Mitchell who carries a list of all wanted men  which has the size of a big city's telephone registry. They rescue a maiden in distress played by Simone Blondell the daughter of director Fidani and happily kill everybody who looks like a bandit.Truly no art but still the best movie by the director as far as I've seen his works... which reviewers often describe as junk. The screenplay is straight ahead the music by Lallo Gori provides tension and a good title song and the camera work of Joe D'Amato is excellent with its many closeups and precise focusing. Kinski puts more effort in his performance than in some other westerns for example in the scene at the beginning when he discovers his two brothers were killed. Ray Saunders got a really nice role as a former slave saved by Nevada Kid. In a scene which was cut from the 80s video tape version but restored for DVD he even sings a song. Hunt Powers is first mentioned in the cast but plays only one of the bandits.".

Gunslinger Nevada Kid being supported by the AfroAmerican Ray Saunders and he gets unexpected help by a cunning  grinning bounty hunter Gordon Mitchell against the malicious killers and the ending settle disputes by shooting . Meantime  they save a damsel in distress Simonetta Blondell or Vitelli  Fidani's daughter who has been kidnapped by Hagen's henchmen .This Italian production is a moving S.W. movie starred by Jeff Cameron Hunt Powers and Klaus Kinski  it takes on a strange gunslinger against treacherous gang  the Hagen band who are wanted dead or alive. The film deals with a mysterious stranger  become an avenger  who vows to take down dreaded outlaws . This Spaghetti movie gets the usual Western issues  such as greedy antiheroes  violent facing off  quick zooms  and exaggerated baddies . It is an acceptable  passable Western with several titles as Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari  Coffin Full of Dollars  Showdown for a Badman that contains an interesting and violent plot about a young seeking vendetta . It packs thrills  shoot'em up  violence  and results to be quite entertaining  though drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some pursuits  crossfire or stunts every few minutes . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist against the heartless enemies formed by a brutal gang of bandits led by Klaus Kinski and Hunt Powers. The main starring is Jeff Cameron as a gunfighter really seeking vengeance and the popular Klaus Kinski as Hagen  Slander who appears elegantly dressed and with a brilliant look  gaining a reputation for his ferocious talent and equally ferocious temper  Kinski plays as a strange killer who occasionally joins in on the action with his deadly guns . Here he plays with lots of gesticulation and excessive gestures . As he is fine  as he ravages the screen with his peculiar face and using suddenly his hidden weapons . This Spaghetti is made during his Italian period when Klaus starred a lot of Westerns  later he collaborated with Werner Herzog with whom played several prestigious films . They later collaborated on five movies  Aguirre 1972 Woyzeck 1979 Nosferatu 1979 Fitzcarraldo 1982 and Cobra Verde 1987. As Kinski starred numerous Spaghetti such as  Pray to Kill and Return Alive  Black Killer  If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death  Bullet King  Shangai Joe  Clint the solitary  The Ruthless Four  Nevada Kid  The return of Clint  and specially famous resulted to be his acting in For a fistful of dollars more . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as well as a lot of twists and turns  as the film approaches its climax  as in the final and the customary conclusion . Atmospheric Eastmancolor cinematography by the famous Aristide Massaccesi or Joe D'Amato  though being necessary a good remastering and filmed in De PaolisINCIR Studios  Italy Elios studios Rome  as usual  and El Lacio . Enjoyable and thrilling musical score by Coriolano Gori as Lallo Gori  including catching leitmotif and attractive song at the beginning by Mark Wolf.The picture was lousily directed by Demofilo Fidani or Miles Deem  considered to be the Ed Wood of Spaghetti Western and husband of Mila Vitelli Valenza a professional costume designer and father of actress Simonetta Vitelli  both of whom worked in various films of Demofilo . Fidani directed all kind of genres in low budget and exploitation pictures . He eventually had more pseudonyms than any working director in the world  similarly to Bruno Mattei .

Klaus Kinski is great as ever.Simonetta Vitelli as Simone Blondell has to be one of the most gorgeous women that has ever walked the planet. Cheap shots about her looks???

A 50 plus welltodo business guy with a 19yearold hippie drifter? Not necessarily uncommon but in this film the girl's not in it for the money and the guy's not in it for the sex. They genuinely love and cherish each other and strangely this is the element of controversy.William Holden plays Frank a cynical divorced real estate broker who lives by himself with only a series of uncommitted relationships for companionship and a mental rulebook that precludes serious involvement. He is likewise surrounded by likeminded cynics that all want for something they have long since given up on . . . youth. Not so much in chronological terms but more in attitude and that sense of wonder about life. Breezy is the very embodiment of that sense of wonder and despite her 19 years possesses a wisdom that cuts through the cynical disillusionment of Frank who unlike what you'd expect never makes a sexual advance toward the younger girl even though she's very attractive and probably willing. For her part Breezy recognized the sensitive soul that Frank has taken pains to suppress and confounds his suspicions by giving of herself to him without asking for anything in return. When he eventually gives in to his feelings the age difference becomes irrelevant but Breezy and Frank do not exist in a vacuum and the outside world eventually fills his head with doubt. His best friend while being envious of the zing  Breezy has put into Frank's life laments thus Why should a young girl like that love an old fart like me? I'd be a meal ticket for her and nothing more. And even if it could be more where could I go with her without feeling like a child molester? And so Frank smolders in a crisis of perception that already had been countered by Breezy in an earlier scene. Is that how it is Frankie? Do you start believing what you see in the mirror and forget about what you feel inside? Do you stop feeling because the outside of you makes it seem foolish? Does becoming older mean feeling foolish? What's there to look forward to if you can't go on loving and being loved? Surely this bit of wisdom transcends any distance of years between two people.".

Not so much in chronological terms but more in attitude and that sense of wonder about life. Breezy is the very embodiment of that sense of wonder and despite her 19 years possesses a wisdom that cuts through the cynical disillusionment of Frank who unlike what you'd expect never makes a sexual advance toward the younger girl even though she's very attractive and probably willing. For her part Breezy recognized the sensitive soul that Frank has taken pains to suppress and confounds his suspicions by giving of herself to him without asking for anything in return. When he eventually gives in to his feelings the age difference becomes irrelevant but Breezy and Frank do not exist in a vacuum and the outside world eventually fills his head with doubt. His best friend while being envious of the zing  Breezy has put into Frank's life laments thus Why should a young girl like that love an old fart like me? I'd be a meal ticket for her and nothing more. And even if it could be more where could I go with her without feeling like a child molester? And so Frank smolders in a crisis of perception that already had been countered by Breezy in an earlier scene. Is that how it is Frankie? Do you start believing what you see in the mirror and forget about what you feel inside? Do you stop feeling because the outside of you makes it seem foolish? Does becoming older mean feeling foolish? What's there to look forward to if you can't go on loving and being loved? Surely this bit of wisdom transcends any distance of years between two people.";

One would expect to enjoy a film such as Star Wars in HDyou wouldn't immediately think that a film like Breezy would benefit from this treatment. However the crystalclarity of the presentation brings back the look of Southern California of the early Seventies in all of its glory that can only really be appreciated by those who lived here back then. Seeing the locations in Topanga Canyon Malibu and the Valley the hippies the straights in their suits and ties and the way the Generation Gap back in the day when there REALLY was one is treated is definitely a trip down memory lane.Anyone who has ever had a love that has dissolved into sadness with the passing of time most of us can fully relate to this film. This is a story about a young woman who has so much to share her exuberance her unique way of looking at the world her evolving femininity her inner and outer beauty. It's also about a powerful and successful man who is at the crossroads in his life. It is a film is about two people that for a brief moment are able to look beyond the constraints of societal disapproval and just simply appreciate what the other has to give.When I first saw this film I was the same age as Breezy. Now thirty three years later I'm getting close to Frank's age. Nobody prepares you for the passing of time. They don't teach you how to handle it in school there's no handbook that you can refer to as the years slip away. No the greatest challenge in life is something you can't prepare for you can only live through it and each person's journey is different from the rest. In that aspect this film is a wise and knowing look at real life. Sure there's some stilted dialogue and some of the scenes are a bit too predictable. but if you scratch the surface you'll find a diamond underneath.I am fortunate to be able to say that I see Kay Lenz frequently. I'd like everyone to know that she still has a unique beauty that is greatly unaffected by the passing of the years. Sure she's not twenty anymore but who is? She has an easy graceful way about her that is a pleasure to experience and just hearing her angelic voice which has changed only slightly through the years brings me back to that world of beach walks undeveloped L.A. canyons and six bedroom houses in the Valley that cost 88000 !!. For you nonactors out there remember Kay was playing a role. Breezy was a character not a real person. However if you were smitten with that character you would not be disappointed to see the real Kay today. If anything she is even more endearing in 2006 than she was in 1973.Let's face it folks growing old stinks. Falling out of love is even worse. This film handles both of these issues with a grace and acceptance that is missing from most of the films made about these themes. I truly believe that there is something in this film for all who care to look for it.".

Never in his wildest dreams could he probably envisioned the big chance he was taking by agreeing to give the girl a lift. Little did he know she would be turning up like a bad penny. Breezy is a free soul. When we first meet her she is sharing a bed with Bruno her boyfriend. Not having a car in L.A. is the worst punishment for anyone. Breezy doesn't hesitate to ask anyone to take her places. That is until she meets the first creep that had a different idea. She is able to run out but she is in the middle of nowhere. She decides to hit on someone that will be passing by. She gets lucky in finding Frank a kind man on his way to work. The relation between Frank and Breezy seems almost impossible. He is a responsible real estate man and she has nothing to show for herself. Frank's resolve is worn out when Breezy comes on to him. In spite of being a sensible person Frank ends up in love with the careless young woman that has won him over.This was Clint Eastwood's third directorial effort. Written with sensitivity by Joe Heims the film is a romantic comedy quite a departure from Mr. Eastwood who has been involved with other themes in his previous films. The idea of casting William Holden who was in his middle fifties at the time pays off well. Mr. Holden had a great film career and was comfortable playing romantic leads as he does here. Kay Lenz who appears as Breezy had great presence as a young emerging talent. She appears not to have being intimidated playing opposite an actor like Mr. Holden.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie in 1973 when it first hit theaters I recently watched it again on DVD. The amazing thing about it is that after thirty plus years it still evoked the same joy that I felt when seeing it the first time. I don't know if that is a comment on it or me but it was a nice feeling.The movie centers around Frank an uptight lonely and often emotionally constipated real estate salesman played by William Holden and Edith Ann Breezerman the 'Breezy' of the title played by Kay Lenz in one of her earliest roles. It chronicles the progress of the love affair between them with a great deal of charm and occasional depths unexpected in this kind of film. Why unexpected? For one thing it takes Frank more than half the length of the film to consummate the affair the first half devotes itself to Breezy's breaking down of Frank's selfimposed barriers with the charm of youth.The inevitable break between them occurs after the late Roger C. Carmel in one of his finest dramatic moments enviously defines Frank's relationship as nothing more than 'the old zing'. The very moment Breezy shows herself the most domestic becomes ironically the very moment Frank chooses to destroy the affair with the comment that they were simply the punch line of a very dirty joke. In an unpredictable twist of fate Frank learns that with love one must Carpe the Diem and they get back together.William Holden turns in a marvelously understated performance foreshadowing his Oscar nominated turn four years later in 'Network'. Kay Lenz captures the essence of the earthmother hippie chick without becoming either caricature or slapstick her performance here may well be one of her alltime best. And the aforementioned Roger C. Carmel as well as Marj Dusay and Joan Hotchkiss turn in excellent thoughtprovoking performances of their own.This film was one of Clint Eastwood's earliest directing efforts. Yet already his greatest directorial trademark is in full view a literate wellconceived script filmed with a light touch by a director who knows how to set the stage and then stay out of the actors' way and let them shine an Eastwood trademark still visible in his most recent works such as 'Space Cowboys'. The script by the late Jo Heims captures the two different worlds clich in a fresh and unpredictable manner. We see the good parts of Breezy's world in her own attitude yet we meet the bad almost tragic aspects of the same world in Breezy's friend Marci who appears stoned throughout most of the movie and says her boyfriend gets 'pissed' if she's not where she's supposed to be. That he beats her though never admitted becomes painfully obvious when Frank visits her and finds her terrified to leave her own house.Frank in many respects is both the good and the bad in the world he represents. But the ultimate evil in that world surprisingly isn't the middleaged wouldbe rapist we meet in the first sequence but the Roger C. Carmel character who gives a monologue on the obvious aspects of the male midlife crisis that makes it clear the true evil of growing old is found when you no longer care whether you live or die. Carmel looks for the 'zing' but knows he'll never find it and also knows he no longer really cares if he does.Despite this the movie has a happy ending in that the lovers reconnect. But even the ending is cautionary Frank still questions its permanence showing us as he tries to seize the day that he may still not entirely know how to do it. We hope Breezy shows him but we're not sure either.I find it interesting that I am now the age Frank is in the movie I find it quite instructive personally to contrast my reaction to it now with my reaction to it when I first saw it. I understand Frank and his friends better and I find Breezy's ultraopen honesty of emotion sadder than I did in 1973. But the movie though it might bring a tear to these old eyes still warms the heart. Maybe there's hope for me yet.".

He's a loner who enjoys his solitude and he scrupulously avoids getting in too deep with any of the attractive but aging women who would like to become his second wife. Then he meets Breezy Kay Lenz a carefree teenager who hitches rides with older men in order to con them out of a few bucks. She gloms onto him in such an unaffected and unpretentious manner that she succeeds where his more sophisticated girlfriends have failed utterly. Soon the couple are living together and in love and Frank must deal with his astonished friends who seem impressed with her sunny innocent personality yet are shocked and disapproving mostly out of obvious jealousy. Breezy is one of those underrated films few people have seen or remember and was one of Clint Eastwood's most interesting early directoral efforts. The movie hearkens back to a time when unwashed hippies still hung out on Sunset Boulevard while cardcarrying members of the Establishment drove around in big luxurious cars gawking at the counterculture misfits yet remaining disgusted and aloof. The story bridges not only the generation gap but the divide between optimistic naivet and cynical worldliness. The theme song is a bit corny but it sticks in the mind nonetheless. Breezy is an uplifting movie one that some people will definitely place among their favorites.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever the Eastwood fan I came to Breezy as a lover of the director's modern work not very familiar with his earliest efforts. With his career as a major star still in relatively early days it was interesting that he should opt not to cross in front of the camera as with his first two helmed films.A free spirited countercultural youth Breezy is a girl who cruises through life with whatever resources she can manage to encounter. Fleeing the car of a man attempting to take sexual advantage of her she finds herself at the home of middleaged realestate agent Frank Harmon and each gradually comes to be attracted to the other.A man becoming ever more known for his roles as tough western heroes Eastwood's decision to direct a film that he not only would not star in but would be a romance must have come as a surprise to many. His debut Play Misty for Me was of course a romance film of a sort in itself and one which Eastwood safely captained cementing his position as a top emerging director as well as a star capable of taking on more than just one set type of role. Nevertheless the concept of something like Breezy coming from someone like Clint can't help but encourage one to raise an eyebrow. First things first the leads. A wellknown star in the autumn of his career William Holden was at this time no stranger to roles as romantic lead though his age had seen few of these roles come his way in recent years. Her first significant role Kay Lenz was almost entirely unknown a young girl faced with the monumental task of sharing the stage with one of Old Hollywood's biggest stars. Both rise to the task expertly the respective cynicism of age and vibrancy of youth combining to create a wonderful chemistry wherein you completely buy the slow romance of these wholly different people. Frank is a functional member of societyalbeit a divorced lonely and embittered onewhile Breezy seems to stand entirely against it. Her clothing is colourful and lively his gray and drab. She is a sociable friendly and cheery character he a loner who seems content to recede into his hilltop home incidentally Eastwood places Holden with the sea in the background and Lenz with crowds behind her to emphasise this a wonderfully subtle touch. It is the differences between these characters which draw them to each other and indeed to us. Their relationship despite its unlikeliness is entirely believable and endearing encouraging us to root for them and will them together. Naturally difficulties are encountered the film teases us and never quite allows the characters to connect as completely as we'd like and the emotions we invest are played with.An unconventional love story which examines other issues such as counterculturalism and becoming old Breezy is a surprising film from a surprising director. Demonstrating himself to be as skilled behind the camera as he is before Eastwood gives us an engaging and interesting romance that draws us in with the charisma of its leads.".

It is never played in any form on t.v. anymore and what a shame it would be for everyone not to be able to experience this precious film. It is a unique kind of love story and was such a different kind of part for Mr. Holden. In my opinion Kay Lenz was the actress of the 70's so good in everything she did. She and Jan Michael Vincent just belonged together in the movies!! I would highly recommend Breezy and just pray I get the chance to experience it again.".

Since I was too young for PLAY MISTY FOR ME in 1971 I was finally old enough to see BREEZY in 1973 and I saw it a good many times.  It was the movie that really made me respect Clint Eastwood.  This was his third time directing a feature and his first without him acting in the film.I haven't seen it since then but you can bet I'm buying the DVD.  It's the kind of film that just stay on your mind even after 30 years!  Bill Holden is great alright SUNSET BLVD. is bettera reversal to BREEZY too and Kay Lenz is a wonderful free spirit I still hate the term hippy. One cool thing to watch for is when Holden and Lenz are going to a movie on a date you can see an onesheet for an Eastwood film in the backgroundI forget which onekind of like the MISTY reference in DIRTY HARRY.If someone tells you this is a piece of fluff open your mind and look at it as a great timepiece from 1973.  I can't say enough about this filmit's the one that opened my eyes to the Leone films the DIRTY HARRY series BIRD HONKYTONK MAN REVENGE OF THE CREATURE etc.  And what's so bad about THE ROOKIE?  I liked that one too.Open your hearts too  enjoy BREEZY!".

	schema:reviewBody "When William Holden took the part of Frank Harmon in Breezy it was a dress rehearsal for the same kind of role in Network where he was the older man who had fallen out of love with his wife and looking for something new and different. Of course his taste in women is a whole lot different. In Network Holden falls for the chic Network news executive Faye Dunaway and in Breezy he's entranced by the free spirited young hippie chick in the title role which Kay Lenz got her breakout role. These two women are about as different as they come.One thing that the story and director Clint Eastwood failed to do is give us all that much information about Breezy and how her character developed as it did. She's a type that was quite common in 1973 and it's assumed by the audience that the Vietnam War and the counterculture of free love makes her typical of young people. So when she drops into Holden's life by kind of forcing him to give her a lift in his car after a night of sex with Dennis Olivieri who picked her up.Holden's gone through a bitter and nasty divorce and we also are not quite sure about the whys and wherefores there. But Eastwood kind of takes care of it from his end when Holden and Lenz at a fancy restaurant encounter his exwife Joan Hotchkiss who's there with a date. Her one scene with Holden and Lenz is Breezy's most unforgettable point. This is one bitter and drunken women and while we don't really know what went wrong it's clear why Holden wanted out of the marriage and why he's soured on the female of the species. There was a 33 year age difference between Holden and Lenz and most wouldn't give odds for this lasting but you never know.Both Holden and Lenz give a good account of themselves making up for some plot deficiencies in Breezy.".
