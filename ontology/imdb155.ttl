Burnett is soon alone trying to outrun a pursuing army while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics forcing Burnett to run far out of his way.";

As a former Naval Flight Officer who was stationed on a carrier in the Adriatic in the early 90's I can say with absolute certainty that this story the dialogue and just about everything else was complete hogwash. It pains me to think that some hack writer actually got paid big bucks for this script probably much more than I ever made in full year in the Navy. Anyway I could obviously point out a million things wrong with this picture but I'll limit to a few laughersFirst I flew EA6B's not F18's but apparently nobody else did. Every EA6B and nonF18 shown in the film was tied down to the flight deck. In fact I don't recall any other jet being launched or recovered in this film from that carrier deck other than that 2seat F18. Back then the Hornet squadrons on my boat yes it's a boat not a ship. Only blackshoes called it a ship. Even had a 'shoe Senior Chief correct me a lieutenant in that regard once. Get real. only had one seat one pilot and no navigatorsrios. Only Marines flew those Dmodels. At least they could have used an F14.Some Master Chief running around the boat chastizing an Admiral and telling him what to donot do. Yeah right.The bad guys are shooting SAM's at our heroes who survive quite a while before getting bagged. Only after getting safely on the ground with their big bright colorful ! parachute canopies do they decide to interrupt the Admiral's meal to tell him a jet's been engaged. Oh I better get up and see what's going on! That boat would be at General Quarters the minute the first missile was in the air. And missiles which normally travel at many times the speed of a Hornet in burners would either hit or miss not follow you all around the sky. And a search  rescue mission would be in place IMMEDIATELY regardless of what some pseudoItalian knucklehead who thinks he's in charge says.Guys walking around the flight deck with no headear protection immediately before during and after flight ops? Uh no. At not playing football either.Flight crew officers eating meals on the enlisted men's mess decks rather than the dirtyshirt wardroom? I suppose it's technically possible but are they out of their minds?A NavigatorNFO threatening to leave the Navy to go fly for the airlines? Sorry even if one had a civilian pilot's license most do NOT all those backseat hours in the Hornet count for squat in the eyes of the FAA. There are way too many military PILOTS that compete for commercial pilot jobs that a navigator sure as heck wouldn't get one.A downed pilot sitting there in an open field in enemy territory not even making an attempt to hideevade. The other guy just leaving him there to find higher ground? Didn't you guys learn anything in SERE school? Also a single fighter going feet dry in potentially hostile territory with no other escort support aircraft or SARCAP? Hah!you get the picture...".

Now if this had been a spoof of American War movies it would've been great. Only problem is that it isn't a spoof it's dead serious. The huge number of goofs and mistakes aside this movie offers little in the ways of storyline and character development. You really couldn't care less if Wilson's character lives or dies and Hackman doesn't really get anything done until the end of the movie which is ridiculous to say the least!.Now the thing that really breaks this movie is the aforementioned goofs and mistakes. As I mentioned if this movie had been a parody on American waraction movies I would've loved it because all of the goofs actually make you think that it IS a parody! But considering the fact that it's a glorified superpatriotic default American war hero running around facing all kinds of problems it all seems like a moral boost for the newly attacked America my sympathies for all who were affected by 911 by the way... The hero is a handsome blond allAmerican guy they could've added that he was a star quarterback and we'd have the complete package who faces irredeemably evil SerbsBosniansWhatevers we never really get to know... and has to face the hazards of traversing unknown territories. It all seems the typical Hollywood actionwar...HOWEVER... SPOILERS!!!!!The fact that the entire navy administration doesn't send in a rescue team until the very end is a bit silly. Also scenes like the minefield where Wilson's character is chased by two soldiers and runs straight through the tripmines where he is unhurt by the explosions one of the soldiers step on a mine that kills both him AND his buddy standing 10 feet away! And the ending in which he's shot at by a HUGE amount of soldiers including tanks... and manages to get out unhurt note also that three halfased choppers take out a lot of that army without getting shot down.... And let's not forget when he runs up a hill while being shot at and the bullets keep on following him while he's running down the other side!SPOILERS!!!!!So all in all as a war movie it's horrible Hollywood junk that falls flat on bad acting terrible script and major goofs! As a parody on actionwar movies though this could go far! If they'd only put those weaknesses to good use...Many will try to save the movie by claiming that It's not supposed to be realistic!. I however feel that war is bad enough to be taken seriously and not turned into a stupid glorification like this where one man can beat an entire army and considering how incompetent the SerbsBosniansWhatevers are portrayed as in this movie I'm surprised that no one took offense!. Just like Titanic it undermines the very issue at hand and deserves to be forgotten for that.110".

What does it say when a civil war in the former Yugoslavia is accompanied by rock music? Well it says that this is essentially a movie for American teenagers who haven't a clue where Yugoslavia is or was but who do need to be made to sit still in the cinema. Result with an action movie where random death happens to people they don't know about or care about but American lives are precious. Ultimately this is a recruiting film for kids who think that they can be involved in foreign wars they know nothing about get shot at but come home safely. Dire.".

I always find manontherun stories good anyway.The missilejet scene has some of the best surround sound I have ever heard in an action scene along with super visuals. Wilson's travails as he tries to stay alive in hostile territory while redtape holds up his rescue efforts are fascinating. The action scenes are quite different too.This is a film I guarantee will not put you to sleep and at the same doesn't overdo the action.

The whole Owen Wilson dodging bullets thingwhile running on a lakewas a bit farfetched. I mean seriously those Bosnian army guys would have be trained to shoot accurately in these situations. i mean its like 70 snipers against one man even an army tank misses! you see all these Bosnians shooting and not one not one hits him.overall the film was good but could have been better it delivers thrills and does keep you entertained.

We then get a little bit of very far fetched action as the navigator's F15 tries to dodge incoming missiles by the way Hollywood SAM missiles do not do 180 turns  that's strictly for cartoon time and then perhaps the most interesting 20 minutes of the film just after the aircraft is shot down. You actually feel tense as the bad guys approach Burnett's hiding prone figure.However after that it just gets plain silly. Burnett dances his way through minefields dodges sniper bullets and climbs to the top of mountains and back while most of the Serbian army tries to eliminate him. What might have been a tense psychological combat between Burnett and his assailants is thwarted by caricatures of brutish and stupid  bad guys stumbling over themselves followed closely by America's inept NATO allies.And as for the ending... puhleeze!! The Admiral himself leading the rescue mission? Helicopters flying in formation into the setting sun? Whose idiot idea was that?310".

Gene Hackman seems to have done this movie merely to fill up his dance card. His delivery and characterization are as always flawless but you can tell his heart isn't really into this stinker.Okay the action scenes are fair.

	schema:reviewBody "Whats fundamentally wrong with this movie is summed up by the opening voice over about  The Cincinatti peace accord  . I jumped out of my seat screaming  The whaaaat ? . Its the Dayton peace accord you bloody fool  . But I realised this was a complete work of fiction even though its set against the background of the aftermath of the early 90s Balkans conflict . Or is it ? Is it set before the signing of the Dayton peace accord of 1995 or after it ? Is it set before the Kosovo campaign of 1999 or after it ? This vagueness of chronology is irritating as are the politics . Why is the Serb faction so anti Mladic ? Despite his unforgivable behaviour against Bosniak  Bosnian Muslims   and Croat civilians during the conflict Mladic was by far the most popular Bosian Serb leader amongst the Bosnian Serb population  and once again Ive got to ask when BEHIND ENEMY LINES is set ? If its after 1995 Slobodan Milosevic should be the hate figure for these Serb rebels for signing the Dayton peace agreement . Another thing that annoyed me was the false picture painted of the NATO command structure which has always been commanded by Americans . There is exceptions to the rule such as NATOs ground offensive in Kosovo in 1999 being led by British general Mike Jackson but NATO has nearly always been an entirely American run show and theres no way Uncle Sam would allow an entire NATO task force to be run by a French admiral as seen here . And another unforgivable error that shows the screenwriters dont have a clue what theyre writing about is the line  The F18 was shot down over southern Bosnia  ! Even when the Bosnian Serb army made its greatest gains in the summerautumn of 1992 they never reached as far as southern Bosnia  this area remained in the hands of the Bosnian Croats before  during and after the war while most of central Bosnia was held by the Bosniaks while the rest of Bosnia was held by the Serbs so if the hero was shot down over  Southern Bosnia  how come hes being chased by Serb militia and tanks . Oh and if theres a peace deal how come everyone is fighting again ? Wasnt there a large UN presence before NATO arrived ? Wasnt there a large NATO ground force  IFor it was called  sent into the country to implement the Dayton peace accord ? So how come we dont see any NATO ground forces stopping the fighting between the factions ?  I might be accused of nit picking but I wish to say that I think its absolutely obscene that Hollywood has made a movie set against the back drop of a conflict that killed 278000 human beings and not once do I get the impression that the production team know what theyre talking about . Its not too difficult to check a few facts if only to show a little respect to the victims of this brutal conflict . Ive never been to the former Yugoslavia but I obviously know more about the conflict than the people who produced and wrote the screenplay . If youre going to do a made up movie that resembles MCGUYVER meets MTV can you please have the decency to set it in a made up country".

	schema:reviewBody "Behind Enemy Lines Bravo niner delta what's your vector Victor?You'll hear lots of dialogue like that in Behind Enemy Lines.  Military code talk is one of the coolest things ever.  Vector copy come back affirmative negative nogo RallyPoint... That stuff is just plain COOL.Back to the movie review.  So  you're making a war movie with airplanes. Let's make sure you have everything you need.  Stock footage?  Check. Lieutenant with a bad boy' attitude?  Check.  Stuff blowing up?  Check. Politically ambiguous military situation?  Che  what?  That doesn't make sense.  I mean we're America... Don't worry  We're the good guys.  It's all the rest that's ambiguous.See Behind Enemy Lines is set in Bosnia during the last' days of the civil war in SerbiaYugoslaviaBosniaHerzegovina.  Chris Burnett Wilson is stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea.  The ship is commanded by Admiral Leslie Reigart Hackman who in turn is under the command of NATO represented by Admiral Piquet de Almeida.  Now Burnett is a bit of a maverick.  Not like the Tom Cruise type  Burnett is tired of being in the Navy.  He signed on to be a fighter pilot not a sitting around on the ship pilot.  In fact he's handed in his resignation papers.  Of course you can't just leave in the middle of a mission.  When the ship returns to port Burnett is done.  Reigart doesn't really care for Burnett  he used to have potential but now he's just dead weight.  So in a bit of vindictiveness Reigart assigns Burnett a navigator and his pilot Stackhouse Gabriel Macht on a recon mission on Christmas.  The recon?  A lake.  Lovely. But radar picks up some activity.  Activity OFF OF THE ASSIGNED COURSE.  Now we've established that Burnett is a maverick so naturally they do recon over there.  They take pictures of mass graves.  Then they get shot down. BEHIND ENEMY LINES.  This is not good.  See NATO planes were not supposed to be making flybys in that area.  A peace treaty has just been signed and things could fall apart at any moment.  So Reigart has a choice to make  does he risk the lives of thousands of people to get one man?  Does he ensure peace and leave a man behind?  We all know the answer to that.Behind Enemy Lines is slick.  It is very very slick.  Teflon.  It looks like a video game.  A really cool video game.  Shifty framerates cool filters Matrixstyle special effects Saving Private Ryancameraeffects it looks way cool.  It's not universally realistic but stylistically it works very well.The acting is also good.  No one is going to win any acting awards in this picture but no one stinks.  If you don't know who Gene Hackman is turn off your computer right now.  You have some serious catching up to do.  If you don't know who Owen Wilson is start paying attention.  This guy is good.  Very very good.  You may have seen him in Zoolander he was the blonde model.  You may have seen him in Shanghai Noon with Jackie Chan. You may have seen an underrated comedy called Rushmore  he cowrote that. He's just beginning to get recognition and he deserves it.  While I think he's better in comedies he's no slouch as a leadingmanactionhero. Joaquim de Almeida doesn't stand out but you've seen him before.  He played Bucho the bad guy in DesperadoSo that leaves us with the story.  It must be tough to make a war movie now.  WWII was easy  the bad guys were easy to spot.  But to make a movie based on any war post1970 must be tricky.  Things like finding bad guys' aren't easy anymore.  Even in something like the Gulf War.  To paraphrase Mark Wahlberg from Three Kings I forget... Are we shooting people anymore?'  The Balkan conflict was really really tricky.  First of all there were three sides.  Secondly there was a huge history of racial strife in the area.  Thirdly NATO stepped in to prevent the war from spreading into Macedonia which would have brought Greece a NATO member and Turkey another NATO member into the war against each other.  Fourthly keeping all the factions straight was very very hard unless you studied political science.  Behind Enemy Lines doesn't get too bogged down in the details which is good.  Nor does it name real names.  Slobodan Milosovic is not mentioned but he is implied.  The story is about an American airman in the middle of the conflict but it's not based on the story of Lt. Scott O'Grady.What we have here is a slick mostly nonpolitical there are some references to landmines being bad for children and other living things war movie.  It's not perfectly paced but it's close.  The cinematography is really really cool.  And stuff blows up.".

It was a great mix of action and suspense with some very realistic cinematography.Basic plot  the Bosnian War is coming to an end and from a US Navy carrier in the Adriatic Owen Wilson and his pilot fly out on the last recon mission of the war but are taken down by a surfacetoair missile. The rest of the film is about Wilson trying to get rescued while he is chased down psychogenocidal Bosnian Serbs. You see Wilson's plane took pictures of something the Serbs didn't want seeing.The film is augmented by some superb cinematography and very realistic sets which really capture the cold and miserable setting in which the story is depicted.I have to admit that Owen Wilson was an odd casting for the role but he surprised me by not grossly annoying me too much and seems to carry the serious role pretty well.Gene Hackman carries well the role of the Admiral frustrated when attempts to rescue Wilson are blocked by his NATOcommand boss over politicalsensitivities.The Serbs particularly the psycho paramilitary guy in the tracksuit are nasty efficient and ruthless and whilst I've noticed some criticism of this film for it being jingoistic and antiSerb one has to question whether this depiction was inaccurate or not... From what I recall the Bosnian Serb military were not nice people and this film reminding us of that I believe is a perfectly valid point.There is a lack of realism at times in the film especially toward the end where Wilson seems to dodge a million bullets emerging from an entire brigade including armour vehicles etc. but don't let this detract.

You feel better about yourself and you'll bring the bad guys to book. So don't worry about your best friend. He was only a plot device anyway.One thing is certain though.

This film is certainly no comedy so the appearance of these notes to me would seem to imply that the movie was in part based in reality. I find this disturbing simply because there are any number of extremely dumb people out there that would see such final comments and assume the film was after all based on true events. And it's this kind of it happened like this cinema which most often involves Americans saving the world that concerns me most. U571 is another now notorious example of this. Apparently its true that history is written by the victors......As for the movie the opening scenes are the most rewarding. Once the movie passes into its middle it becomes a bit dull and the ending as others have observed is more like a Rambo film and gets quite farcical.The movie is best watched whilst a few drinks shy of inebriation. You'll enjoy it more and not notice the foolishness hopefully.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a taut and compelling film based on true events  it focuses a pair of brave pilots  two crack fighter pilots  the Air Force Lieutenants Burnett Owen Wilson and Stackhouse Gabriel Match . The F14 Fighter pilots have only seen the war from 40.000 foot until they're shot down behind enemy lines  in Bosnia territory . Now the Admiral McMahon Gene Hackman in charge to get him out  before the Servian soldiers Olek Kupra and enemy forces bombing the area . However US commanding doesn't want intervene but is about a peace treatise . Stranding two pilots in enemy territory  now in order to survive  there starts a game of survival . They must fight the rebel forces that threaten their lives and retrieve photographs about massacres .It's an adrenalinefueled adventure with spectacular flightscenes suspense  tension and lots of entertainment . What's important here are the aircraft flights  shooting  noisy action and breathtaking combats . Fantastic  memorable aerial cinematography and overwhelming pursuits are the main assets of this story . Although it displays a ridiculous finale in Rambo style . The movie follows the wake from Bat 21 Peter Medak with Gene Hackman  Danny Glover in similar premise though developed in Vietnam .

However US commanding doesn't want intervene but is about a peace treatise . Stranding two pilots in enemy territory  now in order to survive  there starts a game of survival . They must fight the rebel forces that threaten their lives and retrieve photographs about massacres .It's an adrenalinefueled adventure with spectacular flightscenes suspense  tension and lots of entertainment . What's important here are the aircraft flights  shooting  noisy action and breathtaking combats . Fantastic  memorable aerial cinematography and overwhelming pursuits are the main assets of this story . Although it displays a ridiculous finale in Rambo style . The movie follows the wake from Bat 21 Peter Medak with Gene Hackman  Danny Glover in similar premise though developed in Vietnam .

He's discovered evidence of a massacre of Moslems so the Serbs are determined to track him down and kill him. They've already captured tortured and executed his pilot. Meanwhile back on Wilson's ship his handler Gene Hackman is in touch by handy talky and is eager to launch a rescue mission but he's always being reined in by The Suits in the person of a French officer in charge of peace negotiations.This was released in 2001 and so antedates the attacks on 911 of that year otherwise this movie is so compliant regarding the presumed desires of its intended audience that it's safe to assume that had it been made a year later the Moslems would have been the mass murderers not the victims although The Suits might have remained French.The plot is lifted wholesale from the successful Bat 21 of 1988 but is far less challenging. In the earlier film Gene Hackman is the aviator stranded behind enemy lines and is forced to kill a hostile civilian who is the father of several scarred children. It fills him with chagrin.There is no such ambiguity here. Owen Wilson is the only blond in sight. All the natives are swarthy and the villainous ones are ugly to boot. They sneer and scowl and bark orders and leave each other to die without a qualm the way the Nazis used to in World War II movies.Not all the incidents are lifted from Bat 21 although the tale sticks pretty close to the template even down to the golf lingo used to disguise the messages between Wilson and Hackman. In Bat 21 the story including the fairway references was based more or less on a true historical event. This one is entirely made up. Crawling through the sea of decomposing bodies that are left over from a massacre is lifted from The Killing Fields. It differs from the original model too in being dumbed down. Wilson is obliged to run an obstacle course similar to Hackman's but zapped up with myriad CGIs and extreme slowmotion visuals of guys and their equipment being blown apart.Poor Wilson is subject to all sorts of travails. He slides all the way down the wall of a vast dam he's shot at he's almost disintegrated by the explosion of more land mines than can be counted he's hunted by a professional killer with a telescopic sight on his rifle he pursued by hordes of mustachioed Serbs tanks blow holes in the walls he hides behind he burrows under rotting corpses his hair gets mussed he gets all dirty but never gives up hope.Wilson isn't a badlooking actor. I kind of liked his nose aquiline in profile lumpy in frontal view. He doesn't seem suited for dramatic roles though. He might do well in light comedy. Gene Hackman is his professionally competent self looking older and he and his staff are bathed in a bright irritating neonblue light that serves no purpose.If you enjoy action movies filmed with devices borrowed from MTV or TV commercials a plot borrowed from the much better Bat 21 and a satisfactory bundle of binary oppositions between good and evil lacking in any mature values provoking nothing more than an arousal jag this is for you. Otherwise you might want to see the more imaginative Bat 21 and The Killing Fields. In any case you've seen this before.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lt Chris Burnett is a US Navy navigator working on a NATO mission around Bosnia. Bored with routine in the Navy and fed up flying uneventful missions to survey the peace Burnett annoys his CO one last time by putting in his notice to quit and return to civilian life. Of course his reward is to be put on a mission on Christmas Day doing routine reconnaissance. An error in the intelligence data leads them over an nofly zone where they see a convoy of Bosnian soldiers who should not be there and in the process of recording them they are attacked and shot down. Separated form Burnett the pilot is captured and killed leaving Burnett to evade capture for as long as he can until he can be rescued. First of all lets make it clear that this is not the film to come to if you are expecting anything intelligent or worthwhile about the conflict in Bosnia if that is your aim then I would suggest maybe Saviour as a starting point but certainly not this film. However if you want a standard action movie that happens to use the bleak washed out colours of a war zone to add character as well as using the war to make lots of things go bang then this should do you  as long as you can stop your brain from thinking about the morals of using such a conflict to make a flagwaving simplistic piece of Saturday night entertainment. The plot aspires to being some sort of serious piece about the conflict based around an action movie but it is nothing of the sort. Instead the conflict is very simplified for the purposes of leaving our brains free enough of worry and moral concern for our fellow man to be able to just enjoy things going bang. The plot sees an American soldier evade the bad guys with the aim of defeating them against the odds  it doesn't matter who the bad guys are because they are a device rather than real people  they could have been black Black Hawk Down Muslim The Siege or French SWAT but here they happen to be Bosnian. We don't need to worry too much about this because the film doesn't really do anything with them other than use them as the baddies to the blonde and clean cut Burnett's goodie. I'm sure I'll get bashed as antiAmerican for saying things like that but that is not my intention and I'd like to think I'm just being objective lets be honest this is just an action movie and shouldn't be looked on as anything more. However even judged on the standards of action movies this is only an average affair with a plot that destroys its own tension by making Burnett increasingly bulletproof as the film goes on leading to a climax that reminded me of the laughable ending to Rambo 3. It does have tension early on but it has blown it by the ending and the simplistic approach to a real war is hardly helpful. The direction tries to cover the gaps by using advertising gimmicks of jump cuts and freeze frames  they aren't a replacement for content but at least they make the film a bit more interesting. Ignoring the morals of it the use of the frozen war zone does create atmosphere really easily and it was used well.With Hackman too old to be repeating his Bat21 role Wilson steps up and aside from his usual comic stuff at the start plays it pretty straight and has clearly aimed to be nothing more than an allAmerican kid just doing his duty. He aims for this and this is all he does which in an action movie is fine  however I kept thinking of Denis Quaid and thought how much braver he was in his choices. Hackman must have done about 2 or 3 weeks work on this film given 95 of his scenes are in one main location he is OK but really just phones this in. The support cast is interesting in regards the Americans people like Keith and 24's Almeida but no effort is made on the side of the 'enemy' who are simply goons and baddies from the get go. Again it all works fine in a dumb action movie but the real setting in such a terrible conflict made me hope for more than just action fodder.Overall this is an average action movie with a bulletproof hero taking on baddies who look different black Eastern European Muslim whatever to bring good to the world of evil. On this level it is nothing special although it has some nice touches of style along the way but gets silly as it comes to the end. However morally it had a responsibility to really use this stage to do more with the conflict than just use it as a backdrop. Sadly it just paints everyone as the baddies and only looks for the emotion of cheering 'our guys' on rather than feeling anything for the real people or real country. Saviour may be bleak and depressing as a film but my god it is easier to stomach at times than this was. If you want things going bang then it should do you but you'd best try to switch off your brain morals and heart before you start watching it.".

But instead of a ripping oldstyle Star Trek space opera we got KP meeting in a log cabin while Kirk made breakfast followed by an extended pony ride in which Kirk's character does little but support the story's themes of mortality. And you know what? That's FINE!I recalled Roger Ebert's review of the second 'XFiles' movie in which he called it refreshing adding that it was heartening to see a summer franchise film that didn't have a villain as big as a building. 'Generations' doesn't have a villain at all it has an energy ribbon and a scientist who desperately wants to harness that ribbon's power after a personal tragedy. What it does have are several indelible scifi images the ribbon approaching Dr. Soran on the mountaintop the EnterpriseD saucer touching down on a planet's surface and an abundance of class. This is a gem of a film that now seems to hearken from an era when every genre film didn't have to be shown on a threestorey screen and have 3D shrapnel flying at the audience throughout.".

	schema:headline " Much Better Film Than I Remembered";
	schema:reviewBody "When I originally saw this film in 1994 when I was 13 years old I was distinctly underwhelmed but having rewatched this for the first time in over 20 years I appreciate this film a lot more. Even though Star Trek will always work better as a TV Series this is actually a very good film and I'll explain why below.Originally I wasn't too fussed on the film because I was an avid Trekkie who had loved 'The Undiscovered Country' had been a huge fan of the TNG series and remembered that Scotty said in Relics that I'll bet Jim Kirk himself hauled the old gal outta mothballs and thus the film had what I considered a major plot hole as a result of Kirk dying. Now that I'm considerably wiser and no longer a virgin13 years old this minor plot inconsistency really doesn't matter to me. Whilst the special effects are a bit rushedcheap in places re using 'The Undiscovered Country' and TV Series effects it stands up fairly well for a 20 year old film on a limited budget particularly compared to the new films. Anyway special effects can sometimes get in the way of a good script or even negatively affect a film...as they did with 'Into Darkness'.Generations has some stand out moments. I was quite touched by how lonely Picard and Kirk were despite the fact that they had extraordinary lives with excitement and variety that most of us could only dream about. And yet Picard mourning the death of his family and the family he never had really touched me...in a way that it didn't 21 years ago. Behind that extremely intelligent and reserved character was a real nuanced human being with regrets dreams and hopes that were never quite realised. When people say this is out of character for Picard it's obvious that the events in TNG Episode 'The Inner Light' really touched him on a personal level and made him reconsider how important family was. Kirk too seemed to have heartache in his life and how his decisionsStarfleet ruined any chance of a normal existence. It was sad and compelling to watch and something I never really noticed when I was 13. In fact the writing by Braga and Moore is very good in the Nexus part whilst the acting by Patrick Stewart and William Shatner made this even more believabletangible. Moreover there are humorous elements to the film  Data and the tiny life forms speech made my girlfriend laugh out loud several times  in fact we watched it 4 times! Thus it's not all sad.  And to me that's the mark of a good film. Soran played by Malcolm McDowell hams it up but is a good character. It was also nice to see Chekov and Scotty one last time. Seeing Kirk Chekov  Scotty on the bridge and how out of place they were was a nice touch and wellacted. Obviously the rest of the cast probably weren't utilised as much as they should have been but that's only a small negative. Try to watch this with an open mind and maybe you'll appreciate Generations a lot more than you did previously. I know I did. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite some other people's reviews on this site I thought this was an EXCELLENT Star Trek film.  In fact this is probably one of my favorites of the films.  I thought everything about this film was above average the story the special effects the acting the directing...EVERYTHING!I thought the story was absolutely brilliant and quite inventive.  I really loved seeing the two captains fighting and working together.  Also I love the idea of this place The Nexus a place where time has no meaning you can relive all of your favorite memories and your dreams become a reality. I thought the story was excellent.The special effects in this film were definitely above par!  There are several scenes that just made my jaw hit the floor because they looked so good and were done so well.  I've noticed a few people have complained that they used the exact same footage of the Klingon birdofprey exploding that was used in Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country but I say if they're going to use some archive footage to save some money and put that money into the other special effects that they need for the movie more power to them !  Besides the scene is such a tiny scene in the movie and it wasn't the climax of the film anyway so where's the problem?The acting and directing are top notch in this film.  I thought all of the actors did a fantastic job.  William Shatner pulls off a great performance in his final Star Trek film as well as James Doohan and Walter Koenig.  The Next Generation cast does a great job as well Patrick Stewart Jonathan Frakes Michael Dorn Brent Spiner LeVar Burton Marina Sirtis Gates McFadden and Whoopi Goldberg all pulled off great performances!  Malcolm McDowell did a fantastic job as the antagonist in this film!  I also really enjoyed seeing Alan Ruck and Jenette Goldstein in the film although they both had very small roles.All in all I thought this was a great addition to the Star Trek series and a great transition from the original Star Trek crew to the new Star Trek crew.  Also I love this film because you need to know very little about the original Star Trek films to enjoy this film.  The only thing you need to know is that James T. Kirk William Shatner is the star of the original films and that Scotty James Doohan and Chekov Walter Koenig costarred. Also...it may be useful to know that Commander Sulu was another one of the original crew members but not terribly important.  Anyhow I would definitely recommend this film to any scifi fan and to anyone that likes the Star Trek films.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for readingChris".

	schema:reviewBody "Been home nursing an emergency tooth extraction over the past week and nothing was able to assuage the misery like wallowing in Star Trek. I watched a bunch of the cartoon shows  made myself come to grips with THE FINAL FRONTIER re Shatner's movie which managed to be fun when regarded as a study in applied narcissism. But boy how I dislike GENERATIONS and won't be watching it though I decided to try and deal with my feelings about it once and for all.I think its a copout a cheap sloughing off of responsibility that should have been handled with graceful dignity. This is not the way that I will remember Star Trek. I say that because for me the essence of Star Trek is James Tiberius Kirk watching him grow  learn. I switched on the spoiler warning disgronifier in case you are not aware that Captain Kirk dies in this movie and for absolutely no reason at all. It was as if to say his learning curve was arbitrarily being concluded in a rewrite even changing the way he died from the original script two versions were filmed for reasons that have never been explained to my satisfaction.I had learned to like TNG and her crew by the time the film premiered though I think that Tourette's Guy is probably right when he addressed what Brent Spiner is up to these days. Google it if you don't know what I mean I always despised Data. He was a decent plot device and they did come up with at least one great episode where they got him a sweet girlfriend with nice legs but enough with the emotion chip already OK? It's clear that his model was incompatible for the input they had long milked the gimmick dry and it turned him into a jerk.I did like watching the saucer section crash which in a theater looked about as believable as Godzilla destroying Yokohama enhancing the enjoyment. The producers knew we would get off on seeing it and were so kind as to show the mayhem twice providing the film with it's two most interesting sequences thoughtfully shot from different angles for variety. But the rest of the treatment left me cold. I didn't give a damn about the Nexus which sounded pretty swell compared to graduate school. I went with my fiance at the time smuggling in a flask of blackberry brandy so we could drink a toast to Kirk when he finally bought the farm. Turns out the bottle was 34's empty by then due to the draining experience of watching the film. Which looked muddy and rushed filled with subplots that went nowhere cameos by assorted Next Generation personalities which distracted from the focus and a forced sentiment that was at odds with my own feelings about the show.Which was great don't get me wrong! Heck the TNG episode Tapestry is one of Star Trek's finest hours whichever series that turned up in rocked. It was just that the series run had come to an end with a superb showstopper of its own. There was no unfinished business left to attend to no need to pass the baton as producer Rick Berman put it by having the Original Series crew and Next Generation crew appear in a film at all. The classic crew made a rousing emotional exit in the very satisfying THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Kirk had said himself in the soliloquy that it was the final adventure for that crew but by forcing the issue Shatner became the proverbial drunk who wouldn't leave after the party was obviously over.Which in many ways turns out to be the case as Shatner used his studio muscle to not just get himself written into the picture but threatening to direct at one point. The whole subplot involving Kirk is a distraction from the rest of the story and feels superimposed though yes the horse riding scenes with Picard are nice. But if they had to happen at the expense of the dignity of Kirk's character then they were as unwelcome as his demise. Shatner also bullied himself into the film specifically to have his character killed off heroically then posited himself to come back in the 2009 prequel film as if. I now realize he deserved to be left out of that one having cast his fate already. It was about time someone made Bill keep his place in the line after such an unnecessary curtain call.Kirk deserved a better movie to go out in or rather his own movie if it was that damn important. And I say it wasn't Why kill off anyone in the Star Trek universe at all if there are an infinite number of ways to bring them back? Emotional death scenes suck and it made the film perfunctory or formulaic in my eyes trying to fix what wasn't broke in the first place. On its own the Next Generation crew's story was pretty good and from what I've read a lot of what they would have been doing ended up being chopped out to make room for Kirk's scenes back when Alist talent movies at least didn't run three friggen hours. This crew was short changed eventually coming back to make at least one good feature in FIRST CONTACT though by then my heart just wasn't in it anymore in part due to GENERATIONS.So I don't know. I thought maybe I had confused my feelings for the woman I had gone to see this with the film itself which I have seen since on home video and didn't like any more. Actually less wishing I'd had more of that blackberry brandy or at least a six pack of Romulan ale. Here is a Star Trek movie that will drive a classic series fan to drink and that isn't ever a pretty thing.410".

As for Kirk's death scene that was just an insult. Falling off a bridge. It's what I'd do not a space legend still don't know why there's an iron bridge on an uninhabited planetThere's also an irrelevant subplot featuring Data and his emotion chip though Data's life form song is a great moment.Overall a wasted opportunity".

	schema:reviewBody "One does have to admire Star Trek Generations and what it tries to do. In short it is given the difficult task of having to bring closure in two ways 1. Closure for the character of Kirk who's been around since the beginning of all Star Trek and 2. Closure for the TNG series which had just wrapped and now had to destroy their EnterpriseD set before moving to further adventures. For the most part you have a success until the last act.We start with a prologue with Kirk Scotty and Chekov which is well done plus it's nice too see Alan Ruck show up. Kirk acts a little different than he does in the TOS movies more on that later. There is then a clever transition to 80 years later aboard the holodeck. For the next hour and a half you have a great ST movie. All the TNG cast is there and Riker Troi Crusher and Whoopi Goldberg are all GIVEN SOMETHING TO DO this became a problem in the later movies which focused on Picard and Data and the rest of the gang felt tacked on. The story is solid there're moments of humor philosophical ideas behind the Nexus and Malcolm McDowell plays a nice villain he doesn't have much screen time but is still well acted and had a great backstory.Where the film starts to falter is when Kirk and Picard meet side by side. The scenes fall flat for several reasons 1. The idea of the two of them meeting sounds great in theory and may excite fans but the truth is that they're very different characters don't really have the best chemistry or make all that great a team. 2. The premise of the Nexus starts to seem contrived just a plausible explanation so both characters can meet and it raises more questions than anything else. 3. The biggest problem of all is that Shatner never seems to fully get into the character of Kirk. He plays him as just a character making oneliners winking at the camera he knows he's just making an extended cameo. This may really be the fault of the script's Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga had written for TNG and had never written Kirk's character before. That leads into the ending...MAJOR SPOILER! Others have said so before me the emotional impact of Kirk's death is somewhat lost because he is a supporting character in this story and we do not see him grow very much. This is not to say it's all bad I do very much like the idea that Picard is the only witness to his predecessor's death.And that's Generations pretty much. Great film right up till the end. One Final Note it's become a wellknown story that Brent Spiner hates cats and when filming the scene when Data is reunited with his cat he remarked Does it have to be the cat? Couldn't he find Geordi? Frankly I think that would've worked MUCH BETTER and been a great redemption for Data. Shame they didn't follow his advice.The result is a good ST film but not as great as the classics in the series 2 4 6 and 8.".

Destroying the EnterpriseD for no good reason.  Killing Picard's loved ones for no good reason.  Turning Picard into a crying sissyboy.  Turning Kirk into a jerk.  Turning Data into a babbling idiot.In some ways time has undermined this film. In 1994 one could see TNG and TOS as almost equals. Since then the Next Generation crew has diminished in stature while the Original Series crew has risen. Why else would they recast it in STXI? But the reality is that this just isn't a very good film and never will be. It's dramatic flourishes are diminished by how badly they are handled. Come on not only killing Kirk the greatest hero that Science Fiction has ever produced but then killing him with SCAFFOLDING? It like having John Wayne break his neck tripping over the spittoon in the saloon! The films other fault is that it is too derivative of TNG.

	schema:headline " Perhaps The Best Of The Star Trek Movies";
	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion Generations is the best of the Star Trek movie series for a number of reasons. Although The Undiscovered Country represented a fitting ending for the original crew this movie was a good way of blending original Trek with Next Generation Trek. Given almost 80 years difference in the generations I though the solution for doing this was quite ingenious. 78 years apart both Kirk William Shatner and Picard Patrick Stewart find themselves sucked into the Nexus  a huge energy ribbon in which time has no meaning  where they meet each other and join forces to defeat this instalment's villain  Dr. Soren Malcolm McDowell in what I thought was an excellent performance he's one of the better villains to appear in the Star Trek movies.James Doohan Scotty and Walter Koenig Chekhov both make appearances at the beginning of the movie which opens in the era of the original cast and  given the premise in which they appear kind of an honorary visit to the Enterprise B as it prepares to launch for the first time  their ages really don't matter that much. This was always a bit of a problem for me with the movies starring the original cast. They always seemed to be getting just too old to keep being sent on these emergency missions. Here their presence on the Enterprise B makes sense. I thought that Alan Ruck playing Captain Harriman of the Enterprise B did quite a good job of playing a nervous young captain a bit overwhelmed at the presence of the heroic and famous Kirk on his bridge. The Next Generation cast having only recently ended the TV series slipped into their roles without effort. Brent Spiner I thought was extremely good playing Data who has recently added an emotion chip to his positronic brain and is having to adjust to his new feelings while trying to do his duty.The movie revolved though around Stewart and Shatner. Interestingly enough I thought this may have been Shatner's best outing as Kirk in the movies perhaps because although he was still playing Kirk as the hero he wasn't burdened with being the only star. Stewart was clearly playing that role and Kirk was appropriately deferential to Picard  as he was to Harriman for that matter. Shatner and Stewart seemed to work well together giving Kirk and Picard a real chemistry. Flaws? Well a few minor things. It bugged me that the transporter technician speaking only on radio referred to Commander LaForge and Mr. Data. Why not Commander Data? After all Data outranks LaForge. Why honour LaForge with his rank but not Data? No respect for android officers? That's a minor point of course. I also thought that the connection between the two generations might have been even stronger if Leonard Nimoy had somehow been written into the story as Spock. Spock spanned both series and a reunion of Kirk and Spock 80 years later might have been quite touching. But overall minor weaknesses aside this was an excellent movie with a good story and flow and interesting all the way through.810".

I think Walter Koenig and James Doohan were marvellous in the first part of this movie and the scene where they arrive on deck 15 and find themselves staring into the void of space is chilling.After this it picks up with the Next Generation Crew and boy does the camera love the Enterprise D. It's emotional to see the crew going through the changes this movie throws at them and by the time Geordi's kidnapped and Data's emotions are uncontrollable my heart was in my throat.It's also a pleasure to see Whoopi Goldberg reprise her role as Guinan and as far as humor goes Data's newfound sense of humor had me on the floor.I LOVED Picard and Kirk's interactions and the segment in Kirk's cabin is an absolute hoot. Picard This is not your bedroom. Soran is a great villain truly ruthless and threatening. Out of all the Next Gen films this is probably my favorite. It has an atmosphere about it that's very appealing to me and the only other TNG film that had the same feeling was Nemesis which I still maintain was a DAMN good movie.".

	schema:headline " The Trek Movie That Should NEVER Have Been! Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "When it was first announced that Generations was being made with cast members of both TOS  TNG I was excited. Despite the highlypublicised fact that Captain Kirk was gonna bite the dust in this one I had high hopes recalling how the death of Spock was handled in The Wrath of Khan. Not to mention with the TNG series finale' All Good Things... being soooooooo good a TNG bigscreen outing that combines the casts of both series HAS to be even MORE spectacular!!!However what we were treated to was a murky discombobulated outing that essentially wasted the talents  screen presences of Jimmy Doohan Walter Koenig Jonathan Frakes Mirina Sirtis Gates McFadden  Michael Dorn. The scenes that featured William Shatner Patrick Stewart Brent Spiner LeVar Burton  Malcolm McDowell were spotty at best though Patrick Stewart was given ample time to emote.The three cast members of TOS Shatner Doohan  Koenig all did fine jobs as always! with what they had to work with but it's obvious that the roles the latter two wound up with were written for Leonard Nimoy  DeForest Kelley. Chekov as a medic  Scotty as a science officer? Not that they couldn't do it in a pinch but the dialogue could've at least been rewritten to suit the characters. However it speaks volumes that Nimoy  Kelley turned down the parts once they'd read the script.The lighting on this film is one of the most frustrating aspects of watching it from a technical standpoint. Everything appears in ambient lighting which is something that was rarely done on either TOS or TNG. When Will Riker walks out of Picard's ready room he walks onto the bridge in almost pitch blackness. HUH?!Also what's with each crew member changing uniforms every time they come back from an away mission? START with the new uniforms  let it stand at that!The biggest complaint I have about this movie is the fact that cowriter Brannon Braga admitted from the getgo that he was not a classic Trek fan  had always wanted to kill off Captain Kirk if the two casts ever met on screen. As I stated earlier the death of Spock in Trek II was handled tastefully  as Kirk stated in his eulogy his sacrifice was not a vain or empty one. Spock's death actually SERVED a purpose. Braga simply wanted to kill Kirk  it shows in the lack of depth with which it was handled. Classic Trek fan or not if it hadn't been for Shatner  Co. Braga wouldn't have enjoyed the lucrative coattailriding career he's had for almost 20 years. He needs to be a lot more respectful of his elders.The shoddy plotpoints that lead up to Kirk's first death in the 23rd century are hackneyed  poorly written. For Starfleet to assign a young bumbling officer as the captain of their flagship is not only ludicrous but also illconceived. I guess he was trying to make some type of political statement about the military as a large unthinking collective but he wound up insulting a if you'll pardon the bad pun generation of fans who grew up watching a Star Trek series where Starfleet was adept at assigning officers who could handle crises without looking over their shoulder or having to call home every time. I know this was designed to make Kirk look good  still vital despite his retirement but it only served to make Starfleet  their newlychosen crew look like nothing more than a bunch of buffoons  publicity hounds.The attempts at trying to tie in loose ends from TNG Lursa  B'Etor was a hindrance that could've been done without. They had no logical place in this movie it was a contrivance that Dr Soran just so happened to contact two Klingon sisters or maybe they contacted him  who knows who cares? who had it in for Picard  could help him with his plight if he helped them with theirs.The emotion chip scenes with Data while being far better utilised in ensuing TNG films were forced  I don't know if Brent Spiner is to blame for that or the writers. TNG always had a healthy dose of humour in it but throughout the film I kept waiting to hear a muted trumpet blaring waawaaWAAAAAAA! after every one of Data's lines once he'd installed the emotion chip. And the one word of profanity spoken in the movie was spoken by Spiner in a lame attempt by the writers to garner cheap laughs from an already insulted audience.Bringing in Guinan as a bridge to explain what the Nexus was  what it did was overkill. While it's generally a welcome thing to see Guinan her scenes were a bit too pat  explanatory not to mention they were forcibly reiterated when Picard finally confronted Dr Soran facetoface  again a character's presence was wasted by being reduced to what Ridley Scott termed Irving The Explainer. Let's have a little mystery here folks! Who's this madman destroying stars? Why's he doing it? Guinan care to espouse for me? Thank you! As I said a bit too pat  FAR too pandering a mentality for a Trek film.Another thing  this has always irritated me about TNG that really bothered me about the whole PicardgoingtorescueKirkfromtheNexussavetheuniverseonelasttime nonsense is that Picard has always been portrayed as a little bit TOO perfect. Kirk like any other human being made occasional mistakes  his foibles made him all the more identifiable with the audience. Not so with Picard he was always depicted as right regardless of the situation. Granted here Picard had foreknowledge of the Nexus  how it affected those within it while Kirk didn't but to suggest that Picard would be less susceptible to the wiles of the Nexus than Kirk is ridiculous. Braga really goes out of his way to say MY captain's better than YOUR captain! with this one.BTW  I know Ron Moore cowrote this script with Braga but the points I bring up are the ones where Braga had his hands in a bit too heavily.And finally we have the death of Kirk.Spock died saving the Enterprise from the obsessions of a madman. Kirk died saving a solar system from the obsessions of a madman.The difference? How it was handled.Spock's death was poignant to the point of tears. The only reason Kirk's death caused tears is because it was so senseless. Whether it's the original ending where Kirk after saving the solar system is shot in the back by Dr Soran or the theatrical ending where Kirk after saving the solar system FALLS OFF A BRIDGE !! the death is pointless. Hey JeanLuc... look! I've saved the universe one last time like we agreed. Now I'm gonna go off  die somewhere.PuhLEASE!!Kirk doesn't even get a decent burial for cryin' out loud! At least Gary Mitchell gave Kirk a tombstone!! Picard dumps his body under a pile of rocks  places his battered Starfleet insignia atop it then calls his ship to pick him up. How friggin' TOUCHING. I'm all choked up just thinking about it.TNG was able to redeem itself very much like the cast of TOS did in their subsequent films. I regard Generations as I do Star Trek The Motion Picture it was a gawdAWFUL movie but it laid the groundwork for some really fine films to get made.And that's REALLY the only reason this movie should still exist.".

START with the new uniforms  let it stand at that!The biggest complaint I have about this movie is the fact that cowriter Brannon Braga admitted from the getgo that he was not a classic Trek fan  had always wanted to kill off Captain Kirk if the two casts ever met on screen. As I stated earlier the death of Spock in Trek II was handled tastefully  as Kirk stated in his eulogy his sacrifice was not a vain or empty one. Spock's death actually SERVED a purpose. Braga simply wanted to kill Kirk  it shows in the lack of depth with which it was handled. Classic Trek fan or not if it hadn't been for Shatner  Co. Braga wouldn't have enjoyed the lucrative coattailriding career he's had for almost 20 years. He needs to be a lot more respectful of his elders.The shoddy plotpoints that lead up to Kirk's first death in the 23rd century are hackneyed  poorly written. For Starfleet to assign a young bumbling officer as the captain of their flagship is not only ludicrous but also illconceived. I guess he was trying to make some type of political statement about the military as a large unthinking collective but he wound up insulting a if you'll pardon the bad pun generation of fans who grew up watching a Star Trek series where Starfleet was adept at assigning officers who could handle crises without looking over their shoulder or having to call home every time. I know this was designed to make Kirk look good  still vital despite his retirement but it only served to make Starfleet  their newlychosen crew look like nothing more than a bunch of buffoons  publicity hounds.The attempts at trying to tie in loose ends from TNG Lursa  B'Etor was a hindrance that could've been done without. They had no logical place in this movie it was a contrivance that Dr Soran just so happened to contact two Klingon sisters or maybe they contacted him  who knows who cares? who had it in for Picard  could help him with his plight if he helped them with theirs.The emotion chip scenes with Data while being far better utilised in ensuing TNG films were forced  I don't know if Brent Spiner is to blame for that or the writers. TNG always had a healthy dose of humour in it but throughout the film I kept waiting to hear a muted trumpet blaring waawaaWAAAAAAA! after every one of Data's lines once he'd installed the emotion chip. And the one word of profanity spoken in the movie was spoken by Spiner in a lame attempt by the writers to garner cheap laughs from an already insulted audience.Bringing in Guinan as a bridge to explain what the Nexus was  what it did was overkill. While it's generally a welcome thing to see Guinan her scenes were a bit too pat  explanatory not to mention they were forcibly reiterated when Picard finally confronted Dr Soran facetoface  again a character's presence was wasted by being reduced to what Ridley Scott termed Irving The Explainer. Let's have a little mystery here folks! Who's this madman destroying stars? Why's he doing it? Guinan care to espouse for me? Thank you! As I said a bit too pat  FAR too pandering a mentality for a Trek film.Another thing  this has always irritated me about TNG that really bothered me about the whole PicardgoingtorescueKirkfromtheNexussavetheuniverseonelasttime nonsense is that Picard has always been portrayed as a little bit TOO perfect. Kirk like any other human being made occasional mistakes  his foibles made him all the more identifiable with the audience. Not so with Picard he was always depicted as right regardless of the situation. Granted here Picard had foreknowledge of the Nexus  how it affected those within it while Kirk didn't but to suggest that Picard would be less susceptible to the wiles of the Nexus than Kirk is ridiculous. Braga really goes out of his way to say MY captain's better than YOUR captain! with this one.BTW  I know Ron Moore cowrote this script with Braga but the points I bring up are the ones where Braga had his hands in a bit too heavily.And finally we have the death of Kirk.Spock died saving the Enterprise from the obsessions of a madman. Kirk died saving a solar system from the obsessions of a madman.The difference? How it was handled.Spock's death was poignant to the point of tears. The only reason Kirk's death caused tears is because it was so senseless. Whether it's the original ending where Kirk after saving the solar system is shot in the back by Dr Soran or the theatrical ending where Kirk after saving the solar system FALLS OFF A BRIDGE !! the death is pointless. Hey JeanLuc... look! I've saved the universe one last time like we agreed. Now I'm gonna go off  die somewhere.PuhLEASE!!Kirk doesn't even get a decent burial for cryin' out loud! At least Gary Mitchell gave Kirk a tombstone!! Picard dumps his body under a pile of rocks  places his battered Starfleet insignia atop it then calls his ship to pick him up. How friggin' TOUCHING. I'm all choked up just thinking about it.TNG was able to redeem itself very much like the cast of TOS did in their subsequent films. I regard Generations as I do Star Trek The Motion Picture it was a gawdAWFUL movie but it laid the groundwork for some really fine films to get made.And that's REALLY the only reason this movie should still exist.";

I thought the story was great it was a bit more complex than the series episodes and had more time to develop. The only complaint I have is when Data and Geordi continually state the obvious for the benefit of the non Trek fans and then the dialogue doesn't sound natural. They should take note of The Xfiles movie if you don't watch the series tough chances are you won't know what's going on. To finish off I find Generations easier to watch over and over again where as First Contact can get very boring after you have watched it twice and I can't comment on Insurrection as I have only seen it once but I intend to remedy that very soon.

	schema:reviewBody "Alvin Toffler's Future Shock was required reading on college campuses across America back in 1972 and the alarmist book about the future and the shock that its arrival brings was only a forerunner of the fears the 1970s grappled with. Many movies at the time jumped on the bandwagon with cautionary tales and one of the better ones was Alain Jessua's TRAITMENT DE CHOC 1973 which tells the story of Helene Annie Girardot a wealthy French fashion designer who has a midlife crisis when her boyfriend leaves her for a younger woman. On the advice of a friend Robert Hirsch she checks into a revolutionary rejuvenation clinic run by the charismatic Dr. Devilers Alain Delon where the clientle a microcosm of society consisting of judges politicians bankers and wealthy heirs form a sort of secret sect. Helene feels great after the first injection but when her friend can no longer pay he becomes a pariah in the tightknit community and he tries to warn her away. The next day he commits suicide and Helene is determined to leave the spa against the doctor's advice until she's approached by two undocumented Portugese male help who separately plead with her to help them escape just before they disappear. Helene becomes intent on discovering the suddenly sinister clinic's mysterious secrets and doesn't hesitate to sleep with the doctor to find out...The primitive tribal soundtrack reflects the film's premise that for all of man's technological advancements the law of the jungle still holds with the strong preying on the weak or in this case the rich feeding off the poor in a society with more than its share of disposables. The suspense builds slowly and the climax although it's lost some impact after decades of similar denouements is a shocker but what's really scary is how little the rest of the world cares about the dreadful things Helene discovers. The similarlythemed SOYLENT GREEN was made the same year which shows that these Me Decade fears taken to the extreme were universal and continued to be reflected on the screen in such scifi films as WESTWORLD 1973 THE STEPFORD WIVES 1975 and DEATH RACE 2000 1975. There's also a bit of free love commentary as the aptly named Dr. Devilers get it? casually sleeps with all his female patients and compared to Hollywood films at the time both the sympathetic treatment of a gay man Hirsch and the fullfrontal nudity of Delon  Co. come as a bit of a shock even though both were natural and in context. Recommended.".

However the true essence of a film cannot simply rest on the presence of just few sex scenes. This is precisely why a film like Shock Treatment is revolutionary as it was the first film in the history of cinema which heralded the use of human beings as guinea pigs for sadistic pleasures of a few denizens of a selfish capitalist society. Director Alain Jessua chose to highlight the sad plight of impoverished Portuguese boys who were deceived into selling their own bodies when they came to France in search of a better living.

	schema:headline " It Ain't Over 'til It's Over  Third favorite best Rocky movie for me!";
	schema:reviewBody "Rocky Balboa 2006 is truly the best Rocky Movie since Rocky III and IV maybe the best of all time!! Still the first movie is the best Rocky Balboa is close to the first film the best movie in the series of all time! It is my second favorite best film In the series. I love this movie to death the same as I love Rocky IIII and IV to death! in my opinion it is better than new movie Creed! For me Rocky IV will be the best in the series. This movie brings closure to the ultimate sports movie. This movie showed the true essence of who Rocky was and what he was all about. The film has a heart unlike Rocky V who did not had a heart. The most that I love In this film is the training sequence. The film is fast paced entraining not boring or over too long. It truly follows the roots from the first Rocky film it is a 30.year anniversary after the success of the first Rocky film from the 70's. I love how Rocky meets little Marie Geraldine Hughes after 30.years and everything what Rocky predicted in the first film really happened to her. Tony Duke Tony Burton did return in this film. There is no Adrian Talia Shire in this film I am happy she wasn't in here. I heard something that Stallone did not cast her in the film because she wanted much more money. Rocky helped Marie and her son. He adopted little puppy and he run the stairs of his former statue. Running with his dog on the stairs was one the most touching sequences I have ever saw! The speech he gives his son is probably one of the most inspiring speeches I've ever heard. This movie is Stallone's masterpiece moving touching not boring unlike II  V Sylvester Stallone gave his best performance after the first film  I ever seen. The fighting sequences are realistic like in the first film! Antonio Tarver Mason 'The Line' Dixon wanted more money before he would agree to star in this film so Sylvester Stallone gave half of his salary so that he did started in this film. Rocky Balboa 2006 was a huge impressive improvement over Rocky V. The fifth movie was the most sad film to the series I have ever saw. Even Sylvester Stallone him self was very disappointed with the flick how it ended. I even heard they originally wanted to kill the Character Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone did not allowed that to happened with his character he invented. I am glad that he did come back after 16.years of disappointment to redeem him self and the most beloved character of the history! I have singly enjoyed this film more than I did Rocky II IV and V. People keeps saying Rocky V goes back to his roots well that would be Rocky Balboa not Rocky V. Rocky Balboa is going once back they way he was in Rocky I we see Little Marie after 30.years and everything what he predicted really happened to her. Rocky Balboa in this movie he has a heart we also see Spider Rico. Thank god there was no Adrian in this movie she annoyed the hell out of me. Sylvester Stallone made in my opinion one of the best movies and wonderful performance in my opinion. Rocky III Rocky I and Rocky Balboa are in my top three best movies of Rocky that I absolutely love. After the huge disappointment in Rocky 5 Stallone has come back with a vengeance to complete this historic franchise. And he does it in style. The story is simple but the characters are beautifully portrayed. I also heard that Stallone was planning to make this film in 2004 after a failure of Rocky V 1990 and he executed perfectly! It Ain't Over 'til It's OverThirty years after the ring of the first bell Rocky Balboa comes out of retirement and dons his gloves for his final fight against the reigning heavyweight champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon. That is your basic plot. I love this film to death It is my second favorite best film of the series that I just love and Enjoy. I am giving it a 1010 because the film deserves it. Rocky Balboa also known as Rocky VI is the sixth installment in the Rocky franchise written directed by and starring Sylvester Stallone who reprises his role as the title character. The 2006 film in the Rocky series that began with the Academy Awardwinning Rocky thirty years earlier in 1976.".

Rocky Balboa 2006 was a huge impressive improvement over Rocky V. The fifth movie was the most sad film to the series I have ever saw. Even Sylvester Stallone him self was very disappointed with the flick how it ended. I even heard they originally wanted to kill the Character Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone did not allowed that to happened with his character he invented. I am glad that he did come back after 16.years of disappointment to redeem him self and the most beloved character of the history! I have singly enjoyed this film more than I did Rocky II IV and V. People keeps saying Rocky V goes back to his roots well that would be Rocky Balboa not Rocky V. Rocky Balboa is going once back they way he was in Rocky I we see Little Marie after 30.years and everything what he predicted really happened to her. Rocky Balboa in this movie he has a heart we also see Spider Rico. Thank god there was no Adrian in this movie she annoyed the hell out of me. Sylvester Stallone made in my opinion one of the best movies and wonderful performance in my opinion. Rocky III Rocky I and Rocky Balboa are in my top three best movies of Rocky that I absolutely love. After the huge disappointment in Rocky 5 Stallone has come back with a vengeance to complete this historic franchise. And he does it in style. The story is simple but the characters are beautifully portrayed. I also heard that Stallone was planning to make this film in 2004 after a failure of Rocky V 1990 and he executed perfectly! It Ain't Over 'til It's OverThirty years after the ring of the first bell Rocky Balboa comes out of retirement and dons his gloves for his final fight against the reigning heavyweight champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon. That is your basic plot. I love this film to death It is my second favorite best film of the series that I just love and Enjoy. I am giving it a 1010 because the film deserves it. Rocky Balboa also known as Rocky VI is the sixth installment in the Rocky franchise written directed by and starring Sylvester Stallone who reprises his role as the title character. The 2006 film in the Rocky series that began with the Academy Awardwinning Rocky thirty years earlier in 1976.";

	schema:reviewBody "Guys...Stallone did it.I went in cringing and walked out impressed.The tone was closer to the first two Rocky movies but it did it in a way that the fifth movie wasn't able to grasp. One key ingredient verisimilitude.They treated the boxing in the film the way boxing is in real life. I know because I covered and followed the sport very closely for about three years.Real life boxing personalities pepper the film's cast. For the fight scene they got the current HBO announcing team of Jim Lampley Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman.They treated the buildup to the fight not unlike movie audiences are treating Rocky Balboa the movie What another Rocky moviefight? There is some reminiscing of the past like in Rocky 5 but it's handled much better. It flows naturally from Rocky the character. It's not nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia the way some of Rocky V played out. In fact I got choked up quite a few times throughout the film.The writing is excellent. The monologue from the first Rocky teaser that some people criticized shows up in this movie. It plays WAAAAAAAAAAAY better more powerfully with more emotional resonance in the context of the movie. The teaser didn't do it justice. The movie does.If you're a Rocky fan you have to see it. If your girlfriendboyfriend aren't Rocky fans or have never seen a Rocky movie you have to take them.My 19yearold girlfriend thinks she has seen Rocky but only as a little girl so she had a vague if any recollection of the series. So vague in fact that she even told me that Stallone the actor looked familiar. And she loved the movie. She cheered and when the fight started she told me I'm so nervous! In the end she also loved the character of Rocky proving to me that the character's appealdespite his age and several decades removed from his debutis still undeniable.Stallone was great in the role of course. This is obviously the part he was born to play.Burt Young is great as Paulie. He gave a nice supporting performance with the right touch of humor.I was impressed with Antonio Tarver as Mason Dixon. Tarver as some of you might know is a real fighter. In fact I saw him fight once in Miami. He turned in a good performance which I wasn't expecting since he's an athlete not an actor. So Tarver deserves a nod.The movie is inspiringthe winning quality in all Rocky movies.Now don't get me wrong I'm not claiming this is Rocky I all over again. This is the sixth movie in what was a tired series when we last saw it but Stallone breathed new life into it and it's definitely a deserving addition to the Rocky series.Lastly there's a moment in the theater that I really really want to share with you guys. Don't worry it has nothing to do with the end.The movie audience was pretty quiet throughout the first half. But when Rocky starts training to the Rocky theme the crowd came alive and began cheering and clapping. I saw one guy throwing punches during the fight. Another guy was stomping on the ground from what I imagined was excitement of the fight and nervousness.I'm not sure Stallone could've made a better part 6 than this.".

It really develops his character in ways that the other movies have not. The trailer that is out does not do this movie justice. If you want to see a movie with a deep message and a whole lot of heart you will not be disappointed. Don't think Another 'Rocky' movie and brush it off. This movie is well written the acting is great the characters seem like real people. Even though I have already seen it I will be back on opening day to see it again. It is an instant classic.

	schema:reviewBody "Balboa is gonna hit so many people in different ways.I suppose you can look at any great film and see a message in there but the Rocky franchise is so inspirational even the 5th one.This new film has had me thinking and though some reviews have said it's a trip down memory lane and a rehash of the 1st well the point is as reflected in the film that Rocky IS living in the past like so many of us do for one reason or another.The message as stated in the film you gotta keep moving forward I don't know if its me or just pure genius but if you LOOK you will find something that touches your soul throughout the franchise ..So i wont drag this out...........I left the theatre kind of stunned. Its been a long while since Rocko got back in the ring and I like everyone else wanted a better film than Rocky V. Sly has wised up a lot over the years and all I can say is....THIS FILM DELIVERS BIG TIME !The fact that its the 6th one and to be honest its no scifi film where you can really go to town on the plot there is only so much you can do and Sly has done it. Yeah you could say that the plot mirrors Sly's life over the last few years but all the Rocky's have done that in one way or another. This is Rocky back to his sweet and charming self stunned with what life has thrown at him and just going through the motions of well growing old but still having that ambition to kick life in the balls and say it ain't over til it's over. He looks great for 60 and doesn't over train for the final bout he's kept it very realistic and the fight itself is handled very well and looks different to the recent wars we have been used to. The film isn't just about boxing it's a drama which will inspire you if you can put your ego to one side and let it.Paulie is fab he calms things down and stops certain moments turning into what some people may call cheesy. Unfortunately people with no emotions call things cheesy but they are the ones who have yet to learn what life can throw at you.This film is up there with I  II and I need to see it again!!!!!!!!OverallA perfect ending to the saga and an amazing turn around for the franchise.".

The film doesn't focus so much on boxing as it does on the actual character of Rocky and the trials he faces having one day been on top of the world and now he leads a simple life and thrives on his memories.I am a huge Stallone fan but I realize his career has been in a slump lately but this film would be a perfect resurrection for him. The acting is great and it has some of the best writing I've seen in years. Two very powerful scenes are when Rocky tries to get his license back and probably the best scene of the film is when he confronts his son.Any Stallone or Rocky fan will love this film. And I'm sure a lot of people who had doubts about this film 30 years later or even Stallone being 60 years old will be very surprised and pleased. And it does not hurt that Sylvester Stallone is in better shape at 60 then half of Hollywood under 30.I've already seen the movie but I plan to be there opening day to see it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you permanently there if you let it. You me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take. That's how winning is done. Now if you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit and not point fingers saying you ain't where you are because of him or her or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!  Rocky Balboa.For a guy with a single digit IQ and a chronic speech impediment Rocky sure does speak a lot of sense. Part of the appeal of the first film was Rocky's never give up attitude. We loved watching an underdog succeed. The ring became a metaphor for life and The Rock a metaphor for the unmovable human spirit. He weathered blow after blow but kept on standing.Rocky Balboa the last film in the series is likewise a tale of triumph against the odds. It's a small story akin to a gritty 1950's B movie but it's filled with pathos some nice character interactions and a couple memorable speeches. Though the final boxing match is pretty unmemorable and badly shot the entire film has a sense of maturity which I found neat.What's great is that Stallone doesn't pander to audiences with unearned sentiment. He honestly believes in his story. He honestly believes in the inspirational element. As such it's a fitting coda to the series and a worthy retranslation of the first film.Of course Rocky 1 remains the best in the series. It's a low key Cinderella story filled with lots of iconic moments and a cute romance. Yes it's an absolute rip off of Robert Wise's Somebody up there likes me but it's appealing and John G. Avildsen's direction was in some ways innovative and clicks with the audience. Especially young males.Rocky 2 is likewise very good but suffers from a pointless story. It's essentially the same film on a bigger budget. From here on the series would go down hill. Rocky 3 sees a complacent Rocky challenged by Clubber Lang a hungry fighter. Thematically the film logically progresses from the first two. The Rock has weathered the beatings and risen to the top. But once there he grows complacent. When the hits resume he's not ready. He's lost his edge and his cracks are exploited by Lang. It's an entertaining film but with Rocky 3 the series gradually begins to lose its realism.Rocky 4 degenerates further taking things firmly into popcorn territory. It's basically a 90 minute music video in which The Rock has to fight Russians. All realism is gone and it's now all a silly cartoon. Still I like the film in a guilty sort of way. The soundtrack all those cheesy muscle shots the montages...it's dumb fun.Rocky 5 however is totally worthless. It's an embarrassment and the whole subplot with Rocky's son is pathetic. The film is a waste of time and it's incompetence is largely why Sly decided to revisit and salvage the series.Luckily with Rocky Balboa he does just that. Rocky 1 910 Rocky 2 7.510 Rocky 3 7.510 Rocky 4 710 Rocky 5 610Rocky Balboa 810The Rocky series has taken a lot of critical flak but it's not as bad as people make it out to be. The first and last films in the series play like lowkey B movies from the 1950's ie Somebody Up There Likes Me also about a boxer called Rocky and have a nice sense of realism. The dialogue is witty and well written and Sly despite his goofiness is quite endearing. One can imagine a Robert Rossen or a young Robert Wise directing these 2 films in black and white.".

Rocky Balboa.For a guy with a single digit IQ and a chronic speech impediment Rocky sure does speak a lot of sense. Part of the appeal of the first film was Rocky's never give up attitude. We loved watching an underdog succeed. The ring became a metaphor for life and The Rock a metaphor for the unmovable human spirit. He weathered blow after blow but kept on standing.Rocky Balboa the last film in the series is likewise a tale of triumph against the odds. It's a small story akin to a gritty 1950's B movie but it's filled with pathos some nice character interactions and a couple memorable speeches. Though the final boxing match is pretty unmemorable and badly shot the entire film has a sense of maturity which I found neat.What's great is that Stallone doesn't pander to audiences with unearned sentiment. He honestly believes in his story. He honestly believes in the inspirational element. As such it's a fitting coda to the series and a worthy retranslation of the first film.Of course Rocky 1 remains the best in the series. It's a low key Cinderella story filled with lots of iconic moments and a cute romance. Yes it's an absolute rip off of Robert Wise's Somebody up there likes me but it's appealing and John G. Avildsen's direction was in some ways innovative and clicks with the audience. Especially young males.Rocky 2 is likewise very good but suffers from a pointless story. It's essentially the same film on a bigger budget. From here on the series would go down hill. Rocky 3 sees a complacent Rocky challenged by Clubber Lang a hungry fighter. Thematically the film logically progresses from the first two. The Rock has weathered the beatings and risen to the top. But once there he grows complacent. When the hits resume he's not ready. He's lost his edge and his cracks are exploited by Lang. It's an entertaining film but with Rocky 3 the series gradually begins to lose its realism.Rocky 4 degenerates further taking things firmly into popcorn territory. It's basically a 90 minute music video in which The Rock has to fight Russians. All realism is gone and it's now all a silly cartoon. Still I like the film in a guilty sort of way. The soundtrack all those cheesy muscle shots the montages...it's dumb fun.Rocky 5 however is totally worthless. It's an embarrassment and the whole subplot with Rocky's son is pathetic. The film is a waste of time and it's incompetence is largely why Sly decided to revisit and salvage the series.Luckily with Rocky Balboa he does just that. Rocky 1 910 Rocky 2 7.510 Rocky 3 7.510 Rocky 4 710 Rocky 5 610Rocky Balboa 810The Rocky series has taken a lot of critical flak but it's not as bad as people make it out to be. The first and last films in the series play like lowkey B movies from the 1950's ie Somebody Up There Likes Me also about a boxer called Rocky and have a nice sense of realism. The dialogue is witty and well written and Sly despite his goofiness is quite endearing. One can imagine a Robert Rossen or a young Robert Wise directing these 2 films in black and white.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've been able to see this before it's release date so I'll avoid giving too much away in this review. To start with when I heard that they were going to make a sixth Rocky movie you didn't have to be a die hard fan to wonder what were they thinking about particularly 15 years after the last horrible outing! After 30 years since the original ROCKY was released one could only wonder what else they could conjure up after such a long hiatus? Yet this movie was not bad and it's important to stress that on a number of levels. This rendition of Rocky is true to the previous ones as again he is the underdog a former champ who is encouraged to come out of obscurity and take on the current champ despite having been retired for 20 years.Just to recap to the earlier movies for the moment in the original ROCKY in some sort of bizarre publicity stunt Rocky Balboa was plucked up from a short list of bum of the month contenders to leap frog genuine challengers for a crack at the undisputed heavy weight title. Although he falls short because of the effort and the show that he puts on the public demand a rematch and consequently sequel to ROCKY is made and so on. It's important to remember that in the 1970's the American public craved for there to be white heavyweight boxing champion so when the original ROCKY was released not only was it contemporary but captured the imagination of the public at the time. Apollo Creed as the champion was obviously modeled on the brash cocky Muhammad Ali who you either loved or hated.Also it's worth noting that in the 1970's and 80's boxing enthusiasts often wondered who would win in a fictional fight between the 1950's champion Rocky Marciano and the 1970's champ Muhammad Ali. Therefore it was no coincidence the name 'Rocky'was used in the 70's but now today in ROCKY BALBOA we are now asking who would win in 2006 Rocky from the 70's and 80's or Mason Dixon from the 2000's? The question in this movie is actually more like a Rocky Marciano v's Ali now than it was in the 70's!Another point worth mentioning is that in the original the conceited Apollo Creed was a flashy arrogant publicity seeking showman but more importantly he was human. By the time of Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago in ROCKY'S III and IV respectively the Italian Stallion was up against fighters that did not seem to be human. They were void of feelings had no family and their physical prowess and abilities were so advanced that they seemed more like comic book or video game characters. In this movie Mason Dixon to a large extent returns the heavyweight champion to a more believable human role although contemporary for 2006 i.e. athletic brash and mean! I give credit to the writers here and to a large extent this is where the movie worked! I don't know if it was a coincidence or if it was part of the thinking but ROCKY BALBOA was fortunate enough to be released at a time when the heavyweight boxing scene itself is in a shambles and resembles a three ring circus. From blown up middleweights to an alphabet soup of nobodies in their late 30's right up to a 7 foot Neanderthal lookalike that is totally useless heavyweight boxing has never been more of a joke! In a time when top athletes in their respective sports are stronger faster or bigger and more powerful than there peers from earlier decades heavyweight boxing is about the only sport to have regressed. The skill levels and talent are so much poorer than their counter parts in the 1970's and 80's that none of them could even carry Muhammad Ali or Larry Holmes jock strap's when they were at their best! The International powers that be have in there zeal for money have butchered the world heavy weight boxing scene so badly that its turned into a freak show. Thus the idea of a former champion 25 years past his best challenging for a world title is not as far fetched as it once might have been! This movie will have it's critics and while it is certainly not flawless I see no reason why this movie should be lambasted as it no doubt will be. At the very least it stands out from being better than 90 of the movies that are released today many which are simply dreadful. If old 1960's70's and 80's TV shows are revived on the big screen for the movie industries indulgence or else the public are fed an endless list of remakes why not another Rocky movie! The dialogue and writing while not great was no worse anything else I've seen recently and the production and camera angles were good. It's slow in certain areas particularly at the beginning but over all a nostalgic effort which tried to capture the theme of the earlier rocky movies. Apparently Sylvester Stallone was never happy about ROCKY V and for years the memory of it tormented him well I think this one will have exorcised that demon a much better effort overall. Check it out!".

	schema:headline " Stallone Makes Us Believers  Again";
	schema:reviewBody "Admit it. The first time you heard this movie was being made you either laughed or cringed. On the surface the concept of a sixth ROCKY film is one of the most ludicrous in recent memory. A braindamaged boxer who hasn't fought in two decades comes out of retirement in his 50s? To take on the Heavyweight champ? Come on.But just as The Italian Stallion has one fight left in him it turns out that writerdirectorstar Sylvestor Stallone still has the talent to produce topquality entertainment. We pick up with Rocky in contemporary times now running a quaint little restaurant called Adrian's named after his beloved late wife. His relationship with uptight son Robert is awkward and his life is filled with reflections on years gone by. After a computersimulated boxing match suggests a young Rocky would defeat current boxing champ Mason The Line Dixon the 50something decides to climb into the ring again. He plans to headline smalltime local fights for thrills but Dixon's managers soon propose an exhibition charity match of Will Vs Skill between the two men. And so the stage is set for the final and most unlikely match of Rock's career.What's most amazing about ROCKY BALBOA is that again Stallone makes us believers. Just as we believed that at washup from the streets of Philly could take the boxing crown from Apollo Creed all those years ago we believe he can stand toetotoe with Dixon. Stallone doesn't gloss over the unlikeliness of the storyline. The boxing commission initially rejects his application for seemingly obvious reasons. Reporters chide the fight as a sort of circuslike event that hurts boxing. Dixon's champion status is watered down by the fact he has been spoonfed weak opponents his whole career didn't seem to take the Balboa match seriously and injures his hand early in the fight. It all gives the film a very real feel as unlikely as it may sound.ROCKY BALBOA is also a very fresh take on a character we've grown to love. The film has a very gritty contemporary look. Rocky's old neighborhood isn't quite the same place where men used to sing in perfect harmony around a barrel fire. Now it's filled with decrepit buildings and obnoxious young people who remind you of the guests who go on Jerry Springer and swear at the audience. The Rocky here is a man out of his time who can hardly be blamed for his desire to seek out past glories. At the same time ROCKY BALBOA has high nostalgia value. Whether you like the film or not it's a real treat to see Rocky still with his pork pie hat back when we were sure we'd never see him again. Paulie's back too still drunk most of the time and former Creed trainer Duke once again gets the most out of his man in the ring.ROCKY BALBOA is first class entertainment. Like the original entry it's not really a boxing movie but a film about the human condition and following our dreams. It's fantastic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this was not what I was expecting!The story was a lot slower than any Rocky film since the first one in the mid '70s but I'm not complaining. When it was all over I thought this was probably the bestmade Rocky film of them all. I never thought I would describe a Rocky movie as classy but this one deserves that adjective. It may be the least entertaining as far as a lot of action goes but it is the most classy.I say this mainly for the wonderful sweet tone to this story a story of aging boxer who is long past his glory and is still mourning the loss of his wife. Apparently Adrian died some time after the last Rocky film. His wife's death is haunting him which makes this a very sad film in the first 45 minutes. However interspersed in Rocky's reflective period is the still the same upbeat lookatthepositive sideofpeople attitude.Rocky now acts as host of his Philadelphia restaurant and he regales the customers with stories of his past ring successes and seems to enjoy doing it. He still has his old friend Paulie Burt Young dropping by daily. Rocky's nowgrownup son seems to be sullen and resentful of trying to fill Rocky's hometownhero shoes but dad is everencouraging. It's obvious Rock still loves people. With that attitude it's impossible to dislike the man.One of the turning points of the film is when the old fighter gives his son a what'swhat speech about life. The veteran pugilist may not be Phi Beta Kappa but he comes up with some very profound statements. His son soon sees the light about his dad.For those who might be leery about watching yet another Rocky movie filled with overthe top villains and way overdone ring action rest easy you won't see that here. Balboa's training scenes last only a few minutes and the fight doesn't begin until the last 1520 minutes of the movie. Preceding that are melodramatic moments with Rocky's friends family and new female friend and her son.....all handled with dignity and class.The cinematography is just beautiful in parts and if you're a student of photography you'll enjoy viewing this.Sad nostalgic yet inspiring and optimistic I can't recall ever being so impressed with a Rocky film. Highly recommended.".

People were in the theater making fun of Rocky saying Oh so when is Rocky XIX coming out?! Come on you old man!

This film is different from the other films in that it is an ageing or aged Rocky whichever you prefer living out his retirement in a comfortable restaurant with friends and people he knew in the past. From the outset it has a very nostalgic feel. Though not directly in the past there are reflections of the past by going back to the streets as the camera shows various parts of neighbourhoods and structures. We see Rocky as the quiet and very kind warm hearted peoples champion. A man loved and respected by many but living out the remainder of his time quietly. Then of course things happen and he winds up training about for perhaps the last fight of his life. This is not so much an entertainment flick but more of a slow burner that if you are prepared to follow is filled with warmth and inspiration. The script is not perfect but adequate and Stallone puts in a performance that shows us that Rocky really is his baby. That said there are some truly inspiring lines and scenes that can bring a tear to the eye and without the eye of the tiger or no easy way out. For me the last ten minutes of the main event crowned the film. When you hear the people including his female companion but not love interest shouting ROCKY ROCKY as the true champion of the people who is by no means bombastic gives his bell ringing finale. I would recommend this film to anyone who is down or insecure about their future because it brings you up from your knees with a positive and inspirational message that whoever you are whatever you do if you want it and you pay your dues go out and get it. Because there ain't nobody who has the right to take it away. This film is a winner for those of us that appreciate such things. And what makes me smile it does this without any special effect whatsoever ".

A lot of flashbacks but it definitely wraps up the series a lot better than Rocky V did. It won't win best picture or any great acting awards but the cinematography was better than I've seen in a lot of the previous 5. As far as the big question in the blogs does Rocky die in this one you'll have to wait till Christmas and see for yourself. The music was great the final scenes were great and Paulie was great! It was also interesting to reintroduce the characters of Little Marie and Spider Rico from the first movie.".

It was also interesting to reintroduce the characters of Little Marie and Spider Rico from the first movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "This new ROCKY is a truly fitting finale to the saga of Rocky Balboa. Always likable usually stirring and entertaining of course I'm not acknowledging there was a Rocky V this version has replaced macho with heart. In a glorious pitch perfect performance of a revered Champ in the twilight of a now lonely unfulfilled life Stallone is actually amazing. I didn't think he still had this kind of heartfelt performance in him. He has written directed and performed this work with the insight of a person who has endured all the ups and downs that a career can experience.The setting is familiar the characters have been thinned down to only the dependably irritating Paulie the haunting memory of his beloved Adrian his withdrawn and overshadowed son and a struggling acquaintance from his past. All the performances are fine but this is about Stallone in full on Rocky mode. He exudes the melancholy of a life that has lost meaning while not unpleasant just not connected. His revelation that he wants to like fight doesn't seem weird or unnatural.Some of the film's conventions to get him back in the ring with the current undefeated champ no less are achieved quickly and stretch our believability but once that Rocky Theme and as I sit here I'm getting a goose bump or two blares out of the sound system you are getting READY TO RUMBLE!!!! The fight sequences which have always been cartoonishly brutal mock the limits of human endurance and insanely exciting deliver once again. But its the insight that Stallone brings to this script his heartfelt speeches to the Licensing board his son and of course Paulie that are the real knockouts in the film.I am so glad this turned out to be the fitting farewell that an icon like Rocky and Sylvester both deserve.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't even need to copypaste I know this line by heart. And when I heard it for the first time in the movie theatre I knew that whatever would happen from that point I was probably watching the greatest Rocky film since the first one which is saying a lot considering how deeply rooted in popculture the sequel were.Coming from the famous speech Rocky gave to his son Robert the monologue that started with let me tell you something you already know the world ain't no sunshine and rainbows cut straight to my heart. Rocky Jr. starts an angry rant blaming his father for stealing his life condemning him to live forever in his shadow venting many years of repressed anger on his father's face. Then Rocky Balboa the character who was introduced to cinema thirty years before in an underdog story that would be the inspiration for all the 'little guys' in the world Rocky the exHeavy Weight champion and now a father and widower straightens his son out explaining him that there is no other person to blame in our misfortune than ourselves and learning that is an important step for maturity. What makes the line so powerful is how impacting it is for us viewers. We like Rocky Jr. used to point our fingers on people held responsible for our failures and after watching Rocky Balboa we understand it's time to reconsider this attitude.And this is the defining element of Rocky Balboa it touches us personally and invites us to identify with Rocky with the same level of empathy as in the first movie. The atmosphere conveys the same feeling of melancholy and loneliness something that made me realize that the choice of having Adrian dead was an 'intelligent plot device although I don't like using that word. Adrian died of 'woman cancer' an expression Rocky would use and left Rocky alone with his son with Paulie and a bunch of memories. Rocky's life is behind him he now runs a restaurant where he hired his first opponent Spider Rico and he entertains the clients telling him the stories of his victories and while we listen to him we remember what a great character Rocky is in all the meanings of the word. From Spider Rico to Rocky's memories the film is a rediscovery of a lost universe in a mood full of nostalgia.There's indeed a sad and dark feeling all through the first act and Paulie plays an important part in the film notably through his powerful even Oscarworthy breakdowns that gives him a new level of threedimensionality when he finally realizes how selfish and careless he used to be. The movie's sadness is so present that some might find it manipulative in the way it tries to inspire tears and make us feel sorry for Rocky but the movie doesn't fall in that trap and takes an interesting turn to the future when Rocky meets the famous 'Little Mary'. While not the highlight of the film and thankfully not an excuse for a forced romantic subplot 'Little Mary' is the outsider element that prevents both Rocky and Rocky to be alienated in its own universe and a reminder that there's more in life than sad memories. There's also a good amount of humor from Rocky's poignant slowness and good old Grump Paulie am I the only one who thought his reference to 3D images as cartoons was hilarious Rocky Balboa is the perfect conclusion of the series something that was begging to be made after the disastrous Rocky V but I guess it was only a matter of time before Sly would find the right tone and right story to justify a sequel something that would work as both a tribute and a continuation. Consequently it took 16 years of pounds and maturity gains and so many cinematic flops that could have almost ruined Sly's career and reputation. And this is another aspect of the 'rainbow' speech that makes it so powerful it also works on a selfreflexive way it's not just Rocky talking for his son or for us viewers it's Stallone's response to all the crap and all meanness he received in his life to all these Razzies nominations that elected him as the scapegoat of 'bad cinema' to all the mockeries and incessant comparisons with Arnie Stallone took all the hits and moved forward with a last provocation a movie with a sixtyyear old Rocky and managed to make it believable his challenge against the young Mason 'the Line' Dixon less flamboyant but more realistic than any other Rocky's opponents.And to understand the reasons of this insistence one has to take into consideration the scene when he expresses his desire to join the Boxing League explaining that no one should interfere with his personal vision of happiness this is again Sylvester Stallone speaking for himself for why he did Rocky Balboa. The film's script is powerful as it works on many levels than even on its own Rocky Balboa is a powerful and inspiring drama that should have garnered more Oscar nominations. No need to show it as a sequel no need for a 'VI' number the film is about the man about Rocky Balboa and his ultimate quest before a last farewell to the ring and for us a last and real goodbye to Rocky Paulie Duke the trainer and whatever defined one of the greatest Saga of cinema's history as illustrated by the ending credits that show the film's greatest heritage the 'Rocky steps' as the incarnation of the spirit that raises us above our condition the idea of going the distance.And I've always said that the Rocky films despite their flaws always redeemed themselves through great finales the same can be said about the Rocky series if we consider how great and fitting conclusion Rocky Balboa was.".

Hold on Michael weren't you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And weren't both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures the director Richard Fleischer was hospitalised as a result of sunstroke during the shoot. What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career lowpoint of Michael Caine. Instead it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast exotic locations boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline.Dr. David Linderby Caine is a W.H.O medic who is left devastated when his black wife Anansa Beverly Johnson goes missing during an aid trip to an African tribal village. Linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders  led by Suleiman Peter Ustinov  and he sets off on a continentwide pursuit which eventually leads to the Middle East.Along the way big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot Omar Sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in his quest. The film is based on a bestseller entitled Ebano by the littleknown author Alberto VasquezFigueroa but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again. There are occasional flashes of action but on the whole Ashanti is quite slowmoving. All in all it is a resistible piece of action hokum  not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested but not a very inspiring film and certainly a letdown from all the talent involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "ASHANTI is a somewhat typical movie from the late 70searly 80s starring Michael Caine . It's certainly watchable in an undemanding way but no more than that but neither is it bad enough to be virtually disowned by its star .The story itself is intriguing an AfroAmerican doctor working for the UN is kidnapped by slave traders and it's up to her English born husband to track down the kidnapped woman . I guess the movie could have concerned itself more as to dispelling or building myths about the present day slave trade but it's not that type of movie and rightly concentrates on action and adventure One can't help thinking that maybe Caine's dislike of the movie is down to the fact that he's playing a hero and as everyone knows heroes are by their very nature boring . Undoubtedly Malik played by Indian actor Kabir Bedi is the most interesting character while Peter Ustinov as Sulimen gets by far the best lines and scenes like  A father  a father  a father  . Very frequently Caine gives the impression that as soon as the movie is finished and the cheque is in the bank he'll be firing his agent ASHANTI is a movie that demands very little from and offers little to its audience except to sit back and be enthralled . Film buffs might complain that this is a poor movie considering it was directed by the legendary Richard Fleischer  well maybe but I think the only thing the director can be criticised for is casting an obviously unwell William Holden in a needless cameo".

	schema:reviewBody "Ashanti is a very 70s sort of film 1979 to be precise. It reminded me of The Wild Geese in a way Richard Burton Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa. It's a very good film too and I enjoyed it a lot.David Michael Caine is a doctor working in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman called Anansa Beverley Johnson who has trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they're doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an Arabic slave trader called Suleiman played perfectly by Peter Ustinov of all people. The rest of the film is David trying to get her back.Michael Caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff. He's helped out first by a Englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on Rex Harrison! then briefly by a helicopter pilot William Holden and then by an Arab called Malik Kabir Bedi. Malik has a score to settle with Suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with David to find him and get Anansa back  this involves a wonderful scene in which David fails miserably to get on his camel.Then there's lots of adventure. There's also lots of moralityquestioning. The progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but it's all pretty forgivable. The question is will David get to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells her on to Omar Sharif yes of course Omar Sharif is in it!?".

	schema:headline " Exotic as well as entertaining adventure movie based on a novel by the Spanish writer Alberto VazquezFigueroa";
	schema:reviewBody "Ashanti  land of no mercy is an amusing picture with great loads of action  thrills  violence and adventures . It has a passable direction by Richard Fleischer  a superb casting and spectacular scenarios .The picture begins in the following sentence   Slavery stills exists today thousands of people disappeared in Africa last year . This story is based on fact . The film's Ashanti title refers to the name of a proud African tribe who fought the Dutch and British armies during the 18th and 19th Centuries  the descendants survived to form the modern African state of Ghana . It deals with a doctor named David Linder Michael Caine along with his wife Anansa Linderby topmodel Beverly Johnson she also was the only female character in the cast acting as missionary in a medical mission in Africa . When the wife is kidnapped by a slave trader named Suleiman Peter Ustinov publicity for the film stated the part was Ustinov's first outandout bad guy role in his then thirtyyearlong career begins a relentless pursuit . From this moment the doctor finds himself alone in a battle to rescue her from a band of slave traders . The chase spans many Middle Estern countries and starts to look bleak for our man . Later on  David is helped by Malik Kabir Bedi of Sandokan  though Omar Sharif was originally going to play this type role of desertguide Malik but had to bow out  instead Sharif played the smaller role of Prince Hassan an expert Arab seeking vendetta . Only two men could rescue her  one driven by love the other by revenge. In this weak film there are thriller  suspense  emotion  frenetic action and for that reason is amusing . Apparently the flick is actually allegedly based on a real truelife story . This adventure movie also contains fantastic elements as when the sorcerer boy kills a nasty and has gorgeous moments when the desert pursuit and there appear slavering children . This movie about modern slavetrading was developed made and released right on the heels of Roots a popular highrating television series about historical slavery . On a hand it is an enjoyable adventure film  including usual ingredients  deserts  camels  jungles  oasis  Tuaregs and many other things . On the other hand the valuable cast and promising screenplay are undone by sometimes slow pace . The picture is based on a novel with same title by successful Spanish author  an adventure expert and prolific author called Alberto Vazquez Figueroa who gets numerous cinematographic adaptations such as Manaos  The Iguana  Ocean  Oro Negro and Rottweiler . Publicity for this picture stated that the United Nations had at the time the film was theatrically released a Special Committee on Slavery operating within the UN's Human Rights Division. Factual reports on slavery presented to the UN were a key source when author Alberto Vzquez Figueroa wrote this movie's source 1975 novel Ebano. The picture was distributed by two studios Warner Brothers and Columbia Pictures depending on the territory . Excellent and talented cast as Michael Caine as an unexperienced man who faces off extraordinary dangers  he has said many times that he acted in this film purely for monetary reasons and considers it the worst project  most wretched film he's ever done . In addition  gorgeous supermodel turned actress Beverley Johnson was the first ever AfricanAmerican model to be featured on the cover of Vogue magazine in 1974 . Peter Ustinov goes through familiar role as the villain as well as Omar Sharif . While topstars are really wasted as Rex Harrison and William Holden as a mercenary  helicopter pilot have little more than cameo characters  this is one of the final feature films for both actors . William Holden accepted a lowly seventh billed role on this picture so he could work on location in his beloved Africa where he owned a safari club . Furthermore  Johnny Sekka  JeanLuc Bideau and veteran Eric Pohlmann as a swarthy portly man in one of his last acting . Colorful and shimmer cinematography by the Italian Aldo Tonti filmed on location in Israel  Kenya and Sicily Italy and scenes set in the Sahara Desert in North Africa were actually filmed in the Sinai Desert in Egypt. Director Fleischer and cinematographer Tonti previously worked together on Barrabs . Functional musical score though composed by a TV composer by means of synthesizer . The motion picture was middling directed by veteran filmmaker Richard Fleischer who replaced Richard C. Sarafian the film's original director who dropped out of the production though the action is in his safe hands . About four years prior to this picture Richard Fleischer directed another film about slavery called Mandingo. Richard has directed all type of genres  such as classic adventure  Vikings  20.000 leagues under sea  noir cinema  Narrow margin Clay pigeons Trapped and Sci Fi  Fantastic voyage  Soylent Green . However  Ashanti resulted to be a failure at the international Box office  being today better considered .".

	schema:headline " There's a reason you've never heard of this movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Ashanti has loads going for it Released in 1979 it was directed by Richard Fleischer and stars Michael Caine with an impressive supporting cast including Peter Ustinov Omar Shariff William Holden and Rex Harrison the latter three in very minor roles. If you're into exotic women there's Beverly Johnson not to mention great exotic locations  Israel Kenya and Sicily although much of the story takes place in the Sahara Desert. Caine's costar Kabir Bedi is impressive as well.The story addresses modernday slavery. Caine's black wife is apprehended by slavetraders and he chases them across the Sahara Desert all the way to the Red Sea. I know of two beautiful women who completely disappeared abroad. What happened to them? Were they apprehended by slavers? Did they become sex slaves? No one knows. The film illustrates this veryreal possibility.Ashanti plays like a wannabe Lawrence of Arabia but doesn't even come close. It's marred by a horribly dated 70s score whereas the score to Lawrence is timeless even though it's older by about 17 years!!. Plus Lawrence is believable from beginning to end whereas I found myself mumbling Yeah right numerous times while watching Ashanti. In other words too many scenes come off unconvincing or slightly awkward.BOTTOM LINE Ashanti sounds great on paper but they needed to take more time in the creation process to work out the kinks in the writing acting directing and score.Still the locations are great there is a lot of action and the film provokes thought on an important subject. It's definitely worth picking up if you're a Caine fan or if you're into desertsurvival flicks especially since it's so cheap. Same thing if you favor Beverly Johnson who's not the greatest actress. It's quite a bit better than Caine's similar African adventure The Wilby Conspiracy 1975.The DVD features only a full screen version but the picture is quite good. Unfortunately the menu is cheap featuring only Play Movie and Trailer there isn't even a scene selection option.GRADE C".

He was probably really hot on location and that's all he remembers. Good to great actor though he is this isn't really in his worst 10 not in his best 10 either but...it's well worth watching.He does seem to have chemistry with the wife character and there is a memorable scene with him and a bunch of slaves who don't want him to leave them. Also an early scene involving his wife's abduction is very well doneso the story gets off to a good start.Director Fleischer was friends with Rex Harrison who is just fine in the film and Holden is okay too. This film always remains interesting even it may not catch fireit actually drags in the middle but has a pretty lively wrap upbut everyone treats it with seriousness. A noble cause sort of thing.It may well be the last really serious role Ustinov had certainly one of his few villain performances. Shariff is also good and helps juice up the ending.The photography is beautiful and the locations are very well used too bad it sort of stumbles around about a third of the way in. It has a good sense of place in the details throughout.Aside from a blandly shot helicopter crash the action what there is of it is well done. I believe Fleischer took this over from another director and probably deserves credit for what's good about the film more than what's weak.Worth a look though the ancient full frame VHS doesn't do it justice in 2014 a good looking DVD finally became available.".

Holden is just too old for the role. Harrison looks understandably embarrassed. Kabir Bedi is great to look at but he is not asked to do much more. Ustinov is the best of the lot as the Arab slavedealer Arabs were the ones who were most involved in the slave trade in Africa but of course we can't say that these days so it's more politically correct to blame the Jews and let's see if IMDb has the guts to post my opinion.However it's the utter fantastic situations that makes one throw one's hands in the air. Caine drops into a river in the middle of the African jungle a place totally alien to him after the helicopter carrying him crashes and the pilot of course dies and in the next scene we see him clean and healthy in an airport ready to board a plane. How the blazes did he get there?! People walk barefoot in the burning sands of the desert for miles without getting so much as a blister. Sand troughs in oases contain crystalline water. In abundance. I could go on but you get the general picture. And how about the sound track? Elevator music! I kid you not.A total mess. Get the book and avoid this silliness.".

The main problem is in its execution. Nobody seems too excited about this potentially quite exciting material including the director and most of the cast.Although he does steal the film Peter Ustinov feels tremendously out of place to me as he channels a lot of the same largerthanlife pathetic  comedic energy he displayed as the villain in Disney's animated ROBIN HOOD and as the Caliph in THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD made around the same time. It just doesn't fit in with the dark and serious undertones of the film and how everyone else underplays as much as he overplays.The direction by the usually reliable Richard Fleischer is adequate but filled with moments of bizarre incompetence such as the final showdown on the boat with Bedi just standing there waiting to get shot. There's plenty of other flaws including some bad dubbing poor special effects involving an airplane crash a dreary and dated musical score and a lot of uninspired cinematography.While the cast is certainly top notch featuring Omar Sharif returning to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA territory along with the Indian actor he famously shot at the beginning of that movie marking the start of his international career most of the performances are unbelievably weak. Rex Harrison and William Holden seem wholly unenthusiastic about every bit of dialog while star Michael Caine goes through the entire film with an annoyed wince on his face like he just can't wait to cash his paycheck and get back to England and out of the sun.Nicely this film takes place almost entirely outdoors and showcases some splendid African locations. The pacing is fairly leaden but picks up later in the film and Kabir Bedi's performance as Caine's vengeful guide ranks among his best and gives the film an air of gravity and authenticity. Not to mention Beverly Johnson is one of the most outrageously attractive women ever filmed so her scenes alone are worth the price of admission.Writer Alberto Vasquez Figueroa covered similar ground involving modern slavery in the period pieces MANAOS and IGUANA which are both worth checking out for those lucky enough to find them. He also wrote TUAREG THE DESERT WARRIOR one of the few more original Italian Bmovies from the early 80's as in not an obvious cashin featuring some similarly fascinating expose on North African culture though distilled into cheap action movie conventions and the odd casting of NCIS's Mark Harmon as an African chieftain ??! Of all Figueroa's works this may be the one to reach the widest theatrical audience and fail the hardest but I can appreciate it along with all his other works for their relative originality.".

The pacing is fairly leaden but picks up later in the film and Kabir Bedi's performance as Caine's vengeful guide ranks among his best and gives the film an air of gravity and authenticity. Not to mention Beverly Johnson is one of the most outrageously attractive women ever filmed so her scenes alone are worth the price of admission.Writer Alberto Vasquez Figueroa covered similar ground involving modern slavery in the period pieces MANAOS and IGUANA which are both worth checking out for those lucky enough to find them. He also wrote TUAREG THE DESERT WARRIOR one of the few more original Italian Bmovies from the early 80's as in not an obvious cashin featuring some similarly fascinating expose on North African culture though distilled into cheap action movie conventions and the odd casting of NCIS's Mark Harmon as an African chieftain ??! Of all Figueroa's works this may be the one to reach the widest theatrical audience and fail the hardest but I can appreciate it along with all his other works for their relative originality.";

This one with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s shows the best and worst values of Africa which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole. It also has shortcomings given the undue influence of western preconceptions of Africans and especially Arabs.Dr Anansa Linderby the beautiful AfricanAmerican wife of the English doctor David Linderby is captured by Arab slavetraders along with a teenage Sanufu girl and a young boy. The lead slavetrader Suleiman is every bit the stage Arab with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric and gestures to match  which would not be out of place on Carry On Follow that Camel but are not up the standard this film deserves. Peter Ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful onedimensional character.Continuing the stereotypical theme all three of Suleiman's Arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen.One of David's first ports of call is the local police officer a stereotypical pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotypical white expats an Englishman Walker played by Rex Harrison and an American Sandell played by William Holden. Sandell is a mercenary with conventional views on mixedrace relationships who initially refuses to help unless David provides payment up front. Won over by David's love for Anansa and conscious of his own inability to find love he agrees to take David up in his helicopter to help search for Anansa. They find Suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory  as a result of Sandell's hesitation and David's lack of experience with firearms his helicopter is shot down but David survives.We then see David introduced to Malik Kabir Bedi an African who has lost his family to Suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance. They find the Sanufu girl with a group of Tuareg and know they are on the right track to find Suleiman.In one of the most heartrending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not Suleiman's group and have no choice but to send their captives to the Tuaregs they met earlier.Later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's henchmen. Anansa on her part  and despite the scepticism of the boy  manages to engineer the demise of Suleiman's two other employees.By this time Suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market.Suleiman now in no doubt that Anansa is trouble attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy Arab prince Omar Sharif who is corrupt but intelligent. On discovering that Anansa is an American working for the U.N. the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences. The scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film.At the slave market the young boy is sold to a middleaged German paedophile and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered wunderbar when his owner is on the receiving end of his witchdoctoring skills.David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and there is a bittersweet ending from Malik's point of view.Ultimately David and Anansa are reunited and Malik whose life is in ruins can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed.The overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters. Credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting.".

Michael Caine in the lead has called it the worst film he ever made but there is nothing wrong with his acting even though you can trace a slight lack of interest and passion which is what he professes as the husband of the violated bride. Peter Ustinov makes the most of his character the villain an abominable slave trader counting every human life as worthless unless he can sell it for money and even succeeds in making this monster of a human trafficker look ridiculous  it's actually a caricature. William Holden has the briefest but also the most interesting part a role typical for him in which he shines and develops a profound interest only to become the first and most regrettable casualty like a typical Holden hero. Rex Harrison is as sly as always and also makes the best of his diplomatic business in doing what he can to temper and prepare Michael Caine for his quest while the most fascinating figure is Kabir Bedi as Malik a copy of Omar Sharif's Ali in Lawrence of Arabia who has another tragic and heroic story to tell  and ends as regretfully as William Holden. Omar Sharif is credible enough as Prince Hassan and his eloquence and gentlemanly demeanor almost makes you hope for some humanity in him but he absconds as soon as he sees that his game is up. The actor left for us to dissect is Beverly Johnson as the leading lady and here is the evident flaw. She is good in the beginning as the doctor and wife and even better as Peter Ustinov's bullied slave but when it comes to the final critical point she loses everything and suddenly you understand Michael Caine's lack of interest in her although they married for love. which he insists on but which no one can believe least of all William Holden. I am sorry but she is not a good actress. If she had acted up to the part written for her inspired Michael Caine to the passion needed to chase her all over Africa and if she had been just anything more than only a clich Ashanti beauty the film would have been a success. One suspects that the director Franklin Schaffner who has made a number of outstanding films rather soon during the shooting noticed she was not enough for her part and lost interest himself to finish the film just to fulfill the contract.

These guys range from 20s30s some are pretty hairy and they're not all drop dead gorgeous. They do all have buff bodies and the hardcore scenes go on and on and on. That's not a bad thing but this runs 2 12 hours with maybe 45 minutes of plot. I actually lost track of what was going on after the sex scenes ended! Still this is a very good attempt to go a hardcore gay porno with a plot based on a classic novel. The settings are beautiful there are plenty of cameos and the sex is VERY hot and erotic.

	schema:headline " A cult classic best martial arts Van Damme Style movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bloodsport 1988 is my favorite action Van Damme movie. It was the first movie I ever saw about Van Damme that introduced me in to his movies. This is the film I grew up with it I have first see it when I was 8 years old! I love this movie to death! In my opinion is Van Damme's best martial arts film! Beside Hard Target Bloodsport is one of his best movies till date. I Love it so much. Best martial arts movie is never boring is fast and entertaining and It is awesome seriously. And I still love it today Bloodsport also introduced me in to martial arts. Jean Claude Van Damme's Bloodsport is still today it's best. After this movie there were a few copycat movies that copy the idea from this movie. Like were Bloodfight 1989 with Bolo Yeung returning with the same name but playing different character from the Bloodsport and Bloodfist 1989 with World Kickboxing champion Don The Dragon Wilson. I also love the music from this movie lately it helps me a lot the song On My Own  Alone I also love the song Fight to Survive.This is my favorite tournament fighting film too. This film also inspired the video game Mortal Kombat and for that? This film is twice as awesome to me. This is a film where you see JCVD at his peak and this is my second favorite JCVD flick after Hard Target and Universal Soldier. It holds up really well to this day and it's a shame the film does not have a special edition on DVD and Blu Ray. The film does have a big cult following so it not getting any features to this day is lame. Great concept great cast charismatic characters bad ass fights and a kick ass soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best martial arts flicks ever made without a doubt for me. Fell in love with the film ever since I saw it on VHS when I was a kid.As for the Bloodsport sequels? For the most part? They all suck. They can't even hold a candle to this film. Bloodsport is a classic and a fight that is worth watching anytime anywhere. I still own this movie on VHS and on Bluray. I don't have the DVD I don't need it. I am going to say it again I love this movie to death it is my childhood JCVD film and I grew up with it. I have always enjoy it. It has a real bloody badass fights. Van Damme and Yeung kicks fighters to the ground. Original this movie was almost never released but Van Damme helped edit the film so that it could be released this movie is praised and loved all over the World including Asia USA and East Europe. The real Frank Dux was the fighting coordinator for this film. When JeanClaude Van Damme was cast Dux announced that Van Damme wasn't nearly in good enough shape and put him through a 3month training program. Van Damme called those three months the hardest training of his life  this despite being a worldchampionship martial artist in his own right.It does feel good to go rewatch films like this especially dealing with the very sad fact that films like this classic aren't made anymore and seeing Van Damme these days on film he just seems to stone faced or depressed. I have enjoyed training sequences flashback sequences on Frank Dux's earlier childhood life and a life of a young man. The chase sequences where Helmer and Rawlis are chasing Dux was hilarious and very entertaining. Chong Li in my opinion is one of the best non horror villains out there. My personal favorite JCVD villain and my favorite martial arts villain. Also though it isn't the same character almost like a bizarro world version another Chong Li appears in a movie called Bloodfight Bloodsport knockoff played by Bolo Yeung. Van Damme maybe had some problems in his later years but I always admired him for everything he did to make this movie well known back in '88 from reediting the original cut to promoting the movie by putting posters of it himself in cinemas. This movie for me is a perfect 10 I don't care what anyone says.".

It has a real bloody badass fights. Van Damme and Yeung kicks fighters to the ground. Original this movie was almost never released but Van Damme helped edit the film so that it could be released this movie is praised and loved all over the World including Asia USA and East Europe. The real Frank Dux was the fighting coordinator for this film. When JeanClaude Van Damme was cast Dux announced that Van Damme wasn't nearly in good enough shape and put him through a 3month training program. Van Damme called those three months the hardest training of his life  this despite being a worldchampionship martial artist in his own right.It does feel good to go rewatch films like this especially dealing with the very sad fact that films like this classic aren't made anymore and seeing Van Damme these days on film he just seems to stone faced or depressed. I have enjoyed training sequences flashback sequences on Frank Dux's earlier childhood life and a life of a young man. The chase sequences where Helmer and Rawlis are chasing Dux was hilarious and very entertaining. Chong Li in my opinion is one of the best non horror villains out there. My personal favorite JCVD villain and my favorite martial arts villain. Also though it isn't the same character almost like a bizarro world version another Chong Li appears in a movie called Bloodfight Bloodsport knockoff played by Bolo Yeung. Van Damme maybe had some problems in his later years but I always admired him for everything he did to make this movie well known back in '88 from reediting the original cut to promoting the movie by putting posters of it himself in cinemas. This movie for me is a perfect 10 I don't care what anyone says.";

It's not just good it's great. It was really exciting to see different fighting styles from all over the world. And Bolo Yeung did a really great job as the villain. He barely talks but shows with his behavior that he is Mr. ruthless himself. The final fight with van Dammes trademark the 360kick shown several times in slow motion is a feast for the eye. Hong Kong is the location for the movie and the city fits perfectly for it. Enjoy!".

Okay its not an Oscar winner for acting but who cares! its not about acting its about true martial arts and fighting on the big screen and Bloodsport brings this to you superbly. One of my favourite movies it also provides the Rocky pump as in like Rocky it has the emotion both in action and through the films music and the fighting makes you want to get up and starting punching and kicking anything! and you don't get that sort of feeling with many films. Rocky had it and Bloodsport has it and if a fighting film makes you get up and fight your living room wall then its a winner! Van Damme is excellent his fighting manoeuvres are breathtaking the range of different styles of fighters is great and well know martial artist Bolo Yeung's destruction of all opponents is wonderfully filmed and as Van Dammes main contender we have a great adventure. All the fighters give great performances and the fighting scenes are superb. Great performance from big Donald Gibb as the hilarious Ray Jackson. His running punch on his first opponent is worth watching for that alone! Donald Gibb is excellent and brings humour to the role as well as some excellent and sometimes hilarious no nonsense fighting! The story too is superb the kumite bringing the worlds greatest fighters together and by invitation only and the location also brilliant. Hiden in the depths of Hong Kong badlands. A winner in all departments. I remember watching this with friends and going out in the garden for some Bloodsport kicking and punching well not each other thin air! but it makes you feel alive. Not many films do that. 1010 for me. Fantastic film!".

It has a few good songs too! It has very good fighting and it is a serious movie. Here is a brief look at the films best competitors that are most likely to win the Kumite.Bolo Yeung as Chong Li  Chong Li is the undefeated champion that holds many records and will do anything to win a match whether it is to break a mans leg knock him out or even kill his opponent. He has huge muscles and there is no telling how strong he is. Every fighter is in trouble when they step in the ring against him.JeanClaude Van Damme as Frank Dux  Frank Dux is a great fighter taught by Tanaka. He a hansomemusclarsmartand kind man that cares. He know just about it all when it come to fighting thanks to his great master. He really cares for his new friend Jackson. Paulo Tocha as Paco  There is one kickboxer type fighter named Paco. He is a great fighter but he doesnt block well but he has two advantages. 1. Pacos opponents should not trust him when he reaches out to shake hands because he is a cheater and 2. is when he grabs ahold of his opponent its all over with!Donald Gibb as Jackson  Jackson is a massive man with a bad attitude but is a good friend to Frank Dux. He is very tuffstrong and is able to beat up anyone though he fools around too much and thats his only mistake.Michel Qissi as Parades  Parades has big thick legs that hits his opponents hard but like Paco he is not a good blocker and that is his only flaw.Bloodsport has many other great figters but these are top ones in the Kumite. If you like JeanClaude Van Damme and fighting films then be sure to check this awesome JeanClaude Van Damme movie out soon because in MY opinion it is a classic!".

This movie is more than just about fighting. It transcends the entertainment value it was made to provide. This story is about Dux's journey through life and his struggle to bring honour to his Shidoshi. He is not in it for money or bragging rights but simply for honour. Now how many people in today's world care about honour? Not very many. This is one out of many reasons why I love and am inspired by this movie.

No one can deny that van damme is a great martial artist but his acting is so so the opposite.You have to look at it as a martial arts film which it is and accept the stunning fight sequences especially the final fight scene which was very well choreographed the film offers.Yes people will talk about how bad his acting may be but what people forget is that he is a martial artist more than an actor. Movies are just the way he can express his great skills to an audience.I recommend this film to any martial arts fan but not so much to anyone looking for a compelling dramatic mystical thriller because you will be disappointed.On all it's a basic pure martial arts film that i feel is underrated.".

No one can deny that van damme is a great martial artist but his acting is so so the opposite.You have to look at it as a martial arts film which it is and accept the stunning fight sequences especially the final fight scene which was very well choreographed the film offers.Yes people will talk about how bad his acting may be but what people forget is that he is a martial artist more than an actor. Movies are just the way he can express his great skills to an audience.I recommend this film to any martial arts fan but not so much to anyone looking for a compelling dramatic mystical thriller because you will be disappointed.On all it's a basic pure martial arts film that i feel is underrated.";

	schema:headline " Gay Karate Guy makes his best movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I am not a huge Van Damme fan but I have seen and commented on several of his movies. When you watch Van Damme you want to see bad acting bad accents decent action and several slow motion kicks to the face. Bloodsport delivers like no other.Let's just start with the acting. Van Damme was not quite full of himself at this point in his career having played Gay Karate Guy in 1984's Monaco Forever so he's actually not as bad as usual. His main supporting actor is Donald Gibb best known for playing Ogre in the Revenge of the Nerds movies. He basically plays Orge in this movie too although he doesn't shout NERDS! He should have but he didn't. That is why this is 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Forest Whitaker is in this too. Apparently being a supporting actor in Platoon Fast Times at Ridgemont High Color of Money Stakeout and Good Morning Vietnam was not enough credit to land him the coveted role of the main military policeman that is constantly outsmarted by Van Damme ! in this film. Instead the actor with the best film credits in the movie is the secondincommand military policeman who serves under the person that is constantly outsmarted by Van Damme. Either the casting director was racist or he could see into the future and knew that Forest would eventually costar in Battlefield Earth and was thus deserving of punishment. Bolo Yeung the Asian bad guy with the huge pecks plays a suitably evil villain at the impressive age of 50.The soundtrack is pretty awesome too. You have a nice blend of lame 80s music combined with a strange theme song that has the refrain Kumite! Kumite! The song is so good it makes you wish AhHa covered it.The plot of the movie is silly. To avenge the death of his Asian friend and make his mentor proud the militarytrained Van Damme sneaks off to Asia to compete in the Kumite. This is the world's most hardcore fighting tournament and it is ultrasecret. The military doesn't want Van Damme to fight so two men are sent to Asia to get him. They fail frequently until they eventually decide to let him compete. There is a nosy reporter woman that wants to cover the Kumite. Naturally her main purpose in the movie is to give us a reason to see Van Damme's ass. Van Damme and Ogre become friends after Van Damme beats him in a karate video game. Ogre for reasons unbeknownst to me identifies Van Damme's accent as American and the two become good friends. After a shot of Van Damme beating someone up is shown in slowmotion two or three times Ogre stands up and shouts That's the fastest thing I ever saw! You see if he hadn't said that the audience wouldn't have known it was fast they would have had to rely on the timer above the ring that said new world record. Obviously Van Damme has to fight a number of people most of whom have comically unique styles of fighting. Just as obviously Van Damme has to fight Bolo in the end. Van Damme has several slow motion kicks to the face and seven different times where he does the splits. Van Damme doesn't get much better than this.By the way this is based on a true story. HA!".

The plot and characters may be simple some of the acting may be amateurish and the music may be dodgy but Bloodsport remains an enjoyable nobrainer for fans of the star or genre.Van Damme stars as Frank Dux a soldier in the US Army. He has been trained by Tanaka all his life in martial arts and wishes to travel to the infamous Kumite tournament in Hong Kong to avenge his friend's death. The Kumite is a tournament which attracts the best and most vicious fighters from around the world many of whom are seriously injured or killed while taking part. Dux breaks orders and travels to Hong Kong but two soldiers follow him in an attempt to bring him back. There he meets Ray Jackson a fellow fighter and Janice Kent a reporter trying to get an inside scoop on the tournament. From there we see many fights as Dux progresses in the tournament whose defending Champion Chong Li Bolo Leung is a deadly killer. Naturally they meet in the final.Once the plot devices of revenge and honour are put in place all we have to do is sit back and watch the fights. They are wellstaged there is a fair amount of violence some humour and the main cast do as well as could be expected. This is a must for Van Damme fans but there will be little for anyone who does not watch martial arts movies.7 out of 10".

Bloodsport is deftly edited adequately paced effectively gory at times and features enough intense fighting to make it suitable entertainment. Van Damme may not have been much of an actor at this point but he was already displaying that easygoing charm that has served him well. Gibb best known as Ogre in Revenge of the Nerds delivers a lively performance as his new buddy. Ms. Ayres The Burning does a decent job as the requisite romantic interest and certainly is very easy on the eyes. Burton and Whitaker are good as the government guys just trying to do their jobs it's fun to see them attend the final matches and actually start enjoying the spectacle. Genre legend Bolo Yeung is a perfect villain as Chong Li the reigning champion of the Kumite who's developed an enormous ego. Roy Chiao Bruce Lee's Game of Death as Frank's mentor Tanaka and Philip Chan Double Impact as police captain Chen are excellent in support. By the time of the big confrontation  fight at the end sufficient rooting interest has been generated.Just before the end credits we get a summary of the accomplishments in the real Frank Dux's life.Seven out of 10.".

Man did Cannon really hit one out of the park this time. Not  only did it set the careers of Van Damme and Forest Whitaker in motion  it almost singlehandedly set the mold for all the many Punchfighters to  come. Of course to the Bloodsport people it's not just fighting it's  a martial science. I guess martial arts are just too lowbrow for  them. The Kumite has no weight divisions so hulking brutes fight  against skinny wimps without a second thought. Guys even have quirky  unique styles and even the knockoffs are quality productions  look  at Shootfighter 1992. And the knockoff even spawned a sequel! Such  is the awesome power of Bloodsport.

When these action movie people come up with a good word they  really don't let you forget it.  JCVD never gets tired of showing us that he can spread his legs widely  and weirdly and he has plenty of funny facial expressions. He's  supposed to be American but his accent is pretty thick  Belglish is  a bit more like it. He and Ogre have good chemistry together. Sure  Gibb is great and he brings the movie up but what would it be like  had the role been played by Jack S. Daniels? But Van Damme as the  spiritual warrior and Gibb as the brash basher is a winning combo.  It's colorful it's fun it's entertaining and it's fast paced. It  also has some great songs and Hong Kong locations. What more could you  ask for?

The hero is great JCVD the sidekick is unbelievably amusing Jackson and the bad guy. Well I can only say that this is the best bad guy in recorded history. Seeing JCVD in the ring is like looking at a dancer performing his routine very reminiscent to Bruce Lee in Fist of Fury when he is in the ring with like 20 Japanese karate dudes. You know it ain't real and that the moves worth nothing in real life but you still enjoy it tremendously. Add to that the incredible music that backs the fights and you got yourself something that you can keep watching and never get tired of. As a boy I totally loved the movie and probably watched it at least 20 times. Roll forward 8 years I watched this movie as a soldier and it was still unbelievably great. Roll forward present day I accidentally watched bloodsport II and said to myself Boy this is crap the first one was way better and just to prove the point I watched it again this time with my wife!! Well my wife didn't really approve but she liked the Persian prince so I don't think her opinion counts... but for me it was still an amazing movie. I strongly recommend to anyone who likes martial arts films and especially to the guys who are tired of all the stunts and computer enhancement that one can get in modern martial arts film. Enjoy!! I know I will next time I see it Perhaps with my children...".

	schema:reviewBody "Ninjutsu trained American Frank Dux leaves home for Hong Kong in order to be a part of the controversial MartialArts Tournament called the Kumite. The Kumite is a freeform illegal and extremely dangerous underground fighting tournament that occasionally turns deadly. Bloodsport is supposedly based on true events from the actual Frank Dux's life. Bloodsport is considered by many to be JeanClaude Van Damme's best film as well as the film that paved the way for his international fame and cult status among martialarts and action film fans. The fight coordinator for the film was the actual Frank Dux himself who even allegedly took the time to put JeanClaude Van Damme through three months worth of training in order for him to be extra prepared for the role despite the fact that Van Damme was already a championed martialartist. Bloodsport is considered one of the biggest cult classics of the 80s.It's no surprise to me why this film is hailed so much as a martialarts classic. While I can't say that it is quite as spectacular as... say for example Enter the Dragon I still cannot deny this film's magnificence. This really is an amazing action film. Granted it is silly at times but if you are looking for a raw brutal bloody and intense fight film this really is one of the best that there is. The fight scenes here are some of the tightest and most jaw dropping fight scenes of it's kind. JeanClaude Van Damme himself is a sight to behold. His kicks and splits are simply out of this world. If you haven't seen them you simply must. It's a necessity. I can easily say that it is easily one of his most charismatic and he does go all the way with it when the time comes. His screen presence is one of the most memorable things about this film but just as amazing this time is Sammo Hung as Frank Dux's rivaling warrior. Hung is a real beast of a man in here and what I was impressed by was how Van Damme was able to visually convey the same sort of power as he despite the fact that he looks smaller and skinnier than Sammo Hung. Again it's the kicks and the splits that do it though his body does look like it's in excellent shape. I think this helped me get even more involved in the more vicious fight scenes in the film.The screenplay here is actually not too bad especially considering the genre. We have some fairly decently fleshed out characters here and some very quick but efficient character development. A lot of these moments feel a lot more genuine that most are probably expecting and this only helps the film feel more realistic. At times Bloodsport felt borderline documentarylike in it's look and in it's approach to the fight scenes. The film actually has a lot of ground to cover in telling the life story of Frank Dux and the whole film flows beautifully. The setting the characters and the things that happen to the characters all feel realistic enough. You feel like you are there. The look of the film only adds to it. It's grainy yet colorful. Ugly yet bright. Dull yet saturated. The music in this picture is phenomenal and it adds so much to the fight scenes. Also hats off to Van Damme for not only convincing studio executives to allow him to reedit the film but also convincing them to actually release. It may not have made any money and Newt Arnold may be passed away but this film will carry on both he and Van Damme's legacy.It's not my favorite Van Damme film believe it or not but it is truly a masterpiece of it's genre. This film is amazing and it has everything that you want to see in a film like this. Bloodsport is entertaining from start to finish. I think what makes this one especially good is the fact that I can recommend it to anyone even those who aren't fans of JeanClaude Van Damme. The fight scenes are easily the best part. They are brutal and wonderfully pulled off. Van Damme gives a rather charismatic performance that only helped enhance my appreciation of this film. Bloodsport is a great film. Check it out!".

I saw DVD of this film again alone. And this time I cannot help enjoying it. Every actor's line touched me very very much.What's behind the mountain? May be another mountain and another. How wonderful it'd be to forget the past. Everyday would be a new beginning. Isn't that great? What's love? Maybe love is to leave the one you love to win the one then finally find you have lost everything including yourself.Now I have my job and new life. Many things have been past for a long time. And this movie I cannot remember some of the scenes. But sometimes I still recall lots of words they say. When I am alone when I feel gloomy or a little bit sad the words will come to my mind with beautiful music and the scene of huge desert.In this world something's gonna change something's not. If you cannot have someone the only thing you can do is not to forget.I will never forget.".

	schema:reviewBody "This classic ultrastylized and in the words of the NYFF blurb insanely gorgeous 1994 martial arts or 'wuxia' film based on the Louis Cha novel 'The EagleShooting Horses' needs no introduction to film fans now though before Tarantino's release of 'Chungking Exrpess' Americans had to go to Chinatown theaters or rent pirated videotapes to see it I saw it in Chinatown in a double bill with 'As Tears Go By' 1988. A cinematic icon today Wong Karwai didn't get international recognition till 1997 at Cannes for 'Happy Together' and the majority of US arthouse viewers didn't notice him till 'In the Mood for Love' 2000. Now ironically since the huge blowout and exhaustion of Wong's epic '2046' 2004 a summingup of his 60's nostalgia themes and characters he seems to have reached a point of exhaustion and his Englishlanguage romance 'Blueberry Nights' 2007 was a critical failure. Reediting 'Ashes of Time' looks like another example of treading water but it's still great to have it many have still not seen it and any films as visually magnificent as Wong's are best seen in theaters. It's also fortunate that all his films can be seen on decent DVD's now with readable subtitles for English speakers instead of the weird earlier Hong Kong prints with flickering titles in Chinese and peculiar English that disappeared before you could read them. 'Ashes of Time Redux' has the best English subtitles yet both visually and linguistically.According to Wong 'Ashes of Time' negatives weren't in very good shape and a search of various versions led him to a huge warehouse somewhere near San Francisco's Chinatown that contained the entire history of Hong Kong movies. He and his team put together various versions adding a bit to what we already know digitally cleaning up the images and enhancing some of the color and doing things with the sound adding a new score and rearrangement by Wu Tong including cello solos by Yo Yo Ma.Experts will have to comb over all this to explain the differences. The cinematographer Christopher Doyle who was present at the press screening of the film at the NYFF doesn't like the enhancing of the color and neither do I. A lot of yellows and oranges are heightened greenishturquoise touches are set in and many of the desert sand landscapes seem to have lost their surface detail. This seems unnecessary and even obtrusive but it's not enough to spoil the experience. Other images simply look more pristine and clear. Wong wouldn't say what specific changes were made in the editing. He preferred to talk about how he adapted Louis Cha's novel and how this film relates to his oeuvre. Both for him and for Doyle it was an essential milestone. The cast features the late Leslie Cheung both Tony Leungs Chiu Wai and Ka Fai and Jacky Cheung and has Maggie Cheung as The Woman and martial arts film great Brigitte Lin as Murong Yin and Murong Yang the sister and brother. Lin now retired was responsible for the revival of the genre and is central to this film though Maggie Cheung is its diva its dream lover.Cha's novel is a complicated 4volume wuxia genre epic very popular but little known or appreciated in the West. Wong studied it carefully and made a parody of it called 'EagleShooting Heroes' but then though he says this film unlike all his others had a fixed plan and thus made for a story full of fatalism he threw away the story and just took a couple of the main characters and made up another simpler story imagining what the characters' lives were like when they were young. A simpler story. Well. The story has always seemed completely incomprehensible to me but after rewatching 'Redux' it obviously is nonetheless a coherent narrative it's just intricate and above all cyclical. It ends as it begins with the narrator looking into the camera and repeating the opening lines.'Ashes of Time' was shot in the desert. Doyle had never done that. The film was long delayed and the shoot was difficult. Doyle knew nothing about martial arts or 'Jianghu' the parallel universe of martial arts fiction. He was under extreme constraints having very little artificial light. Nonetheless he produced some of the most beautiful sequences in modern film because he's a great cinematographer perhaps the greatest of recent decades as Wong KarWai is one of the defining contemporary cinematic geniuses.Wong is notable for his meditative and arresting voiceovers. Here is a sample People say that if a sword cuts fast enough the blood spurting out will emit a sound like a sigh. Who would have guessed that the first time I heard that sound it would be my own blood? You gained an egg but lost a finger. Was it worth it? There are aphorisms or bits of advice Fooling a woman is never as easy as you think. The film is anchored and structured by the Chinese calendar the Chinese almanac is divided into 24 solar terms and the narrative moves forward selectively through these terms which contain weather descriptions naturally and advice as to what is propitious or unlucky and in what regions and directions. There is also a great deal about oblivion and forgetfulness which are linked with wine including a magic wine that eliminates memory. The desert and drinking are visual touchstones throughout as are pairs opposites and contrasts and there is crossdressing and perhaps bisexual love. The images are full of flickering light. The sword fights which do not begin until more than half way into the film are without the acrobatic feats actually performed or digitally faked as in current martial arts films though they are elaborately staged by the action choreographer Sammo Hung. They are a symphony of fast cutting closeups blurs and slow motion which Wong intended particularly to express the fatigue of the Blind Swordsman in the film.".

Ashes of Time is the exception to the rule as it haunts me so much that I have already given it three viewings! It may be because of the wonderful pictures the essential yet poignant dialogues or the grave  epic music nevertheless Ashes of Time is a fascinating movie! Set in a tavern in the middle of the desert it tells us stories of different swordsmen and deals with the theme of unrequited love. All the people in fact had to face a rejection.. and now strive to find a way to overcome the delusion and go on with their life. Swordsmanship is mostly viewed as an outlet to bring out the inner passions and frustrations.The protagonist Ouyang Feng Leslie Cheung is one of those swordsmen who left his lady Maggie Cheung and his village to pursue fame and glory convinced that she would have waited for him to return. Now instead he faces loneliness and the fact that she has married his elder brother.The most peculiar aspect of the movie is the pictures so beautifully shot that each still can make a wonderful portrait. Even the battles rather than being filmed continuously are rendered as a sequence of separate shots thus remaining more indelibly impressed in our head. Indeed the movie also focuses about memory whom the movie title probably refers to and its power to keep alive moments of the past that otherwise would perish in the flow of time. Highly recommended! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface of things we are faced with a martial arts film a typical HK wuxia piece. But knowing Wong KarWai did you really expect a regular martial arts movie? 'cos that's not what you'll get...Best known for his In the Mood for Love and 2046 this stylish director has established his reputation among Asians and Westerners alike through his dreamy poetic romances and metaphysical dramas. Here in Ashes of Time an earlier film remade the director's teamwork with cinematographer Christopher Doyle is already in full bloom. The film offers the same colour palette and style that we find in their more recent collaborative works. This film is beautiful to look at a mystery to behold and a genrebreaking ode to love and loss. Clearly it looks and feels like a 21st century movie but its origins go back some years.Based on a film originally released back in 1994 Ashes of Time Redux is a retelling a story that most of us missed the first time around. The redux is more than a remastered version of the original. Apparently it features significant alterations to the basic structure of the narrative as well a new musical score. More than that it stands as the definite version of the movie a true director's cut. It's almost a kind of second birth because finally the movie can become known for what it truly is. Even though I have not seen the original I will take the director's word for it and trust his judgment.And it is very easy to trust his judgment when the result is as strong as this relatively short 93 min film. It feels like a labour of love. There must be heaps and heaps of discarded film on the editing floor because it is clear that all the little details and cuts were handcrafted to perfection. My main problem with the film is that it is unforgiving to its audiences even careless about how they might feel about being bombarded with constant overloaded verbiage. The result full of symbolic links and razorthin internal connections may feel overstylized and overworked but this kind of approach to filmmaking is admirable because it is so rare. Films that demand a lot also reward the viewer for paying attention. But don't get me wrong this is not a puzzle or a mystery like some Lynch film nor is it surrealistic dream logic like some Buuel. No it conveys a surprisingly simple poetic truth encompassing love manhood relationships struggle perseverance betrayal fantasy hate jealousy remembrance forgetfulness loss and loneliness. It is a movie about forgetting and about the forgetting of having forgotten in the first place. It portrays characters as duplicates mirages and psychic phantoms. Identities are mixed up. Friendships are won and lost mainly lost. Love is first fleeting then impossible and finally a memory.Memory and time and the passing of time these are the central themes of this tale divided up into nonlinear seasons. Nature is cyclical and so is human life and especially human memory which is always obsessed about some recurring dream or fantasy. Memory is not a timeline of events but a force of inertia a dead weight and a curse. Time is the archnemesis of happiness and love is proved impossible by the accidents of nature. Love that once was is no more. Nor was there any love to get around to begin with if memory serves me correctly. Have another sip of wine it'll help you rememberforget...The performances are through and through superb. Both the male characters and the elusive female characters are perfectly cast and the fact that it's an allstar cast does not make it feel any less authentic. Especially female charms and the ambivalent androgyny of one of them are given such full force that we are left with a sea of emotions an ocean of desire. The wailing soundtrack reaches melodramatic heights even when you expect nothing but calm and quiet this signals that the characters are still haunted by their past. There IS no quietude only the passing of time and the lingeringon of memory.The swordfights are stylish thanks to Sammo but peripheral. Action is more often than not a piercing flash of violence that only deepens the emotional wounds carried in the hearts of the protagonists. The physical dagger in the heart of man is nothing compared to the deep soul wound inflicted in love. In death some lucky ones lose their anxiety while others lose nothing but their chance for redemption. Still others are driven to death by precisely this impossibility of redeeming themselves. Living and death become equally mortifying.These themes such as the passion of unrequited love and the wounding of lonely hearts will be familiar from films like Mood and 2046. In fact the director is as obsessed about these themes as are the characters in his movies. The setting does not matter human heart is always the same  desiring hurt and lonely. But it is not pure darkness that we encounter there are also a few authentic flashes of pure passion and empathy although less in Ashes than in many of his other films. To call Wong KarWai a pessimist is to call outer space cold it is rather to miss the point to understate the case. He is not a pessimist but an explorer of love's tragic journey in life from conception to annihilation. He takes us as it were beyond the here into the yonder and gives us intimations of love's afterlife.The film is not perfect. It is oftentimes too selfabsorbed. The audience will be split. I know I was. I didn't especially enjoy the moviegoing experience but I learnt a lot from it and remembered something I thought I had forgotten... In this honest and heartwrenching mood piece love's memory on the big screen is burnt into ashes of time.".

In this honest and heartwrenching mood piece love's memory on the big screen is burnt into ashes of time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on the Chinese heroic literature classic The EagleShooting Heroes by prolific Wuxia author Louis Cha ASHES OF TIME is conspicuous for the unusual and postmodern approach it takes to a genre so firmly entrenched in Hong Kong cinema.The story consists interactions between various characters as they weave in and out of each other's lives with a small village in a bleak desert wasteland as the crossroads. These vignettes are not always sequential and we must gradually piece together the relationships and backgrounds of the protagonists some of which contribute to a larger story while others do not. The allstar cast portrays a varied palette of characters perfectly flawed incarnations of fantastical beings with performances teetering on the line between disarming humanity and iconic romanticism. One thing to love about this movie is the way that director Wong KarWai takes the reflective internal monologues and quirky alienated losers from his other films and transposes them to the world of Chinese heroic fantasy. It's an interesting idea that both ennobles and deconstructs the genre. Martialarts superheroes who can literally shear mountainsides with a wave of the sword mired in their own personal conflicts and bouts with inadequacy in the points of time that occur between the legendworthy events. This unusual treatment lends these mythic characters a familiar dimension that is both poetic and banal. The cast and the desert are wrenchingly beautiful in the same starkly desolate way. The music consists of odd synth dirges like a moody clash of Ennio Morricone and Vangelis particularly the 1492 soundtrack but it is nonetheless hauntingly atmospheric. ASHES OF TIME is a truly beautiful movie. The cinematography is a lush blend of stunningly arid vistas iconic posturing minute sensual gestures grainy documentarystyle camerawork and stylish impressionistic fight sequences. A visual metaphor for textiles and tapestry persists with the various interwoven plots echoed in the camera's almost tactile attention to fabric and texture throughout... sometimes tightly bound like an inescapable net others fraying apart like elusive memories. That said this movie is not going to appeal to everyone. The disjointed dreamlike narrative can be confusing initially with so many characters behaving in obscure ways backwards and forwards in time. Still in the end if you take some time to retrace your steps it all does fit together remarkably well. The puzzle pieces really do form a coherent picture but for most people it will probably take a second viewing to see it all. Also those looking for the action sequences Hong Kong movies are famous for will find the emphasis is on the characters and their meandering thoughts. When the nonetheless exciting and very cool action scenes do take place they are blurred hyperkinetic washes of motion. While Hong Kong action films have some of the greatest choreography captured on film ASHES OF TIME attempts to capture an impressionistic psychological aspect as well sometimes obscuring the action as much as displaying it. This movie takes many of its cues from Sergio Leone's revisionist westerns. The stylized desert environment is the wastes of New Mexico revisited through Chinese legend complete with tormented superhumanlyskilled antihero swordsmengunslingers lost deromanticized ideals melodramatic showdowns and roving hundredsstrong gangs of horse thieves. Still Ashes of Time manages to be its own beast a technical artistic visual sentimental masterpiece that gives a new twist on old conventions while simultaneously managing to belong very much to Wong KarWai's thematic oeuvre. A movie you won't easily forget.".

Nevertheless Ashes is still a very difficult piece to sit through in its entirety. In my opinion due to its disjointed storytelling it is a film where parts are better than the whole and those parts simply take my breath away.Interestingly enough the most breathtaking and spellbinding film to me is not one I so much like or enjoy but is one that I cherish for its evocative artistry.

Tarantino is a huge borrower of ideas. Having already written a couple raw movies that people admire he stumbled upon KarWai in the midst of making this  a long affair. All the clever bits in the structure of Pulp are from this just as surely as all the clever bits in Star Wars are from Kurosawa.What are those bits? Multiple persons in one body. Multiple bodies for one person. Circular storytelling where any part is the beginning. Nested narrative where one story tells another. Characters that imagine and forget each other bringing them into our world and out.Death love yearning accident encounter.All of this at the beginning of a luscious partnership between KarWai and Christopher Doyle. They are today what Greenaway and Sacha Vierny were dangerous adventures in cinematic imagination coupled with mastery of cinematic expression.This takes a few too many chances and you can see precisely where KarWai abandoned it to search for sense. He always shoots in order of what you see. But if you are ready for the transcendental thrills of his later work you might want to start here.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

This film is not a remake it is a redone version of the film a 1992 drama set and shot in the Chinese desert in which Ouyang Feng the late Leslie Cheung plays a person for hire mostly to kill others. Through the film you see various people enter his life and their stories are told in the passing of the seasons. This absolutely stellar casts includes Maggie Cheung both Tony Leungs Carina Lau and Jacky Cheung along with Bridgette Lin and Leslie Cheung. The film chronicles tales of love lust betrayal vengeance pain and yearning admirably. There is also excellent swordplay in this film but the real brilliance of this film is the cinematography by Christopher Doyle. The desert is punctuated with wind  sandstorms and many images are purposely blurred. Really if you are a film buff of any kind this film is essential viewing for the cinematography alone. The film is more dramatic than violent and you are filled with a sense of foreboding throughout wondering what will happen next. I never saw the film in its original incarnation so I can't compare but if you did see the film and liked it you have to see this. If you're a fan of director Wong Kar Wai this is also essential viewing. Do yourself a favor and try to catch this film in a theater where you can enjoy the overall majesty of it. Not a perfect ten only because at times it is a bit hard to follow but stay with it and you'll be rewarded with a great cinematic experience.".

How the two versions differ I can't say but the Redux is very heavily stylized in the way of Chinese Wuxia action. That is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. A comprehensible story. But true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore there are lots of colorful very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story.The editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled. Much is left out in the scenes the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie.Thanks to these brutal but very few fights the movie is put into the action genre. The poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing. Only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action the other couldn't be farther away from it. The movie in its entirety is very slow dull and hence very boring. Not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie.I might say that I'm not a fan of this Chinese style since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems most importantly that the visual is more important than the story but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've seen.310".

I guarantee that you will not be disappointed as you might have felt towards My Blueberry Nights which is not bad but just missing something that makes the movie a bit shy of the director's usual style  the lingering melancholy and subtle poignancy. Surely it is not easy for nonChinese viewers to be convinced by wuxia stories which is usually quasihistorical and surrealistic. But I hope westerners will not be deterred by the genre because what is more important is the characters' thoughts and feelings. Those in wuxia stories are just as real as any other dramas. There are seven characters and the relationships among them seem a bit complicated. Judging from the Chinese title of the movie one can tell that the story between Ouyang Feng and Huang Yaoshi is the main plot and others are just the subplots. Huang Yaoshi is deeply in love with The Woman Maggie Cheung but she never loves him. Her love is Ouyang Feng who disappointed her however by allegedly taking her love for granted. So she married to his older brother. Ouyang Feng then moved to the desert and lived in solitude. To give himself an excuse for seeing The Woman Huang Yaoshi befriended with Ouyang Feng and visited him every year. He collected stories about Ouyang Feng and reported back to The Woman. The interesting things are how much did Ouyang Feng know about the friendship between Huang Yaoshi and The Woman? Could he guess the intention of the annual visit? Did he always know that the socalled memory erasing Magic Wine is from his sisterinlaw when it was first brought to him by Huang Yaoshi? Did he refuse to try it simply because he does not believe in magic? Or because he did not want to forget The Woman even she caused so much pain? He however drank it after finding out that The Woman had died. Does it mean that he was secretly hoping for a chance to see her again and so willing to bear the pain associated with his memory? Huang Yaoshi claimed himself to be the loser in love at the very beginning because he never got the love from The Woman and probably also because he did not even dare to express his love to her. He is a good seducer but he could only acts as a gentleman confidant in front of The Woman. His bitterness is evidenced by his withdrawal to live as a hermit after her death. Ouyang Feng says Huang Yaoshi wanted to know how it feels when being loved and that is why he would make women like him. It is sad to Huang Yaoshi because he totally missed the point. He does not need to know how it feels when being liked. He just needs to know how it feels when being liked by a woman he cares. Maggie Cheung stole the show with her performance at the scene where she confessed that she lost to herself as well as Ouyang Feng in their relationship. For her her love was not appreciated and the only way she could earn her pride back was to shun him altogether. No wonder she was drawn to Ouyang Feng because he is just egoistic as her. For him he avoids rejection by rejecting others first. But were they manipulating each other? No they were just protecting themselves. Sadly they did not know that acting against their own true feelings was actually hurting themselves and each other. Again no wonder only Ouyang Feng not Huang Yaoshi can see through the meaning of the Magic Wine  to know what you have forgot you have to remember what to forget.The subplot of Murong YanYin is really confusing. And personally I am hardly sympathized with her. As to the purpose of the subplot towards the end as Ouyang Feng said that it is not difficult to say You are the one I love the most  if you are not speaking for yourself. This remark foretells that he is incapable of expressing his love. The subplot also brings in the main plot when Ouyang Feng was imagining his sisterinlaw was touching him. The bird cage is a funny prop in the movie. It seems to be suggesting that the characters are just like the birds  trapped.The Blind Swordsman is the most interesting figure outside the main plot. Like Ouyang Feng he ran away from home after heartbreak. What is different is that his wife Peach Blossom still loves him and waiting for him. But he could not forgive her betrayal. He wants to kill Huang Yaoshi whom his wife falls for but failed. When the swordsman found Huang Yaoshi he could not see due to night blindness. After that he started to work for Ouyang Feng as a contract killer. It is unclear whether he knew about the relationship between Ouyang Feng and Huang Yaoshi. Apparently he just took it as a job but how much did he do it for money how much was it of selfdestruction and how much did he do it for helping The Girl revenge her brother? Hong Qi is the only character who is not troubled by women. The subplot about him is to show the unreachable ideal of Ouyang Feng that is to be true to oneself and do what the heart tells. It is Hong Qi's attitude to life in jianghu as well as to his woman. Desert is the best choice for the setting of the story. The harshness and scarcity of lives in desert parallel the emptiness of the characters' souls the climatic extremity corresponds to the contradicted feelings harbored in each of their minds. Last but not least the music is marvelous. It trembles your emotions. As to the cinematography did Christopher Doyle ever disappoint you? Just fantastic as always!".

Leslie Cheung was brilliant as the cynical and bitter Ouyeng Feng. Tony Leung Chiuwai was also great as The Blind Swordsman. Maggie Cheung's ten minutes torward the end is the most jawdroppingly beautiful yet haunting and sad scene ever. It is the best scene ever in a film the film is worth it for that scene alone. Maggie Cheung is an actress you'll never forget once you see this movie and the scene that she is in. The best performance is by Bridget Lin as Yin and Yang who are really one person in one. I REALLY thought those were two different actresses playing those characters amazing work by her.The directing and cinematoaghy is off the hook. The images you see on screen are truely amazing and unforgetable. Wong Karwai does a brilliant job of putting this film together. This is one of my top ten favorite films.1010".

The plot of Ashes of Time is fairly simple and comes down to two words love triangle. Because of those love triangles crossing stories jealousy hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters. The narrative part is seen through Ouyang Feng's eyes Leslie Cheung. Ouyang Feng lives in the desert where he acts as middleman to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of Destiny through which vengeance is achieved. Unfortunately Ashes of Time fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Karwai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact beside the casting of beautiful actors men and women everything else is a failure in this movie. Dialogs are minimalists and not original at all. Picture's quality is very much unequal the editing is one of the worst ever seen at least by me in the swordplay genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing. Even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved the so call erotic women on a horse scene is ridiculous not erotic and useless. Wong Karwai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told. By forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective.".

	schema:reviewBody "The cinematography and art direction like all Wong Kar Wai films is simply magnificent. The desolate landscape reflects the loneliness and isolation that permeates through the entire movie a sense of lost and despair a basic mood of pessimism that lasts till the very near end of movie where we got a glimpse of a future that holds promise through the actions and thoughts of Ouyang and of course a flash foreword that shows the future of the characters. The action scenes are in a word WOW. Wow in the sense that I have never seen it done like that before. All the actions scenes I have seen all involves the action being seen properly. Every punch kick slashes and chop are seen and most of the time emphasised through slow motion. However in Ashes of Time except for one scene all the fight scenes are shot in trademark Wong Kar Wai style strobing effect where everything is just a blur. That really blew me away as I felt like I was actually in the fight with everything going at breakneck speed with hardly anytime to react. The story or rather what the film conveys is very thought invoking like a typical Wong Kar Wai film every time you see the film you discover something new. You would discover another piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is a Wong Kar Wai movie and only through multiple viewings would you be able to piece together the whole story. Like all his films the movie is more about the form the film itself rather then the story the story at times seems to be an afterthought a side dish to the main course of the visual feast of cinematography art direction and sound to provide the audience with a lingering sense of mood of feeling. It makes you reflect on your own views on life and love and for me the similar sense of disenchantment that I share with the characters. Things like the best way to avoid rejection is to reject others first or if you have to lose something the best way is to keep it in your memories. It also makes you realise and reflect upon the fact that the consequences of any action you take do not affect only yourself but the people around you as well. The part on Hong Qi and his actions strikes me a lot and that happened only at the last of my numerous viewings and that is his courage. Would you have the courage to be yourself to go after your own dreams even if the cost is great? It is this ability to involve the audience to make them think way after they have seen the film and to make go see the film again and again which makes this film great. The sense of familiarity that makes people go I feel the same way or I know someone who is like that. it just sorts of brings the movie closer to you to make you feel involved like the characters are acting out your life in a weird way. It is the entire package cinematography art direction sound and a philosophical story close to my heart that make me love this film so much. To date it is still my all time favourite nonAmerican film.".

Thus I have enjoyed the thoughtful serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless popcorn fun of action films. With a wide array of Chinese Japanese and Korean movies under my belt I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It is one of the worst Chinese movies I have ever seen.To start off this overrated swordplay epic showcases the infamous slideshow action sequence throughout which is nothing more than an ultracheap and pathetic form of action choreography. One simply needs to show a series of closeup pictures of grimising faces swords legs andor arms and then a dead body. Bravissimo! You now have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on.The dramatic element of this film is nonexistent as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen which renders all characters generic and colorless leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact the storyline itself is an absolute disaster introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices. Plot complexities in films can be used very advantageously i.e. A Tale of Two Sisters but Ashes of Time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reason.In fact this entire movie acts like a series of smokescreens to cover up its deficiencies. Horrible action choreography is covered up by slideshow tricks and chaotic camera movements. Nonexistent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel. And a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with convolution.As if this weren't bad enough this movie was extremely boring seeming more like 150 minutes instead of the actual 95.Rating  A rarely given 05 Stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Dung Che Sai Duk' aka 'Ashes of Time' is a beautiful visual tapestry. It is another fine example of poetry on canvas. The story does not follow a linear structure but at the same time the dazzling visuals grip the viewer and involve us in the characters' life. The first time I watched 'Dung Che Sai Duk' I was engaged throughout the entire duration but by the end I was left a little confused. This is because I overlooked the layers and some of the important details. It also didn't help that the subtitles were poor. After second viewing this time with better subtitles it became a lot more clearer and my appreciation has increased much more.Almost the entire film is set in the desert. There are plenty of swordfights to enjoy but this is secondary to the story which is mainly about unrequited love and how the fights are a projection of their anger and way of dealing with rejection. The fight scenes are well choreographed. However I felt slow motion was overused. The editing is good but I was disappointed that so many sequences were cut from the Redux version. The dialogues are marvelously poetic. The tricky cinematography is conducted through various angles and so astonishingly effective. The soundtrack is superb and atmospheric. The cast boasts of top talented names like Leslie Cheung Maggie Cheung Brigitte Lin Tony Leung Chiu Wai Jacky Cheung and Carina Lau all of whom do full justice to their roles with subtle performances.Kar Wai Wong is known for experimenting with different themes and here he does that with unrequited love. Although the treatment of the story is slightly different when compared to his other works the same essence remains within the characters. It is a movie that stays with you and invites you to revisit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have my message headed with a WARNING because I don't want any readers to be misled and go rushing for this movie thinking it's like anyone of those Chinese Wuxia movies. This is not an action based movie it only has sword fighting world as a background. This is what always made WKW's films different from any others'. This film has probably the least action scenes compared to any other sword fighting films made within the last 15 years.I called it Timeless because seen again today you don't find it outdated like some others' films. This is among the only 4 Chinese films that I will enjoy watching again every 2 or 3 years and I think this is the most timeless among the 4.The other 3 are Love EterneLi Han Hsiang A Touch of ZenKing Hu and Days of Being WildWKWThis is the kind of film that you know it's great even if you don't understand it. You don't need to understand its story in order to enjoy it. It's message is simply about memories and regrets. It said something like Regrets is the most painful feeling and regrets and unhappiness because of memories.It's the most complicated among WKW's 7 or 8 filmstill 2046 and Eros. I don't fully understand it during the first viewing but I was totally surprised and mesmerized. I am the type that will consider a film good only if after watching surprised me and felt that i could not thought of such a film. If I can expect or imagine a film's outcome I will not call it great. Even after 4 viewings now I am not totally sure I have figured out all its sequences yet but it doesn't matter. Some of the scenes and editions are paced so fast that you may not recall seeing it. Just like his recent 2046. This is the work of a brilliant directorbecause you need more than 1 viewing to fully get it so you must buy a copy for future viewing. Heard that even the Venice Filmfest Jury has to give it a prize although they don't understand what's it about.Those who don't know how to appreciate a good film may not understand a WKW film as he seldom stick to a particular genre his films' genre is simply WKW and it's all about sights and sound in WKWstyle. Original stylish and trend setting. After his Ashes of Time and Fallen Angels swept all the major awards during the HK Film Awards in the same year 2 most prominent HK directors changed style and tried to follow WKWstyle but both failedTsui Hark in DaoBlade and Stanley Kwan in Hold Me Tight.WKW has mentioned that movies to him is most is sights and sound and we see it clearly in this film. The music and the cinematography is the best.Those who don't like WKW films may criticize that he don't has a script or don't know what he wants until the final edition. I totally disagree. I think WKW always know what he wants and completed the film just the way he wants it otherwise how could all his films are being so well received by critics ?. As for the viewers what we want is the finished work. We don't care the original idea or the casts. We only care for the outcome. I mentioned it because this film took 2 years to complete and along the way plot and actors have changed. Leslie Cheung  nominated for best acting here but I find him better in 2 other WKW films Days of Being Wild and Happy TogetherWKW won best director at Cannes. Brigitte Lin is superb in a dual character roles. Tony Leung and Carina Lau are always goodusually and only in WKW films. Maggie Cheungunbilled has her best 2 single take shotsher fans must keep this. Even pop idol Michelle Yeung who never act well appeared like she acted.I strongly recommend this film to any film student or critics. Those who like 2046 or Tsui Hark's The Blade will like it. This is not WKW's best but I consider it his most UNIQUE. Like any other WKW movies it's a collectors' item and a future classic if not already one.".

When they do happen they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful with the of Maggie Cheung Brigitte Lin and a rollcall of HK's top acting talent chewing up the scenery. As with some of Wong Karwai's early work the dialog could be more precise. In short The Ashes of Time requires a forgiving attitude. Released around the same time as Wong Karwai's spectacularly successful Chungking Express it's clear that the director isn't as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film. Anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed. But those intrigued by the director's aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least.".

This one rates an 8. The two together are probably a 12.I personally didn't like the amped up color. I gather that one of the things that happened when the filmmaker rediscovered a warehouse full of bootlegs was that there were some terrible copies that distorted the color and he liked and played with that. This version also seemed more static than I remembera lot of shots seem to have been done with still or very short segments of film. I have to see the original again to see if that's really the case or if it is just my memory that there were more frames of action in the original. This often felt like it was cut from snippets. For example the shifting sands under the title was a pair of superimposed images moving in different directions. Was that the case originally as well?I loved the original but also could never quite follow the plot. Redux slices and dices orratherunslices so that each story is parceled together and the blurring that is going on in the interactions onscreen for example the YinYang sibs does not spill over quite as much into the interaction between viewer and screen. Redux shakes out the story lines so you can parse them. I miss the mystification and don't think it's a net gain. I also think something else may be going on here... If you remember the original or have a copy to view tell me what you think of this reading The point of view of the story seems to have shifted from Huang Yaoshi to Ouyang Fengalthough because of how the movie mixes action memory and stories it is hard to tell. In the original we followed the wandering Huang as his memory unspooled. Part of the difficulty for a viewer in understanding was the difficulty that his point of view had because he was moving through a world of consequences without his memory to root understanding. The story flowed in pieces which might have been his splintered memoriesashes of time or might have been others'. Things that he is told by unreliable narrators are accepted at face value until experience tells him otherwise. Events are repeated in variation as his understanding of them waxes and wanes.In this version the narrator Huang Yaoshi is fixed and the world comes to him. Things enacted in the first movie for example the encounter between Huang and Murong with all the attendant ambiguity of living sequence are instead recounted with the flattening filters of narrator and listener. Unlike Huang Ouyang accepts nothing at face value. So each event is more clearly arranged in a narrative but all the narratives are filtered in the same way by a mind that rejects nuances that it can't fit to its particular ego. It is only at the end that Ouyang gains an insight that he may have missed things as important as his life's love as a result of his fear and pride.The story consists of interlocking circlesorganized around malefemale pairs. Ouyang and his true love are separated because of mutual pride and unwillingness to be the first to declare love Huang plays messenger between them never telling the woman his own love for her. This story of two men and a woman is mirrored in a minor key in another triangle which engages Huang. In this one passion was realized with unhappy consequences for all. Huang seduced his best friend's bride. At the time of the story the blind husband encounters the memoryless Huang. Just as the moment to tell love had gone by for the lovers in the first triangle the moment to enact revenge has slipped past the rivals. The subsidiary stories also have evenly balanced male and female parts. The balance of male and female is concentrated to a point in Murong who manifests that experience as a spinning latticed cage sexual identity as a trap. Hong Qi the natural is steadfastly pursued by his wife who ignores his rejection and simply acts to do what she thinks is right. The girl who wants revenge for her brother mirrors Ouyang. Each believes they have only one thing to sell and each expects to be able to withhold the self from the exchange. For each it takes another person's wound to break the trance of transactions. Whatever is going on Wong Kar Wai and Christopher Doyle are gods.".

She does so to be able to stand on her own two feet for the first time in her life something she probably could not have done if she remained in a job washing hair at a beauty salon. Working at the mine does not sit well with her father Hank Aimes who also works at the mine and who like the other male workers believes she is taking a job away from a man. Hank has believed that all Josey's problems are of her own doing ever since she unmarried had Sammy while she was still in high school. Josey has always stated that she does not know who Sammy's biological father is which fosters Hank's attitude about her. ...";

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this would be one of those issuebased legal drama movies about sexual harassment where the main character is harassed a couple of times and then she eventually fights back. I was apprehensive about buying it. I mean I wanted to see it but whether it was worth buying was another thing. After checking I decided to gamble. I bought the DVD and watched it and discovered that 'North Country' is about much more than sexual harassment. As the film progresses towards the end we are addressed more important themes such as the consequence of rape on the relationship between a mother and child and how her silence is used as a weapon against her. However while these issues are interestingly dealt with and fit the story they slightly deviate from the main theme of sexual harassment.Niki Caro does a fine job in directing. Her intentions are sincere. Perhaps the script could have been a little tighter and the courtroom sequences could have been better handled as they are a little too dramatic and unrealistic especially the judge letting White to argue his case that way. In addition to that the case became more about Josey's sex life rather than the actual harassment and terrorizing in the workplace. Even though this provides a twist in the story and explains a lot of Josie's situation it takes away from the main theme. Also most of the male characters have been caricatured. I understand the film is about Josey which may be the reason why these characters weren't given much attention but even Josey's father is portrayed as a misogynist and all of a sudden he is shown to have a change of heart. It would have liked to see this characters inner conflict as he plays a crucial role in Josey's life.In the technical front the cinematography is smooth and gives us some spectacular glimpse of the snowy landscape and the coal mines. The sound effect and countryfeel soundtrack are quite good too.Charlize Theron deserves all the recognition she got for giving a strong confidant and heartfelt performance as the brave hardworking and headstrong Josey Aimes. She breathes fire into her role and along with Frances McDormand she's the heart of the film. McDormand performs naturally and her tragic character provides some great comic relief. She has some witty oneliners that bring a smile. While most of the guys are portrayed as nasty sleazy men Sean Bean's Kyle is the complete opposite. Nonetheless the actor does a fine job quite a deviation from what the type of roles he's more famous for. Harrelson's Bill White suffers from poor characterization. His character is a bit too sketchy. Harrelson tries the best with what he's got and turns in a decent enough performance. Richard Jenkins too suffers from poor writing. Sissy Spacek has a tiny role but she has a subtle dignified presence and her character contributes to one of the major turning points of the story. Rusty Schwimmer and Michelle Monaghan are adequate.'North Country' isn't an easy film to watch because of the explicit scenes of sexual harassment and the haunting rape scene but it is a relevant film. Not only is it about women's rights it's about everyone's right to live a life with dignity to work with dignity. It's about standing up against injustice rather than turning a blind eye. It's about protecting your loved ones and fighting for what you believed in. Though 'North Country' isn't without its share of flaws it is a little preachy and sometimes too dramatic it brings forth some important themes well enough and with the support of good direction and strong performances it's worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hate to give North Country a relatively low vote because this is such an important issue and I appreciate the good intentions of director Niki Caro and the Alist actors who no doubt took a big pay cut when agreeing to take a role.On the other hand I feel disappointed a little angry as well as insulted as a woman that this hugely important story was made into a melodrama that flattens out what really happened and somehow manages to diminish the political nature of sexual harassment even while seeming to highlight it.At least 90 percent of the problem had to do with Michael Seitzman's script. In the interview with Seitzman on the DVD he makes clear that he didn't think the sexual harassment story was the real story. The real story he said was the traumatic experience Josie had in high school and her relationship with her son.Therefore he should have written a script for Lifetime focusing on what he felt was the real story. He should not have used one of the most important cases for sexual harassment in legal history as the vehicle for telling this other story. The producers should have demanded a script that more closely resembled Susannah Grant's Erin Brockovich. The sequence of victimization after victimization depicted in North Country didn't let us get to know Josie's character in any depth. We saw her slammed against the wall again and again from beginning to end. We see that she stands up against the oppression but we aren't taken into her sensibility her choices her process her blind spots character change etc etc like in EB. Likewise the lack of complexity in the male macho characters also flattens the story and takes away from the real difficulties in challenging sexism and sexual harassment. In real life character complexity of those who oppress or who defend oppressors is part of what makes the problem of sexual harassment difficult to fight. I read an interview with Niki Caro and though I think she's a very talented director I got the sense that she didn't really get the politics or history behind sexual harassment. It seems things aren't as bad in New Zealand as they are here in the U.S. This is a foreign culture to her and Northern Minnesota is certainly a foreign culture. I wish she would have spent more time fully understanding the issues and cultural dynamics including the accent and mannerisms of the area etc which were sprinkled into the movie but not rigorously replicated before undertaking the project. If she had gone the extra mile to immerse herself in the issue and the region perhaps she would have demanded a total rewrite of the script.".

	schema:reviewBody "Through fourfifths of North Country the audience receives a rare treat. It's a film that deals with a serious issue sexual harassment in a serious way. It is a compelling drama that is well shot directed and acted. It is nothing short of tragic then that the last fifth of the film is some of the worst put to screen this year. Screenwriter Michael Seitzman is no stranger to vastly overblown yet flat melodrama. One can see his Here on Earth for a sample of how ridiculous his conception of human interaction is. Yet how is it that most of the film is not only watchable but truly exceptional when the ending was so terrible? The answer probably has more than a little to do with director Niki Caro. In 2002's Whale Rider Caro guided another spectacular story about a woman who challenges the gender roles of her community. It was a beautiful and engaging tale and North Country starts out the same way.Presenting a fictional account of the nonfiction book Class Action The Story of Lois Jensen and the Landmark Case that Changed Sexual Harassment Law North Country begins on the stand with Josey Aimes Charlize Theron being grilled about her sex life. The film then goes back to Aimes' hiring at the mine and the problems she and the other female workers faced there. The harassment was pervasive. It wasn't just catcalls and sexist utterances though it was those. It was in many cases more or less sexual assault. When Josey felt able to complain about it she could do so in the Human Resources office with a pinup calendar staring back at her. It was the type of openly hostile workplace that really makes you wonder as Josey's dad Richard Jenkins does how is it that so many men can behave so badly? They wouldn't act towards women the same way at a company picnic so why do they do it at work?Josey's struggle is not made easier by most of her female coworkers. They need the high paying mine jobs as much as she does and the repercussions for speaking out have been wellillustrated. Unemployment and hungry families are not welcome ideas when there is no reason to believe your complaints will be acted upon. Or at least acted upon positively. Josey is subjected to degrading and brutal reprisals as are some of the other women despite having not complained themselves. Particularly disgusting though it's hard to pick out the worst from so many choices is an instance where Sherry Michelle Monaghan finds semen in her locker.Josey finally gets to court only to have her sex life put on trial. That this is done is no surprise. In the actual case Jensen vs. Eveleth Taconite the women were subjected to detailed examinations of their personal lives after a judge granted the company's lawyers access to their medical records. Where the film begins to falter is when it tries to defend Josey's sex life. Josey's sex life is not the point and never was. By focusing on that it focuses less on how she and her coworkers were routinely terrorized at work. Though her lawyer Bill White Woody Harrelson does an adequate job in rebutting arguments the arguments are ones that need not be addressed. All the court scenes deal with only this.The struggles of Aimes are based largely on the events of Lois Jensen's Joblike struggle. Where the film fails though is by trying to rearrange them neatly and add Oscar moments. Many of the actions even the ones that seem over the top actually did happen. But they didn't happen like they do in North Country. Particularly regrettable are a courtroom confrontation between White and Bobby Sharpe Jeremy Renner and a surrogate fatherson talk between Kyle Sean Bean and Sammy Thomas Curtis. The awful Hollywood legalisms and almost absurdist melodramatic conclusion is a tremendous letdown after a great start and middle. It's worth noting that the missteps happen where the film strays farthest from the true story the Michael Seitzman coming through maybe. That's not to say that it isn't worth seeing or that is doesn't have brilliant moments such as Sissy Spacek's one woman wifestrike it's just that a halfway decent ending would have made this one of the year's best films. Instead it abandons an important and well done story for the sake of what? Oh well at least it was better than Disclosure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Josey Aimes the beautiful young woman at the center of this story has been betrayed by almost everyone in her short life. As we meet her she is abandoning a situation that has turned bad in the home she shares with an abusive man. She packs whatever she can and her two kids heading north to the home of her parents she is trying to put her life on track. Josey's father still bears a grudge against his daughter because the unwanted pregnancy of the girl who never revealed who was the man responsible for a child she decided to have.Instead of finding a nice environment when she applies and is accepted working at the coal mine in Northern Minnesota Josey becomes the one where all the men loved to pick on. The miners resent the intrusion of women in what has been a male dominated work place up to 1975 when women were allowed in the mines. Her former friend Bobby Sharp seems to be the ring leader who makes her life a living hell. Complaining to the president of the mine only gets Josey deeper in trouble as the chauvinist owner tells her point blank he has no time for her accusations about what's really going on.At the same time all the other women in the mine who are also ridiculed by the male workers turn against Josey. They don't want to lose jobs that pay well and even though they are also ridiculed by the macho men they tolerate the situation and don't want to make waves. When Josey feels she has had enough she quits the job that she needs badly. Glory her best friend and ally comes down with a rare liver disease so there is no help from her. When Josey has tried everything she goes to Bill White a lawyer hoping he would be able to help her sue the mine and get her job back.Josey and Bill have to deal with a formidable opponent as Mr. Pearson the owner has a lot of money and powerful friends and lawyers to deal with problems. The judge who is hearing the proposal tells Bill and Josey he will consider a class action suit if at least three persons come forward something that seems almost impossible when they start the arguments. Josey and Bill persevere against all odds to prove their case which result in a monumental defeat for the mine clearly taking Josey's position.During the trial the defense introduces a witness one of Josey's high school teachers as a character witness. This in turn triggers a chain of events that no one expected. Also Bill White questions Bobby Sharp about his role in a school incident in which he didn't come to Josey's help when the girl badly needed it.Niki Caro whose previous film we had greatly admired seemed to us the wrong choice for directing North Country. We just couldn't imagine she would be able to pull it off working in another environment and a situation that probably presented a challenge to the way she worked. In spite of all that Ms. Caro succeeded with this movie that even though it recalls other films about female sexual harassment that came before. Ms. Caro's film is made even better by the cinematographer Chris Menges who is one of the best men working today. The music of Gustavo Santaolalla plus the atmospheric popular songs in the film work well in the context. The screen play by Michael Seitzman is based on the novel that chronicled a real case that serves as the model for North Country.Charlize Theron appears to love to take chances. Ms. Theron a beautiful and sophisticated woman doesn't mind changing some of the couture clothes she wears to transform herself as this working class woman. She gives an honest performance as Josey. Frances McDormand who plays Glory is only seen during the first half of the film. Sean Bean Woody Harrelson Jeremy Renner Linda Edmond Thomas Curtis Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins among the large cast are seen in supporting roles.Judging by some of the comments submitted to IMDb it appears there are some people who must have hated this film. Frankly while North Country could have used stronger material especially in the court proceedings it is an engaging movie that will satisfy its audience.".

They don't want to lose jobs that pay well and even though they are also ridiculed by the macho men they tolerate the situation and don't want to make waves. When Josey feels she has had enough she quits the job that she needs badly. Glory her best friend and ally comes down with a rare liver disease so there is no help from her. When Josey has tried everything she goes to Bill White a lawyer hoping he would be able to help her sue the mine and get her job back.Josey and Bill have to deal with a formidable opponent as Mr. Pearson the owner has a lot of money and powerful friends and lawyers to deal with problems. The judge who is hearing the proposal tells Bill and Josey he will consider a class action suit if at least three persons come forward something that seems almost impossible when they start the arguments. Josey and Bill persevere against all odds to prove their case which result in a monumental defeat for the mine clearly taking Josey's position.During the trial the defense introduces a witness one of Josey's high school teachers as a character witness. This in turn triggers a chain of events that no one expected. Also Bill White questions Bobby Sharp about his role in a school incident in which he didn't come to Josey's help when the girl badly needed it.Niki Caro whose previous film we had greatly admired seemed to us the wrong choice for directing North Country. We just couldn't imagine she would be able to pull it off working in another environment and a situation that probably presented a challenge to the way she worked. In spite of all that Ms. Caro succeeded with this movie that even though it recalls other films about female sexual harassment that came before. Ms. Caro's film is made even better by the cinematographer Chris Menges who is one of the best men working today. The music of Gustavo Santaolalla plus the atmospheric popular songs in the film work well in the context. The screen play by Michael Seitzman is based on the novel that chronicled a real case that serves as the model for North Country.Charlize Theron appears to love to take chances. Ms. Theron a beautiful and sophisticated woman doesn't mind changing some of the couture clothes she wears to transform herself as this working class woman. She gives an honest performance as Josey. Frances McDormand who plays Glory is only seen during the first half of the film. Sean Bean Woody Harrelson Jeremy Renner Linda Edmond Thomas Curtis Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins among the large cast are seen in supporting roles.Judging by some of the comments submitted to IMDb it appears there are some people who must have hated this film. Frankly while North Country could have used stronger material especially in the court proceedings it is an engaging movie that will satisfy its audience.";

There is a whole confluence of constantly orchestrated pressure applied against all female miners intended to get them to resign.Charlize Theron Who won the Oscar for best actress in MONSTER in the role of the only female serialkiller in U.S. history Florida's Aileen Wuornos as expected is absolutely magnificent as Josey Aimes a woman whose only motivation is wanting to provide a better life for her two children. The fight is quite a tough one for Josey. At first everyone seems clearly to be set against her. Neither her friends nor his parents not even her own children give her their support! But Josey is a very stubborn human being who does not permit anything or anyone to discourage her. Gradually her unshakable character her unparalleled courage and the enormity of the injustice committed against her finally begin working in her favor.North Country at times does exhibit some rather lethargic moments but the cast and the quality of the story are so outstanding that is easy to overlook this minor flaw.

Woody Harrelson Natural Born Killers is convincing as the exfootball player town hero turned lawyer who takes on Josey's case. Sissy Spacek Carrie original version as the dutiful Mom and Richard Jenkins Six Feet Under as the skeptical dad.Almost everyone who works or has worked recently in the United States knows that the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace is something that is taken extremely seriously. This is thanks in large part to Josey Aimes and the struggle she was forced to wage against that Minnesota mining company over 30 years ago!

The manifest absurdity of the last 15 minutes of the movie undermined for me what was otherwise another excellent performance by Charlize Theron and the usual outstanding work of Frances McDormand.

She is a gifted actress who deserves better than being asked to stand by like a cigar store Indian while the plaintiff's attorney Woody Harrelson commits every procedural violation that could possibly be conceived. Don't blame Harrelson however. The onetime goofy bartender of Cheers actually does very well in the scenes outside the courtroom.

Putting the revolting issue of sexual harassment back in the public conscious can never be a bad thing so with that North Country achieved its aims. If it's as impacting as its cousins Norma Rae Silkwood and Erin Brockovich is debatable but it is potent and it is acted with aplomb from its principals. It's just regrettable that one can't quite shake off knowing it's all a bit too glossy for its own good. 710".

Putting the revolting issue of sexual harassment back in the public conscious can never be a bad thing so with that North Country achieved its aims. If it's as impacting as its cousins Norma Rae Silkwood and Erin Brockovich is debatable but it is potent and it is acted with aplomb from its principals. It's just regrettable that one can't quite shake off knowing it's all a bit too glossy for its own good. 710";

	schema:headline " Boy those miners are really MEAN!";
	schema:reviewBody "The feelgood feminism of Niki Caro's Whale Rider from a couple years back becomes a passionate tirade in her new film North Country based on the landmark sexual harassment case involving miners in the northern Minnesota iron mines. The class action suit was apparently brought in the late Eighties and finally wrapped up in 1998  which may explain why Caro and her screenwriter Michael Seitzman decided that it might be a good idea to simply fictionalize the whole affair. Can't make a movie about briefs being submitted to a court over a period of a decade I guess. Despite the fictionalization the movie serves as a timely crash course on how recent the legality of women's safety in the workplace actually is the characters in the film watch clips from the Clarence ThomasAnita Hill hearings. Sissy Spacek snaps the TV off in horror after Ms. Hill describes Thomas talking about his own penis. These hearings occurred I believe in 1991. So kids the federal laws on sexual harassment don't date back to the era of black  white TV back in the day was like 15 minutes ago. Advances in civilization are always more recent than we think. I can certainly remember the effect of the mining case on my own workplace even though I'd never heard of it by the midNineties we were marched off to sexual harassment sensitivity trainings and were barraged with xeroxes on the subject to be appended to our Policy Manual. What had seemed like simple common decency had apparently never before been buttressed by the law.Perhaps because these wounds are still raw Caro in depicting this material goes for the Hollywood Prestige Picture approach much like Jonathan Demme did in his approach to AIDS with Philadelphia back in '93. The signposts are huge and easy to read the heroes are virtuous sufferers the villains are pasteboard meanies the issues are never ambiguous. In other words North Country is simple entertainment and it succeeds quite well on that level. Even so I do think that Caro trowels on the villainy rather thickly. We expect to see macho jerks in an iron mine but the guys in this film are heathen savages looking and behaving like a San Berdoo motorcycle gang in the grips of a threeday boozeandmeth binge. They literally play in excrement smearing obscenities on the women's bathroom wall with it and in what is probably the first depiction of semen in a mainstream Hollywood film spray themselves in the women's lockers. Meanwhile the grabass games adolescent pottymouth insults and violent threats are unrelenting from punchin to punchout. They don't even let the girls take a pee break for goodness sake. During all this we don't really get a sense of Charlize Theron's daytoday work duties at the mine. Apparently it's just one terrifying pileon after another.Maybe this is just as well for Theron the actress who admittedly excels in extreme situations. A big bold actress dangerously beautiful she attacks the Powerful Moments with great confidence leaving all that subtlety stuff to the rest of the topnotch cast which includes the likes of Spacek as her mother Richard Jenkins as her father Frances McDormand as her union rep pal with a toneddown Fargo accent Sean Bean as McDormand's injured husband an atypically credible Woody Harrelson as the lawyer who takes on Theron's case and Linda Emond as the mine's attackdog defense lawyer. Also take note of Michelle Monaghan as Theron's coworker Sherry a Rising Star if I may prophesy. North Country is ultimately made watchable by these great actors even if their parts are diagrammatic in the extreme. The obvious case here is Jenkins as Theron's dad for most of the film he's forced to be an unfeeling heartless character who stews in shame about his daughter and doesn't support her when she's suffering at the mine conveniently he does an aboutface at the union meeting hall bringing down the house with a great speech that castigates the greasyhaired apes in attendance I don't have a friend in this room!. Jenkins' toneperfect line reading makes it easy for us to swallow what is otherwise a prime example of Hollywood malarkey of the first order. Say much the same for the rest of the cast's work in relationship to the movie as a whole. North Country is ultimately justified by the actors.4 stars out of 10. Nice Dylan tunes on the soundtrack incidentally  though a movie called North Country surely required the immortal Nashville Skyline version of Girl from the North Country in which Johnny Cash duets with Dylan. Such an inclusion would've lifted my rating up to 5.".

You understand what the character experiences and you are there with the character's struggles  not only mentally but the anguish she also finds in family parents and friends. You're pulled in watching experiencing hoping and for me quietly rooting for the lead character. This really connected me to the story  something very important especially for this type of movie.Also seeing this movie in 2005 decades after what 'really happened' heightened my appreciation of this film. It let me at once understand the significance of how a relatively short period of time surrounding a woman's life changed not only her life but how its effects have rippled throughout the US and other countries. But what really humanizes the story is how family and surrounding people react support and interact. This is key. Without this the story would be flat.

	schema:headline " Despite being a little preachy and over the top North Country is still an effective drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Charlize Theron is Josey Aimes a single mother of two children who moves back home to Minnesota after her boyfriend gets abusive and has to start working at the mine to earn a living. When she's put through all sorts of indignities from the mine's male workers she gets a lawyer Woody Harrelson to help her file a class action suit against the mining company for sexual harassment.After watching the trailer for North Country I thought the film was going to be a very bad feminist movie but it's a lot more than that. Sure the film may display most guys in the film as sexist pigs but it wasn't too overdone. Niki Caro captures all the relationships and all the situations so well. The relationship between Josey and her two kids was very well done and very moving. Her sacrifice for them was great and the film captured that so well. The relationship between Josey and her father was also pretty good and kind of hard to watch because he didn't help his daughter at first. The relationship between Josey and Bill Harrelson wasn't very good. They tried to push the romance at the beginning of the film but then completely dropped it. It seemed like a big waste of time and a lot of work for nothing. Caro did a fine job at capturing all the problems the women were having. Some were hard to watch because the situations were kind of disgusting but they were pretty realistic.The acting for the most part is pretty good and strong. The best being Charlize Theron. She gives a very heartwarming and effective performance. Frances McDormand also gives a good performance though she didn't really deserve an Oscar nomination. Her performance wasn't bad just kind of ordinary. Woody Harrelson gives an okay performance. He's not very convincing when he's in the courtroom but he's pretty good outside the courtroom. Sissy Spacek was in the film for about a total of 25 minutes. The trailer makes it seem like she's an important character but she was underused. Sean Bean gives an okay performance but he was a little weak during the serious scenes. Richard Jenkins plays Josey's father and he gives a strong performance as well. The only performances I didn't like were from some of the co workers at the mine. Most of them were pretty weak and most were pretty unconvincing.The film is of course not perfect. It's a little over the top and preachy. They didn't beat their message into the viewers head but sometimes they did shove it down our throats a little too much. The only bad thing Caro did were the court room scenes. I thought the film was pretty realistic except for all the times they were in the courtroom. It was so cheesy and over the top. It didn't kill the movie but a more mature approach to them would have been better. The ending was also a little weak. It was too cheesy and it felt rushed. The film is over two hours long but apparently not long enough because not everything wraps up nicely. In the end Norma Rae is better and so is Erin Brockovich but North Country is still a powerful drama that should appeal too most people. Rating 710".

The relationship between Josey and her father was also pretty good and kind of hard to watch because he didn't help his daughter at first. The relationship between Josey and Bill Harrelson wasn't very good. They tried to push the romance at the beginning of the film but then completely dropped it. It seemed like a big waste of time and a lot of work for nothing. Caro did a fine job at capturing all the problems the women were having. Some were hard to watch because the situations were kind of disgusting but they were pretty realistic.The acting for the most part is pretty good and strong. The best being Charlize Theron. She gives a very heartwarming and effective performance. Frances McDormand also gives a good performance though she didn't really deserve an Oscar nomination. Her performance wasn't bad just kind of ordinary. Woody Harrelson gives an okay performance. He's not very convincing when he's in the courtroom but he's pretty good outside the courtroom. Sissy Spacek was in the film for about a total of 25 minutes. The trailer makes it seem like she's an important character but she was underused. Sean Bean gives an okay performance but he was a little weak during the serious scenes. Richard Jenkins plays Josey's father and he gives a strong performance as well. The only performances I didn't like were from some of the co workers at the mine. Most of them were pretty weak and most were pretty unconvincing.The film is of course not perfect. It's a little over the top and preachy. They didn't beat their message into the viewers head but sometimes they did shove it down our throats a little too much. The only bad thing Caro did were the court room scenes. I thought the film was pretty realistic except for all the times they were in the courtroom. It was so cheesy and over the top. It didn't kill the movie but a more mature approach to them would have been better. The ending was also a little weak. It was too cheesy and it felt rushed. The film is over two hours long but apparently not long enough because not everything wraps up nicely. In the end Norma Rae is better and so is Erin Brockovich but North Country is still a powerful drama that should appeal too most people. Rating 710";

Her dad Hank works at the local mine and when Josie runs into an old and female schoolmate who encourages her to join the company Josie reluctantly does so.But she finds it's not easy  and that's not even including the work itself. The men resent her and try every kind of harassment they can think of. The women want her to sit down and take it so they don't have to suffer too. Her dad hates her because she's in a man's job plus he's a real misogynist jerk and her mom doesn't like her much either because Josie did after all leave her husband and you're supposed to stand by your man.See where the problem lies? The movie tries hard to paint each character with one brush only and then beats you over the head with that characterization for much of the movie. The script is so obvious it's tough not to see the big setup coming and sure enough it turns out that not all men ARE bad. Why some were merely confused and by gosh they're gonna do the right thing here in the final ten minutes of the movie! The movie is bookended by court scenes as various characters testify against or on behalf of the suit. Much of the movie deals with the sometimes literal crap that Josie and the other women had to go through although she's the only one with any kind of gumption to do do anything about it.Theron's pretty good although this isn't a gettin' ugly kind of role like that of Aileen Wuornos. Her Josie actually looks pretty throughout the movie for the most part. But Theron hit all of the right notes and might even have deserved her Oscar nomination. Frances McDormand plays her toughasnails friend who's a union rep at the plant. McDormand is a great actress and she turned in a good performance in a madeforOscar role. Woody Harrelson yes can you imagine is solid as Josie's lawyer a former hockey player.North Country is manipulative treacle but even the toughest miner would melt a little during the final scenes but it's an outcome that's telegraphed from the getgo. The fun should be in getting there but when the characters are given laughable overwrought dialog to mouth it's as much fun as.. well maybe working in an actual mine.".

Almost immediately we learn that this is a woman who has been judged criticized and ostracized and called a whore ever since she became pregnant in high school. Josey takes a job at the local mine because it's the best paying job she can find and she's determined to give her kids a comfortable life. She and her female coworkers are reminded every day how unwanted and unwelcome they are at the mine. They are physically verbally mentally and sexually abused on a daily basis. After being physically attacked and threatened Josey quits and starts to fight back by suing the company for sexual harassment.I was finally pushed over the tears threshold when Josey's dad stands up at the miners' union meeting and defends his daughter for the first time in her life. After that I was sobbing on and off for the entire duration of the film. While the entire cast is perfect I believe the Best Supporting Actress Nomination must go to Frances McDormand who injects some muchneeded comic relief into this bleakbutbrave story.

Only now do we see men who are morally conflicted over what happened to this woman. All they needed was a scolding to bring it out. In this film this is a surprise. Up until this point we have been shown little evidence of sympathy. Dramatically it is dishonest to portray 100 of the men as cretins.

	schema:reviewBody "Niki Caro's North Country dazzles us with its unfaltering rightmindedness even as it's hammering us silly with ploys so shameless even Frank Capra would be embarrassed to have anything to do with them. You might call this the Schindler's List approach  taking a position that no rational halfwayeducated person would dare oppose then slipping in under this ironclad cover to deliver the most unblushing exercise in emotional manipulation imaginable. Who would dare contend that the poor downtrodden heroine of North Country Josey Aimes isn't a courageous soul for standing up to all the icky ironoreminers who so vilely harass her and her female coworkers? There's always a core of indisputability to movies like North Country but around this concrete nucleus lie so many layers of bull that it no longer matters if the central premise is unassailable. Why is it necessary to resort to shameless movie tricks in the name of a truth ninetypercent of the audience would already regard as selfevident? Is it some instinct for emotional chicanery some need to push the story beyond the factual and into some fantasyland of supernobility? Or is it simply that people like Niki Caro and Spielberg and Capra before them don't trust their audience's ability to absorb the facts themselves and feel they must garland them with simpleminded absolutism didacticism and deglamorization as a way of guaranteeing their message gets across? The reallife drama concerns Josey Aimes Charlize Theron a married motheroftwo who leaves her abusive husband for the snowswept hinterlands of Northern Minnesota there to take up residence with her taciturn ironminer father Richard Jenkins and softspoken mother Sissy Spacek. Josey resolves herself not to fall into another bad relationship in the name of simple security she needs the kind of job that will let her support her two kids herself and the only job available is as a menial laborer in the mines where the physical dangers inherent in extracting ironore come second to the ones posed by the primitiveminded brazenly sexist bodilyfunctionobsessed men who work there. Josey and the other girls are toughcookies who can handle a little razzing but what happens to them goes beyond chummy jocularity the male miners resent the women their intrusion upon the hallowed male workspace and take obscene pleasure in systematically intimidating them. Josey comes in for an inordinate share of abuse thanks to the presence of an old highschool flame Bobby Jeremy Renner whose attitude toward her remains proprietary and thanks to her own dodgy sexual history which gives the miners and their wives plenty of excuse to berate her. But Josey is not the kind to just turntail and run she goes to management which demonstrates no desire to shakeup the profitable statusquo by addressing the gripes of a single illtreated woman and when this doesn't work she turns to a downonhisluck lawyer Bill Woody Harrelson who agrees to bring her case to court as a classaction suit provided she can convince more of her harassed female coworkers to take up the cause.Movies like North Country are inherently patronizing  not just because they depict lowerclass people in a hollowly ennobling often stereotypical way but because they're made under the assumption that the gist will not get across to average people unless the factual story is dressedup with melodramatic plotmovements emotionally explicit acting and direct preaching. Niki Caro and her team are not interested in simple facts  rather than present the story straightforwardly evenhandedly they go out of their way in jacking the outrage to a fever pitch emphasizing the yawning gulf between the apelike behavior of the men and the saintly durability of Josey who derives more radiance and strength from each insult and provocation. The situation is seen almost entirely from Josey's pointofview the miners are a mass of hateful vaguely grotesque humanity a bunch of craggyfaced gargoyles in soiled coveralls the managers and owners similarly callous freakish monsters thinly glossed with duplicitousness. The photography emphasizes the hard ugly faces of the miners while bringing out Josey's own angelic glow the movie divides humanity into bad people who look like evolution has passed them by and good people who are all understatedly attractive. The heroine Josey is played by Charlize Theron less as a suffering human being than a symbol of feminine resolve in the face of patriarchal insensitivity. Theron was so impressive in Monster because she could affect pride and toughness while keeping her emotions close to the surface in North Country Theron's emotions crack the tough exterior spilling forth in sceneafterscene of bawling blubbering and snotblowing. The emotions are pushed so forcefully by Theron and Caro that they become unseemly we start out being ashamed of the behavior of the miners but wind up more embarrassed for Theron who is alternately a deglamorized quasiiconic figure she becomes almost Eisensteinian in her headbandanna and coveralls and a spewing tearfactory. Wouldn't we feel sympathy toward Josey even if Theron didn't turn every scene into a display of her ability to prole herself out act the toughie or crumble into a mass of quivering Oscarworthy jelly? Wouldn't we applaud the triumph of the just over the greedy and heartless even if the courtroom scenes didn't degenerate into wild contrivance? The movie sells itself too hard it's not content to rest on being right but must stagger us with its rightness resorting to such base trickery that it undermines its own position becoming nearly as crudeminded as smugly selfassured as the people it's against.".

Who would dare contend that the poor downtrodden heroine of North Country Josey Aimes isn't a courageous soul for standing up to all the icky ironoreminers who so vilely harass her and her female coworkers? There's always a core of indisputability to movies like North Country but around this concrete nucleus lie so many layers of bull that it no longer matters if the central premise is unassailable. Why is it necessary to resort to shameless movie tricks in the name of a truth ninetypercent of the audience would already regard as selfevident? Is it some instinct for emotional chicanery some need to push the story beyond the factual and into some fantasyland of supernobility? Or is it simply that people like Niki Caro and Spielberg and Capra before them don't trust their audience's ability to absorb the facts themselves and feel they must garland them with simpleminded absolutism didacticism and deglamorization as a way of guaranteeing their message gets across? The reallife drama concerns Josey Aimes Charlize Theron a married motheroftwo who leaves her abusive husband for the snowswept hinterlands of Northern Minnesota there to take up residence with her taciturn ironminer father Richard Jenkins and softspoken mother Sissy Spacek. Josey resolves herself not to fall into another bad relationship in the name of simple security she needs the kind of job that will let her support her two kids herself and the only job available is as a menial laborer in the mines where the physical dangers inherent in extracting ironore come second to the ones posed by the primitiveminded brazenly sexist bodilyfunctionobsessed men who work there. Josey and the other girls are toughcookies who can handle a little razzing but what happens to them goes beyond chummy jocularity the male miners resent the women their intrusion upon the hallowed male workspace and take obscene pleasure in systematically intimidating them. Josey comes in for an inordinate share of abuse thanks to the presence of an old highschool flame Bobby Jeremy Renner whose attitude toward her remains proprietary and thanks to her own dodgy sexual history which gives the miners and their wives plenty of excuse to berate her. But Josey is not the kind to just turntail and run she goes to management which demonstrates no desire to shakeup the profitable statusquo by addressing the gripes of a single illtreated woman and when this doesn't work she turns to a downonhisluck lawyer Bill Woody Harrelson who agrees to bring her case to court as a classaction suit provided she can convince more of her harassed female coworkers to take up the cause.Movies like North Country are inherently patronizing  not just because they depict lowerclass people in a hollowly ennobling often stereotypical way but because they're made under the assumption that the gist will not get across to average people unless the factual story is dressedup with melodramatic plotmovements emotionally explicit acting and direct preaching. Niki Caro and her team are not interested in simple facts  rather than present the story straightforwardly evenhandedly they go out of their way in jacking the outrage to a fever pitch emphasizing the yawning gulf between the apelike behavior of the men and the saintly durability of Josey who derives more radiance and strength from each insult and provocation. The situation is seen almost entirely from Josey's pointofview the miners are a mass of hateful vaguely grotesque humanity a bunch of craggyfaced gargoyles in soiled coveralls the managers and owners similarly callous freakish monsters thinly glossed with duplicitousness. The photography emphasizes the hard ugly faces of the miners while bringing out Josey's own angelic glow the movie divides humanity into bad people who look like evolution has passed them by and good people who are all understatedly attractive. The heroine Josey is played by Charlize Theron less as a suffering human being than a symbol of feminine resolve in the face of patriarchal insensitivity. Theron was so impressive in Monster because she could affect pride and toughness while keeping her emotions close to the surface in North Country Theron's emotions crack the tough exterior spilling forth in sceneafterscene of bawling blubbering and snotblowing. The emotions are pushed so forcefully by Theron and Caro that they become unseemly we start out being ashamed of the behavior of the miners but wind up more embarrassed for Theron who is alternately a deglamorized quasiiconic figure she becomes almost Eisensteinian in her headbandanna and coveralls and a spewing tearfactory. Wouldn't we feel sympathy toward Josey even if Theron didn't turn every scene into a display of her ability to prole herself out act the toughie or crumble into a mass of quivering Oscarworthy jelly? Wouldn't we applaud the triumph of the just over the greedy and heartless even if the courtroom scenes didn't degenerate into wild contrivance? The movie sells itself too hard it's not content to rest on being right but must stagger us with its rightness resorting to such base trickery that it undermines its own position becoming nearly as crudeminded as smugly selfassured as the people it's against.";

	schema:headline " Great performances allround and directing make this well worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite not having seen Gone Baby Gone I've heard a lot of good things about Ben Affleck's switch to directing and so I decided to watch The Town which put simply is about band robbers but to expand on that the film is also about the leader of the group played by Ben Affleck. When watching the trailer it easy to draw comparisons to Heat and The Departed but this is different. Many films about crime make the audience side either the police or the criminals yet The Town allows the audience to see people from both sides of the law fairly. Jon Hamm plays an honest working FBI officer while Ben Affleck plays the criminal. The film is shot predominately from the criminals perspective therefore the audience feel the same sense of urgency that they do but we don't want to see them gun down the FBI and police and let them get away with their crimes. It is a difficult challenge for the director to deal with but he does it well and the end result is very good.The entire cast are all fantastic even when given smaller roles for example Chris Cooper and the late Pete Postlethwaite steel the scenes that they are in. Jeremy Renner has earned a lot of attention from his role and he deserves it giving an honest performance which clearly took a lot of research to perfect. An almost unrecognisable Blake Lively and Rebecca Hall are both great. Ben Affleck and Jon Hamm as the opposing forces are also great but it is Renner's performance that stands out.As a crime film it is important that the action doesn't turn the whole film into an all guns blazing film. The action scenes are handed pretty well and the car chases through the minor roads of Boston are really exciting to watch.The Town is not only only a solid action crime film but also marks Affleck as a great director. I strongly recommend this film if you are interested in the genre. While it is not perfect it does so much well that you would be missing out if you didn't see this.".

	schema:reviewBody "To say that The Town is everything Takers tried to be and failed at would actually be an insult to Ben Affleck's latest film. Mentioning that bland rehashing in the same breath would imply they even exist on the same plane but the honest truth is this gritty Boston crime drama is something special and the best film of the early fall season.Affleck's first foray into directing with the Dennis Lehane adaptation Gone Baby Gone shocked viewers and the critical community in kind showing that a fading acting career does not mean one is downandout in Hollywood. Affleck marries his two passions in The Town directing producing and writing the film as well as starring in the lead role his first since 2003's Paycheck. He owns this comeback performance successfully wiping any lingering distaste from duds like Daredevil or Gigli. This is by no means a oneman show but The Town has nothing close to a weak link in fact this may be one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting in years.Joining Affleck in a supporting role is Jeremy Renner fresh off his best actor Oscar nomination for The Hurt Locker and he beyond a doubt proves he is no onehit wonder. This is Oscarworthy acting yet again for Renner nailing his Boston accent along with his loosecannon mentality. He is terrifying but impossible to pry your eyes away from. The most shocking revelation comes from Blake Lively TV's Gossip Girl as a dopedup mother with more than a few issues. She is not only unrecognizable but owns her role never calling attention to her drastic deviation from type. Substantial buzz was also placed in the way of John Hamm from the acclaimed television drama Mad Men. He is sufficiently pompous as a dedicated FBI agent also scoring a number of the films laughs.Before I wander too much further into specifics the characters in The Town populate a Boston suburb called Charlestown which an introductory message informs us is the worldcenter for bank robbers. Affleck's Doug MacRay heads a team of those in such a profession including Renner as James Coughlin and two others played by Slaine and Owen Burke. During one of their routine bank heists they are forced to take a hostage Rebecca Hall during their hasty escape. Afterwards to make sure she does not know anything incriminating following her release from captivity MacRay follows her and inadvertently falls for her in the process.There is nothing particularly revelatory about The Town there are few surprises or much that deviates from a standard crime drama. But Affleck directs with such skill and confidence while showcasing yet another peek into suburban Boston that it is never less than riveting. There is an overlying sense of impeding dread that perforates The Town and a handful of sensational action sequences do little to let up the firm grasp the film has on our windpipes. Propelled by faultless acting and a pitch perfect script this slice of the Boston criminal underworld is everything for which we could have hoped following such a bland summer. Affleck has always been a star and if he continues to produce films of this pedigree then there might be hope for the movies yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ben Affleck's second feature film as a director  if nothing else  proves he's no fluke. In all the ways his sincere and revealing debut Gone Baby Gone succeeds so does The Town. Both are Bostonbased crime dramas that are both touchingly dramatic at times yet gripping at others. More impressive with his work on The Town however is that it proves he could just as easily go on to direct an action blockbuster as he could an Oscarwinning drama.It starts with the cast and the performances he gets from them. In 2007 he helped Amy Ryan to a supporting actress nomination and that's ignoring the other talents in the film such as Casey Affleck Michelle Monaghan and Ed Harris. In The Town he gets Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner in his first major film since his breakout in The Hurt Locker and Jon Hamm in his first major film since TV's Mad Men took off. He also gets a pair of upandcomers in Rebecca Hall and Gossip Girl star Blake Lively. And that's not to mention Pete Postelthwaite and Chris Cooper. Next to Inception it's the best ensemble cast of the year.Based on the Chuck Hogan novel Prince of Thieves the film follows a team of bank robbers from Charlestown an area notorious for grooming the best at intercepting armored cars and taking down banks. As with Gone Baby Gone also based on a novel by Dennis Lehane the city of Boston and the people and culture are as important to Affleck as the plot. He's sure to let shots of the Charlestown bridge and Fenway Park soak in amidst the everbuilding pinch the main characters are in.Doug MacRay Affleck and his buddy Jim Renner and a couple others pull off a bank job in the opening scene but when it doesn't go exactly as planned they're forced to kidnap the bank manager Hall. To make sure she didn't see anything and can hand them on a platter to the feds led by Jon Hamm's Special Agent Frawley Doug trails her only to find himself falling for her.The Town is one of those crime dramasbankjob action films that while not revelatory for the genre executes everything well and sticks to a characterdriven story in order to stay meaningful. Perhaps the reason it works so well is because it floats in between the drama never becoming too much of a guns 'n robbers flick but also not slipping into crime melodrama for too long. Affleck's performance as MacRay acts in accordance it's tastefully understated and he lets go of the machismo that has marred a few of his previous roles.The film also has an unexpected but much appreciated sense of humor. In a mileaminute crime dramathriller you don't expect to laugh the way you will in The Town which speaks even more to the writing and Affleck's versatility. Even if there are some plot conventions and nosurprise characters as good as Hamm is he's playing every other quickwitted FBI guy in films the dialogue is sharp the story is exciting and the way we are so easily able to see things from MacRay's perspective as the bank robber who wants out makes up for any use of convention as a crutch.There's no doubt that if The Town becomes a success that studios will seek out Affleck for some more highprofile projects and it will certainly be interesting to see how he handles material not rooted in Boston subculture. As long as he continues to get such memorable performances out of his actors he'll be doing things on the other end of the camera for a long time to come.Steven CVisit my site httpmoviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "My Oh My how Ben Affleck has had a up and down career. Starting out as the cheesy yet funny guy in those Kevin Smith flicks to the academy award winning writer of Good Will Hunting all the way back down to the pathetic string of acting he produced only 10 years ago. But there is a silver lining....with his directorial debut in Gone Baby Gone and his much improved acting in Hollywoodland. Ben Affleck is beginning to once again prove his worth in Tinsel Town. Hopefully he can continue to feverish pace.Well i can say with complete just that this is the best Heist movie since Swordfish......Now i know most of you may not like Swordfish but what other bank robbery movie can you compare it to in the past 10 years? Maybe Snatch? Lock Stock?....eh if you classify those movies as Heist pictures than okay it's the best heist movie since Snatch or maybe even Oceans 11....either way it's a big compliment.Ben Affleck has certainly proved that Gone Baby Gone was not a fluke. He can actually direct a major motion picture. And not only can he do it he does it very well. Sure the movie had some minor flaws but nothing that takes too much away from the overall big picture. The best way i can compare it is.....it's like an east coast Heat. Now the group is not as fool proof or professional as the gang in Heat......well let's face it you will probably never top that group in movie.....ever. But never the less the style of film making really pulls you into each sequence whether it be the action packed bank robbery the emotional dialog between characters or the intense decisions the players all must endure.The movie doesn't try to WOW! you by offering a different style of bank robbery. Which is a good thing because you really run the risk of tripping over your own two feet in the process. But i really think the major factor in this film was the acting. Everyone came to play ball in this one........but i can also say this with complete confidence.......Ben Affleck was the best actor in this movie. Yes i know it's hard to swallow for some of you but he really showed us all what he is truly capable of doing. So Mr. Affleck let me tip my hat to you and say job well done sir. You took a lot of crap to the face and you wiped it off and came back strong.Bottom Line......Yes i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies of the year so far. Sure the movie gets a little sappy at the end but it's pretty necessary. But overall your very well entertained.I read an article a few months ago about even after Gone Baby Gone people still wouldn't hire Affleck as a director. And he had to fight tooth and nail to land this deal. Well hopefully now you can find more work buddy because you have certainly earned it.".

But there is a silver lining....with his directorial debut in Gone Baby Gone and his much improved acting in Hollywoodland. Ben Affleck is beginning to once again prove his worth in Tinsel Town. Hopefully he can continue to feverish pace.Well i can say with complete just that this is the best Heist movie since Swordfish......Now i know most of you may not like Swordfish but what other bank robbery movie can you compare it to in the past 10 years? Maybe Snatch? Lock Stock?....eh if you classify those movies as Heist pictures than okay it's the best heist movie since Snatch or maybe even Oceans 11....either way it's a big compliment.Ben Affleck has certainly proved that Gone Baby Gone was not a fluke. He can actually direct a major motion picture. And not only can he do it he does it very well. Sure the movie had some minor flaws but nothing that takes too much away from the overall big picture. The best way i can compare it is.....it's like an east coast Heat. Now the group is not as fool proof or professional as the gang in Heat......well let's face it you will probably never top that group in movie.....ever. But never the less the style of film making really pulls you into each sequence whether it be the action packed bank robbery the emotional dialog between characters or the intense decisions the players all must endure.The movie doesn't try to WOW! you by offering a different style of bank robbery. Which is a good thing because you really run the risk of tripping over your own two feet in the process. But i really think the major factor in this film was the acting. Everyone came to play ball in this one........but i can also say this with complete confidence.......Ben Affleck was the best actor in this movie. Yes i know it's hard to swallow for some of you but he really showed us all what he is truly capable of doing. So Mr. Affleck let me tip my hat to you and say job well done sir. You took a lot of crap to the face and you wiped it off and came back strong.Bottom Line......Yes i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies of the year so far. Sure the movie gets a little sappy at the end but it's pretty necessary. But overall your very well entertained.I read an article a few months ago about even after Gone Baby Gone people still wouldn't hire Affleck as a director. And he had to fight tooth and nail to land this deal. Well hopefully now you can find more work buddy because you have certainly earned it.";

	schema:reviewBody "A bank robbery goes a little different than planned when one of the robbers takes a hostage. Doug Affleck has to duty to check up on the hostage after she is let go to see if she knows anything about the crew. Surprise they start dating. Can he continue his life of robbing banks and have a love life? Will his crew accept that he is with her? Will she ever find out? This is The Town. Gone Baby Gone was his first directorial effort set in the city of Boston The Town is his second. Ben obviously loves the city and if he keeps making films like these two I'll be happy with some more Boston. I'm not going to preach about which film is better their both different. Gone Baby Gone has more of an emotional punch with it's climax and tough decisions. The Town doesn't reach those heights but it's a well made tense action thriller with a bit of a romance thrown in. This time Affleck is in front of the camera as well. He seems to have left his pretty boy blockbuster image behind him. I'm thankful I can only take so many Armageddons or Pearl Harbors. He's matured as an actor this is evident by his roles as of late. State of Play and Hollywoodland are two examples. Of course he's had some fun films in between but he's probably the best thing about those. Extract anyone? For The Town he has assembled quite the cast. Jeremy Renner who is hot off of The Hurt Locker plays his buddy with an attitude who won't think twice about pulling the trigger if you're in his way. Mad Men's Jon Hamm who is the FBI agent on their trail his partner is Man in Black actor Titus Welliver who was also in Gone Baby Gone. I wouldn't mind seeing more of him in films and if he's Affleck's good luck charm all the better. Blake Lively has a small role and she does skanky a little too well. She has a thing for Affleck's character and she has a daughter but he's obviously fallen for someone else. Rebecca Hall who has the hard role of playing the woman who is dating her abductor. Things don't look too well for this relationship.The Town shows Affleck's ability at directing action sequences. Gone Baby Gone wasn't full of gunfights and car chases but The Town is. There are three separate heists in the film the opening the middle section and the climactic ending. All three are different from each other one is in a bank the other a truck and finally a baseball stadium. Each heist was exciting to watch and gave you those Heat moments. It's obviously the Heat was influential in the making of this film. It seems all movies that have robberies in them look to Heat. Ben Affleck had a hand in writing the film he of course won an Oscar with Matt Damon for writing Good Will Hunting. It appears he's found his footing once again and hopefully the allure of the blockbuster won't claim him once more. The Town is a successful film made for adults. It's slick well acted and has enough thrilling moments to keep those who seek it entertained. The film centres mostly on Affleck and his new love and the heist bits are second fodder. Renner is the only one who gets some spotlight from the crew the other two are simply background faces. The Town does it's job as a movie and Ben Affleck has found himself a new career.".

Ben Affleck was truly incredible as Doug McCray and I've never seen him work his acting at such a high level. As far as the plot of the film goes it's very engaging. The trailer doesn't give this film justice as it's very intense and romantic at times.Jeremy Renner is quite intimidating and Blake Lively is sexy Ben Affleck is gripping and the supporting cast is incredibly powerful. I think the movie was powerful and not at all predictable. I couldn't wait to see what would happen and if Doug would get away. It's such a greatly crafted movie. From writing to acting this film is wickedly astounding.I thought that the sex scene was over too quickly but it was made up with all the action. I thoroughly enjoyed the chase scenes. I thought the action sequences were welldrawn out. I loved the bank robbery scenes of the blue masks and the nun outfits. I especially liked Ben's scenes with the sledge hammer and the scene where he says if I think anything might happen to her I'm gonna kill both of you. It's a clip from the trailer but it's so much better when it happens in the film.It's driven as an action film with drama and romance on the side. There's a few chuckles along the way but pretty much sparse. I thought the romance was done just enough and I felt the drama was perfectly done and drastically added to the plot as well as the tone of the film.It's certainly the best heist movie I've ever seen. In comparison if you called Inception a heist movie this movie is a better heist movie. I really think this is the Heat of the decade. I truly believe that Affleck is in his peek of his career and this is his greatest performance directing writing and acting. I'm overjoyed and excited to see his next piece of work.".

Starring himself Jeremy Renner The Hurt Locker 2009 and Rebecca Hall Vicky Cristina Barcelona 2008 this crimeheist thriller is set in Charlestown Boston where every other day there seems to be an armed robbery happening. Produced by Graham King who won the Best Picture Oscar for Scorsese's The Departed 2006 which is also set in Boston The Town is a generic crimethriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.The film follows Affleck's character Doug  as he faces a turning point in his life. He leads a gang of masked armed robbers but wants to quit a life of crime and change for good. His dream of a better future is spurred on by a coincidental romance with Claire Hall who was an unharmed victim and a key witness of one of his heist schemes. To complicate things Claire does not know that Doug was involved in that heist. Worse his partnerincrime James Renner a volatile Joe Pescilike madman discovers their relationship and threatens to kill her.There is a scene with these three characters together sitting around a table at an outdoor caf. This is perhaps the only moment in the film that causes a significant degree of uneasiness and tension in the viewer. Sad to say much of the entire film does not live up to its thriller tag. As a crimethriller it is a borderline passable entry. That is not good enough for Affleck whose debut directing effort Gone Baby Gone has shown that he is capable of making a noteworthy thriller.The Town has reasonably wellexecuted action sequences but they amount to nothing if the story is onedimensional and the characters underdeveloped. The romance between Doug and Claire which I feel to be the film's central narrative thread is clearly lacking in development thus when the film closes with their separation and ends with the line see you again this side or the other it feels unconvincing.The Town's standout performance is credited to Renner. He steals the screen every time he appears but his characterization is limited to the stereotypical caricature of a badass gangster. Nevertheless Renner's performance helps to engage the viewer whenever the story fails to do so. As for Affleck's performance there is no surprise in store for us. He is weak in acting and should stick to directing instead. But hey I am starting to have doubts about his directing too.SCORE 610 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!".

I did not think she had the skill to pull off such a character and she delivered in all of her scenes. Pete Postlewaite has some amazing dialogue and is frighteningly amazing in his role.

Again nothing wildly original here but enough action and suspense to keep the public interested.That is if you did not see Heat and do not mind the ripoff scenes and general feeling of the plot.Unfortunately part III turns a likely story into the realm of science fiction.

Ben Affleck is not Michael Mann and he could not pull off a decent ending for his movie. While Heat manages to retain a certain atmosphere The Town crumbles miserably at the end. Besides not being in the Michael Mann league of directors Affleck is not even such a great actor remaining expressionless and dull in all his scenes.

	schema:headline " Entertaining heist flick that wears out its welcome at the denouement";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Town' refers to 'Charlestown' once a predominantly IrishCatholic section of Boston known for criminal activity. Crime apparently reached its apotheosis around 1995 in Charlestown when a series of bank robberies were committed. In more recent times however the area has become gentrified and probably most of its residents now would express surprise that Charlestown is currently associated with the serious type of crimes depicted in this film. Nonetheless the filmmakers advise their audience in the trailer that there are over 300 bank robberies in Boston every year and most of these professionals live in a 1squaremile neighborhood called Charlestown. According to Wikipedia however there were 23 reported bank robberies in the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the first quarter of 2010. So much for verisimilitude!'The Town' works best when depicting the dark underside of the criminal underclass in Charlestown albeit a depiction that is decidedly anachronistic as discussed above. My favorite character is 'Fergie' played by the late character actor Pete Postlethwaite. He's a local crime boss who runs a floral shop as a front for his criminal activities. In perhaps the best scene in the film Fergie confronts Ben Afleck's 'Doug MacRay' insisting that MacRay participate in the next bank robbery he's got planned despite the fact that MacRay now wants out. MacRay is practically left speechless when Fergie reveals that years ago he got MacRay's mother hooked on drugs in retaliation for his father wanting to leave Fergie's gang. The kicker is that the mother committed suicide. Fergie ups the stakes like all good criminals when he threatens to kill MacRay's girlfriend Claire the sweet bank manager turned hostage. Postlethwaite is perfect as the scraggyfaced longtime tough guy who'll stop at nothing to protect his turf.There are a few other good things about 'The Town' including the excellent performance of Jeremy Renner as 'Jem' Doug's boyhood friend who's now Doug's right hand man. Renner is utterly believable as the hotheaded psycho who always wants to take things a step further than Doug his levelheaded comrade in crime. There are also a collection of local Boston characters in the form of armored car guards police officers and Fenway Park workers who all show up adding to the foreboding atmosphere. Blake Lively also acquits herself well as the McRay's jealous exgirlfriend who can't accept the fact that she's the odd woman out. Should I also mention the first two bank robberies are neatly shot and edited and add to the overall fast pace of the film's narrative?Unfortunately a good deal of the rest of 'The Town' is typical Hollywood claptrap which disqualifies it from being in the same league as that old chestnut the gritty 1970 crime drama shot in the Boston area 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle'. At the outset it doesn't make a lot of sense that Jem decides to take Claire hostage as it soon becomes apparent that she lives in the neighborhood and could perhaps identify one or all of them as the perpetrators of the bank robbery.The hostage 'faux pas' is a necessary contrivance in order to allow Doug to hook up with Claire. Many have criticized Affleck's performance arguing that he seems out of place as a local boy from Charlestown. Maybe so but Affleck is really saddled by a script that calls for a character working at complete cross purposes. The screenwriters want us to believe that McCray is on one hand a bit of a psychopath who doesn't hesitate to join his pals in committing bank robberies where people are killed although McCray insists he never does any killing himself. But when his chivalrous heart is offended after girlfriend Claire informs him some local bully has been harassing her he has no qualms in breaking into the apartment of the bully in question and beating this guy along with psycho buddy Jem to a bloody pulp. As long as he's doing it for 'a good woman' McCray's violent outbursts are 'justified'.Rebecca Hall is equally saddled by the film's unconvincing script. In one of the worst scenes in the film when Jem intrudes on Doug and Claire's luncheon date no bells and whistles go off in Claire's mind after she meets him. It's quite obvious that Jem is not only from 'the other side of the tracks' but is also thoroughly unsavory and Claire ends up saying nothing to Doug afterward about him. You would think that that it might occur to good girl Claire that Doug's 'buddy' also puts her new boyfriend in a bad light too. The films' scenarists also lose points when they have Claire and the FBI agents standing at an open window where Doug can easily see that they're forcing her to entice him to her apartment. Hey how about standing inside the living room away from the window where Doug can't draw any definitive conclusions as to whether the FBI is at the apartment or not.'The Town' wears out its welcome completely in the final third bank robbery scene. While the first bank robbery was quick and for the most part fairly believable and the second one featured some comic relief with the gang dressed in Nun masks the third heist appears to be simply derivative. Doug and Jem simply dress up as cops and rob the payroll room at Fenway Park. There is the obligatory shootout with Jem doing his 'suicidebycop' routine. Meanwhile Special Agent Frawley stares mindlessly as Doug makes his getaway in a cop car right in front of his eyes. In a nod to the 'Shawshank Redemption' all's well that ends well when Claire digs up the stolen cash in her garden and donates it for the renovation of a local kids' hockey rink.There you have it. 'The Town' manages to entertain in some respects but ultimately must resort to the tired trappings of the heist genre. It's a mixed bag that should at best engender mixed reviews!".

And all that time spreading the gas and moving bags of money no police officers shooting at them no other cops show up from the other streets no helicopters..... Right. And what a great gesture that right after he tries to find out the truth about his mom with his dad the flower guy starts giving him all that gratuitous information and tells him the whole story.

And not only that but he is such a very good person that he leaves all that money to that chick that he just met what a month ago?? Right. Just like in real life. And how did the police know it was them in first place if they left nothing behind from the beginning?? Ahhhh. So much absurdity. What's up with Ben showing us his abs while doing pull ups?? Everyone is doing so in all movies now... Wow how cool eh? Even George Clooney has that scene himself. I think it's an OK movie to entertain yourself for a bit with some decent action but nothing memorable or great about it. I feel sorry for all those who think it's the best movie of the year. Hahaha.

	schema:headline " Wait didn't I already see this?";
	schema:reviewBody "Typically movies do not make enough of an impact on me that I feel I need to comment. The Town however is certainly one of those movies. How a movie like this can be made without a ton of money being exchanged between the writers of the original work and the plagiarists who reconstituted a couple of old script's is beyond me? This movie simply combined the plots of two previous made Hollywood movies entitled Heat and Point Break packaged it in a different city Boston instead of Los Angeles and added the dreadful acting and directing of Ben Affleck. I just wish I could get my money back for having paid for this awful movie. After all I've already see Heat and Point Break dozens of times and like them both. I'm not going to rehash the storyline but I do want to point out a few things that particularly annoyed me about this movie. The first is the part is the rip from Shawshank Redemption where she dug up the bag of money. This scene worked so magnificently in Shawshank because you desperately wanted the characters to end up in Zihuatanejo as free men. When the female character in The Town dug up the bag I was hoping she would give it to the authorities so they could expedite the process of tracking down the thug murderer who buried it there and throw him in the electric chair. In other words I didn't find any of characters sympathetic compelling or likable. Second are we really supposed to believe a successful single very good looking woman would fall for an uneducated ruthless killer thug from Southie? Really? Finally in this day and age of CSI and BONES are we supposed to believe Affleck's character is just going to lay low in Florida for the rest of his life? That final scene was almost as ridiculous as the part where he was working out. What was that? Was that some sort of dare between he and his Hollywood buddies to have a comparatively and equally lame scene like the one in Top Gun when they are playing volleyball? If you have not seen this movie yet save yourself the time and money.".

How a movie like this can be made without a ton of money being exchanged between the writers of the original work and the plagiarists who reconstituted a couple of old script's is beyond me? This movie simply combined the plots of two previous made Hollywood movies entitled Heat and Point Break packaged it in a different city Boston instead of Los Angeles and added the dreadful acting and directing of Ben Affleck. I just wish I could get my money back for having paid for this awful movie. After all I've already see Heat and Point Break dozens of times and like them both. I'm not going to rehash the storyline but I do want to point out a few things that particularly annoyed me about this movie. The first is the part is the rip from Shawshank Redemption where she dug up the bag of money. This scene worked so magnificently in Shawshank because you desperately wanted the characters to end up in Zihuatanejo as free men. When the female character in The Town dug up the bag I was hoping she would give it to the authorities so they could expedite the process of tracking down the thug murderer who buried it there and throw him in the electric chair. In other words I didn't find any of characters sympathetic compelling or likable. Second are we really supposed to believe a successful single very good looking woman would fall for an uneducated ruthless killer thug from Southie? Really? Finally in this day and age of CSI and BONES are we supposed to believe Affleck's character is just going to lay low in Florida for the rest of his life? That final scene was almost as ridiculous as the part where he was working out. What was that? Was that some sort of dare between he and his Hollywood buddies to have a comparatively and equally lame scene like the one in Top Gun when they are playing volleyball? If you have not seen this movie yet save yourself the time and money.";

	schema:headline " The Town proves that Ben Affleck is not only a gifted actor but also has a great eye for directing.";
	schema:reviewBody "In The Town Ben Affleck plays Doug the brains behind an Irish mob that robs banks and plans heists all around the Boston area. After their last huge bank job Doug learns from his colleague James James Coughlin that the female bank manager Claire Rebecca Hall from the bank lives a few blocks away from where the mob meets. This is when Doug decides to investigate Claire and see what she knows about him and the other members of his crew. Along the way Doug falls in love with Claire as the FBI is slowly investigating him and his fellow mob members to see where they are going to strike next. It's only a matter of time before the FBI comes after Doug and it's now up to Doug to decide whether it's the mob life or love....I have to admit when I first saw the trailers for The Town I wasn't really that impressed with it. Sure it looked like a solid action movie about bankrobbers but the trailers just seemed to give away too much. When The Town was actually released in theaters I didn't have a chance to see it because it was released during a time where for some reason which I am not sure of I didn't see any films. I did however read the reviews for the film and they were nothing but extreme positives. I tried to see the film in theaters but like most things nowadays it didn't last more than a few weeks at the local theaters. I decided to buy the flick on Blu Ray and finally sat down last night to watch it...There is so much good to say about The Town but it's hard to pick where to start. The easiest place to start is with Ben Affleck so I am going to start there. As many may know already Affleck directed cowrote and starred in this film. Unlike most people I never really disliked Affleck even though earlier in his career he had a few stinkers Gigli Daredevil and Jersey Girl all come to mind but I figured he just hasn't found the right fit yet. In The Town Ben Affleck shows off just how solid of an actor he can be with the right material. He plays the tough Irish mob leader to perfection. I am talking everything from the accent to the mannerisms Affleck just nails it. Along with the acting his eye as a director is also rather solid. This is Affleck's second directorial endeavor and its surprisingly better than his first which is saying a lot. Gone Baby Gone was well reviewed by critics and audience members alike and many were shocked to learn that Affleck directed that flick. The Town is rated even higher by both categories of people. Affleck knows his way behind the scenes capturing raw emotion realistic and gritty violence and truly showing his audience he knows how to make his cast act out their roles to near perfection. Affleck's dark and corrupt vision of Boston reminded me of something Martin Scorsese would have created. If Affleck keeps this up you never know but he might just become the next Scorsese.Besides Affleck providing a solid performance there are several other names that deserve some recognition here. Rebecca Hall is absolutely terrific as the bank manager and Doug's love interest. It's was interesting to see a smaller name in such a big role but it worked to the films advantage. She seemed perfect to play an out of town girl who gets involved with someone has sleazy and shady as Doug. Jon Hamm did a perfect job as the lead FBI agent. I haven't seen him in many other projects but his mannerisms fit my ideal image of a FBI agent. Jeremy Renner who played James was just nuts! He played this whacked out character perfectly. The guy seemed to not care about anything and anyone but did it in such a believable fashion. He truly was a demented and troubled soul in the film and really acted his heart out to show that. The one person I do have to say didn't really wow me was Blake Lively. I will admit it was nice seeing her play a really dark and gritty role which is out of her normal character but she wasn't convincing to me. I just had a hard time believing her as a trashy person. As a whore I can see but the white trash thing didn't work for me. I am sure many would disagree but trashy I couldn't picture. All in all I really don't have anything bad to say about The Town. It was a solid film all around. The pacing was perfect the acting was solid and the direction was superb. This movie may soon be placed in the same category where such movies like Goodfellas Casino and Reservoir Dogs now sit. It will not shock me if this film holds up over the years and becomes known as a cult classic. The film may be too violent or gritty for some but for those who like raw and gritty dramas will probably be adding The Town to their favorites list. MovieManMenzel's final rating for The Town is a solid 8 out of 10. A ton of kudos points are in order for Affleck and the entire cast of this film.".

I'm not sure the razzies were warranted by his movie choices got decidedly weaker as his star was falling. Eventually he took some strong supporting roles to get back on track and now has grabbed the director reins with both hands.The Town is placed in and about my loved Boston. Ahh ahh Boston you're my home. By choosing Charlestown now a yuppier Chuckville as its base the North End for a car chase and the bowels of old 1912 Fenway for the climactic last job he is at home in his surrounding. Anyone who has walked thru the North End stopped for a slice and checked out the streets knows that's the last place you'd ever expect a high speed car chase. Ben's camera work and editing makes it a thrilling crash filled event. Pity the poor stunt drivers who has to careen around those corners! So lots of reviews tell the plot points. I'm just writing to voice my opinion on the entertainment value and that is very high. Though its over two hours it never drags. Ben gives each of his excellent cast a very strong scene or two. Chris Cooper gets 5 minutes of screen time and is excellent. Rebecca Hall the prettiest average looking person you'll see is terrific. Jeremy Renner is calm and explosive at the same time. Jon Hamm gets to look cool be cool and stay cool. He is a different FBI than we are used to. Smart but with a meaner edge. And for me last but not least Blake Lively. I hear she's a glamor girl on TV and red carpets but here she absorbs the role of broken damaged and desperate with a glob of mascara in each eye. One review I read said she's no Amy Ryan seeGone Baby Gone. Maybe not but that's pretty unfair and she is well up to the task here. So action antiheroes to root for and Fenway Park a diamond on the outside pretty scruffy underneath!! What's not to like? But I've got to nitpick one thing. Does everyone in the world have a 3 day beard??? FBI guys go to the office unshaven for days? Ben even has some uneven moments where he goes from 2 to 1 to 3 day beards in the same caper! Hey what can you do its not one big long shoot but it was a lot of stubble!".

Or actors such as Denzel Washington.That all said I'm not sure The Town was set out to grab any awards though I'm sure with 100 best picture nominations okay 10 but still it's sure to get a nod. That's not saying too much since 2010 basically sucked and I would be racking my brain to come up with 10 let alone 100.And yet The Town SHOULDN'T win anything. In fact the only nominations I would approve but not win mind you would be Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor for the always impressive Jeremy Renner. The rest of the cast or talent barely would pass an audition let alone get any consideration.The worst part of the movie was the overused and welldone tired plot including the infamous LIE subplot involving the laughable Ben Affleck and his honey Rebecca Hall. The story cowritten by the lesser Affleck Casey is just so much better isn't anything new and brought little to the table.OK so we have hohum and very little depth bank robbers who wear disguises andor forget to shave  shocking trickery!  who pull off their latest but must take and eventually release the manager Claire Hall and in their suspicion lead robber Doug Affleck follows her once the heat is over. Naturally and completely unsurprisingly he falls for her.I'll pause a momenthere's where I prove how bad Affleck was in both acting and cowriting he asks her a dozen or more questions on what she remembers or who's been talking to her. Maybe I'm being cynical but she's pretty dumb nave scared or just a plain idiot not to see why he's asking so many questions.Fine not everyone can put two'n'two together but you'll have to get ahead of that plot hole to move on to the others.The FBI knows whodunit but they need to prove it or get a witness tonail them! Sorry needed to put emphasis on that because the movie asks er begs you to have some urgency even though we know everyone's on the same page. Oh and when Doug's being interrogated let me say this He ain't Keyser Sze. Hell he ain't even the Joker. It would be more interesting to see the interrogation scene from Marathon Man and if only I could play the dentist hovering over Affleck asking Do you think you're safe?Let's move on to the other obvious and clichd plot of DougieBoy wanting to do his last robbery and start fresh inin Florida? Anyways if they brought anything to the table that hasn't been done before in the countless I'm getting too old for this sht retirement bits SEE Lethal Weapon One Two Three I might have given a sht myself.I'm not going to spoil anything else but to say they try to unsuccessfully sneak some character depth to the story The FBI agent that won't give up! The Mother  Child who also want out! The Mob won't let him go! The positives about the film was again Renner who wasn't on top of his game  nowhere near but still good to watch and the striking though formulaic views of Boston. Honestly I don't mind scenic aerial shots of cities or on the ground and in unfamiliar neighborhoods of cities. So I did like how the film was shot.Unfortunately it was always ended with a close up of the DudleyDoWrong mug of Affleck. Buzz kill.You have no one to root for. No depth of the characters other than what's spoken and not shown. You have nothing new under the Boston sun. And you have no reason to subject yourself with dozens of other already made already better film versions of The Town. SKIP!".

He is too middle class to act tough incredible charming and thoughtful to the point that you think the movie is a romance. He falls in love at first sight and sacrifices everything for this girl who he has 'traumatized' meanwhile he is more than happy to spray his submachine gun all over the town. Oh and did I mention he had childhood problems? Did I have to? The movie is so incredibly clich that you just want to laugh out loud. Rebecca Hall played her part well is it really that hard to stand around looking pretty and feeling vulnerable. Blake Lively was a disgrace. Despite having absolutely no character depth admittedly not her fault her accent was abysmal to the point of being unaudible for most of the movie. She needs to stick to Gossip Girl where the role is incredibly easy and her looks get her through the episodes due the abundance of gawking twelveyearolds.Jon Hamm star of Madmen is yet another completely miscast character. While I am usually impressed by his acting he did not pull off even slightly the badass detective role.Basically this movie was based on the premise that if enough good looking people were thrown in it would make a lot of money. The performances however were not all bad Jeremy Renner was powerful and once again I was impressed by his ability which was of course proved in 'The Hurt Locker'The script was weak and predictable most characters had no depth for example the other two crew members of the supposedly four man team and frankly just boring save one or two good lines. I wont go deep into the plot holes because im sure someone will have covered that elsewhere but I will note briefly that there are many of them. I don't usually take such negative stances on movies but I felt that this movie is completely undeserving of its rating.".

	schema:headline " A Well Polished Turd";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people seem to love Ben Affleck's The Town. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by that. I mean we do live in a society in which almost all our popular culture is fake. Fake reality shows flood our current television channels the music business is full of fake posturing and overly manufactured acts and Hollywood keeps filming the same old stories with bad writing big star names and lots of glitzy glamour. All flash and very little substance seems to be the trend of the day or should I say decade? Well The Town is not much different it too is a well polished turd. A turd that lacks pretty much any originality at all. The dialogue and overall quality of writing in this film should easily be surpassed by the average tenth grade student if challenged. Seriously is there a single stretch of 10 minutes in this film that actually seemed like it could or might be able to happen in reality? I've been around. From the big house to the white picket fence to the bad side of town and I'm telling you that no there is nothing real. Nor is there anything meaningful here. This basically seemed like a badly written cartoon made into an even worse film. None of the characters who are given time to develop are anything more than cartoon like. Has the majority of people these days lost all perspective on what is realistic and what is a total sham? It certainly seems so.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many people seem to love Ben Affleck's The Town. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by that. I mean we do live in a society in which almost all our popular culture is fake. Fake reality shows flood our current television channels the music business is full of fake posturing and overly manufactured acts and Hollywood keeps filming the same old stories with bad writing big star names and lots of glitzy glamour. All flash and very little substance seems to be the trend of the day or should I say decade? Well The Town is not much different it too is a well polished turd. A turd that lacks pretty much any originality at all. The dialogue and overall quality of writing in this film should easily be surpassed by the average tenth grade student if challenged.

It's more like a feature length madeforTV soap opera than a regular movie and is very cartoonlike with a poor to mediocre cast. None of the characters are believable except for Jeremy Renner's role as the crazy Jem Coughlin and Jon Hamm as Adam Frawley the FBI Agt. who's been assigned to bring Doug MacRay and his men to their knees and to prison once and for all. The beginning of The Town with the opening bank heist and the aerialon the ground shots of Charlestown and Boston generally was interesting but it went from being okay to being just plain awful in a matter of minutes. The Town conveys the message to me personally that people don't have to be held accountable for what they do and as long as they get what they want anything goes. A strong message that predatory behavior such as stalking a person and associating with a person who shoots kills and beats people within inches of their life is okay is also evident in The Town. So is the message that a woman who's very princesslike demure and normal and steals the heart of the defacto leader of a local gang of thieving thugs can be petted and praised as a good lass regardless of what she does and that being an accessory to someone's criminal activity and making dupes out of law enforcement people who are trying to do their assigned jobs of bringing criminals to justice is okay. The Town also indicates the continued dumbing down of America and the world the fact that such a film not only can be mad but to have such glowing reviews from most people is a strong reflection of that.".

It's a movie about nothing with too much things going on. The same things that couple of minutes later are completely forgotten and the story goes on like some of them never happened. It has some great masks different one for every occasion but it seems that masks are there to make people pay no attention to weak action sequences and lack of tension. And even if we forget all about action and tension we are left with bad love story. The movie is also too long and it seems that Ben got lost somewhere towards the end. It is just bad and boring.And let's be clear... the guy is robber he's pointing guns at people he should be in jail and not in some idyllic house on a lake.

Tension is kept mostly throughout there are some predictable moments...but who cares? And the performances are also a major plus.  James Caan is very easy to empathize with and he manages to keep his cynical sense of humor. Richard Farnsworth as a grizzled sheriff was a nice addition to the film since his character didn't exist in the book.  He also has a nice sense of humor and he's the kind of guy who you want to root for.  But the most amazing performance is from Kathy Bates who treads a fine line alternating between sweet and lovable to amazingly evil.  She won an Oscar for this movie and wholeheartedly deserved it.Side note  This is one of the few films which took an Oscar that you can actually say the Academy had the guts to give out.  Can anyone name another horror film which won such a notable prize?ANyway...by the end the novelist and the viewer or put through some torturous activity.  We sometimes feel his pain and it is so much fun to hate this woman................the book is excellent.....the movie is just as good in about 16th of the time it would take to read.

When he finishes his last Misery book he decides to celebrate and is heading back for his daughter's birthday but he gets caught in a horrible blizzard and gets into a nasty and fatal car accident but is saved by Kathy Bates or as we know her Annie.He wakes up in a bedroom with his legs badly broken bruised up and cut up but hears a light and charming voice saying You're going to be just fine. I'm your number one fan!. Annie nurses Paul back to health and says she'll get an ambulance once the storm clears up. She's so lovely and charming you would never have any clue that she'd even just harm a fly. But when she gets ahold of Paul's last Misery book she gets infuriated when she finds out that he's killing off Misery and continuing onto more dramatic and dark stories. She makes him write a new Misery where she is resurrected Paul used to write for a living now he's writing to stay alive. Discovering slowly how crazy Annie is he tries to escape more and more but Annie is so convinced she's in love with him she'll never let him go! Kathy Bates truly is the amazing star of the film she is so disturbing to watch. Especially during the hobbing scene she breaks Paul's legs again she makes it seem so innocent but it's HORRIFYING to watch! Both her and James worked so well together and were just incredible. The movie is so awesome I would highly recommend this movie for anyone! It's a movie not to be missed.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Misery is without a doubt one of the finest movies of the 90's and one of the best movies in the thriller genre. In my opinion Misery is one of the better adaptations of Stephen King's works and truly a movie that cannot be missed!Paul Sheldon James Caan is the author of a successful series of romance novels about a character called Misery who decides to take a more serious approach regarding his future novels. On his way to publish his new manuscript Paul drives from his hotel in Silver Creek to New York. Due to the extreme weather conditions he has an accident that leaves him severely injured and hopeless. A local nurse named Annie Wilkes Kathy Bates finds Paul and brings him to her remote home in order to help him recover. Claiming to be his number one fan Annie discovers that in his last Misery novel her favorite character dies and then her obsession about him takes a dark and twisted turn as a long story of captivity and abuse begins.The direction by Rob Reiner is phenomenal and on a hitchcockian level as the film has a plethora of perfectly crafted suspenseful moments that have the audience on the edge of their seats from the beginning till the amazing climax. The editing of the movie is also flawless as the shots are specifically designed to induce tension in any moment they can. The cinematographer and Reiner both ace the perilous atmosphere of the picture using close up shots of the moonfaced Wilkes both in her fits of rage and kindness which magnifies the polar extremes that Wilkes is prone to unexpectedly visit. What is also triumphed is the slow convergence of the audience and Paul Sheldon.The movie received a lot of critical acclaim especially due to Kathy Bates' chilling and memorable performance as Anny Wilkes that earned her the 1990's leading actress Oscar award which remains the only Oscar ever given to a Stephen King film adaptation. No matter how great Kathy Bates' Oscarwinning performance is James Caan's cannot go unnoticed as it definitely qualifies as one of the best performances in his extensive career despite how demanding and challenging his role as Paul Sheldon was.In conclusion Misery is a dark and tense masterpiece which succeeds into creating the feeling of captivity and helplessness that the thriller genre was purposefully built for and that makes it one of the best movies of the 90's and one absolute classic in its genre.".

In my opinion Misery is one of the better adaptations of Stephen King's works and truly a movie that cannot be missed!Paul Sheldon James Caan is the author of a successful series of romance novels about a character called Misery who decides to take a more serious approach regarding his future novels. On his way to publish his new manuscript Paul drives from his hotel in Silver Creek to New York. Due to the extreme weather conditions he has an accident that leaves him severely injured and hopeless. A local nurse named Annie Wilkes Kathy Bates finds Paul and brings him to her remote home in order to help him recover. Claiming to be his number one fan Annie discovers that in his last Misery novel her favorite character dies and then her obsession about him takes a dark and twisted turn as a long story of captivity and abuse begins.The direction by Rob Reiner is phenomenal and on a hitchcockian level as the film has a plethora of perfectly crafted suspenseful moments that have the audience on the edge of their seats from the beginning till the amazing climax. The editing of the movie is also flawless as the shots are specifically designed to induce tension in any moment they can. The cinematographer and Reiner both ace the perilous atmosphere of the picture using close up shots of the moonfaced Wilkes both in her fits of rage and kindness which magnifies the polar extremes that Wilkes is prone to unexpectedly visit. What is also triumphed is the slow convergence of the audience and Paul Sheldon.The movie received a lot of critical acclaim especially due to Kathy Bates' chilling and memorable performance as Anny Wilkes that earned her the 1990's leading actress Oscar award which remains the only Oscar ever given to a Stephen King film adaptation. No matter how great Kathy Bates' Oscarwinning performance is James Caan's cannot go unnoticed as it definitely qualifies as one of the best performances in his extensive career despite how demanding and challenging his role as Paul Sheldon was.In conclusion Misery is a dark and tense masterpiece which succeeds into creating the feeling of captivity and helplessness that the thriller genre was purposefully built for and that makes it one of the best movies of the 90's and one absolute classic in its genre.";

	schema:headline " Shining shocking dark comedy in the Hitchcock mold";
	schema:reviewBody "Writer William Goldman and director Rob Reiner do Hitchcock proud with this one. It has all the elements a seemingly innocent place and situation invaded by a growing sense of sinister dread until a breathtaking climax. The intelligent script is peppered with moments that will either make you cringe or make you laugh depending on how morbid your sense of humor is. It is a harrowing movie to watch the first time around. The crew has done a good job of making you feel Paul Sheldon's pain. Few films torture the audience like this one. In fact I venture to say this is the best film of its kind since Psycho thirty years earlier.The acting is good allround. Farnsworth steals every scene he's in with his sardonic and relentless sheriff  he did not get enough accolades for what would have been a routine part in a lesser actor's hands. Caan is solid and underplays beautifully and the inimitable Kathy Bates carries the film with her alternately hysterical or ridiculouslysappy Annie the psychotic Sheldon fan. Her performance is a throwback to Hollywood's old days  it's not subtle not quiet and borders on overacting. This is not method acting this is showing off. But Bates makes it work investing Annie with enough pitifulness to make the character complex and thus hold the role together. This movie is famous of course for making Kathy Bates an overnight sensation as everybody went into the movie wanting to see what Sonny Corleone looked like as an older man but left with accolades for Kathy Bates on their lips. She is absolutely terrifying and unforgettable in this role and perfect for it. Brilliant performance that elevated a 7star thriller to 910 classic status.".

	schema:headline " The best horror film ever adapted from a Stephen King book";
	schema:reviewBody "Misery accomplishes something which Hitchcock achieved in Psycho but which very few modern horror films achieve it entertains without seeming exploitative. Even the movie's most gruesome scene which ranks up there as one of the more memorably horrifying moments in all of cinema ends with a laugh that somehow doesn't cheapen the materialmaybe because it arises so naturally from the basic situation which the movie takes very seriously. We're not being urged to find the violence itself entertaining as is the case for so many horror films these days. Rather the humor is a way of breaking the tension of a desperate nightmarish scenario. It is we suspect what helps the protagonist survive the ordeal.Like many of the greatest thrillers Misery begins with a bizarre set of coincidences. A bestselling romance novelist named Paul Sheldon James Caan is on his way to the countryside to work on his next book when a blizzard causes his car to crash leaving him severely injured and unable to walk. Annie Wilkes Kathy Bates a retired nurse and obsessive fan who was following him takes care of him in her house without letting him leave or contact anyone. She is upset that he has recently killed off a central character in his series and she forces him to write the new book more to her liking though in total isolation from the outside world. His family and friends fear him dead but the local sheriff Richard Farnsworth is investigating a little more closely.Misery belongs to a unique genre in which a single character is trapped in a small area and spends the entire story attempting to escape. I've been fascinated by this type of story ever since I first read Edgar Allan Poe's The Pit and the Pendulum. With his fine attention to detail Stephen King has made two notable contributions to the genre Misery and the unfilmable Gerald's Game where a woman spends the entire novel handcuffed to a bed in the middle of nowhere. Everything is topsyturvy in a story like this. The protagonist must adapt to a weird new set of rules that put a diabolical twist on normal routines. To most people a house is a mundane setting where you wake up every day and leave without blinking an eye. For a house to become a prison seems almost unthinkable. Stories like Misery have the urgency of a nightmare where the thing you fear most is always on the verge of happening.In particular this movie has much in common with the 1962 suspense drama Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? which I recommend. The basic structure of the story is the same involving a disabled person in the house of an insane woman who subjects her captive to physical and psychological tortures while almost everyone on the outside doesn't even know the victim exists. But in the older film the motives were simpler rooted in sibling jealousy and old wounds. Misery brings the conceit to a new level by making the captive a famous writer and the kidnapper a crazed fan. The movie makes much of the irony that she's a pretty good editor. She's not really sadistic or vengeful as was the case with the Bette Davis character in Baby Jane. The tortures she inflicts on Paul are the natural result of her trying to fit him into her bizarre little world.Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her performance one of only three horror performances ever to receive that award. The other two are Fredric March for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Anthony Hopkins for Silence of the Lambs. One of the best actresses working today she's fortunate not to have been typecast in this sort of role. She later proved herself quite adept at playing vulnerable women like the battered wife in Dolores Claiborne. She brings to the role of Annie a certain earthiness that you don't expect in this kind of role. She plays the character as a woman who doesn't perceive herself as insane who acts bubbly and cheerful most of the time and seems to view her sudden mood shifts as merely a personal weakness. At times the movie almost comes off as a demented parody of a normal relationship between a man and woman living together.The very best of the Stephen King horror movies Misery is a film which I count among my favorites even though it is so intense I sometimes have trouble sitting through the whole thing. With a screenplay by William Goldman who has a knack for developing bizarre torture scenes the Nazi dentist torture in Marathon Man the Machine in The Princess Bride the movie manages to be scary and classy at the same timea rare feat for a modern horror picture. Kathy Bates is in my nightmares!".

	schema:reviewBody "Horror movies generally aren't my cup of tea but people have always talked about how great Misery is. So I decided to give it a look when it came on TV today. All I can say is that I was definitely not disappointed this was an amazing movie.Misery is the story of writer Paul Sheldon James Caan who is driving through a snowstorm after just having finished his newest novel. The car crashes and it seems that Paul will die trapped in his car in the snow in a deserted forest when he is rescued by a mysterious stranger. She turns out to be Annie Wilkes Kathy Bates a former nurse who dresses his wounds and gives him a comfortable bed. In addition it turns out that Annie is Paul's selfproclaimed Number 1 Fan. Specifically she is obsessed with the Misery Chastain series Paul's major claim to fame. Annie keeps Paul in an isolated room for days then weeks as the outside world searches for him. Eventually when Annie objects to the content of Paul's latest manuscript and when she has a hysterical reaction to the death of Misery in the latest novel Paul and the audience come to see that there may be something wrong with Annie.Caan and Bates were absolutely stunning in their performances. The vast majority of this movie focused on them so it was crucial that they both be able to convey the sense that something horrific was going on. It was no surprise that Kathy Bates won the Best Actress Oscar for her role. Everything in this movie really worked to show just how trapped Paul was and how hopeless his situation seemed. And of course this movie left a few indelible images in the mind. One in particular comes to mind and I really wish that I hadn't seen that scene previously on some other TV show that almost took away from the impact of seeing it in context. So if you are a fan of suspenseful fare or you just want to see a horror movie mostly sans blood and guts Misery is for you. You will never ever want to hear anyone say that they're a fan of yours again.".

She stars as a crazed fan who cares for author James Caan after he's involved in a nearfatal auto accident in the middle of nowhere.  Quickly her mood goes from cheerful to downright frightening when she learns that Caan's fictional heroine Misery will die in his newest novel.  Caan's character is not very well developed and this somewhat stalls the film but it really does not matter because of Bates's performance.

	schema:reviewBody "With most of the action set in one room and involving only two people this tense psychological thriller is more like a stageplay than a movie. Fortunately this style of presentation works well in establishing the claustrophobic atmosphere and sense of unease that prevails throughout this tale of an unfortunate man who through no fault of his own is held captive by a psychotic woman. The physical pain and mental torment that he suffers is dreadful and the journey that he makes through his personal nightmare is both harrowing and compelling to watch.Paul Sheldon James Caan is a highly successful writer whose numerous romantic novels featuring his heroine Misery Chastain have all been bestsellers. Having grown tired of writing this type of material he'd recently been working on his first serious novel and on completing his manuscript sets out from Silver Creek Lodge in Colorado and drives down a mountain road in a snowstorm to deliver his work to his agent. As the conditions worsen and the road becomes more slippery he loses control of his car which rolls down a bank and into a snowdrift where he ends up unconscious with two broken legs a dislocated shoulder and numerous other injuries.Local Woman Annie Wilkes Kathy Bates discovers the wreckage and pulls Paul out of the vehicle before taking him to her isolated home where she starts to nurse him back to health. When he regains consciousness Paul is grateful for what Annie's done and soon learns that she's a trained nurse and a devoted fan who feels privileged to have him staying at her home. She tells him that because of the storm the roads are closed and the telephones are out of action so she's unable to inform anyone immediately of his whereabouts. Annie's obviously a lonely person and acts rather coyly and politely at this stage.After reading Paul's justcompleted manuscript she changes radically becomes very angry and expresses her strong disgust at the amount of swearing it contains. A little later when she also reads his newlyreleased Misery Chastain novel she becomes outraged when she discovers that he's killed off her favourite character Misery and feels betrayed by him. She uses her dominance over him to make him burn his new manuscript and write a new novel in which Misery is brought back to life. As her behaviour continues to become increasingly violent and unhinged Paul tries to go along with what she wants as far as possible whilst also trying to devise a way of escaping his hellish ordeal.Annie Wilkes is a highly eccentric character who's initially very ingratiating but later becomes completely deranged and horribly violent. With her pet pig called Misery her love of Liberace's recordings and an obsessive need to control Paul the scope for any actress who portrays her is obviously enormous. Kathy Bates in her Oscarwinning performance does an amazing job of bringing this complex woman to life and James Caan whose character is so helpless and physically constrained throughout skilfully overcomes these limitations to make Paul a very sympathetic victim. Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen add some light relief as the local sheriff and his wife and Lauren Bacall is also excellent in her cameo role as Paul's agent.The way in which the action unfolds onscreen is vital to the success of this movie and director Rob Reiner's brilliant pacing plays a big part in building up the mood and tension so effectively. There are some shocking moments such as the shooting of one of the story's minor characters and the infamous sledgehammer scene but more surprisingly maybe there's also a certain amount of humour to enjoy.".

	schema:headline " He didn't get out of the Cock a Doodle Car so he suffered misery from his number 1 fan";
	schema:reviewBody "No famed novelist Paul Sheldon James Caan known for his successful series of novels involving a character called Misery Chastain didn't get out of his car when it crash in Colorado during a blizzard. The reasons why is for his legs are broken and a dislocated shoulder. He is rescued by Nurse Annie Wilkes Kathy Bates and brought to her remote home bedridden and incapacitated. He soon finds out that Annie is his number one fan and talks a lot about his novels. When Annie get a hold of Paul's newest works she become enraged in many factors but one really got to her. That one was Paul wanting to branch out and wanted to try something new so he killed off Misery in his latest book Misery's Child. She wasn't going to allow it so she forced write a new novel entitled Misery's Return in which he brings the character back to life. Paul reluctantly does believing Annie might kill him otherwise. The character that James Caan plays in this film is so realistic. He realizes very quickly that he's dealing with a psychopath who likes to be in control when he studied psychological disorders as part of his research for the Misery series. He knows how to butter her up to keep her mind at ease as much as possible. He realizes that the way to get out is to treat her with respect  act like he understands her  that he's on her side. He figured what he had to do from this minute to the next to the next. Yet he took risks exploring the area and trying to escape. Using the typewriter as a weight to work out his shoulder and strength is smart. Sheldon is enormously witty and clever. Most victims in movies are just hopeless and stupid. The audience will feel for him because of that reason. He would have to be strong to survive Annie Wilkes. Kathy Bates is best suited for the mercurial psychopathic role of Wilkes. Wilkes can be describe as a American yandere. Wilkes is gentle and care for a lot before their romantic devotion becomes mentally destructive in nature often through violence and brutality. She subjects him to a series of physical and psychological tortures throughout the film. Bates makes Wilkes out to be a cunning brutal and dangerously disturbed woman who hides her psychosis behind a cheery facade while displays obsessivecompulsive personality disorder by using with childishly strange words and phrases when expressing anger. Kathy Bates won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this role. The supporting cast is made out to be one man local sheriff Buster Richard Farnsworth whom is investigating Paul's disappearance. The character rarely gives anything to the plot and personal wasn't needed in the film pointless. Misery is a Rob Reiner film that based on the Stephen King's 1987 novel. There are some different between the film and book. For instance the book was more violence to Paul. In the book when Paul mentions that her typewriter is missing a key Annie cuts off his thumb. Rather than hobbling him in the book Annie cuts off his foot. Buster is also treated with more violence in his death with her riding over his body with a lawnmower. In the book Paul become an addict to painkillers and finish writing 'Fast Cars'. In the film Paul becomes successful with his book 'Higher Education of Phillip J. Stone'. One of Stephen King's inspirations for Misery was the reaction his fans had to The Eyes of the Dragon. The fans rejected The Eyes of the Dragon because of its lack of horror. Paul Sheldon feeling chained to the Misery books by his fans was a metaphor for his feeling chained to horror fiction. As a horror thriller movie it works. People still cringe during the hobbling scene. Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata was such a good choice as background music. The whole movie has a sense of tongue in cheek about it. Director Rob Reiner did a good job on it. The camera work is very similar to Alfred Hitchcock. Perhaps because the way King wrote the protagonist as immobilized in a wheel chair Reiner purposely wanted to make allusions to Rear Window. Allot of the disorienting angles and suspense scenes reminded people of Psycho too. Some people might hate the ending since it different from the book. Endings are pretty hard to manage in general because everyone kind of has their own expectations and predictions of how the story should end. It's especially difficult if you've invested a lot into the story. If it doesn't end the way you think it should have you get disappointed. This is an intriguing notion the craziness of fans. I suppose it echoes the surprise Annie Wilkes felt when she read that Misery was killed off. Critics are like that. A great movie that stirs the pot.".

Like several of his novels the protagonist is a writer Secret Window also has a tortured novelist. King's tendency to use his novels in the '80s as parallels to his own experiences is liked by some but not all fans. However with this film it works to its advantage. Shawshank Redemption is my favorite film based on one of King's books but when it comes to his horror stories this is the best.

The suspense the director built along with Kathy Bates' wonderful acting makes the story very involving and tense. The director is able to entertain involve scare and even deliver some jumps without even needing to add a supernatural thing. Annie Wilkes' cynicism is able to induce all of us the agonizing feelings we can feel in a suspense film. I see some people arguing if Annie knew the wine had that odd medicine in it obviously that's the writer's intention. And that's brilliant because it's a simple scene which provokes lots of questions and doubts about her intelligence. And more than that leaves the doubt to the spectator making he think about the movie after it's over.Misery thought not perfect is a great original work with good actors that will deliver you a good time and keep you on the edge of your seat.".

James Caan stars as author Paul Sheldon who while leaving his secluded lodge in Silver Creek gets into a terrible car crash amidst a blizzard. He is saved by Annie Wilkes a woman who keeps to herself on her quiet farm. There isn't much to Annie other than her eccentric love for Sheldon's Misery book series. She claims to be his number one fan but as she nurses him back to health she reveals her love of Sheldon's books to be more of an obsession than a liking. Sheldon quickly finds himself in a lot of trouble as his own life is threatened by this deranged fan of his.Misery is an all around wildly entertaining film that incorporates horror suspense and even a little bit of dark comedy. These elements work together perfectly and make for an incredibly exciting film full of suspense and lacks any predictability. You never know what is going to happen next while watching Misery and it makes it incredibly fun to watch. Kathy Bates is astounding as Annie Wilkes a performance she won an Academy Award for it was so good. The performance is frighteningly believable absolutely deranged and makes you so incredibly afraid of what this character is capable of. We don't feel safe at any turn during the film and it leaves us in constant suspenseful worry about what will happen to Sheldon. James Caan also does an excellent job in his role but his and all the other roles in the film are heavily overshadowed by Bates.This film has a very natural flow and cadence to it that makes it a wonderfully enthralling experience from start to finish. There's never any dead air the film always stays interesting and something new and exciting is always happening. The majority of the film takes place in Annie's house so there was a lot of opportunity for the film to become redundant and repetitive but it always maintained a heightened level of excitement. There's never a dull moment in Misery.I personally loved every moment of Misery. I constantly was interested in what would happen next and I couldn't wait to see how the events of the film would all pay off in the end. This is such a well made film and Bates is so terrifyingly good as Annie Wilkes that if nothing else her performance will be forever engraved in your brain. It's easily one of the best Stephen King adaptations out there and one of the best film's I've seen from the great Rob Reiner.".

	schema:headline " What happens when you overvalue a movie concept and undervalue the story";
	schema:reviewBody "The answer to the obvious question hovering around Jon Favreau's latest action blockbuster is yes Cowboys  Aliens is as ridiculous as the title sounds. Yet blame doesn't quite belong on Favreau's shoulders or that of star Daniel Craig or the rest of the cast rather the failure of this alieninfested Western results from the domino effect of the countless studios and producers who put their faith and money in a concept rather than a story.To be fair I know nothing of the Platinum Studios comic by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg but it couldn't have been all that good if all the hottest screenwriters in Hollywood couldn't whip together a plot worth a damn. The duos behind Iron Man and Star Trek along with Lost writer Damon Lindelof all took cracks at the screenplay and an earlier treatment from another pair of it writers who wrote next month's Conan the Barbarian was discarded. Frankly criticism of Cowboys  Aliens all stems from a story with lackluster characters equipped with clich motivations. Despite some cool aliens the action doesn't offer anything unique enough to counter that we've no reason to care.Craig stars as Jake Lonergan a stoic outlaw in Arizona sometime in the late 19th Century who wakes up with no memory and some metal device on his wrist. When he arrives in the town of Absolution the sheriff discovers he's wanted and attempts to ship him off for a reward. That's when the aliens attack bombing the town and roping up locals before flying off into the night. Lonergan's bracelet activates as a weapon and suddenly he's the only one capable of defeating these things. He joins a rescue party led by a grumpy Civil War vet named Dolarhyde Harrison Ford and they all set off to find out what happened to their loved ones.The script introduces characters willynilly and provides little satisfactory explanation for anything that happens. The story paints Lonergan as a quiet badass but one who has flashes of some woman he loved. Because his past slowly unravels with nothing revelatory to show for it as the film wears on it's tough to care much or even see him as capable of romantic feelings. Regardless a woman named Ella Olivia Wilde keeps approaching him with questions he doesn't have the answers to and she evolves into a love interest for nothing but the sake of it. Sam Rockwell has little to no bearing on the film other than serving an example of an otherwise peaceful man who will do whatever it takes to get his wife back. He's a waste in the role. As for Ford he just gets on screen and acts grumpy and impatient. We've seen everyone on board do so much better. Did these folks not read the script?

	onyx:emotionText "The answer to the obvious question hovering around Jon Favreau's latest action blockbuster is yes Cowboys  Aliens is as ridiculous as the title sounds. Yet blame doesn't quite belong on Favreau's shoulders or that of star Daniel Craig or the rest of the cast rather the failure of this alieninfested Western results from the domino effect of the countless studios and producers who put their faith and money in a concept rather than a story.To be fair I know nothing of the Platinum Studios comic by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg but it couldn't have been all that good if all the hottest screenwriters in Hollywood couldn't whip together a plot worth a damn. The duos behind Iron Man and Star Trek along with Lost writer Damon Lindelof all took cracks at the screenplay and an earlier treatment from another pair of it writers who wrote next month's Conan the Barbarian was discarded. Frankly criticism of Cowboys  Aliens all stems from a story with lackluster characters equipped with clich motivations. Despite some cool aliens the action doesn't offer anything unique enough to counter that we've no reason to care.Craig stars as Jake Lonergan a stoic outlaw in Arizona sometime in the late 19th Century who wakes up with no memory and some metal device on his wrist. When he arrives in the town of Absolution the sheriff discovers he's wanted and attempts to ship him off for a reward. That's when the aliens attack bombing the town and roping up locals before flying off into the night. Lonergan's bracelet activates as a weapon and suddenly he's the only one capable of defeating these things. He joins a rescue party led by a grumpy Civil War vet named Dolarhyde Harrison Ford and they all set off to find out what happened to their loved ones.The script introduces characters willynilly and provides little satisfactory explanation for anything that happens. The story paints Lonergan as a quiet badass but one who has flashes of some woman he loved. Because his past slowly unravels with nothing revelatory to show for it as the film wears on it's tough to care much or even see him as capable of romantic feelings. Regardless a woman named Ella Olivia Wilde keeps approaching him with questions he doesn't have the answers to and she evolves into a love interest for nothing but the sake of it. Sam Rockwell has little to no bearing on the film other than serving an example of an otherwise peaceful man who will do whatever it takes to get his wife back. He's a waste in the role. As for Ford he just gets on screen and acts grumpy and impatient. We've seen everyone on board do so much better. Did these folks not read the script? Probably not considering the number of drafts alone.Worst of all the script thinks we will care after all this is Cowboys  Frickin' Aliens!

Cowboys  Aliens is a blast of summer blockbuster fun delivering fun visual effects consistently entertaining action and fun dialogue to spice up the fun.

What really stands out for me were the scenes at the beginning of the film Jon Favreau introduces the characters locations and situations in such a manner that when the real threat manifests itself despite the films title it catches you as off guard as the characters are.The cast are all great some nice character work from Clancy Brown and Keith Carradine. Daniel Craig brings the stoic no nonsense aspects of his Bond to Jake and as i said earlier Harrison Ford obviously relishes the role of Dolarhyde.It reminds me of the films i used to enjoy about twenty years ago that had lively pace but were'nt frantic. The effects are special but not overblown or overwhelming to the point where they become the focus thereby obviating any interest in the characters stories. I don't want to talk about the story too much and spoil it i'd just urge you to go and watch it because this movie is an honest attempt to try something a little different. Its not Superheroes its not a TV show its not a line of toys and its not cute animated whatevers. Its an unlikely but successful fusion of two genres to produce a film with humour drama action and a refreshing amount of practical effects work. Give it a chance i really was surprised how much i enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been over 42 years since a good Weird west movie came out. Now Paramount Picture attempts to revive the genre again. Did It work? This is my review on Cowboys and Aliens.The plot goes like this A man wakes up in a desert without any knowledge of of history or his identity. He also notices a metal armband around his arm which looks like something WAY beyond it's time. He eventually finds a small town in Arizona entitled Absolution. After causing chaos with the local Sheriff he runs into a dirty goodfornothing Cattle owner named Colonel Dolarhyde who seems to own the town. But before Dolarhyde could get ahold of him mysterious attackers from the skies assault the town abducting anyone who stands in their way. After the attack Dolarhyde decides to cut a deal with the man with no name due to the fact that his armband is some sort of alien weaponry. A Posse is established and they set out to find the invaders and reclaim their family members.With a few exceptions like True Grit and 310 to Yuma Westerns that have come out in the 21st century have been far from Brilliant status of the older movies. Cowboys and Aliens seem to mix the two together Assembling a classic western storyline with a modern alien twist and it works! The story has all the stereotypical western characters that appeared in the oldies. You've got an old drunk the young kid that needs to learn manners a greedy land owner and of course a man with no name. The writers did a really good job establishing some great western clichs that seemed to be used a lot in the old movies. The characters are extremely well acted And why wouldn't they be. It stars great acting legends like Harrison ford and Daniel Crag. Harrison plays brilliantly grunting and growling like some savage beast which the character seems to be. Daniel is quite good tothough there is nothing out of the ordinary to talk about. Good acting in general but don't be going in thinking that there is going to be the best acting ever because it isn't.One factor a look at most in SciFi movies is the Aliens. The aliens in this movie are amongst the greatest of modern aliens. Im probably alone in this but they make me feel like I'm watching an oldschool alien ultimatum which is very hard for modern filmmakers to achieve. One thing I like about them is their weaponry. You see a alien armband on the Daniel Crag's character for most of the movie but as you get to the end they reveal a lot more. They have huge underarm Lazar cannons that explode large sections of the landscape which is quite entertaining to watch.The aliens' motivation is nothing special but it wasn't TERRIBLE. For the appearance and weaponry I think they deserve credit.There is a lot of action scenes to keep the action junkies happy. As well as the explosions mentioned before we has huge spaceships blasting people Indians stabbing aliens Cowboys shooting aliens etc. There is A lot of battles which are extremely entertaining.Im not saying this movie is for everyone and most people will disagree with everything i have just said but I on the other hand can't praise it enough. It brought me back to the old school B movies. I highly recommend the film to fans of Scifi action and old B westerns.I give it a 1010".

And yet somehow the 'Curse of The Modern Day Spielberg' managed to defy all expectations and deliver a total damp squib. The story's weak why capture the humans? why come to earth of all planets to mine for gold? how can one stolen gun destroy an entire operation? the treatment confused the whole Olivia Wilde arc the actors underutilized somebody please stop the brutal destruction of everything that Harrison Ford has come to mean to moviegoers and the action and thrills extremely underwhelming.Please do not go to see this movie. More than the time that you'll never get back it'll spoil James Bond Indy Cowboys Westerns and Movie Aliens for you forever. To think that I missed work to catch the first early morning opening show. So disappointed.".

And yet somehow the 'Curse of The Modern Day Spielberg' managed to defy all expectations and deliver a total damp squib. The story's weak why capture the humans? why come to earth of all planets to mine for gold? how can one stolen gun destroy an entire operation? the treatment confused the whole Olivia Wilde arc the actors underutilized somebody please stop the brutal destruction of everything that Harrison Ford has come to mean to moviegoers and the action and thrills extremely underwhelming.Please do not go to see this movie. More than the time that you'll never get back it'll spoil James Bond Indy Cowboys Westerns and Movie Aliens for you forever. To think that I missed work to catch the first early morning opening show. So disappointed.";

John Wayne would have been proud of this movie. So would have many other cowboy legends such as Roy Rogers. Not only was the base of the story well thought out the cast crew and other members of this film worked really hard to entertain us. There are basic morals taught in this film if the viewer would jus pay attention. As far as Christian lessons carefully placed the writers could not have done a better job. Family values soared throughout this tale. This wasn't just a SciFiWestern mix film. This is a brand new way to look at human struggles and how to beat the odds. This a fresh way to look into our hearts and learn to fight as a band for our survival. The odd thing there is a tremendous amount of sacrifice made all the way throughout the movie. And let's not forget about the humor. There is a subtle funny line at least every few minutes. For a viewer like myself I had to watch it 3 times since I really wanted to understand the deep message. And boy did the fireworks light up my soul. The way to win lives is truly amazing. I wish I could shake their hands.".

	schema:headline " Bad Ass Action Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Now this is a summer movie with a unique premise that's not only out there but works so well that it makes me say That was BAD ASS. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you the next heavyweight action film of the summer Cowboys  Aliens.Okay let's get the obvious out of the way YES cowboys and aliens in the same movie sounds like an absurd premise that would only exist in the mind of adolescent boy. And yet this childlike premise is immediately forgotten when you watch surprisingly deep characters struggle through a dangerous situation with overwhelming odds against them. And this film can get DARK in both terms of the fights happening on screen as well as the gravity of the situation. Instead of some sillymindless action you get a film that will make you grow a beard sitting through its 2hour run time which flies by fast. And don't worry ladies you get plenty of eye candy too. The film stars Daniel Craig flawlessly using his American accent as Jake Lonergan a cowboy stranded in the middle of the Wild West with only a strangle bracelet on his wrist and no recollection of who he is or how he got there. After a series of dodging mishaps in the nearby town of Absolution he is corned by Elle played by Olivia Wilde and hardasnails rancher Han Solo I mean Colonel Dolarhyde played by Harrison Ford. An alien invasion then commences and lays waste to Absolution while abducting several of its citizens. Lonergan must then join forces with Dolarhyde and the strange woman to stop the alien threat and discover who he really is.The first twenty minutes of the film play like any Westerner you've seen Craig plays the gruff loner invoking the spirit of Eastwood Harrison Ford plays the gruff bossman of a bunch of thugs and the usual Western archetypes are present throughout the cast. It's when the alien invasion begins that these archetypes are immediately thrown out the window and you find surprisingly deep characters. Lonergan is a wanted man with a brutal past but the allure of a lost love drives him to learn more about her fate. Harrison Ford is playing the best we've seen him in years yes even better than Indiana Jones as a former colonel who has seen the horrors of war and he uses his gruff demeanor to inspire confidence in lesser men. Both Craig and Ford bring their A game to this film as they pull of convincingly deep cowboys. The rest of the cast turns in solid performances. The gorgeous Olivia Wilde plays a mysterious woman who knows more than she's telling but you can't resist caring about her. Sam Worthington plays a meek bar tender out to find his abducted wife and Noah Ringer plays a scared boy searching for his grandfather. And yes these two minor side characters develop their arcs as boys become men. Everyone else does a great job in this setting as well. Okay so now I've praised the story and the deep characters but is the action any good?Oh. Hell. Yes. The fist fights between humans are brutal and visceral. Horseback chase scenes are made more awesome with alien ships hunting the heroes down. And the aliens? Looking damn fine. The computer generated images aren't glaringly obvious here with the aliens looking bulky hideous and monstrous. They are the perfect band of bad guys. And unlike other alien invasion films you get to see humans get into vicious fights with the extraterrestrials. Limbs are blown off Guns blow holes into alien bodies. Aliens eat humans right in front of their comrades. All of it is exceptionally welldone and reminds you that this is most definitely NOT a kids movie PG13 rating be damned. The best part? The fights mean something. You care what happens to Lonerman Dolarhyde Elle Doc and Emmett. When characters die the persons close to them EMOTE. The characters who die are characters YOU grow attached to. You WANT their deaths avenged. You are made known in noneuncertainterms that the situation is dire. And that's what elevates Cowboys  Aliens from a merely good film to a GREAT film.Unique action movies are hard to come by and big budget films with great characters are harder still to find. Cowboys  Aliens finds a way to merge the Western and Alien Invasion genres into something fun entertaining and meaningful. Characters don't get any deeper and action doesn't get any harder than you'll find here. A fantastic summer movie that I highly recommend everyone to check out in theaters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some months ago I read the graphic novel Cowboys  Aliens...and it honestly bored me to tears. Leaving the innovative concept described on the title aside the story only offers hollow characters scifi clichs badly combined with western clichs and an excessively light tone which does not make any justice to the potential from that combination of genres. Paradoxically that disappointment improved my expectations for the film Cowboys  Aliens. After all Hollywood tends to change the novels it adapts pretty much and I thought that some expert screenwriters would fix the many fails from the story. And even though Cowboys  Aliens improved a few elements from the book it also preserved the characters without any substance the arbitrary narrative and the inconsistent behavior from the aliens.The idea of brave cowboys facing an alien invasion is interesting but I think it works better as a concept than as an execution. The crash between advanced extraterrestrial technology and primitive weapons from 19th century would lead to an unilateral massacre which would make the film to conclude in its first 10 minutes so it is necessary to find the way to give the advantage to the cowboys so that the battle is more credible and there is suspense about who the winner will be. Unfortunately coscreenwriters Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman Damon Lindelof Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby did not find a logical way to solve the problem and as a consequence they employ many traps excessive inconsistencies and absolutely ridiculous notions in order to give the cowboys the opportunity to defend themselves from the invaders. Without deepening too much in order not to get into the spoilers field I will mention that despite their technology and destructive potential the favorite method of combat from the aliens is...bodytobody fights. And besides their vulnerability changes according to the screenplay's convenience when the presence of suspense is necessary the aliens are practically indestructible but whenever the movie decides to introduce a cool scene it is easy to kill them with just one shot an Indian spear or a small knife.And because of that the movie constantly pulled me out with its coincidences and forced narrative shortcuts. On the positive side the special effects created by Industrial Light  Magic are competent. As for the human element Harrison Ford brings an adequate performance while on the other side of the coin Daniel Craig feels bland and antipathetic as the antihero. By the way I am going to propose an hypothesis Sam Rockwell and Clancy Brown interpret two supporting roles in this film but they are too short and inconsequential however I think Cowboys  Aliens would have been a better movie with that duet in the leading roles Rockwell is one of the best contemporary actors and he has more cowboy looks than Craig besides his less athletic physique would make the challenges the character faces more interesting. As for Brown he would have been absolutely perfect as the cacique from the village. Sure none of them would have attracted as much spectators as Craig and Ford but anyway...I am sure this movie would have been better if that fantasy was true.In conclusion I cannot recommend Cowboys  Aliens because I found it insipid irritating and the worst thing of all boring. Instead of wasting your time with this film I recommend you three very entertaining westernfantasy hybrids The Burrowers cowboys against subway humanoids which also includes Brown in the cast! Dead Birds cowboys against ghosts and Tremors modern cowboys against crawling graboids. Cowboys  Aliens might surpass them in budget but it is not even remotely to their levels of ingenuity and amusement.".

And not when the movie was being funny.Not going to spoil it but the big revelation moment with Olivia Wilde's character caused some very loud and noticeable derisive laughter from many of us in the theater and the moment with the alien that Jake had first met having a final standoff with him at the end was so hackneyed it provoked chitters and groans.For a movie that felt so long and by concept seemed to be aiming for something big it sure felt small like a Syfy original movie with some bigname actors in it.But the absolute biggest plothole involves the aliens interacting with the people. Not only is it never explained WHY the aliens are randomly abducting people but as it turns out their ultimate reason for coming to Earth and their goal not only has little to nothing to do with humans but considering their technology they could EASILY achieve without EVER interacting with the humans at all! Considering how a clich'd Hollywood flick like this ends with the good guys winning these aliens could've saved themselves a lot of trouble by not looking to pick a fight with the natives for no reason. But then we wouldn't have this big dumb mess we call a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "ONE LINE REVIEW not a great western not great sci fi. What's left?RATING Wait for the instant download. rating system see it in theaters wait for the instant download don't waste you're timeNO SPOILERSCowboys and Aliens opens with our hero Jake Lonergan Daniel Craig waking up alone in the desert wearing an alien bracelet and a fractured memory. He saunters into town and meets Ella Swensen Olivia Wilde who seems to know him. The aliens appear and abduct half the town including the son of cattle man Woodrow Dolarhyde Harrison Ford. Now the remaining townspeople must muster courage to find the aliens and retrieve their loved ones. Our three heroes are joined by a doctor a boy and an Indian aid. Jake has a flashback that lets him remember that the aliens killed his wife and now he wants revenge. With our team established and filled with sufficient resolve they begin their trek to find the aliens retrieve their kin and destroy the alien invaders.This story reminds me of the oldtime westerns where Indians would raid the white man's town and make off with their womenfolk. Then the men folk would form a posse and go retrieve their families. Only here Indians are replaced with aliens.So this movie really offers us a story that was retired decades ago. But with sufficient star power and CGI will it be entertaining to a modern audience? Let's find out...Daniel Craig is the new Bond. You'd think he might deliver a presence as the central character that carries the film. But no. In fact he has very few lines delivered in an American accent and delivers them with complete solemnity. He spends most of his time brooding and taking his hat off or putting it on.Harrison Ford is very believable as the hardnosed cattle man with a past that includes fighting for the South in the Civil War. He's good... He's Harrison Ford after all. His character goes through some important changes as a result of this journey. But that is usually what the lead is supposed to do. As good as Ford is he cannot carry this film playing second fiddle.Olivia Wilde is everywhere these days. She took a year off from House to make movies and she has put the time to good use Tron On the Inside The Change Up. She is a smart and beautiful actor and I'm looking forward to seeing her in a lead role. However the scriptwriters and director did not put her to good use in this film. She spends most of her time in the background watching everything else happen. We never get invested in her  nor does anyone else.The special effects in this film are quite good. The aliens are pretty cool. They did seem to borrow from Aliens and Predator however. The fighter ships that abduct the townspeople have a unique design. However the Mother ship resembles a vertical cigar. As for other special effects a particular explosion was too reminiscent of the Challenger disaster for me. Too soon I guess.Overall this is a pretty unimpressive movie with underpowered performances and a stale story. I can't recommend you spend 10 on it but you might enjoy it at home if you Wait for the instant download".

	onyx:emotionText "ONE LINE REVIEW not a great western not great sci fi. What's left?RATING Wait for the instant download. rating system see it in theaters wait for the instant download don't waste you're timeNO SPOILERSCowboys and Aliens opens with our hero Jake Lonergan Daniel Craig waking up alone in the desert wearing an alien bracelet and a fractured memory. He saunters into town and meets Ella Swensen Olivia Wilde who seems to know him. The aliens appear and abduct half the town including the son of cattle man Woodrow Dolarhyde Harrison Ford. Now the remaining townspeople must muster courage to find the aliens and retrieve their loved ones. Our three heroes are joined by a doctor a boy and an Indian aid. Jake has a flashback that lets him remember that the aliens killed his wife and now he wants revenge. With our team established and filled with sufficient resolve they begin their trek to find the aliens retrieve their kin and destroy the alien invaders.This story reminds me of the oldtime westerns where Indians would raid the white man's town and make off with their womenfolk. Then the men folk would form a posse and go retrieve their families. Only here Indians are replaced with aliens.So this movie really offers us a story that was retired decades ago. But with sufficient star power and CGI will it be entertaining to a modern audience? Let's find out...Daniel Craig is the new Bond. You'd think he might deliver a presence as the central character that carries the film. But no. In fact he has very few lines delivered in an American accent and delivers them with complete solemnity. He spends most of his time brooding and taking his hat off or putting it on.Harrison Ford is very believable as the hardnosed cattle man with a past that includes fighting for the South in the Civil War. He's good... He's Harrison Ford after all. His character goes through some important changes as a result of this journey. But that is usually what the lead is supposed to do. As good as Ford is he cannot carry this film playing second fiddle.Olivia Wilde is everywhere these days. She took a year off from House to make movies and she has put the time to good use Tron On the Inside The Change Up. She is a smart and beautiful actor and I'm looking forward to seeing her in a lead role. However the scriptwriters and director did not put her to good use in this film. She spends most of her time in the background watching everything else happen. We never get invested in her  nor does anyone else.The special effects in this film are quite good. The aliens are pretty cool. They did seem to borrow from Aliens and Predator however. The fighter ships that abduct the townspeople have a unique design. However the Mother ship resembles a vertical cigar. As for other special effects a particular explosion was too reminiscent of the Challenger disaster for me. Too soon I guess.Overall this is a pretty unimpressive movie with underpowered performances and a stale story. I can't recommend you spend 10 on it but you might enjoy it at home if you Wait for the instant download";

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to figure out what Cowboys  Aliens is going to be. I'm not familiar with the comic book that it's based on but the film is definitely what the title has promised us. There are cowboys then there are aliens. If you are fond to Western movies then you'll be entertained but if you are expecting too much aliens then you might get disappointed. You won't be seeing anything mind blowing in this film. If you want to see SciFi action plus Western Violence then this film is just for you.Cowboys  Aliens is nothing but to entertain you. The only thing that is unique here is the Western  SciFi collaboration. The film is just your typical Western movie but instead of Indians or some sadistic bandit the aliens are the antagonist of the film. The aliens are pretty intriguing but we don't see them that much until the third act. It's disappointing if you are expecting too much aliens. The only things we see them do are ride their ships stab people shoot with their weapons  jump scare the audiences. It's also your typical alien invasion film.At least the action is full of explosions. Jon Favreau sure knows how to make the action scenes exciting no matter how flawed they are. The performances saved most of the film. Daniel Craig's character is actually bland in the script so does Olivia Wilde's but Craig's performance gives a little more character to the role. I don't know what to say about Olivia Wilde's she is just hot. Harrison Ford  Sam Rockwell do what they do best. Paul Dano can be both fun to watch and annoying at the same time.It's easy to recognize that the CGI effects were made by Industrial Light  Magic since the CGI aliens looks just like any monster from J.J. Abram's films. No doubt it's good. The score is true to its western themes. The production design is pretty decent enough for a western film.In the end Cowboys  Aliens is just another blockbuster released to our cinemas. I don't know if this film is going to be remembered years from now but I think the only purpose of this film is to show its gritty western violence and some scifi action. If you're expecting more than the title then you will be disappointed. If you are expecting more aliens than the cowboys then you'll be disappointed. Cowboys are the focus and the aliens end up being the jump scare of the movie. It's not bad nor good though. If you are careless about the story and the character development  you're just seeking for some sheer action and huge explosions then I can recommended this. But not quite.".

It's a recipe that doesn't necessarily sound that it would work but the direction of Jon Favreau with a story by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman works to grasp the audience.Characters are portrayed by all the actors with a touch of realism that's rare and perhaps because of the extra time the director's cut allows each character is made believable.Action scenes and it's certainly not short of them are fast paced but again the direction of Jon Favreau is excellent. Rather than the current trend of fast cuts where little is seen the action is visible to the viewer and as such better for it too.Overall an action film which has a strong plot with character development.

These days of action after fight after crash scene with little time for interaction between character to build on plot this film is a refreshing treat.".

	schema:headline " What Iron Man director Jon Favreau brings to this comic book adaptation is texture";
	schema:reviewBody "In the Old West a mysterious man Daniel Craig wakes up not knowing who or where he is. He's been wounded in the stomach and has a mysterious metal bracelet attached to his arm that he can't break off. After he escapes a group of bandits he rides back into town to heal up. But he brings attention to himself by taking out a thug named Percy Paul Dano. Suddenly people recognise the man as an outlaw named Jake Lonergan and he is knocked out by the mysterious Ella Swenson Olivia Wilde and winds up in a cell right next to Percy. When army Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde Harrison Ford learns that his son Percy has been locked up he rides into town with his men to free him. But the town is attacked by alien spaceships which capture by people by roping them up into their crafts. One of the people taken is the wife of bartender Doc Sam Rockwell. When it's noted that Jack's bracelet can shoot down the ships Woodrow insists that he comes with the group including Ella Doc and Nat Adam Beach an Indian to try and get their friends back. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy Cowboys and Aliens. It's a ridiculous concept melding the Western with science fiction and not one with any recent or memorable comparison. But importantly what Iron Man 2008 director Jon Favreau brings to this comic book adaptation is texture. It surprised me what a violent and grubby film this is. That means that it's not appropriate for small children but it does make for a more grounded Western. Out of all the ways to describe a movie called Cowboys and Aliens I never imagined I'd be using the word 'realistic'. But believe it or not the characters in this film look and feel like real cowboys hardened battlers of the frontier. Many of them are unshaven they drink too much and engage briefly in torture. In one scene a man is tied to two horses as his limbs are pulled in two different directions. Even the early brawls in this film are more involving and intense than we usually expect from films like this because they're shot cohesively and with some gravity. The cuts and the bruises here look real. I appreciated the attention to detail that Favreau decided to bring to this movie instead of easy self referencing. Any humour in this film arrives in just the right amount of doses. It never becomes a winking parody because the mood of this film and the performances play the concept straight. This allows the deadpan humour to come through more naturally mostly thanks to some fun supporting roles by Sam Rockwell and briefly Paul Dano. They seem to be having great fun with some of their dialogue and they're really enjoyable to watch and listen to. But the casting of Craig is particularly interesting. Robert Downey Jr. was originally was attached to the film because of the success he and Favreau shared with Iron Man. But Craig is I think a better fit for the movie. His weathered face and constant grimace evokes Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. He doesn't bring any of the smugness that Downey Jr. would have. That means that there's less jabs and winking at the source material. Instead Craig makes himself effortlessly cool by snarling lines like Demons took your gold. When you get to hell you can ask for it back. Harrison Ford is in grizzled form here and really chews the scenery as the battle hardened Colonel. There is a little more depth and warmth to his character because of his interactions with Nat while thankfully avoiding much of the schmaltz of Super 8 from earlier this year. Olivia Wilde is merely serviceable but at least slightly more active than most female roles in movies like this. These characters aren't as rich or romantic as the ones from Iron Man but they're tough and humorous enough to be a lot of fun. The aliens are the least interesting part of the movie. This is where the film loses a lot of its gravity. There's nothing particularly unique or interesting about the aliens. They have few weaknesses and not much personality. They're just after gold. And not having read the comic book I don't know if the aliens are meant to be symbolic or allegorical. Favreau is not interested in that aspect. Some of their sequences have a few jumpy scares which does add to the fun but others are just overdone or too farfetched. If you think the aliens are a stretch wait till you reach the Indian campfire ceremony. There's also a silly scene on top of a spacecraft and the last battle like so many of these films goes on far too long. That said the action is very slickly handled and violent and the actors are engaging. I think a lot of comic book and video game fans are going to love this film.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the Old West a mysterious man Daniel Craig wakes up not knowing who or where he is. He's been wounded in the stomach and has a mysterious metal bracelet attached to his arm that he can't break off. After he escapes a group of bandits he rides back into town to heal up. But he brings attention to himself by taking out a thug named Percy Paul Dano. Suddenly people recognise the man as an outlaw named Jake Lonergan and he is knocked out by the mysterious Ella Swenson Olivia Wilde and winds up in a cell right next to Percy. When army Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde Harrison Ford learns that his son Percy has been locked up he rides into town with his men to free him. But the town is attacked by alien spaceships which capture by people by roping them up into their crafts. One of the people taken is the wife of bartender Doc Sam Rockwell. When it's noted that Jack's bracelet can shoot down the ships Woodrow insists that he comes with the group including Ella Doc and Nat Adam Beach an Indian to try and get their friends back. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy Cowboys and Aliens. It's a ridiculous concept melding the Western with science fiction and not one with any recent or memorable comparison. But importantly what Iron Man 2008 director Jon Favreau brings to this comic book adaptation is texture. It surprised me what a violent and grubby film this is. That means that it's not appropriate for small children but it does make for a more grounded Western. Out of all the ways to describe a movie called Cowboys and Aliens I never imagined I'd be using the word 'realistic'. But believe it or not the characters in this film look and feel like real cowboys hardened battlers of the frontier. Many of them are unshaven they drink too much and engage briefly in torture. In one scene a man is tied to two horses as his limbs are pulled in two different directions. Even the early brawls in this film are more involving and intense than we usually expect from films like this because they're shot cohesively and with some gravity.

And it is interesting to listen to the comments of Costner about this movie. He was a major star but he waited and held up production of this movie a year so he could get WH. He didn't want anyone else and was willing to wait for her. He refused to interject a story line that would 'explain' the BlackWhite thing Bravo. And although BlackWhite pairings are fairly common now THEN for a major star to have a real black love interest  and an untested actress at that was a bold move. And it paid off. I don't know why he has not been as successful recently. The DVD interviews were done about 2 yrs ago and WH was still drug crazy so no interviews with her but Kevin Costner's last words in the interviews are about her and he said among other things that he would always love Whitney.

Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time.Trust me this is better than you think it is.The only problem is that the film is a bit too long to do what it has to do. I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion however once its all going its great.Get some popcorn your honey and enjoy.";

Let's face it who wants to see her acting when she can sing so beautifully? The unrelenting criticism by couch 'drama experts' of her acting seems a tad over the top. She never claimed to be an actress and despite this being her film debut she did not disgrace herself. She did the best she could with what she was given a patchy character with very little to say. What else could she do to play this role? Well just what she did sing her heart out.The best thing that Kevin Costner did was to insist that Whitney was the only one he wanted for this part. He knew he had a winner but he also tried to do too much with the story a romantic thriller with patches of 'comedy' a study in professionalpersonal conflict and 'who done it' thrown in. That's the reason for the plot's erratic turns and the non existent character development. The glue that holds the whole mess together is Whitney the singer looking stunning and sounding like an angel.This could have been a gigantic flop and instead it was a massive hit. It will remain a phenomenon in popular culture because it delivered what the vast majority of its audience wanted escapism a couple of hours away from their own reality and a look inside the glamorous life of a superstar. They were entertained by a great pop singer who had made a huge video clip for her songs and they did not mind paying for the privilege. Those who hate The Bodyguard went to see it with some unrealistic expectations of 'serious cinema and acting'?!

Instead the pair relied on a relaxed approach to their scenes to try and ignite some kind of genuine or uncontrollable passion. However I did not see any passion in the movie except for Houston's vocal numbers and perhaps I'll give it to the movie the kissing scene at the end of the picture before Houston's iconic rendition of I Will Always Love You an old country tune came bursting in at the credits.However the fact Houston essentially played herself in this movie demonstrated how much it lacked in believability I'm guessing the kind of message Costner and the producers were trying to put across was an unconventional love story. Instead the picture focused on Houston's vocals amazing mind you and that's what sold this movie to millions of fans.Costner knew what he was getting himself in for when he cast Houston as the lead  mega bucks. What I will take away from this movie  a positive  is giving Houston the opportunity to give the world some memorable ballads that will stand to the end of time as some of the greatest songs every recorded.".

	schema:headline " Adequate ThrillerRomance";
	schema:reviewBody "I was interested to note from your Trivia page that it was originally intended to make this film in the seventies with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the leading roles but that the film never got made because it was too controversial. The cause of the controversy was presumably the mixedrace loveaffair between Frank and Rachel as there is little else in the script that might upset anyone. The story centres around Frank Farmer a former Secret Service agent now working as a private bodyguard. He is hired by Rachel Marron an AfricanAmerican pop star who has been receiving death threats presumed to come from a mad stalker. Frank's obsessive concern with security initially alienates both Rachel and some of the other members of her entourage but after a number of misunderstandings he becomes first her friend and then her lover. He however is unhappy about becoming emotionally involved with a client and ends the affair. He would also like to end his employment with Rachel but she is becoming genuinely frightened for her own safety and he agrees to stay on to protect her when it is clear that she is in danger from an unexpected source.When I first saw this film in the cinema I disliked it. I was a great admirer of Kevin Costner's performance in Dances with Wolves and I went to see The Bodyguard in the hope that it would be a film of similar scope and vision. Of course it isn't but then it was never intended to be. Having seen it again recently on television I was rather more impressed than I had been the first time. There is a respectable performance from Costner as Frank a man who on the surface seems cold and detached but who hides his emotions under the surface not only his love for Rachel but also his feelings of guilt stemming from the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Frank was not on duty at the time in fact he was attending his mother's funeral but he cannot escape from the thought that if he had been present he could have prevented the President from being shot.Whitney Houston is a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice which was shown off to good advantage in this film. Her rendition of I Will Always Love You is one of the most haunting ballads I know far superior to the Dolly Parton original. Her character is supposed to be an actress as well as a singer the finale actually takes place as she receives a Best Actress award at the Oscars. Unfortunately it seems unlikely that Whitney will ever emulate her alter ego in this respect as her acting is certainly not in the same class as her voice. She seems to have too small an emotional range and it is no surprise that her subsequent film career has been so patchy. The Bodyguard is a perfectly adequate thrillerromance if at times too slowmoving but I felt that it might have been better with a more commanding female lead. 610".

I did read that Kevin Costner's part was originally written for Steve McQueen and he may've been able to pull it off. Note that K.C. has Steve's haircut. This is a demonstration that celebrity in one area doesn't necessarily to talent in another area. The film needs a female lead who can act and ol' Whitney ain't the gal for the job.".

I love many movies which are commonly referred to as Chick Flicks but this hunk of junk is too much for me. The soundtrack is pretty good. I don't know how I can stretch my comments to 10 lines. I did read that Kevin Costner's part was originally written for Steve McQueen and he may've been able to pull it off. Note that K.C. has Steve's haircut. This is a demonstration that celebrity in one area doesn't necessarily to talent in another area. The film needs a female lead who can act and ol' Whitney ain't the gal for the job.";

I would rather have seen oh...Halle Berry or some actress with real dynamism and dubbed voice getting mixed up with Kevin Costner.Kevin Costner is a fine actor who was absolutely doing his best Steve McQueen impression. Women love to see a powerful internally sensual man succumb to a woman so sensual or otherwise desirable that the poor guy's helpless. Costner is a powerful actor and few female actresses have that presence...Angelina Joli? Costner even was too powerful for Susan Sarandan in Bull Durham. I agree that second to the flat interaction of the main characters the story made little sense. If Frank Farmer had such a fragile ego that he could not come to terms with a tragic event he had nothing to do with he would not have been selected by the Secret Service in the first place.And what was the plan with taking the entourage to the lake? Were they going to live there indefinitely? Papa Walton by the way was miscast as Frank's father. He seemed to be ready to break into a smile at any moment or perhaps the corners of his mouth got caught on his dentures.The sister and son were very good. I liked the acting ability of both Fletcher was very subtle and sensitive in a film that wasn't.The Oscar scenes were funny. Anyone who saw Naked Gun 33 13 keeps expecting Mary Lou Retton to come flipping and bouncing down the aisle. Rachel's joking reason for risking her life in attending was ludicrous...you gotta cheer when Frank's stoic chastity appropriately caved if she was a Darwin award candidate her days were numbered anyway so why not? Actually I thought Whitney Houston's acting was fine she downplayed the role seemed rather shy and perhaps if there were more chemistry with the male lead she would have received less criticism. I would like to have seen Diana Ross and Steve McQueen they were equally matched dynamic folks.Oh well there are worse movies. Just because this one lacked chemistry motivation and sense doesn't make it half as bad as the remake of Lost Horizon...my overall standard of rotten films.And hey I thought Frank's haircut was sexy.".

You don't see a lot of chemistry these days like the one these two had they must of known they were meant for their parts because they were played so well under the circumstances. It's hard to make a decent movie when it's partly a musical. You have action  suspense  romance  and epic soundtrack rolled into one you think people would be happy? But no. It's either Whitney's acting is horrid or Kevin is too short. Well maybe he is but I still enjoyed their performances nonetheless.What I also liked about this movie was its heart. There were the lovable other body guards the cute kid the envious sister and intimacy like you've never seen! Call me immature but by the end I was gushing not crying simply gushing over their last passionate kiss goodbye. This film was made to be remembered a sort of time warp back to the 1990s when there weren't cell phones but soundtracks about real love and a lot of spandex as you will see in numerous outfits throughout the movie. In a nutshell I loved it. Fully recommend it because we all get those late night cravings for ultimate cheese and this wasn't so much as cheese as it was heartwarming butterflies in your stomach at least that's the feeling I got.

After safely out of the water the boat stops in the middle of the lake and blows up. Since neither Costner or Houston's characters had been in the boat or shown any interest in the boat the whole idea that someone would try to kill them by blowing it up made absolutely no sense at all.And what about the ridiculous attempt at romance which is obviously the whole point of the film? There is not one credible scene that explains either character's attraction for the other. None. So the reason for no chemistry between the two is that the idiot who wrote this didn't provide any dialog or staging to provide them with any motivation.So my advice is to buy a Whitney Houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise and then rent No Way Out which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious but far more plausible performance from Costner.".

But even with the soundtrack it still rounds out to a disappointing 2 out of 10.";

Second I don't think she is all that beautiful either with those lifeless eyes of hers and the bitchiness came way too easy for her.Kevin Costner looks good in clothes costumes but has the voice of a 15 year old boy. I've never liked any of his movies or his attempts at acting.Put these 2 together and voil an awful awful mess. Was the interracial love affair supposed to be daring in the 90s? Did Whitney get threatening letters for her performance in this thing as well as the character she played? Did Kevin go to Supercuts during a power blackout? We want to know.".

She hires a highpriced but excellent bodyguard Frank Farmer Kevin Costner. They hate each other at first but naturally fall in love. Utterly predictable and a real mess. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. First off Costner's haircut is terrible! Seriously it's so bad you look at it in amazement. I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in itbut that's still a stupid reason. The script is just lousyfull of terrible lines and the plot really doesn't make a lot of sense. The romantic sequences between Costner and Houston are so horribly written and acted that it's almost embarrassing. Purportedly Houston and Costner got along during the filming but they don't show any sparks on the screen. The acting doesn't help. Costner plays the movie with a blank expression on his face throughout but that DOES fit his character. Houston is a very beautiful woman and a fantastic singerbut she can't act. A few times I was actually smirking at her terrible attempts at acting. An overblown overdone mess of a movie. Very dull too.Also if you're seeing this for the music don't bother. Houston sings four songs that all became hits especially I Will Always Love You but you never hear the full versions of the songs in the movie! You might hear the beginning and middle but never the whole thing. Despite all this though audiences in 1992 loved it. It was a huge hit and was nominated for two Academy Awards for the music. So use your own judgment. Also Debbie Reynolds turns in a pointless cameo.".

The Bodyguard is a story that only appeals to one's emotions and never intellect or depth. This movie has a very weak script. The plot is just elongated with the spirit of your typical love story formula. And it touches on all the essential romantic buttons to have girls flocking to the theater. No it will never be heralded as a masterpiece and it even lacks the depth of movies like Love Story and The way we were. First off the pairing of Houston and Costner was unique and somehow drew you in. Houston plays herself pretty much the spoiled talented and exceptionally beautiful pop star. Costner plays the dry uptight and boorish professional bodyguard. They are both opposites but that is what makes the love story intriguing. Costner has been bashed for his boringness dullness and lack of charisma. He never really qualified as a leading man in my opinion. But here it somehow works because Houston's beauty was more revealing as a foil to his bland as goat milk persona. And Whitney Houston was at the height of her career and beauty in 1992 and Costner was at his prime as well. Intellectuals and film critics are more likely to be annoyed by this sappy and overblown love tale. But there are those that just can't help but be immersed in the romance intrigue of it. This is your rare and typical successful bad movie that ranks up there in the same phenomenon as Rambo Terminator 2 etc. Brainless films that just appeal to our senses and emotions.".

I don't want to give the game away so I'll leave it there!The film is a fast paced thrill ride that crosses the boundaries of action comedy romance farce and buddy movie amongst many other genres. The characters are likeable the humour is quick and snappy and the driving is fast and furious some of the best chases seen on screen for a few years. After a short while you barely realise that you are reading the subtitles. The storyline may not be particularly original but it is well executed overall.

	schema:reviewBody "Written by Luc Besson director of 'Lon' and 'The Fifth Element' this French film is funnier and with better action than most American blockbusters. It tells the story of Daniel Samy Naceri who starts as a taxi driver. He is an excellent driver but he never rides by the rules. With the police his taxi is famous although they have never caught him or even seen a license plate. One day Daniel takes a woman Camille Manuela Gourary to her home and she says she will keep his card to call again. She does when her son milien Frdric Diefenthal needs a ride. Daniel who thinks milien works with IBM of course disobeys all the rules and at the end of the ride milien reveals his true identity.Fortunately for Daniel the police has some trouble with a Mercedesgang. Bank robbers who even inform the police before they rob a bank with a Mercedes as the getaway car. Since Daniel knows much of cars he can help milien solve the case and keep his drivers license. milien desperately wants to solve this case because he wants to impress Petra Emma Sjberg the girl he is in love with but always looks down on him. Daniel agrees since his driving is his life. He has to miss a lot of quality time with his girlfriend Lilly Marion Cotillard for this.I agree with you if you say the story sounds familiar. That part is not very original although it has some original touches. Daniel for example was a pizza delivery boy before he started his job as a taxi driver and the early scenes that deal with this fact are a lot of fun to watch. But the story is not what 'Taxi' is about. It is about funny moments and some good action. I have to admit there are plenty of funny moments every scene between Daniel and Lilly is terrific the action looks good and the cinematography for this kind of movie is perfect. Although the character of Daniel can get on your nerves a little too much of a wise guy Samy Naceri does a nice job portraying him.In the end I enjoyed this movie very much. The clichs and simple choices sometimes the bad guy grabs his gun the minute milien reveals himself as a police officer who wants to ask some questions can not spoil the fun the movie has and therefore the audience. Don't expect a 'Lethal Weapon' but it is not that far from it.".

That part is not very original although it has some original touches. Daniel for example was a pizza delivery boy before he started his job as a taxi driver and the early scenes that deal with this fact are a lot of fun to watch. But the story is not what 'Taxi' is about. It is about funny moments and some good action. I have to admit there are plenty of funny moments every scene between Daniel and Lilly is terrific the action looks good and the cinematography for this kind of movie is perfect. Although the character of Daniel can get on your nerves a little too much of a wise guy Samy Naceri does a nice job portraying him.In the end I enjoyed this movie very much. The clichs and simple choices sometimes the bad guy grabs his gun the minute milien reveals himself as a police officer who wants to ask some questions can not spoil the fun the movie has and therefore the audience. Don't expect a 'Lethal Weapon' but it is not that far from it.";

Hollywood could do a lot worse than look over the Atlantic to see how car movies are made.

I'm not a fan boy but i do love this film. Although I do know that it is hard to find an English Dub I enjoyed this film in Russian. Russians tend to dub more French films then America.The story is of a useless cop who freezes when he gets behind a car's wheel and then on the other side we have Daniel who was a pizza legend driver of scooters until he finally got his taxi license and decided to become a taxi driver as the two meet in a lucky circumstances Daniel is forced work for milien. The two become friends in their struggle of having a social life and form a bond.The film has great chemistry between all of the actors and incredible driving scenes. in my opinion better filmed and better executed then the Fast and the furious films.If you get the chance to see this film either Subbed or Dubbed.".

The comedy is funny  the action is sharp and precise but the dialogue might be a little shaky and also there is an underdeveloped bonding plot which lets be honest not Luc Bessons best work. But where he success is seen is in the fact this is a fast paced action movie which is beautifully shot with that makes you realise that this is an cool action movie that makes Hollywood movies just look dull. A must see for both petrol heads and fans of action movies as well as foreign movies. When the french get it right ! they are spot on !".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew TAXI was a French film with a screenplay by Luc Besson but that was all I knew about it . I speculated that since it was written by Besson we'd be seeing a very violent thriller but that's not what TAXI turned out to be since it's an entertaining comedy Pizza delivery boy Daniel Morales drives his own unlicensed taxi and one day makes the mistake of driving  In his own illegal manner  Emilien to his place of work which is bad news for Daniel because Emilien is a police inspector . Daniel is given the choice of helping the police catch a bunch of German bank robbers dubbed  The Mercedes Gang  or lose his driving license Did I say this was entertaining ? It's also very likable and much of that's down to Besson's screenplay which is devoid of the sometimes sickening violence which did spoil for me NIKITA and LEON and they only hint that it was written by Besson being the fact that policemen are stupid . You do get the impression from all of his movies that Besson has a pathological dislike of cops but thankfully he doesn't get too polemical this time . Director Gerard Pires complements the screenplay by casting two young and likable actors in the lead roles There are a couple of flaws to TAXI . While being the chase and crash sequences are well directed it's unlikely cars flip up into the air as seen here . There's also a plot hole in that if the cops know where the raids are going to take place they don't bring in helicopter surveillence  but again being a Besson script the police are portrayed as being terminally stupid so I don't know if it's a plot hole as such . One thing that did annoy me is Daniel and Emilien sharing a joint which is a scene that certainly wasn't needed in the filmBut I saw several films the day I saw this and TAXI was undoubtedly the best movie I saw that day . It's not too difficult to see why the French film industry has been so successful over the years".

That made me sad and meant that the video release would be postponed. And so it was and only in February 2001 I managed to see the movie I was longing to see. What to say? It was magic I never seen a movie with such an ability to pass its goodhumored face to its viewers. I loved it the movie is light only a hour and a half which makes us actually want to see more fastpaced simple but effective. The chase scenes are out of this world and beat the hell out of for example Gone in Sixty Seconds. This proves that the french can do it and with much better results although the plot is paper thin you won't really care when you see it since you'll marvel at everything Daniel's engaging personality Emilien's cool silliness the titular Taxi which will make your jaw drop with its passive  agressive beauty and that amazing finale which made me rewind and see it again. Taxi is a movie which needs no intrincate studies or analysis just watch it and get drunk on the laughter and goodnature it inspires. I watched this with my friends two times in a day and never has a movie done this.

Luc Besson is not a name that inspires that much confidence given the terrible Leon lacklustre Fifth Element and excreble Joan of Arc but this is an absolute humdinger of a movie for its genre. Clearly Besson is happier with just a pen than when in overall control because this film excels in every way. The script is great both packed with one liners and tightly and often hilariously plotted. I confess could only keep up with the subtitles  the characters talk like machine guns if you're not used to colloquial French  but the dialogue really sparkled.The cast of unknowns are also spot on. Samy Naceri and   Frdric Diefenthal are a great double act as Daniel the savvy sexy speed demon taxi driver and Emilien the handsome but hapless nondriving cop. Marion Cotillard is drool inducing as Daniel's long suffering girlfriend Lilly and the aptly named Bernard Farcy is excellent as the prejudiced police chief with a penchant for stupid operation monikers.The film is very tightly shot with plenty of action car chases and the like but the witty script and great performances make it far more than your standard actioner. It also boasts a kicking soundtrack and some great set pieces. I cannot overemphasise how impressive this film is and it's a crying shame that being French it isn't more widely appreciated.".

	schema:headline " One of my favourite movies of alltime";
	schema:reviewBody "Finally a movie worth the full price of a ticket! Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's semiautobigraphical story of an aspiring rock journalist who goes on tour with a band in the 1970's. If it sounds familiar it's probably because the story is hardly new. There have been dozens of movies made about the rock and roll lifestyle the drugs the sex the fights and all the bumps on the road to success.So what sets Almost Famous apart? The acting for one. Frances McDormand was brilliant as William's newcomer Patrick Fugit wellmeaning but overbearing mother. Fugit for his part had a convincing performance as the shy awkward teenager struggling to be a journalist but at the same time aching to belong. Kate Hudson in her breakout role as groupie Penny Lane gave her character depth beyond what might have been a limiting role. And Billy Crudup as band Stillwater's charismatic lead guitarist shines. Jason Lee is always good and as Stillwater's lead singer this role is no exception. And I can't review this film without giving a shoutout to the chronically and criminallyunderrated Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals every scene he's in with his portrayal of legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs.The writing in the film also contributes to its effect. Many of the great lines belong to McDormand but there are plenty of others to go around. In addition the music of the era can't be beat. Everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Alvin and the Chipmunks shows up at some point in the movie's extensive musical score.The plot may not be particularly original but it rings true. I of course am approaching this review as a music fan and someone interested in the industry. Nonetheless I believe that even people who couldn't care less about rock music will enjoy this movie since it's not so much about the music as it is about life. A central theme is the conflict of William Should he remain a detached but lonely outsider so as to be an impartial journalist or allow himself to make friends with these people and feel like he belongs? Aside from bringing up questions of journalistic ethics this dilemma mirrors much of what people in all wakes of life deal with daily.Almost Famous is realistic funny touching and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. It's too bad that they say rock and roll is dead cause we could sure use more movies like this one!".

	schema:headline " Crowe knows what it is love some little piece of music so much that it hurts";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a by now wellknown scene early on in ALMOST FAMOUS when William Miller is poring through the records his older sister Anita has left behind for him since she ran off from home.  Inside the album cover of The Who's TOMMY she leaves William a note telling him to listen to this with a candle lit and he'll be able to see his future.  He puts on the record Sparks comes on and the look on his face as he listens is the look every rock fan will recognize.There's been tons of stuff written about rocknroll music from those who think like William's mother Elaine that it's a corrupting influenceor those who go even farther and consider it the devil's music to those who insist the music is meaningless and to take it seriously smacks of pretension because it's only music.  And then there are people like Cameron Crowe who recognize rocknroll and the music which came in its wake is the shared experience of many people starting from the 1950's in the way maybe that plays and earlier types of music were in centuries before.  Sure there's television and movies as well but rock music is shorter and more direct.  And sure it can just be fun and a way to cut loose once in a while but it's also something which can speak to what we love what we long for what we're afraid of what we think what wounds us inside and so much more.Because Crowe is a fan he's able to capture all of this in his movie.  It's not just in the obvious moments like the people on the tour bus singing along to Elton John's Tiny Dancer which lifts them out of their black mood or singer Jeff Bebe leading everybody into singing On the Cover of Rolling Stone when he learns he and his fellow bandmates will be on the cover.  It's in the wild spirit of people like Sapphire one of the BandAidsread groupies who follow the band Stillwater and others as they tour the U.S. or in the more tender spirit of someone like her sister BandAid Penny Lane who believes she and the other BandAids serve as a muse to bands like Stillwater and who soaks in all of her experiences like a sponge.  It's also in William who trieslike Crowe did to balance reporting with his very obvious love for the music.  And it's especially in the line I quoted from at the top which Sapphire says to Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond late in the movie.  To be sure the road of rocknroll isn't all covered in roses.  There's outrageous behaviorlike how Russell treats Penny or William losing his virginity to three of the groupies drugs excess and yes pretensionlike when Jeff lectures Penny about the power of rocknroll and then adds And the chicks are cool right?  But those who wanted this to be more like THIS IS SPINAL TAP are missing the point.  This isn't a movie about the obvious problems and silliness in rock music.  It's about what still draws people to it and though Crowe acknowledges these people's faults he still loves them for who they are.Of course there's a lot more reasons why ALMOST FAMOUS is a great movie besides its love of rocknroll.  It's well acted across the boardin addition to all the performances mentioned several times I'd like to highlight Fairuza Balk as Sapphire not only does she get the best line in the moviealong with Frances McDormand's Don't take drugs! and Rock stars have kidnapped my son with that line about musicI also like what she and the other groupies yell as they're about to deflower William Death to Opie! but she also captures the carefree spirit of the time.  She may not be important plot wise but if you took her character out the movie would be missing something it's a terrific comingofage story it's a bittersweet love story the dialogue is great and it looks terrific.  But it's Crowe's obvious love for the music and for the people who love it that makes ALMOST FAMOUS the best thing I've seen so far this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen a few comingofage films and a few prodigycumgenius type films and of course more than my share of romantic comedy stuff.  This film skirts between the lines of all those possibilities and somehow manages to find its way to the viewer intact deftly and with a whole lot of oldfashioned charisma.The acting was honest true to how people behave without getting schmaltzy or overdramatic.  Cameron Crowe gets these actors to all project a belief in themselves and bring that across in a way that we care about what happens to them.  I particularly liked the rendition of William Miller by Patrick Fugit who steals the show as the precocious rocknroll journalist.  He evokes visions of a young Matthew Broderick or a wideeyed Michael J. Fox without ever getting corraled into being the cute but troubled young kid.Frances McDormand is amazing and wellcast as Elaine the Mom someone so wrapped up in creating a safe healthy environment she drives both her children far away from home.Billy Crudup  Kate Hudson create the tension filled romance that drives the story along both did a great job  were adroitly evocative of those fast times in the rock  roll fantasyland of the 70's.  Billy as Russell Hammond teeters on the edge of fame not wanting to leave his longsuffering bandmates behind but being courted as the band's star by the record company is palpably torn.  He carries William through the whirlwind of emotions and music along with him showing him a world that is desperate and lonely even with the whole world seemingly vying for his attention. His casting is also very clever seeing as how Billy Crudup also sits on the brink of his own stardom  acclaim in real life.Lester Bangs is William's 'guru' played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  A walking oxymoron he exudes a callous arrogance and at the same time expresses genuine affection for the upandcomer sometimes giving William the exact advice he needs to get him through the toughest moments as a rock critic  dealing with the lovehate relationships they seem to engender with everyone in their world of music.I can't say enough about the awesome casting job as well as the very detailed set design costuming  realism to the times.  Period pieces are usually difficult to do well Mr. Crowe did this one genuine and good.A truly great film one that I'd heartily recommend to all but the most jaded rock critics.".

	schema:headline " An Excellent Original Insight Into The 70's Rock Scene... With Dazzling Performances.";
	schema:reviewBody "There was a time in the US rock circuit before music videos and online marketing. That was the time when several littleknown bands toured all over the country... accompanied mostly by drugs and groupies. Writerdirector Cameron Crowe takes us to that infamous scene of sex drugs and rock n' roll in the 1970's with this semiautobiographical work which is not only equipped with his brilliant direction and screenplay but also by decent performances by some relatively lesserknown actors.Here the introduction of a nottoofamous band an imaginary one called Stillwater was important. In that sense Stillwater is a perfect work by Crowe... with a volatile relationship between the vocalist and the guitarist with a noncompetent manager and everything that comes with. There were also the groupies who became a matter of substance in Crowe's point of view. But the most extraordinary thing that Crowe did is the image of himself as a 15yearold writing prodigy rock journalist William Miller. The viewers watch the movie through Miller's eyes. The character is extremely welldesigned and reserved by Crowe. Miller's the one who becomes able to attach all the parts into a complete movie alone.Billy Crudup was probably the best among the actors as guitarist Russell Hammond. It's true his role was not a tough one but he's the one who made it look so easy. Young Kate Hudson as Penny Lane is perfect and very adorable. She showed her potentials in this movie which seemed even better than her mother Goldie Hawn. All she needs are decent roles in future. The other actors namely Jason Lee as vocalist Jeff Frances McDormand as Williams's overprotective mother and the other bandaids with Oscarwinner Anna Paquin performed also quite well. And newcomer Patrick Fugit as Miller himself is really brilliant. Gaining more screen time than anyone else it was a tough test for Fugit and it is all praises for him.The soundtrack was very good with some fine original songs. There may be some minor flaws in the movie like some unnecessary sequences but all over this is a quite masterful work... a feast for the mind and soul both for a hard rock n' roll fan and for casual viewers.".

Almost Famous is a stunning thoughtprovoking film that comes at you directly from the eye of the camera and hits you with a hard bang. It's a movie not only for people who love 70's rock bands but for all moviegoer's who really love the feeling of coming out of the cinema feeling totally fulfilled.A 15 year old boy named William Miller Patrick Fugit gets an opportunity to travel with a rock band Stillwater on a 1973 tour. As a younger boy his sister Zooey Deschanel and his widowed mother Elaine Frances McDormand had fought about the mother's control over the family and her denial of rock music. The sister leaves home and leaves the young boy her record collection which immediately seizes his attention. As a teen he makes record reviews for an underground newspaper. He submits those to Creem magazine writer Lester Bangs Phillip Seymour Hoffman and gets his attention. The two become fast friends and Bangs acts as his mentor as Rolling Stone magazine comes calling. Slipping into an inner group connected with Stillwater Rolling Stone agrees to bankroll him on a trip with the group. There he meets the Band Aids a group of girls that refuse to be called groupies because they are dedicated only to specific bands. Penny Lane Kate Hudson the Band Aid's leader is enamored with the group leader Billy Crudup but befriends the teen. He responds with complete infatuation with her but he is equally enamored with the charismatic guitarist. While accepted by the band other members are Jason Lee John Fedevich and Mark Kozeleck they nonetheless refer to him as the enemy  a rock critic.The film is classically cool and endlessly enjoyable making it by far one of the top 5 movies of last year. The film boasts absolutely incredible performances Patrick Fugit is a newcomer and has terrific potential Frances McDormand is emotionally stunning as an overprotective mother and Billy Crudup who I underrated at first gives a performance of believability and power. However it comes as no surprise that the film's acting star is Kate Hudson daughter of Goldie Hawn. Hudson gives a masterful performance as Penny Lane she pulls off all Lane's facial expressions effortlessly brilliantly and God knows she is one of the most stunning young performers of her current time and she gives one of the most memorably exciting performances of 2000. Cameron Crowe gets a big pat on the back too for arranging the movie delicately and with absolute dedication.Cameron Crowe's instant classic is a hard one to beat and is surely the closest thing we have to a perfect rock movie' these days. Absolutely unmissable.".

It means so much to me personally cinematographically visuallyIt means so much when it comes to acting and wonderful performances when it comes to fantastic original screenplays that come from a person's mind without being taken from anything we already know.This was probably one of the first movies to ever blow me away. When I was getting and idea of what cinema meant and which where the good films this one left me impressed for more than a week. The same occurred later with Traffic The Truman Show Big Fish and others. It was with this film that I understood that to like a movie it has to mean something to you besides meaning something for the ones who did it or the ones involved in it.It meant something for me mainly because of the music. It was during the main credits written by hand in a paper that I felt something but then when William's Patrick Fugit sister Anita Zooey Deschanel leaves the house to become a stewardess and tells him Look under your bed it will set you free I was introduced to a new world.William's mother Elaine an excellent Frances McDormand raised him and her sister forbidding them to use bad words making them go to school making them religious but most importantly not letting them listen to rock music. This all changes when William plays The Who's Tommy a the light of a candle. Some years later he is writing rock articles and he knows enough to talk with the best music critic in the United States Lester Bangs a brilliant and Oscarcaliber supporting performance by the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman.They talk for a while and the critic says Well I've got to go I can't spend my whole day talking to my fans. But then with a lot of intelligence a camera shoots a restaurant and they are both still talking. Bangs gives the kid an assignment to write about Deep Purple. The kid goes to the concert in his home town and tries to enter backstage saying he's a reporter of Creem.His multiple attempts fail and he is called by some girls who are laughing constantly. These are the Band Aids and that is the moment in the film during which I fell in love with Kate Hudson. She plays Penny Lane although that's not her real name the girl who said women should be with musicians just for the love of the music not sex or free rides.She plays her as an enigmatic and mysterious person who actually is lost and doesn't know or have another place to be in. And I'm talking personally about one of the best performances I've witnessed in my whole life. This personal list of best performances is short and Hudson's Penny Lane is in it and she deserved an Oscar for it and many will agree.Because of how life goes William stays alone outsideUntil Stillwater arrives the kid uses his musical knowledge and he is inside backstage before he knows it. Then before we know he forgets about Deep Purple he is touring with Stillwater and writing an article for Rolling Stone magazine that could be considered for the cover and William is only 15 years old.During the tour I felt what they called the buzz. It was very inspiring to watch the band each of its members all the time with a guitar in their hands. Sometimes they were playing together sometimes each of them was doing his own things. There were pianos and keyboards in each room they stepped foot in there were good and bad live moments just as good offstage moments and horrible fights probably mended with just singing Tiny Dancer.Music is the main factor as this band travels through the country. All of the members of the band we get to identify but the one that obligatorily highlights is the guitarist Russell Hammond played superbly by Billy Crudup. The lead singer is also important and he is played by a longhaired Jason Lee with the guts of a rock persona.The regretful moments we can't be without...Like Russell's party in Topeka and his last lines if he would die I'm on drugs or the plain about to crash and confessions like I'm gay. This was all perfectly crafted by the hand of Cameron Crowe's peaceful camera and the fantastic screenplay he wrote going back in time to his own similar experience. The man got the best from Tom Cruise that's already a lot and Almost Famous is his legacy a gem and one of the best films I've seen in my life.".

He follows a rock band called Stillwater much to mom's dismay played well by Frances McDormand on a Almost Famous tour with rockers groupies and bandaids. Real sweetness comes when the worlds of Miller and the band combine and dramedy kicks in.  Quite the Crowe picture one of his best ones that takes a look at the days of rock when it was still cool to do drugs have sex and be cool singing Elton John in a bus that scene was the highlight.  Band members include Billy Crudup Jason Lee and others including Fairuza Balk Anna Paquin and in a exceptional performance the free spirited Penny Lane played by Kate Hudson.  This film is definately in my top 25 list of the year.  A".

	schema:reviewBody "'Almost Famous' based on director Cameron Crowe's own experiences as a writer is a formidable piece of work. It can be viewed as a comingofage story a study of a 'collage' of characters mixed into a wonderful story or a love story. Crowe smoothly tells his story about William's love for rock music his curiosity and excitement towards the world of rockstars and rock music his relationship with the musicians and the Bandaids his relationship with his mother and sister. He's put a lot of heart into the making of this dream ? project and clearly shows a deep understanding for rock and roll. What makes 'Almost Famous' different from other rock movies is that it doesn't solely focus on drugs sex etc. Sure they are there but there's a whole lot more going on both good and bad. Crowe shows us what attracts people to the world of rock.Every single actor does nothing short of a great job. Even those with limited screentime such as Zooey Deschanel and Fairuza Balk are outstanding. Of course the superb dialogues also help richen the characters but the dialogue delivery is up to the actors. Kate Hudson is stunning and fits her part like a glove. She is amazing with the subtle expressions and shares a wonderful chemistry with her costars. Crudup is brilliant as the guitarist who's under the impression that he's loved by everyone and that he's the best. Hoffman Lee and Taylor are very good. McDormand is sublime. One can't help but love this character. And last but not least Fugit as William Miller effortlessly pulls off the character's awkwardness and initial unease to losing his virginity falling in love and understanding it all.As mentioned earlier Crowe's writing is just fantastic. It would have been easy to make Elaine Miller a caricature antirock and roll mother or Anita Miller as the momhating rebellious teen but Crowe just gave enough attention to writing all the characters well enough. The dialogues make the screenplay more unique e.g. the scene where Elaine Miller screams out of the car to her son Don't do Drugs or the turbulent scene where the Rockband confess. The soundtrack itself is a 'mustbuy'.There's a lot more that I can write about but I'll just stop here. Those who think 'Almost Famous' is nothing different from other rock movies then they just missed the point. It's funny it's got drama it's got wonderful characters great music it's rock and roll!".

	schema:headline " Its Honest About Its Own Dishonesty";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's Crowe's film about his own struggle between whether to write a puff piece to entertain and the incisive truth to stimulate inform extend. The focus is also the method as the film itself is not at all true or insightful.Instead what we have is a very wellwritten mostly competently executed feelgood story. Along the way we have lovable characters and situations pulled from the stock catalog. I liked an equivalent raw competence in Autumn in New York but there they weren't dishonest.The dishonesty here is in the glossy romanticizing of the end of the rock era. GenXers who weren't there want to feel that it was all rather harmless so they couldn't have missed much important with their inconsequential music fads. Boomers the real rock generation don't want to be reminded that they balked upon being led to the cusp of a revolution. So the movie has a constituently for romanticizing rock while castrating its power. America has a tradition of doing this to the past beginning with Native Americans who we disarm by nobilizing.Crowe knows this  he is after all here to push buttons and make money. But he is also an intelligent man so has referenced his dilemma with his two alter egos the kid and the Hoffman character. This latter small role makes this film worth seeing because it is explicitly selfreferential. The reflection is the infilm characterization of the film as superficial.Hoffman is a wonderful actor and the role is exquisite touching both on the issue of real journalism merciless contrasting with celebrity here codified as cool. Starting around then journalism was turned to the manufacturing of coolness outside the film industry and Rolling Stone was the main pimp sort of the Microsoft of cultural vapidity. Hoffman's character remains true and though Crowe himself has sold out taking the Rolling Stone route he's honest enough to know and be explicit about it. For that I tip my hat.Some few things in the film rang true we really did think that this music could set you free even Simon and Garfunkle but not Elton John!. The stewardess costumes really were that dolllike. I appreciated the Eastern Airlines dressage but it should have been on a 727 not a modern DC10. Creem was indeed studied but why not mention the more merciless and honest Crawdaddy?.Some few things rankled. The airplane scene was just amaturish. McDormand's character was too onedimensionally daft for this sometimes excellent actress. Drugs and misogyny were almost absent in this rosey story. It would have helped to describe why the world thought southern rock groups could revive genuine rock and how that hope grew out of latent racism. A character reveals he is gay but that word nor any not derogatory would not have been used then. We miss the often cruel harem politics that stressed the camp followers' alliances.You can have Kate Hudson and overlong fawning on her grin. I'll eagerly await Hoffman's next film though.".

The focus is also the method as the film itself is not at all true or insightful.Instead what we have is a very wellwritten mostly competently executed feelgood story. Along the way we have lovable characters and situations pulled from the stock catalog. I liked an equivalent raw competence in Autumn in New York but there they weren't dishonest.The dishonesty here is in the glossy romanticizing of the end of the rock era. GenXers who weren't there want to feel that it was all rather harmless so they couldn't have missed much important with their inconsequential music fads.

	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersI enjoyed this film to a large extent because of its uniqueness. The only other film I've seen about a rock group on tour is Beijing Rocks 2001 which is although a decent production not quite in the same league. Rock  Roll to me is Elvis Prestley and Donny Osmond why on earth Donny? you ask the answer is the 'Donny  Marie Show' so there you go. I do enjoy the music in AF but clearly not with the intense passion a lot of people in the audience would have. The structure of the story line is quite fascinating a 15yearold budding rock magazine writer following a notquitefirstline rock group on tour thereby giving us some interesting insight into what the entire business is about. The 'band aids' a group of superfans forming a further attachment to the group add another fascinating dimension. I can't help asking myself though if the depiction of the rock group is a little bit on the 'mild' side. The band leader Russell portrayed lovingly by Billy Crudup who later played a somewhat underrated role in Big Fish comes across more like a boy scout leader.Kate Hudson portraying an ultradevoted 'band aid' Penny Lane was good enough for an Oscar supporting nomination. Hudson is a versatile actress capable of many different roles but Penny Lane is the most Goldie Hawnish character she has ever attempted. In AF there are a few shots in which she can almost be mistaken for her mother. While on Oscar supporting actress AF had two nominations the other being Frances McDormand I'll come to her later. Neither won as the Oscar went to Marcia Gay Harden in 'Pollock'. Although I have not seen Pollock I know how good Harden can be. She was nominated again last year for Mystic River and in my view could have beaten Zellweger Cold Mountain had she not already got one. But I digress.The best thing about AF to me are two topnotch artists. I've mentioned Frances McDormand playing the young writer's protective mother who has a best actress Oscar from Fargo. The other is Philip Seymour Hoffman playing what can be loosely described as his mentor who is good enough for an Oscar in Owning Mahowny. It's really a scandal that he wasn't even nominated. With these two around any picture is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2000 writer director Cameron Crowe rocked audiences worldwide with his semiautobiographical portrait of a 15 year old commissioned as a rock journalist for Rolling Stone magazine to profile one of the nation's hottest up and coming bands the fictional Stillwater while accompanying them on tour. While doing so he discovers much more about the whole environment and world of music as well as more about himself and the state of the world in general. This kind of a tale in the hands of a different director might have come across as an overly sentimental rant but no one was born to tell this story than Crowe who essentially lived the life of William Miller during his adolescence. Because the movie is so closely based on his own truelife experiences the film shines in the realism department. One literally gets the feel of being right there catapulted into the 70s rock music scene as if trailing behind Miller as his invisible friend or something along those lines. The film isn't necessarily constructed in a typical Hollywood fashion but instead seems much more like a chronicle a journal entry brought to life. As such the storyline may seem a bit jumpy and certain parts may seem underdeveloped or missing bits but in a way this also only adds to the journal entry feel of the film as if Miller only bothered to remember the parts of his story that were the most graphic or outstanding so it's only a minor criticism. But what really makes the film excel apart from Crowe's spectacularly believable narrative and excellent screenplay is the soundtrack pumped full of old rock and roll classic hits such as The Who Led Zeppelin Jimi Hendrix Deep Purple and Elton John than any self respecting rock fan should be belting out the lyrics along with. Crowe has a tendency for choosing excellent soundtracks and Almost Famous is perhaps the best example the superb selection of songs truly cementing the feel and groove of the period so to speak as well as all the pitch perfect costumes and outrageous outbreaks of facial hair which truly scream Seventies. Adding to the foray of talent the superb cast really bring Crowe's sentimental source material to life in a truly vivid and memorable fashion. Newcomer Patrick Fugit is wonderful in an understated yet charismatic fashion as William Miller Crowe's film counterpart the young idealistic rock journalist who finally gets his big break. Billy Crudup gives a superb performance as the band's guitarist in many ways the stereotypical rock star yet far too well written and grounded in realistic quirks and mannerisms to be passed off as such. Similarly the always terrific Jason Lee is great and often hilarious as Stillwater's lead singer. Kate Hudson is luminous as mysterious Band Aid Penny Lane. She seems to be a beacon of shining light amidst the dark and sleazy world of music sex drugs and alcohol easily deserving her Golden Globe win. Notorious scene stealer Philip Seymour Hoffman arguably walks off with the show with a simply wonderful and inspiring as the world weary yet inspiring writer Lester Bangs Hoffman's brief appearances are so injected with charisma and likability one can't help but take to his character. Look also for brief appearances by Anna Paquin as a fellow Band Aid Zooey Deschantel as Miller's rebellious sister who introduces him to rock and roll and Jimmy Fallon as Stillwater's new manager. Almost Famous is above all else one of the most believable films in recent history. Crowe seems to transport us right back to the crazy hazy days of the mid 70s where everyone searched for significance and meaning in the mundane. But Almost Famous is so much more than simply a story about a band it is a charming and insightful commentary on the state of the period's youth and an entertaining coming of age story as well. For those who have yet to see it Almost Famous is an experience well worth delving into it may end up sticking with you quite a long time.910".

He is coached by the legendary Lester Bangs who is wonderfully played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Rolling Stone has offered him a cover and is funding his tour with Stillwater. Stillwater is a proletarian hard rock band apparently based on the Allman Brothers that has just begun to make it big.What this film does brilliantly is to situate the viewer in its action. The film is shot from the perspective of a relatively clearheaded fifteenyearold  our protagonist is too good to be true some of his experiences are just a bit fantastic and the love triangle between Fugit Crudup and Hudson has magic around its edges. Yet the whole film has an almost voyeuristic truthful feel to it. Notably this is all done with thirdperson perspective so the manipulations are barely noticeable.The performances are great allaround with Crudup McDormand Lee and others playing the archetypal characters of the 1970s to the hilt  rock stars wellintentioned but somewhat oppressive moms and groupies. Fugit and Hudson are removed from their time and context through the timelessness of the theme they share  the honest love of two good friends who respect each other too much to allow their friendship to develop into something potentially destructive. The uniquely REAL bond between these two stands in bold relief against the backdrop of unreal delusional and pretentious relationships created by drugs celebrity and the road.The photographic technique is so subtle that it is difficult to make yourself aware of it. The script is more or less flawless and the pace of the film is fine  neither too brisk nor plodding.Though autobiographical this film doesn't fit solidly into any specific category. It's mostly a coming of age story but has forceful elements of road movie romantic comedy and period piece. There is also some confusion about what the film is about. Some say its about rock and roll. I disagree but I think my disagreement stems from the fact that of all of this films elements rock and roll is one of the one's which interest me least. Upon reflection however I can also say that the critique the film offers of the '1970s scene' in rock is deadon accurate and more truthful than many of the other films I have seen which claim to represent it The Filth and The Fury being one of the better exceptions.I guess we'll stick with the catchall  drama. In short this is a wellmade thoughtful and entertaining film which can be enjoyed from a number of different perspectives even if you're not a big fan of its general themes. Recommended.".

The songs are great the scenery are great and especially the direction of this movie is way beyond any I've seen this year. It rocks your brain and just seeps through the arteries and live there. Up in your head you will still remember this film no matter how many years pass by. It relates itself to you so good you have become what you always wanted to be for at least 5 seconds. Thats why they call it Almost Famous. We all are.Something rare and original that is truly worth a watch. You will never find any other film like it. These are pure emotions. 910.".

Once upon a time films like Almost Famous were the minimum you could expect from a major release. Now it shines like a lighthouse beacon on a rocky shore. Do not get me wrong I enjoyed this flick but there is nothing particularly memorable or outstanding about it. I was in high school during the era depicted and it does a good job of evoking the flavor and fashions of those times. It is a nostalgic look back at a period when rock music was still fresh and not yet being used to sell beer and cars. But the plot was thoroughly predictable and everyone was so NICE that I almost fell asleep. Gotta love that Dream Team of 'bandaids' though  Fairuza Balk has never been hotter!!".

If only Lester Bangs could come back from the grave and trash this movie which converts the music he was so passionate about into slick Hollywood crap.The fictional band Stillwater embodies none of the qualities that drew people to the rocks stars of the late sixties and early seventies they are selfcentered hedonistic inarticulate brain dead hacks whereas real rock stars of the period such as Led Zeppelin The Who and the Rolling Stones may have been selfcentered and hedonistic but they were so brilliant musically and conceptually and so charismatic that they were almost worthy of the idolatry the characters in the movie lavish with no sense of irony on the filmmaker's part on the idiots in Stillwater.Why Rolling Stone would have any interest in Stillwater the dullest band either real or fictional in history let alone want to put them on the cover is beyond me. And I'd like to think that magazine editors actually meet writers before they hire them and don't assign cover stories to 15yearolds they've never met over the phone. How thrilled BenFong Torres is when he reads William's warts and all' article is the movie's most jaw dropping moment of many bad ones. To think that rock stars took drugs and had sex with groupies! That news really would have turned the world upside down in 1973.Kate Hudson seems far too wholesome to be convincing as an experienced groupie and the acclaim she's received for this role is inexplicable. Plus her character is an utter ditz. The poor thing is actually in love with the guitar player and crushed that he doesn't feel the same way. To think that rock stars thought of groupies just as sex objects! Another earth shattering revelation from Cameron Crowe! The fact that groupies' attraction to rock stars' money and fame is just as superficial as rock stars' attraction to groupies' bodies is somehow beyond Crowe's grasp.Frances McDormand's character was shrill and one note the sex was unsexy and I would say that the situations the rock stars were in were cliched but they didn't even rise to the level of clich. This movie was even worse than Jerry  Maguire' another meandering fiasco without a single original idea and is the last Cameron Crowe movie I will ever see.".

He meets rock journalist Lester Bang who gives him a chance to write a piece on a rock band which leads for a break with Rolling Stone thanks to his links with up and coming rock band Stillwater. Despite being out of his depth William follows the band through fights shows and relationships while also finding himself getting older by the day.I didn't really take to this when I saw it trailed in the cinemas in 2000 and didn't bother to go and see it. Years later though I decided to give it a go and although I enjoyed it I must say that the personal approach by Crowe didn't totally win me over. It doesn't help that I wasn't around in the period he is remembering so I can't really relate to the people and the times but it still makes for a good time because during the film I felt like I could. This is what he does well  he brings the audience with him and it overcomes the problem of this being his story and allows it to be more than that. As it is it is a very good story that captures the period pretty well but not at the expense of the characters which is where the film takes place.Fugit brings out Miller really well and serves as our eyes into this world in the same way of course as Crowe does. He is supported well by Hudson who is convincing as Penny and makes a lot of the narrative work. Crudup Lee and the rest of the band have simpler roles but they do well with them and again help support the period and make the narrative convincing. Support from McDormand Deschannel Paquin and others only adds to the feeling of an ensemble cast  even if it isn't really.Overall this was a personal but an enjoyable film. It produce a good sense pf place and time while also creating a story that engaged and characters that it was easy to become interested in. Crowe's personal touch didn't totally sell it to me but mostly he uses it well and prevents it becoming a burden for the film to carry. Perhaps not worthy of the hype and vast praise that it has garnered it is certainly an enjoyable film that does what it does well.".

There's comedy slight drama and a lot of action from cowboys to the outer space.Great writing and great acting.Really there's nothing to complain. It's just a very entertaining family movie which we don't get a lot these days.I recommend Bedtime Stories to any Disney fans and also to anyone who'd enjoy Adam Sandler's movies minus the sexual and dirty jokes.";

We were a bit apprehensive about this due to the poor critics ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. Frankly the critics gave it abysmal ratings and I almost avoided this entirely because of those ratings. And perhaps they were right. But I know that despite the critics we all enjoyed it greatly. Maybe it was just the mood we were all in or the good meal we just had before the movie but we laughed throughout. Obviously there is no highbrow humor here or social commentary to be made. It's just a movie who's sole purpose is simply to have fun. Cookie cutter? Perhaps. In fact in retrospect I'm sure it was. But it was still enjoyable.So if your looking for something more than what you see in the previews forget it. It isn't happening. This movie makes no pretenses about what it is exactly about good fun. If your looking for anything other than that you're going to be disappointed.On the down side some of the best moments were captured in the previews. While this certainly isn't the first movie to this not the last I'm sure it always seems to take something away from the experience of watching the movie. But there were plenty of other twists and turns in this movie that helped minimize the effect this had on the overall viewing experience.Overall this movie was a delight for kids both big and small in our group. You'll enjoy it if you watch it with a child's eye...and not those big ones Bugsy has!!!".

He's the usual Sandler sweethearted semiloser with reserves of childlike sympathies ready to be released.The conceit is that after telling the humorous tales with the kids' ample and creative input at bedtime the story elements become real in real life altered to fit the modern context e.g. a rain of gumballs actually happens the next day explainable by a candy truck spilling its contents over a bridge onto Sandler. In this ingenious way the film recalls the WizardofOz trick of making real in Kansas what Dorothy had experienced in the Emerald City.There is nothing deep about this delight just a small satire of a society that may be losing its sense of wonder and fun in order to bow at the altars of nutrition and commercialism.

Anyway here is how the movie was....Disney in this decade has had a tendency to release very bland and predictable movies out of the shelf every year. With each of them starting and ending the same way with the middle being a slight twist on that every different film. In this film however they have the added bonus in that Adam Sandler who is no exactly known for his kiddy humor but it instead more of the goody comedy type stars in this along with radio hostactor Russell Brand and together they make the movie barable. Also the difference with this film is that the actors seem to be able to work well off each other whether Sandler is talking to his friend boss or enemies they all seem to be able to work off each other without it wanting you to rip your eyes out.Anyway this film is not without it's problems. Some of the jokes are in their for no reason and you can sense the ending anywhere. But that is fine anyway since it is a kid film and is just meant to be enjoyable. The in jokes to some of the other films Adam Sandler made were quite enjoyable Such as Rob Schneiders cameo and the thief.Overall I think this is a good movie to watch with the kids but I would just recommend waiting for it to go to DVD. I rate it a B at 50.".

I have seen most of his movies and enjoyed most of them. Based on the Metascore 33100 I dare to say that fortunately I am not a professional critic. Bedtime Stories is not a movie to win awards in any film festival but is a delightful fantasy to be appreciated by those that have the concept of family and dreams.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Bedtime Stories a while back but this was a film I couldn't believe how much I didn't like this film it was absolutely ridicules and I'm sorry but it insults even the children's intelligence. Adam Sandler I'm going to tell a story Once upon a time a man named Adam Sandler made over a million dollars doing baby voices he also released several movies. Some being hitsi.e. The Wedding Singer and some being huge missesi.e. You Don't Mess With The Zohan. He was a funny man but for some odd reason decided to choose to make some really lousy choices in film. Bedtime Stories is one of them it's extremely predictable and beyond stupid. I couldn't believe all the clich's in this film not to mention I love how in every Disney film they have to have an adorable animal steal the screen which this one wasn't even adorable it was down right disturbing. I don't even know if I should sum up the story since it's predictable but if you wanna know.Skeeter Bronson is a hotel leader who is promised as a child by his father Marty to be the manager of the family hotel but later it is bought by chain Nottingham Hotels. 25 years later the new manager Mr. Nottingham plans to build a new hotel and appoints another man the snotty Kendall to become the manager because he is dating his daughter. Skeeter's sister asks him to watch her kids because the school at which she is the principal is being closed and she is looking for a job in Arizona. The first night Skeeter tells a bedtime story taking place in medieval times with some additions from her kids. It comes true. Mr. Nottingham gives Skeeter a shot at the manager position when he says his new hotel theme was taken by Hard Rock Hotel and on his way home it rains gumballs all from the story. The next night at the hotel he tells another story set in the Old West and when he waits for it to come true a man steals his wallet. He saves Mr. Nottingham's daughter Violet  from the paparazzi and gets kicked by a dwarf. The night after that out on a campfire he tells them about a Greek stunt man and he ends up falling for his sister's friend and fellow colleague Jill. The last night he tells them about a space fight and unfortunately makes the discovery and they change the ending to him being hit by a gigantic ball of fire.Bedtime Stories has it's occasional laughs but it seems like this was more made for a 4 year old. The characters are not developed or really likable. Adam Sandler has made a career on making stupid baby voices I mean how is it that this man gets several million dollars on doing that? But if that's what people like to see I'm just glad that I got to see this for free. It wasted my time it wasn't cute the cast was out of place and the kids were annoying as heck. I wouldn't really recommend watching this movie it's not even a good family movie. I'm sorry but a 6.2 rating is beyond too generous for this stupid movie.210".

Adam Sandler I'm going to tell a story Once upon a time a man named Adam Sandler made over a million dollars doing baby voices he also released several movies. Some being hitsi.e. The Wedding Singer and some being huge missesi.e. You Don't Mess With The Zohan. He was a funny man but for some odd reason decided to choose to make some really lousy choices in film. Bedtime Stories is one of them it's extremely predictable and beyond stupid. I couldn't believe all the clich's in this film not to mention I love how in every Disney film they have to have an adorable animal steal the screen which this one wasn't even adorable it was down right disturbing. I don't even know if I should sum up the story since it's predictable but if you wanna know.Skeeter Bronson is a hotel leader who is promised as a child by his father Marty to be the manager of the family hotel but later it is bought by chain Nottingham Hotels. 25 years later the new manager Mr. Nottingham plans to build a new hotel and appoints another man the snotty Kendall to become the manager because he is dating his daughter. Skeeter's sister asks him to watch her kids because the school at which she is the principal is being closed and she is looking for a job in Arizona. The first night Skeeter tells a bedtime story taking place in medieval times with some additions from her kids. It comes true.

Adam Sandler lead a cast that included Courtney cox and comedian Russel brand. Cox portraying a over protective Mother of her kids and a head teacher at a school that is being closed down and destroyed to pave the way for a new hotel.

It won't amuse anyone with half a brain who is much older than 7 though.The script is so lame that within a few minutes you know what will happen throughout. Sandler moronically mugs his way through his part which is no surprise since so many characters he chooses to play are moronic. But what are good actors like Jonathan Pryce Guy Pearce and Lucy Lawless doing in this mess? The fairy tale sequences which are featured so prominently in the ad campaign make up a very short part of the movie and in no way make up for the lamebrained real plot.The most unrealistic element of the whole movie though it is inevitable is that the Keri Russell character a teacher pursuing an advanced degree would fall in love with a blithering idiot who repeatedly insulted her.One curiosity to note is the apparently ageless Richard Griffiths who looks exactly the same as he did 18 years ago in the Naked Gun 2 12.".

And frankly if you think that this is a nonPC word then what would you consider his portrayal in movie after movie if not disrespectful?

I like Billy Madison The Wedding Singer Happy Gilmore Click etc. But sometimes he gives us a piece of garbage that stinks so bad that it makes a garbage dump want to relocate like I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry You Don't Mess With The Zohan etc. But on very rare occasions he gives us even worse movies and that my friend is the category that Bedtime Stories falls into. The plot is simple. Adam Sandler plays Skeeter an underappreciated or should I say underdemeciated hotel worker guy who is constantly being snubbed for the manager position. One day his sister has to go out of town for the week and he gets stuck watching his niece and nephew for a week. In that time frame he tells them bedtime stories that strangely come to life the next day. Eventually he begins to realize that the kids control the story and whatever they say tends to happen. I liked the premise of the movie where the stories come to life in strange ways but they don't really come to life. They're just coincidences. For the raining gumballs part it doesn't really rain gumballs. Gumballs fall out of a broken truck on the bridge above him. However he thinks it's really raining gumballs even though it would be pretty obvious that they're only falling directly above him and not all over the town. There's one part where he thinks Abraham Lincoln is going to make an appearance and a penny falls down from the bridge above. I would have preferred if there was some supernatural reason for all this happening. He thinks that this stuff is all really happening but he doesn't think Oh my God how is this happening? He thinks Cool I can manipulate my niece and nephew so that I can get a Cherry Red Ferrari a hot girlfriend money etc. Not a single character in this movie is likable except for the CGI guinea pig. Everyone else is pretty much a bunch of aholes in this movie and we learn that early on. I didn't laugh once in this movie I hardly cracked a smile. It's boring it's unfunny I hated everybody in this movie I just did not like Bedtime Stories. My parents and siblings loved it though. I still don't know how or why they can like this snoozefest.P.S.

Sandler is a moronic hotel handyman with daddy issues. His sister is going out of town because the school she works at is being destroyed. Sandler must take care of her kids and tell them bedtime stories. These stories end up happening in real life and Sandler games the kids to get his way in the real world.

The problem isn't with Americans not wanting to see smart characters on the screen it is with the work ethic of the writers. The writers of this movie detach motivation and the logic of their main characters. Motivation is the driving force behind a character and logic is what the characters use to navigate through the road blocks you set up to get in the way of achieving their goal. This is writing 101 fellaslearn it before you write. When there is no connection with logic or reason to the main characters the plot falls apart and goes to the dogs. I will watch your dumb movie again to make sure it is not intentional but online. This film deserves none of my money.The filmmakers would like to beat you over the head with their moral of do the right thing. Or whatever they think it is. But at the end of the day the moral is Do anything to get to the top including tricking kids and Hotels want to tear down your school. Those damned evil hotels. Why are they always building a hotel mall or apartments and tearing down schools?Overall the film suffers from lazy filmmakers cashing their checks and not worrying about anything else. I hope people will start to wake up and treat movies like they do restaurants. If you see a movie that is god awful do not see another one made by the same person. It is like going to the same restaurant when the food always gives you the runs. Don't do it! Be smart consumers!".

The marketing for this movie is everywhere on TV on McDonald's ads and every time I go to the theaters I have to sit through the ads for this.

However there's still a bit of the Sandler factor and there's some in it for kids as well so that makes it enjoyable for kids and adults. Sandler plays Skeeter a hotel clerk who's forced to look after his sister's kids for a week. One night Skeeter tells an imaginary bedtime story to his children and the next day it becomes true. Every time he tells a new story whatever the kids come up with happens to Skeeter in real life. But he must find someway to make it stop before something really bad happens. This is one of those movies you could take the whole family to. Unlike some of Sandler's recent efforts including Zohan and Chuck  Larry he's tamed this movie up quite a bit. On a recent episode of Letterman he says he has a daughter now and he's decided he wanted to make a nice movie for the children. He makes this a delightful movie for children in every way. I don't mind Adam Sandler but when he's doing movies like Zohan I really think his PG13 movies really should be R rated. However even if this one isn't particularly good it's still a delightful family movie and Sandler himself makes it enjoyable for everyone. No matter what age you are its clean enough to enjoy and it's one you should bring the whole family to if it's possible.".

But as it turned out Adam Sandler proved to have struck some gold with this Disney offering and I thought it was successfully refreshing for a change after his vulgar outing as Israeli counterterrorist operative Zohan Dvir.Sandler stars as a hotel maintenance man Skeeter Bronson whose father Marty Jonathan Pryce had to sell their family hotel to Barry Nottingham Richard Griffiths to stave off bankruptcy. As a verbal clause Barry promised to have let Skeeter run the hotel in the future but as it turns out maintenance is the department that Skeeter's stuck in instead. And things don't turn out all the more better in his life where rival Kendall Guy Pearce gets slated to take over a new hotel since he's dating the boss's daughter Violet Teresa Palmer while Skeeter's sister Wendy Courteney Cox has to get out of town and dumps her two children Patrick Jonathan Morgan Heit and Bobbi Laura Ann Kesling for him and her friend Jill Keri Russell to babysit.Hold on didn't I just name drop a lot? You bet! Part of the fun in this movie are the familiar faces that pop up now and then. I had always associated Guy Pearce with more serious roles and watching him ham it up here his Broadway number especially was something quite fun. Keri Russell continues to show that she ages with grace and Courteney Cox didn't lag any far behind too. We also have Russell Brand whom we know as the Brit rock singer in Forgetting Sarah Marshall star as yet another clueless slacker friend of Skeeter's while Xena fans will lap at their star Lucy Lawless' supporting role here and quite unrecognizable too with her bob hairdo.And that's not all! Imagine having Carmen Electra in a cameo together with Rob Schneider and I thought I spied Will Farrell too I could be wrong with his uncredited blink and you miss appearance though as they lend support to this Happy Madison coproduction as they always do the previously produced films. But what I felt had held the movie together aside from that impossibly bugeyed looking guinea pig were the two kids Jonathan Morgan Heit and Laura Ann Kesling. They are Cute personified and in all earnestness just as how Sandler's Skeeter echoed one cannot fathom how anyone would bear to abandon them or as far as Wendy's upbringing is concerned made them lose out on the fun things in life. I'd cuddle them seriously while at the same time try and get them to spin tales that go my way haha!The two kids carry the show really well and as the story goes they have this inexplicable ability to make their version of the bedtime stories come true to life while not exactly always in verbatim fashion. So while Skeeter thought he had figured things out he tries to manipulate them so that they continue his stories which skew to his advantage but of course this being a comedy always end up in situations that provide fuel for laughter. And the production values don't come cheap too as we have stories brought to life from medieval times the wild wild west outer space as well as in Ancient Rome but always mirroring their real life counterparts and situations that Skeeter so decides. No effort was spared in making these stories as zany as they can be but always kid safe.There are some nice messages to impart moral values if you wish in what you could expect from a Disney film. It's extremely kidfriendly I think I've mentioned this for the umpteenth time and looking at the line up of offerings this Christmas season this is certainly a no brainer for anyone to bring their whole family to. It doesn't try to be more than it is and has this fuzzy warm feeling for its ending that suits the mood for celebration. It doesn't go over the top and the ensemble cast all looked as if they had a good time putting together something for the season for all to enjoy. Not an instant classic but the bedtime stories here will grow on you. Recommended!".

He stayed there for more than a year with only his frighteningly twisted imagination and came out with this animation that is a mix between Stopmotion Computer animation 8 bit video game animation and Japanese Anime. He calls it Str8nime. The visuals are absolutely stunning. An electrictechno rollercoaster of a movie with a soundtrack equally colorful.

I never play video games do not like 8bit music do not particularly like any kind of animation and have watched virtually no anime. I actually walked into the movie at Sundance about 10 minutes late and had a hard time getting to my seat because of the visual and audio onslaught coming at me from the screen. I was completely confused for about 34 of the movie yet I could not stop watching. The plot was developed almost entirely outside the realm of dialog and I suggest you read about the story before you begin watching.What I love about this film is that it makes you think. As much as I disliked pretty much hated parts of it I was completely drawn in. It really made me reevaluate why I watch movies and what I get from them. Sundance was a great forum for this film because it definitely is an INDIE film. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this film if you want something different than anything you have ever seen. Give it a chance  it is really something that needs to be watched in its entirety before judgment is made. Even if you hate the movie it is still worth watching if you like to expand your perception of what film is. I walked away from this movie with a much greater appreciation for different kinds of art and the amount of work that went into blending all the mediums used.".

Dot Strange.That kind of gives you a hint of what you are going to see  something very strange.Listen you'll either think this is super cool and love this film or you'll get so disgusted you'll yank it off your screen within minutes. Actually I was somewhere toward the latter but I lasted longer than a half hour before losing interest. I really tried to like this.The good aspect of this film is the clever animation done on a low budget. This is an original film that's for sure. The visuals and the sound are different and mostly interesting. You also have the option of hearing various soundtracks  now that's unique!The bad part of the movie is that it's hard to watch much of it in one sitting. It gets to be too much and is weak in the area of getting the viewer involved with the characters and story. Very little of the story is explained so you can get lost in a hurry and never recover. After a while I found myself not caring what was happening and just attempted to enjoy the strange visuals and sound effects. The visuals are a combination of computergenerated stop motion and bluescreen effects. It is also a combination according to its writerdirector produceretc of 8bit and anime. I'm not versed enough in all of this to explain it. I'm just trying to give you an idea how different this film is from other animated movies you've seen.Also it was first released on the Internet instead of movie theaters I think but did play in the Sundance Film Festival in 2006 and the following year put out on DVD.For the average movie viewer this film would be torture to sit through. It would be a long hourandahalf. For someone who enjoys something different visually this is a unique film that deserves a look and might prove to be fascinating especially for some young person interested in becoming a filmmaker. I'm sure one could learn a lot of techniques and be inspired.".

The two main characters are a young girl with big blue eyes visually reminiscent of anime who escapes her pimp and a sad and scared little boy. More about the story I won't describe because words won't do justice.It happens inside a video game.This is very important. From the stylistical choices to the apparent lack of narrative We are the Strange will most likely appeal to those born after 1970. There are direct references to multiple things most notable I would describe as hybrid the 8bit era of video gaming stop motion anime and 3D with a David Lynch logic. The end result is unlike anything I've seen. It's at times silly beautiful depressing always imaginative and highly atmospheric. This is sensorial filmmaking. Yes there is a very simple story but all that surrounds it truly make the films. Now when so many independent filmmakers view Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez as their heroes its is refreshing to see a filmmaker using the digital tools not to emulate formulas and trends created by others but to experiment all the way and successfully create something new.Now the music is unlike anything I've heard on film. It usually instruments from 8bit game consoles. It's a bizarre eerie feeling.No doubt we are witnessing a personal film in all respects a voice that hasn't been modified muted toned down to suit a specific kind of audience. It is a scream of the senses with no attempt whatsoever at logic. You'll be missing the point. You could say that it is style over substance. But what many people fail to acknowledge is that sometimes style itself can be substance.".

Unfortunately this movie is not strange in a good or interesting way. The plot is pretty much nonexistent and if it wasn't for the lengthly character description at the beginning of the movie it would be nothing more than complete confusion in cinematic form. Although the random mismatch of animation styles used in this movie creates a sense of chaos which is fitting to the world in which the film is based this does not make for good watching and becomes repetitive very quickly. Some people praise the mixture of animation styles and lack of a plot as 'thinking out of the box'. However thinking out of the box is not always a good thing. For instance if I decided to cook myself something new by combining elements of different world cuisines the result might be a fish beef and pasta pie seasoned with typical Indian spices and topped off with a rich chocolate and Weetabix sauce. This would be thinking out of the box but would anyone want to eat it?All this movie achieves is to portray its creator's M dot Strange selfindulgence. M dot Strange would have saved a lot of time both for himself and others if he had simply made the visuals for a five minute music video. There is an obvious reason why most people don't make whole movies by themselves  the results will be unwatchable!".

Fans I myself included among many others were glued to the intriguing persona of M. Dot Strange as he commented on those people who were looking at this movie criticizing it good criticizing it badly. Some people left within 15 minutes. Some stayed and watched the madness. For those who left I feel very sorry for you. You missed an amazing piece of art.We Are The Strange is a movie with a very simple plot but presents itself in such a dazzling way that you have to seek to finish it just to see the art. No matter how you criticize the film you cannot deny that the art form Str8nime a new style of animation created by Strange himself combines 8 bit animation Like the old Mario Games on Nintendo Anime This stuff is nothing like what you see on TV. It's human in it's animated style and Strangeness and this movie provides plenty of it.The story revolves around two main characters Blue and Emm. Blue is an anime girl who worked who lived in a bordello whilst under the ownership of HIM The voice of the Director who tells her she is ugly and will never be anything to him or anyone. She is banished to a lonely forest where the other character Emm a doll boy A doll's body with a voice that squeaks and squeals for speech lives alone in the forest. He does not know why he's there or how he got there but ponders it.Under specific detail Emm highlights he wants Ice Cream and wants to go the big city to get it. Fear and torment plague his mind as the idea of being an outcast is something he recognizes. Blue too feels this way.As the two go to Stopmo City they find that evil lurks everywhere and only a strange fighter named Rain appears to fight the darkness around the city.This movie is brilliant. It's not for everybody but it is fantastic. The art is just dazzling the visuals are what tell the story and it's not just a fan's review that's saying this as a movie goer it's nothing Pixar has ever done. Shrek cannot compete to what this movie tries to say.If you need to see a movie that is brimming with genius has an intelligent way of story telling This does not have much dialog and that's good because instead of clouding your mind with meaningless George Lucasesquire lingo you can focus on a bitter and at the same time sweet movie.I give this movie a 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally I get to see We Are The Strange. I don't remember in the slightest how I came to know about M. Dot Strange's work but overall I'm glad I did. What we have here is a technical achievement on a pretty high level. The story itself is simple but at the same time it's really hard to understand. I urge everyone thinking about seeing this movie to read up about what the movie is about first. If I didn't know the plot beforehand I would have been completely and utterly bewildered right up until the end of the flick. But the plot isn't the reason to watch this film. It's the visuals and the sound. It's really like nothing I've ever seen and most likely nothing you've seen as well. I enjoyed We Are The Strange due to it's imaginative art music and style but I still felt lost quite a bit...too much so. This is a movie for people who are artistic imaginative and adventurous with their movie watching everyone else should stay put.".

	schema:headline " Best Independent film I've ever discovered.";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw a trailer of this movie while browsing on a independent movieDVD website. I was fascinated by how it looked after reading that it had influences on Anime. The trailer said it was viewable on youtube so I went to the website to check it out.The movie takes place inside a video game cartage where the world is a grim dark video game world. There was a woman named Blue who was once a dancer for a vile man named Him. Him disowned Blue for not being attractive and for having a strange condition that whenever she speaks she turns pixelated but if she remains silent she's not pixelated. After being abused by Him he tells her to get lost. Which Blue did as she ran away from the place that was considered home to her but not anymore. She ran away from the city and ended up at a forest where she meets a lonely doll with the head of a baby doll. His name is eMMM and all he wants is Ice Cream and someone to be friends with. Blue wasn't too sure about eMMM but eventually she gained his trust and they both decide to get ice cream. However their trip to get ice cream lead towards a dangerous adventure when they head for the city that's over run with monsters that were sent by Him himself.After watching it it became a new favorite of mine. Not only was it a well done independent animated film. It was also fascinating on how the director throw in various parodies of video games  anime. The main heroine Blue is one of the reasons I liked it a lot.This movie is really strange and it was created by a independent filmmaker who likes to do movies his own way. So it's not a movie made for everyone. In my opinion it's highly watchable if you like movies that have a Gothicanimevideo game theme to them.You're able to watch the entire movie on Youtube because the director wanted everyone to be able to watch the movie. If you like the movie then there's a 2dsic DVD which includes deleted scenes alternate soundtracks making of feature  a commentary where you get to learn at least one new thing about the movie from the director himself.It's not a well known movie to the public but I'm sure within time this movie will gain a large cult following like other movies do.".

	schema:reviewBody "We Are The Strange.What can I say about this movie. It's an experience to say the least. I can almost guarantee you that within the first ten minutes of the movie your first comment will be What the ?! Looking at the title you'd think this movie was well strange. But 'strange' alone in a gross understatement. Saying this movie is strange is like saying the surface of the sun is toasty. You might try to compare this to other strange movies like say Labyrinth or Corpse Bride but really you can't. You just can't.More than anything else this movie is a statement in visual art. The combination of stopmotion animation 8bit graphics and CGI animation is both innovative and crazy to look at. The dark world that is StopMo city get the name? has almost no cohesive structure to it whatsoever. The fight scenes if you can call them that which were most definitely inspired by old school anime is like watching a kid play with action figures. Actually the whole movie feels like it come from the deep dark recesses of some tenyearold's abandoned toy chest.The character designs are...innovative. The first Characters we meet Blue and HIM are probably the closest to normal anybody's gonna get in this film but that's not saying much. eMMM Rain and Ori look like they came from nightmares of Tim Burton. Despite the crazy designs however each character's design better than any other movie I've seen reflects that character's personality purpose and even background almost perfectly. You take one look and you can easily say Oh this is the bad guy or Oh definitely a tragic heroine and so on.The dialog there's dialog in this movie?! is few and far between. There's probably less than five minutes of speech throughout the entire movie...for all characters combined. Like I said this is more on visuals. What dialog does exists is short and straight to the point. There are no pointlessly long exchanges between characters even for humor's sake. Each sentence spoken has heavy significance to the plot so when someone talks you'll know you should listen.As for the plot yes boys and girls there is a plot in here somewhere it's hard to find at first mainly because of the movie trying to visually rape your mind. But if you concentrate really hard I mean reeeeeeally hard there is a coherent plot about two lost tragic characters trying to find their way.eMMM and Blue are the classic tragic heroes both starting out at the bottom of the dumps then slowly but surely finding their courage within each other. the vigilante pair Rain and Ori though feeling like a really bad ripoff of Batman and Robin presented an exciting view of a wrongfully accused man and a misunderstood weirdo fighting for justice. HIM is the stereotypical villain of the piece who thinks of only himself and thinks nothing of plunging the city into darkness if for nothing more than his own pleasure.All of these character elements come together in a straightforward plot line typical of most epic stories. The characters and their motivations are easy to understand once you get into the movie and it's easy cheer for the good guys and hate the bad guys though HIM's low droning voice make it kinda hard to take him seriously Watch this movie once to get a hang of the visuals. Watch it again to truly appreciate the story.In conclusion I loved this movie. I really did. It was weird yes but refreshing in a way that it provided an escape from the usual canned mainstream coming out of Hollywood. It was an experience to savor. It's not boring. It never gets boring. Sure you'll feel like a weirdo for appreciating it but maybe that's a good thing.Just for chuckles you should also watch the 1337 version.".

	schema:reviewBody "as you can no doubt tell by looking at the rating and comments on we are the strange the film has a distinctly polarizing effect about it. it is very easy to level negative criticism at a film of this nature. i will not necessarily disagree with some of their comments. to the casual viewer the film may seem a disjointed mess without a single cohesive idea. in fact most people will probably not like this film though this film was not created to be liked. it is what it is. to some it will seem inflated with its own sense of selfimportance. and the very notion of adapting cg and stopmotion animation into one medium is hardly as revolutionary as the hype surrounding it. these are all fair criticisms.though to look at a film such as we are the strange in terms like this is a disservice. it is not so much a movie as much as it is an abstract painting or a collage and should be watched thusly. in fact the inclusion of typical movie structuring is almost to the detriment of the work  though the plot is simple to the point of it being unnecessary. we are to sit back and engage the film just as the film is attempting to engage us. it is ANTI yet it is so human. we can find themes of pathos desire and fear if we choose. the room for interpretation is endless.we are the strange is a vibrant piece of art but it's not for everyone. undeniably however it is something to behold and a grand statement from a writerdirector who has yet to realize his full potential.".

	onyx:emotionText "as you can no doubt tell by looking at the rating and comments on we are the strange the film has a distinctly polarizing effect about it. it is very easy to level negative criticism at a film of this nature. i will not necessarily disagree with some of their comments. to the casual viewer the film may seem a disjointed mess without a single cohesive idea. in fact most people will probably not like this film though this film was not created to be liked. it is what it is. to some it will seem inflated with its own sense of selfimportance. and the very notion of adapting cg and stopmotion animation into one medium is hardly as revolutionary as the hype surrounding it. these are all fair criticisms.though to look at a film such as we are the strange in terms like this is a disservice. it is not so much a movie as much as it is an abstract painting or a collage and should be watched thusly. in fact the inclusion of typical movie structuring is almost to the detriment of the work  though the plot is simple to the point of it being unnecessary. we are to sit back and engage the film just as the film is attempting to engage us. it is ANTI yet it is so human. we can find themes of pathos desire and fear if we choose. the room for interpretation is endless.we are the strange is a vibrant piece of art but it's not for everyone. undeniably however it is something to behold and a grand statement from a writerdirector who has yet to realize his full potential.";

Whether Meadows will ever break out and be a hit outside of the British Isles is highly debatable his Dead Man's Shoes from 2004 was well received away from his home shores but you would be hard pressed to find anyone in American multiplexes for example purposes only who could tell you who he is which for a director who has his finger firmly on the pulse of characterisation that is a crying shame.A Room For Romeo Brass is the tale of two teenage boys who during a fight with some bullies meet gangly loner Morell as Morell starts to take an unhealthy obsession with Romeo's sister their friendship is pulled apart but this is merely the start of Morell's impact as he is about to explode into both of the boys already fractured families.That's all you need to know really for there is no more to tell and this is one of Meadows's main strengths there are no hidden agendas no allegories of wars this is just an everyday English housing estate with two families awash with everyday characters. Just how often do you see a loner in your neighbourhood? They are there are they all like Morell? Well it may be best not to find out eh?Paddy Considine makes his film debut here thankfully he is now a name across the waters and his turn as Morell is as scary as it is sad. Anyone who was impressed with his turn as the vengeful Richard in Dead Man's Shoes will be well rewarded here. A young Andrew Shim as Romeo grabs the role with sizzling vitality a character calling for strength of nature whilst layering in a heartfelt slant that the story benefits from. I must mention big Frankie Harper Dog in Lock Stock  Two Smoking Barrels playing Romeo's estranged father he gets it absolutely note perfect and I was delighted to see Meadows give him the film's crowning moment.A film that opens with The Specials and closes with The Stone Roses should always appeal to an English heart but lets get Shane Meadows' work out there to the masses for here is a man who even gives an end credit mention for the man who turned on the generators a man making films for the people about the people in our midsts. 810".

Shane Meadows is a survivor and an artist one who has the heart and the enormous ability to give heart to others who must still find their way.  Bravo!!!".

Hoskins reappears in a minor role in his second film the criminally ignored 'A Room for Romeo Brass' another portrait of life among the poor of Nottingham.

But a layer of darkness lies close below the surface. Paddy Considine made his name as weirdo loser Morell a character the film treats with sympathy even though he is evidently a danger to its child heroes a welcome contrast to the Hollywood world where oddballs are either really all right and actually not that odd or pure evil. But there are also great performances from among others as Andrew Shim as Romeo Vivky McClure as his sister and James Higgins as his friend's useless dad. What really stands out in this super film are the odd unglorified moments that completely shift one's perception of what is going on such as the first indications of Morell's manipulativeness the moment when Romeo not usually the most adult of teenagers grows instantaneously into the role of man of the house on the reappearance of his own unwanted father and near the end when his friend's dad who until this point has appeared a man of no qualities whatsoever offers himself as sacrifice in order to protect the boys. The stunning combination of human weakness and courage revealed in that moment is truly profound. Meadows meanwhile is truly a genius. Watch this film.".

	schema:headline " Good film becomes great with stunning climax possible spoiler";
	schema:reviewBody "Although not quite comparable this film reminded me somewhat of THE SIXTH SENSE in which an entertaining movie frustratingly missing greatness is suddenly transformed into something much richer and more complex by a startling climax.  Shane Meadows is one of the few filmmakers today who actually understands the meaning of irony that it's not a synonym for sarcasm that it isn't just a case of saying the opposite of what you mean. Meadows contrives to lead his viewer up a particular path of emotions and meanings before pulling back at the crucial moment to reveal in their horror its full implications.  Topically refreshingly it is also one of the most sensible films about fascism in a long time.KnockKnock a gangly redhead with back problems and Romeo Brass the chipguzzling offspring of a failed interracial marriage are best mates although their friendship must be beneath the surface so joyless and antagonistic does it seem.  Both live in home environments that aren't actually welcoming though in no way dysfunctional.  One day KnockKnock is being bullied by older boys and when Romeo gets involved a ruckus ensues stopped by Morrell a bizarre hooded petty thief probably in his 20s who looks like a dim James Coburn and speaks in the oddest overemphatic parody of Alan Partridge.  He befriends the boys and gets Romeo to ask his beautiful sister Ladine to go out with him.KnockKnock plays a relatively harmless joke on Morrell which results in him looking mildly foolish in front of Ladine.  At the same time Romeo moves in with KnockKnock when his brutal dad comes back after being thrown out by his new lover parking his van outside the house.  Morrell seems like a harmless eccentric but on a seaside trip he threatens KnockKnock for humiliating him and the two boys drift apart Romeo spending all his time with Morrell KnockKnock undergoing a serious back operation and recovering alone in his room.  When Morrell finally gets Ladine to his house but doesn't get the enthusiastic response he expects the stage is set for violent confrontation.BRASS is brilliantly multilayered but until that climax is a little disappointing.  Compared to the inspired stylisation of SMALLTIME in which music style dialogue and performances offered a distanced and contrived yet perversely truthful portrait of petty crooks on the make the more conventional presentation here reminiscent a cliche but true I'm afraid of a BBC TV drama seems a little regressive.  The chief result of this is that it makes the still stylised performances situation and humour seem unrealistic and a little phoney.  Once you adjust to this though minor pleasures are legion.  There is great truth and emotional empathy in the friendship of the boys its rupture and eventual reconciliation.  Although the twee guitar music is laid on a bit thick Meadows achieves some sublime epiphanies out of his mundane material in particular the gorgeous swimming pool sequence early on.And although the film largely focuses on the two friends it does not follow their point of view.  Caricature isn't always avoided but Meadows has a great sense of adult sadness and failure unavailable to the boys  Romeo's mother exasperated with her son obviously carrying horrendous scars from a past only tacitly alluded to torn with confusion over how to deal with her errant husband her daughter Ladine beautiful and smart yet forced to make do with a psychotic loser KnockKnock's mum always caught in immobile silence stuck with a childish husband who has to bully little children to feel powerful and would rather watch telly then visit his son. The evocation of a stagnant midland town which doesn't seem to have changed since the 1970s is masterly and sad.  The comedy though often obvious is hilarious arising as much from simple slapstick as from the boys' precocious worldview the adult's often infantile behaviour or the strangeness of Morrell.Kudos have rightly been offered all round to Paddy Considine but it's a remarkably odd great performance not naturalistic at all but a series of initially amusing tics and mannerisms that soon become very scary and doubly moving because of his evident inability to control them.  Such is his childlike nature we don't actually find it odd that he should want to hang around with younger boys until elders start saying so so that our response becomes so socially conditioned as to leave us vulnerable for the climax.What is especially difficult is that Morrell's seeming reactions don't fit his emotions  he doesn't seem too humiliated after KnockKnock's joke and even gets a date out of it which is what he wanted so when he menaces him by the seaside it is truly alarming we've actually built up quiet a store of sympathy for him.But the climax is the thing and I won't spoil it for you suffice to say that it's the most powerful sequence British cinema has managed in years that any society needing thuggery to save its very obvious helplessness is very disturbing and that the happy ending replete with Union Jack is morally sickening yet oddly moving.".

	schema:headline " One of the Best British films of all time!";
	schema:reviewBody "'A Room For Romeo Brass' is a startling piece of work and one I was quite unprepared for. I had seen some of Shane Meadow's earlier work Twenty Four Seven Smalltime and Where's The Money Ronny? and been very impressed by it but Romeo Brass is so far ahead of anything the director had done before that it knocked me sideways. Firstly the movie is a small scale drama with more emotional insight than the most epic of Hollywood movies. It is filled with stunning performances witty dialogue and so many small moments that just feel true. For me it's biggest achievement is the way it perfectly captures that time when you are young and your best friend is the most important thing in the world to you. The thought of them abandoning you is pure torture. This is something I had not seen represented in films before to such an extent. If you haven't seen this film yet than stop reading this and go and watch it because the film plays better the less you know about it. To discuss the film properly it is impossible not to reveal some potential PLOT SPOILERS. Like how the film throws the audience a complete curve about thirty minutes in when Morrell's character changes from a humorous manchild to a deranged psychopath. This moment is handled so well and one of the film's chief assets is the stunning performance by Paddy Considine Romeo Brass is amazingly his debut. For my money Considine is Britain's most exciting actor currently working. His range is staggering. See 'In America' where he even manages to act Samantha Morton off the screen! The two young leads are mighty impressive too. Watching Romeo Brass is an absolute pleasure. One moment it is hilarious the next terrifying. There is a wonderful generosity of spirit to the film. Like the work of another of my absolute favourite film makers Paul Thomas Anderson there is an emphasis on the quiet dignity and humanity of everyday folk. Nowhere is this better encapsulated than in the absolutely terrifying sequence where Gavin's father previously something of a good for nothing type kneels down to be sacrificed to protect his family. I have seen posted on the notice board that some viewers feel that this character is a wimp for his actions. But the sheer dignity the reserves of humanity expressed by him there is incredible. The film also captures violence very well in that it doesn't glamourise it it shows what a messy frightening degrading experience it is. After watching the film I had to sit down and smoke some cigarettes because it really rang true for me. This film is the best British film I have seen for years. It's right up there with Shallow Grave and The Third Man. As such I think it's criminally under rated. One of the reasons for this I feel is the way it was marketed. I caught the film recently on DVD. The reason I missed it at the cinema was not that I was unaware of it but that the posters of a large pair of pants didn't exactly inspire me. This film has nothing to do with pants! If any British film should be advertised with a picture of a pair of pants it is Love Actually and in that case the pants should be skidmarked not this miraculous film. Go and watch Romeo Brass. Tell your friends tell complete strangers spread the word the following starts here!".

	onyx:emotionText "'A Room For Romeo Brass' is a startling piece of work and one I was quite unprepared for. I had seen some of Shane Meadow's earlier work Twenty Four Seven Smalltime and Where's The Money Ronny? and been very impressed by it but Romeo Brass is so far ahead of anything the director had done before that it knocked me sideways. Firstly the movie is a small scale drama with more emotional insight than the most epic of Hollywood movies. It is filled with stunning performances witty dialogue and so many small moments that just feel true. For me it's biggest achievement is the way it perfectly captures that time when you are young and your best friend is the most important thing in the world to you. The thought of them abandoning you is pure torture. This is something I had not seen represented in films before to such an extent. If you haven't seen this film yet than stop reading this and go and watch it because the film plays better the less you know about it. To discuss the film properly it is impossible not to reveal some potential PLOT SPOILERS. Like how the film throws the audience a complete curve about thirty minutes in when Morrell's character changes from a humorous manchild to a deranged psychopath. This moment is handled so well and one of the film's chief assets is the stunning performance by Paddy Considine Romeo Brass is amazingly his debut. For my money Considine is Britain's most exciting actor currently working. His range is staggering. See 'In America' where he even manages to act Samantha Morton off the screen! The two young leads are mighty impressive too. Watching Romeo Brass is an absolute pleasure. One moment it is hilarious the next terrifying. There is a wonderful generosity of spirit to the film. Like the work of another of my absolute favourite film makers Paul Thomas Anderson there is an emphasis on the quiet dignity and humanity of everyday folk. Nowhere is this better encapsulated than in the absolutely terrifying sequence where Gavin's father previously something of a good for nothing type kneels down to be sacrificed to protect his family. I have seen posted on the notice board that some viewers feel that this character is a wimp for his actions. But the sheer dignity the reserves of humanity expressed by him there is incredible. The film also captures violence very well in that it doesn't glamourise it it shows what a messy frightening degrading experience it is.

It's almost completely undefinable just when you think that it's a reallife type of comedy it switches to being extremely disturbing and you don't quite know where you are for the rest of the movie in the best possible way believe me. Paddy Considine plays Morrell the mysterious childlike adult who befriends two schoolboys after coming to their aid when they become involved in a fight with some local lads. Their uneasy and strange friendship with Morrell continues after he becomes obsessed with the sister of Romeoone of the boys and the eponymous character and the lifelong friendship of the two boys is slowly driven apart as Morrell becomes increasingly obbsessive.Like all of Shane Meadows films it takes a look at the workingclass world of his youth but is unique amongst this type of British film because it's funny without being sentimental or condescending and dark without being depressing. Meadows is certainly ploughing his own unique furrow which kickstarted with the fabulous 'Twentyfourseven'many cast members from that film including Bob Hoskins make cameos here. Paddy Considine is fantastic and it beggars belief that this was his first ever screen appearance. His portrayal of Morrell is both sympathetic and terrifying and you can never underestimate his character for a second.

Gavin has a spinal problem that causes him to limp while Romeo has domestic problems and is prone to his temper. One day they meet adult Morell who helps them beat off some bullies and gives them a lift home. Morell takes a shine to Romeo's sister and starts hanging around with the boys but he is slightly unhinged and his friendship with Romeo threatens to split the friendship of the two boys.I watched This is England recently and it encouraged me to look back across other Shane Meadows films that I hadn't seen either for years or at all. Shamefully this film fell into the latter camp but thanks to the BBC's summer of British cinema I got the chance to see it recently. Typically it is set in Nottingham with a world and characters that Meadows had experience of and as a result it is more convincing that perhaps the main thrust of the narrative has a right to be. The two characters of Romeo and Gavin are both well written and convincing and mostly they move the film along even though I wasn't totally convinced that Morell would be able to get the type of relationships he got before everyone realised what he was about. Other than this slight issue though the film does engage and it is mainly thanks to the acting.Meadows directs his cast well while also making good use of music and the movement of the camera. Shim is excellent in the title role and is very convincing in his performance. Marshall was less so OK he had a bit stiffer character and is on the side of the story as the film goes on but he is very much secondary to Shim. Dominating the film though with an astonishing debut is Paddy Considine. He is amusing to children in the way some adults can be but he never lets us forget that he is more than just a bit childlike and that unhinged is a polite description. In smaller supporting roles are McClure Higgins Harper and Hall who are all good. Apart from adding the weight of his name as support Hoskins does little but I suppose for the support alone he deserves credit.Overall then this is an enjoyable and quite disturbing film. The narrative offered me a few problems in the extremes but the natural and engaging delivery covered for them while Meadows brings roundly convincing performances from his cast not least of which are two strong debuts from Shim and Considine.".

So I avoided it. Last night I rented Romeo Brass on video  and 24 hours later I'm finding it impossible to think about anything else! Sadly there aren't enough British movies that are as absorbing as this. And yet it could only have been made in Britain. I really cannot think of a bad thing to say about this film. Oh... Bob Hoskin's cameo seemed a little surplus to requirements by the time he cropped up I'd forgotten his name was in the credits and it's pretty obvious he is only in it to draw a bigger crowd. But for a film as emotive engaging and gutwrenching as a 2 hour Pulp song that criticism seems petty.How to describe it? A horror film with no monsters and with very little violence most of it verbal anyway? A psychological thriller where the most terrible thing that could happen is these two best friends might stop speaking to each other? A comedy as dark and twisted and as British as you can get? A little of all the above.There isn't a single weak link in the cast. Is a lot of the dialogue adlibbed? It felt like it but only because everything everybody utters is completely real right down to the very last dunno'. The message of the film seems to be that the best way to deal with a bully is to get someone bigger on your side who can bully them. Not exactly something they teach you in school but unfortunately it does seem to be one of the rules of the jungle.SPOILER TIME The morally ambiguous end is just stunning and has prompted me to write this review as well as recommend the film to everyone I have ever met ever.On the one level we have everything back in its proper place Romeo and Gavin are best friends again. Something I had forgotten happens at that age friendships are made and broken in the space of a day by the next day it's all changed again. We have a brilliant comedy scene which only shows us Brits doing what we do best hiding everything under the carpet. Have a cup of tea and it'll all be OK. Everybody is laughing. Everybody has forgotten the public and downright shocking humiliation of Gavin's dad. He dealt with the situation in the best way a weak and stupid man could although he hasn't been absolved at all. Everybody seems comfortable and safe now that Romeo's brooding thug of a dad is back in the fold. This is no contradiction to what has gone on before. Morrell entered the boys' lives under identical circumstances by saving them from another smaller bully. Where is the line drawn? Why is one bully considered a freak and one a hero? That's up to you... and it's also the reason why I can't concentrate on anything else today!".

The characters setting and story are all realistic and believable it is something that any two friends in your street could experience. The only reason why This Is England is slightly better is because there is a more hardhitting ending and more interesting characters in that film. But that is totally fine as this is one of Meadows' earlier films with presumably a lower budget. Sure some of the accents sound comedic but as most of the actors where new to acting in this film it is very impressive. It feels like a home movie in a good way and I look forward to watching more of Meadows' work he is definitely one of the UK's best. A solid 8 out of 10 stars.".

It is very dark humour and of course this always takes you away from slight credibility issues because it becomes more of a black comedy.What we are left to contemplate is the oddball Morell's actions have come out of a deep jealousy of never having this kind of friendship that and just being a deeply unpleasant unlikable loner. Thanks to some good writing and a fantastic portrayal by Considine the film becomes one of the best and darkest studies ever made of a troubled and troubling weirdo. This film like several of SM's others has an almost Western like tinge to it depicting a drifting desperado causing trouble to a community. Good stuff indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to this one after thoroughly enjoying Dead man shoes which was a great film....The movie starts and the intro segments begin to play introducing the two boys Romeo and Gavin. My first thought was how terrible the actor who played Gavin was Ben Marshall. He appeared to be unnatural annoying and generally sounded like he was reading off a script. But i was willing to look past that...A good 25 minutes in and i'm still waiting for something interesting to happen. Morell Paddy Considine had been introduced and had appeared to have developed a strange relationship with the boys and i was left wondering why the boys parents would even let their boys be associated with this strange man who appeared to be 'not quite the full ticket' in the first place.The scene in the clothes shop where Morell was dressed in a shell suit delivering gifts to Romeo's sister was cringe worthy and there was no way in hell that his sister would have had anything to do with this weirdo after that performance which makes the film seem even more unrealistic when she agrees to go on a date with him...The kissing scene was even more far fetched and this just wouldn't happen in the real world even if she did feel slightly sorry for him...The film takes a sinister turn shortly after this and provides the first bit of action...My heart skipped a beat when Morell pulls out a knife on Gavin and it was a quite a random shock. I thought 'ok' this film is going somewhere now...But when Romeo returns from the ice cream truck and finds his 'best' friend crying with his head in his hands there is no way that romeo would just disregard it the way he did considering he had been so loyal to him from the start. He would have demanded to know what was wrong and would have been suspicious that Morell had done something...I thought Morell would start terrorising Gavin after this but nothing happened. I guess his revenge was taking Romeo away from him...The film just plods along with minimal action and you are left wondering why Romeo has abandoned his friend so easily and why he is so reluctant to even have anything to do with him. And i was also left wondering why his parents had not wised up to the situation and why they were still letting romeo hang around with Morell.When Morell turns on romeo after a failed attempt to bed his sister which nearly resulted in rape and proceeds to follow him around its obvious how the film will end Frank Harper saving the day.The scene at the end where Morell is in Gavin's front garden refusing to leave and seeking revenge is flawed. Is there no police in this town??? The first thing you would do if there was a psycho waiting outside your house is call the police. Not go out there and confront him yourself.Romeo's dad arrives and gives Morell a minor beating. A very minor beating considering this man had attempted to rape his daughter and attack his son and then stalk him.I was left feeling unsatisfied after that.Although i have not said many good things about this film i will say that i did enjoy the rare bits of action the movie provided and the general story line was good. It just had too many flaws for my liking and was slow in parts.The final scene in the garden was horrible and the magic show was unfunny and yet again quite cringe worthy.This film is good in parts buts lets face it its no classic.I'm guessing these high reviews are from die hard Shane Meadows fans who will appreciate anything he does.5 out of 10 from me.".

Shakespearian in their intensity of character conflict they bristle with grit are masterfully acted and propel themselves the way John Ford's best films do. I consider him even with his limited output one of the great A list directors. No his camera work isn't stunning crane and rail ballet it's old school  but GREAT old school  Zinneman Ford. And if you're a filmgoer who likes to care deeply about characters Sheridan makes your kind of film.Acting doesn't get better or more truthful than Daniel Day Lewis and Emily Watson working together. They're  absolutely believable  inspiring actually  as a couple struggling through forbidden love after 14 years apart. The dialogue they work with is A plus and written by Sheridan  thus it's probably tuned collaboratively during rehearsal.  Very organic. Great ! work by Gerard McSorley Brian Cox L.I.E. and David Stott as Ike.Yep Northern Ireland as Sheridan portrays it can be dreary as commented here. But it's also full of humanity drunkeness hope cruelty love loyalty oppression and a desperate longing for change  all the stuff of true drama. The action commences at the moment Ireland is on the cusp of real but fragile peace. Boxing and the IRA? A one two punch.I love this film and I'd watch it again with any friend who wanted to see an excellently written and played picture. If you want your blood to boil from some fine performers playing strongly written characters check this out. Not quite Elizabeth but powerful. Good enough dramatically  albeit not quite visually to sit on the same shelf with Raging Bull.".

	schema:headline " Realistic depressing and yet full of hope";
	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this film for several reasons. Firstly it dares to tell the story of ordinary people caught up in a conflict that they don't want to be a part of and having their best hopes crushed. The script isn't written to be a crowdpleaser.Secondly the story and the style of narration is wonderfully subdued and lowkey both fitting the story perfectly and allowing the viewer to really involve himherself in the story and characters.Finally the performances of DayLewis and Watson are very good. DayLewis lends great credibility to his character. He is no Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford rising again with a firm jaw after each blow but rather a believable portrait of a man believing and wanting to do his best but time and time again having his hopes crushed.But the real star performance of the film is by Watson.

	onyx:emotionText "I really liked this film for several reasons. Firstly it dares to tell the story of ordinary people caught up in a conflict that they don't want to be a part of and having their best hopes crushed. The script isn't written to be a crowdpleaser.Secondly the story and the style of narration is wonderfully subdued and lowkey both fitting the story perfectly and allowing the viewer to really involve himherself in the story and characters.Finally the performances of DayLewis and Watson are very good. DayLewis lends great credibility to his character. He is no Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford rising again with a firm jaw after each blow but rather a believable portrait of a man believing and wanting to do his best but time and time again having his hopes crushed.But the real star performance of the film is by Watson. After Breaking the Waves I had written her off sorry but I tend to do that with people who have played in von Trier movies but her performance in this film is simply outstanding. Her portrait of both pride strength and vulnerability is amazing.9 out of 10.";

The cinematography is often stunning especially in the way it uses the cold and minimalist color palette. There's a palatable sense of tension that flows throughout the picture made more taut by the various directing techniques used by Jim Sheridan. One technique is the shots from the helicopters that circle above Belfast showing a community that is under siege and giving a greater perspective on what it's like to live in this part of the city. And there are three parts to the story all of which work very well. There's the story of Danny's release from prison and his attempt to start a boxing club. There's the romance between him and Emily Watson a romance that is forbidden by I.R.A. codes. And then there's the I.R.A. themselves struggling to find peace but being broken apart from within by leaders of splinter factions. A very moving film with a great score by Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer as well and a film that really addresses the issues of neverending violence in a very direct and emotional way.".

The story revolves around a neighborhood of ordinary and notsoordinary people living in a troubled Northern Ireland. Sheridan successfully depicts the problem from both sides. One witnesses how difficult it is to lead a normal life in peace as this will be looked down upon and even used against you. The use of washed out colour gives a gloomy and depressing feel and ironically also shows the weather. But contradicting that Sheridan also skillfully portrays the love devotion and hope of the people.Fine performances are almost always expected from Sheridan's films and here too the actors do an outstanding job. Daniel DayLewis is superb. His restraint reflects Danny's calm dignity and he is very convincing as the man who recognizes a second opportunity in life and tries to make the better of it. Emily Watson is sublime. Her quiet portrayal of Maggie's strength pride courage and vulnerability is spot on. Brian Cox is stupendous. Gerard McSorley proves again how wickedly good he can be when it comes to playing menacing characters. Ken Stott is excellent.I feel the reason why 'The Boxer' is so underrated and not as highly regarded as Sheridan's other films is because it's far more complicated than what they're used to seeing. However in my opinion this is just as effective as Scorsese's 'Raging Bull' and better than the likes of 'Rocky.".

	schema:reviewBody "After fourteen years in prison for terrorist activities Danny Flynn is released and returns to his community. Having blanked the IRA members in the jail with him Danny is not very popular but since he didn't name names is allowed to live when he comes out. Looking to get past the violence that stole over a decade of his life Danny reopens his former boxing gym within a local community centre so that he can give the youth of the area something other than hatred and violence. However the discovery of Semtex in the community centre and his insistence that the gym is a nonsectarian venue brings him into direct conflict with the local members of the army council of Sinn FeinIRA.Perhaps I should not have watched this film today but it has been sitting on my to watch list for ages and I finally got round to it. You say today the IRA issued a statement saying that the British and Irish governments should not underestimate the seriousness of the situation  the situation being them refusing to give up guns now that the police the Irish government and the British government all believe that the IRA while on ceasefire and supposedly pursuing peace carried out the biggest robbery of recent memory in Christmas 2004. Now I do not know for sure whether they did or not but I do believe that all terrorist groups and the political parties that represent them should be ejected from government given that they are all Republican and Loyalist still involved in violence beatings and crime. So this film was even more impacting to me because it was released at a time when I had just left Northern Ireland to live in England and at the time peace looked possible  it is typical that the terrorist groups refuse to do anything unless it is on their terms even a neutral would have to admit that the British government has bent over backwards to get them involved.Anyway perhaps this film is the perfect vehicle to watch on such a night because unlike many films about Northern Ireland it doesn't have a bias one way or the other but rather looks at the ordinary people who try to deal with the struggle and like many films on this subject it gets the mood right even if the material is not that hot. By mood or tone I mean that this film has little hope within it and is not for viewers who are caught up in the current US assurances that terrorism is something that is being beaten by the use of weapons. Watching it on this day I can say that the portrayal of the people as keen to see it all settled in a fair way with both groups of terrorists surrendering their weapons but the whole thing is confused by those who like today refuse to give up the gun while still hoping to be a proper government. However outside of this the material is surprisingly weak. Northern Ireland in the midnineties didn't quite look like this and many aspects of the story are simplified  partly to make it a easier story but partly to keep up the movie stable that parts of the IRA are actually peaceloving people who would just love to get rid of every last bullet and gun. This material is rather patronising and may annoy those who have actually lived in the conflict rather than viewed it from the mainland.The story also involves a romance that didn't totally convince me and the usual backdrop of a man trying to get out of the situation it isn't great but the story has enough going on to hold the attention while also showing the wider depression about the conflict. The cast try hard and they do make the film better thanks to their work. DayLewis is always worth a watch and even if he is a bit selfrighteous here he is still a fine actor and his performance is better than the character he has been given. Likewise Watson seems to have been given an insight into her character that is not available to the audience via the script however she raises the standard by her work. Cox is good but his character is impossible to buy into. Support is also good from McSorley Fitzgerald and others.Overall this is not a great film but it is not a bad one and I suppose Northern Ireland is a very difficult subject to tackle. The story is rather patronising at times and rather bland at others but the film does manage to get the tone right even if the scenes are a bit OTT at times. Bush may speak with grand words but this film and today's statements from Sinn FeinIRA show that there are no easy answers and no matter what the will of the people is if guns are still involved then there will never be a peace. The film captures this truth well shame it doesn't do much else as well.".

It is like a virus. It wears people down and changes them. Makes them harder and sexless. This is well portrayed in this movie. Boyle DayLewis has been inside almost all his adult life and is immature but well contained.Boxing is not the heart of this movie  indeed it could live without it completely. It gives a dramatic centre while the real drama is elsewhere and the message is not contained in the punches. In lots of ways it is a ticket selling con.Director Jim Sheridan My Left FootIn The Name of the Father has done well with the limited material that forms the script. He uses a cool blue to replace the cold grey of the real Belfast. This prevents the place looking as dreadful as it really is and losing the audience.Ken Stott plays an alcoholic boxing trainer who has a good heart and wants for the best. Sadly I don't put great store in men that decide they want to live their life in a stupor. Stott is a good actor though.There is also a love story in this movie with DayLewis starting top pick up the pieces with his old flame Emily Watson. However the situation is complicated as her close relations don't fully approve for reasons I don't want to go in to here.Any film that involves boxing has to nod to films like Rocky and Raging Bull  and this film acknowledges it without borrowing too much. Indeed this is not really a boxing picture as I said before more a film about a man that uses boxing as he has very little else to cling on to.The real weak point is the way exterrorist Danny Lewis is welcomed back and made a hero out of. Wouldn't his criminal record not prevent him from being welcome on the British mainland? Equally how good a boxer is he? Can't tell from the evidence here. Also you need a license to box in the UK  and these are not handed out willynilly.Small quibbles aside The Boxer is a better film than I thought it would be. It doesn't rub my nose in it any longer than necessary and all the thing really needs is something to climax on. What they come up with here is pretty weak and open.".

The imagery of how the people live in this war zone is haunting and bleak never to be forgotten. Daniel DayLewis is superb in his deeply moving role and he is surrounded by an exceptional cast. Particularly outstanding is Emily Watson as Maggie a magnificent performance that lights up the screen and warms the heart. Watson is indeed one of England's most gifted actors perhaps the finest of our time. Her quiet beauty brilliant eyes and depth of humanity are simply overwhelming and watching her on screen is a powerful cinematic experience without equal. It is outrageous she is not even listed as a cast member on the IMDb first page when she was originally prominently featured as DayLewis' costar. Anyone who sees this film will never forget her work here and the image she presents of loveliness strength and smoldering sexuality.".

What I mean is that I'd seen 95 of the filmthen they cut it off!! For years I always wondered what happened at the end and finally I've gotten around to it.Before I talk about the movie I did find the choice of rolls for Daniel DayLewis very interesting. After doing My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father he chose yet another film set in Ireland or Northern Ireland. Because of this and especially coming after In the Name of the Father there is a HUGE sense of Dj vu not only for the location but because BOTH films are about an Irishman who has been imprisoned for IRA activities. Though in this film DayLewis' character is much calmer sweeter and subtle than in these other filmsplus you really have to admire the way he prepared for this role.The film begins with Danny DayLewis about to be released from prison. I don't recall what it is he did to get there but it had to do with IRA activities and Danny is sick of prison and wants to put it all behind him. As far as he's concerned although he's now 32 he wants to pick up with his old boxing gym Holy Family and distance himself from the IRA. He obviously has become disenchanted by them and their killing of innocent civilians. Now he just wants to box and do something very radical for Northern Irelandopen up the gym to young wouldbe boxers of all faithsnot just Catholics. His goal is to facilitate the healing through boxing and his idea generally is well receivedthough his old compatriots are not particularly pleased and do everything they can to keep the fires of hatred stoked. Plus his old flame Emily Watson isn't sure if she should be loyal to him or her rather toxic family.I really liked this film but noticed there were LOTS of divergent opinions. As a person with neither British nor Irish heritage perhaps that is why I appreciated its message that it's time to stop the violence and have peace. I am sure this simple message irritated many on both sides of an insane conflict though to me it just seems like a reasonable thing. Extremely well acted and quite grippingI sure liked this film. I should warn you however the film is tough to watch at times. The boxing match with the Nigerian is one of the toughest and bloodiest in film history and the ending sure is tough to watch as well.By the way it could be because I watched the film streaming through Netflix but there were no captions. I really would have preferred them since I am a bit hard of hearing and it's sometimes tough for me to understand the accentsand I am sure some others might have the same experience.DayLewis' acting method is legendary and even a bit scary. Even most method actors would be shocked how he puts himself into the roles such as behaving as if he had severe cerebral palsy every secondeven when the cameras were off while doing My Left Footnecessitating insane things to accommodate his 'disability' by the crew. Here according to IMDb he worked for three years THREE YEARS! to perfect his boxing skills! Wow...that's dedication. And while it might sound crazy he is the actor with the most lifetime Oscars for Best Actor with three statuettes to his credit so far!!".

Though a decent movie and well worth watching it just doesn't captivate like I'd hoped for. Daniel Day Lewis succeeds in portraying Danny Flynn a former prestiged boxer and IRA member recently released from prison after a 14 year sentence. Upon his release his politics have changed and he seeks peace through training kids boxing at a local gym much to the dismay of his former IRA friends. Emily Watson plays his long lost and bitter lover enraged with him for leaving her. Both do fine jobs of acting but it feels like the chemistry just isn't there plus their history is never quite explained and leaves you frustrated at times. My real problem with the film is that Danny Flynn's character never truly develops and all you really find out in this film is that he was a boxer associated with the IRA and loves Emily Watson. It briefly tells that he was imprisoned for his involvement with the IRA but never specifies. It's obvious Sheridan wanted to touch upon the theme of Prostestant and Catholics struggle in Northern Ireland to live with each other in harmony but personally I feel he failed at doing so.".

Perhaps I have been put off by the skyline shots of another town that quite obviously isn't Belfast and the look of a film that could have been shot in 1987 not 1997 but the politics was patronising  a boxing match could bring together 2 communities that have been locked in hatred for 30 years? Substituting one sort of violence for another albeit a much less nasty violence is the kind of logic that causes these unending wars. Give me a break Sheridan.

So I guess THE BOXER could have been yet another movie where Britain gets the blame for Irelands troubles .This is what I liked best about THE BOXER . the IRA terrorists seen here arent written as the brave and noble freedom fighters of so many Hollywood scripts  here theyre shown to be the worst type of gangster  People who feed on their own community . Yeah most of them want peace but thats down to pragmatic reasons not down to any deeper morality . Anyone wanting to see a more objective drama centering around the secterian divide in Northern Ireland should watch this film . Its not a film to watch over and over again but at least its a mature thoughtful drama on Ulster . Its also well acted by the cast especially Ken Stott".

Her heart is laid bare in this film and she tears open her very soul to allow her audience to witness the performance of a lifetime. Ms. Watson's beauty her eyes so alive with life itself her soft vulnerability are overwhelming. The screen is nothing less than electrified by her presence in this film and it is she alone who dominates all.

You will be left breathless and rocked to the core as Ms. Watson spiritually assaults your senses and drives you mad with desire compassion and pure adoration. In that sense this is typical of any Emily Watson film. However she brings out the best in DayLewis just as she did Fiennes in Red Dragon and that inspiration and challenge she offers fellow actors is something new we are seeing in the profound efforts of Emily Watson. It is certainly welcome and does nothing to diminish her. In fact it makes her own gifts and genius even more clear to all who love cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Flynn Daniel DayLewis was imprisoned in his youth for I.R.A. involvement. He is released after 14 years. His old girlfriend Maggie Hamill Emily Watson is married to Danny's former best friend. He returns to his old neighborhood to a cold reception. In prison he refused to openly support the I.R.A. but he also never named names. He wants to live life free from the political turmoil. He reopens the old boxing club allowing neighborhood kids and himself to fight in nonsectarian bouts. Maggie's father Joe Hamill Brian Cox is working for a ceasefire prisoner releases and ultimately peace. Maggie's husband is in prison and she still has conflicted feelings for her old love Flynn. When the cops show their support for the gym I.R.A. hothead Harry Gerard McSorley is angered and the gym gets fired on.

Boxing has a strange crosscultural appeal up North and there were indeed instances of Protestant boxers in Catholic Clubs and vice versa. Needless to say when any one of them took on an outsider there was an immediate unity that politicians could only dream about.When during the first match Ike introduces the Protestant parents of a boxer who once boxed for the club Sammy Orr but who died in the Troubles I just choke up.Everybody loves a fighter and if you were in similar circumstances ???.Don't forget it's a more than slightly sanitized version of real life.

What makes this story more ironic is that the principal character who now rejects political violence is a boxer and a good one too. The man who hurts people for sport wants nothing to do with fighting. This alone makes this movie worth watching. Daniel DayLewis is a wonderful actor. He brings an intensity to the title role which carries this movie. At first the scenario a man recently released from prison coming on to an old girlfriend who is now married seems contrived but in this movie it works. Yet the main theme of this movie is not about romantic love but about conflict and healing. That an entire community is divided by a wall serves as a metaphor for what are obstacles to communication not only on the social but on the personal level as well. This movie is about what happens when someone tries to breach that wall.".

The treatment of the theme is very hypocritical in the sense that the film seems to mean well on the surface but as it goes on one feels that someonethe director producer et. al.did their best to cram in as many gratuitous sensationalistic moments as possible. This naturally defeats the film's original purpose which was apparently to showcase more progressive methods for treating mental illness than were generally used at the time.So why do I keep coming back to this picture at least once a year?

We never get to see a promised climactic board meeting which will decide the fates of Crawford and Stack.

Not that there was any real legitimacy in how it was portrayed the fact that it was part of the movie as evidenced by the borderlines. Even the term borderlines is made up but the point about the conception of the mentally ill having capacity to heal was discussed. I guess 'borderline' was meant to express only borderline insane.

One is to check out yummy adorable Williams later to portray The Green Hornet on TV as a psychologist anybody would happily go nuts for. Another is tough butch always watchable Ford as a rigid henchwomannurse from hell. Finally everyone stand back....the queen of the cinema is comin' through!! Joan Crawford! With a unique and flattering hair color and a couple of dandy dresses Joanie makes the most out of a smallish role as a nurse administrator bent on keeping her hospital stuck in the past refusing to adapt to the newfangled ways of Stack. Crawford though she certainly had some major career highlights was also seemingly always having to hang on and carve out a career in an everchanging everthreatening Hollywood. That's why this role suits her so well. She and Ford make a wondrous tagteam of brittle severe oldguard battleaxes who do everything they can think of to prevent Stack from introducing his modern methods of psychiatric treatment. And who can forget her famed judo class in which she struts around in a figure flattering leotard with a chiffon sweat scarf! and tosses adversaries to the ground?! With the ludicrous artsy stagey band of group therapy patients who make up Stack's first experiment how can one help but root for the shackle and straightjacket team of Crawford and Ford?? Bergen opens the film with a truly embarrassing and overwrought scene at a movie theater. One has to wonder if it was this film which gave her that trademark raspy voice since she screams continuously and has a penchant for tearing off her own dresses but that's for Stack to figure out! Paige is way way out there in her shocking portrayal of a very loose nutcase as well. There's even some unheard of actress who was borrowed from someplace who has an unhealthy attachment to a bird. This lady's scenes seem to be cut in from another movie altogether as the lighting and cinematography of all of her scenes barely match the rest of the film! Only the allstar cast which also includes Vaughn Oliver Barrie and the shamefully underutilized McBain makes this thing watchable. This is the basic look hair style and color for those that care that Joan was sporting when she strode onto the stage at the Oscars to collect Anne Bancroft's award as a snub to Bette Davis who had gotten a nomination for Baby Jane. She said she felt it made her look old but it actually suited her well and was better than the dyed red she went with later on. Keep an eye out for the Pepsi wagon at the hospital picnic. Crawford was quite a pioneer in the product placement racket. Though her brightlylit closeups are legendary in this movie Crawford actually was noted for letting the rather ill Marshall a pal from the old days of Hollywood get his work done first so he could be done for the day thus causing her to be shot later in the afternoon rather than in the more preferable early hours.".

Robert Vaughn plays Bergen's husband. The setting is a mental institution where Polly Bergen is brought after she goes insane at a theater showing West Side Story. She wasn't the first. The focus is on her case as the director of nurses Crawford and the doctor in charge of an experimental program Stack duke it out  naturally Crawford favors things like discipline and confinement she would and Stack wants to treat the patients as people and give them therapy. I don't know where the drugs were unless they didn't have them in 1963. I'm pretty sure they had Librium though Polly didn't seem to be on it.This film has TV written all over it including in its choice of the actors most of whom did major work on television. It's not strong enough for a feature film though it looks for all intents and purposes like a B movie which it perhaps was. Robert Stack is pretty onenote. Crawford in 1963 still looked good in a leotard but the rest of her is plenty scary. I'm not sure the portrayal of the conflict was correct in its dynamics  nurses have a certain amount of power but riding roughshod over a doctor's orders...I suppose with Crawford heading up the staff it's more than possible but not realistic.Janis Paige gives a lively performance as a manhater and there is the ubiquitous nonspeaker Barrie the nice one Corby the delusional one Hugueny and the one who will probably recover Bergen. Herbert Marshall plays the head of the institute  by 1963 he was 73 and had enjoyed 50 years on stage and in films. After a distinguished career The Caretakers is thankfully not his last credit. Constance Ford played a nurse from hell who is not a credit to her profession. There were two hunks with the last name of Williams back in the day  Van and Grant  this one's Van.

It is also a questionable movie in how it portrays these women all of whom are borderline cases and none of whom are openly diagnosed for us. Still some of the most radical behavior is stuff I've seen first hand and so it isn't completely unreasonable.The big theme is interesting to see in retrospect this seems to be about the very first shifts from large hospital care of the mentally troubled to residential care. The key to this is the notion that the patients they call them consumers now can form small interactive families that encourage emotional and psychological support. It's a kind of giant cocounselling and I think it's been shown to work in the fifty years since.There are several equally strong characters as the plot follows one and then another from patient to nurse to doctor. Joan Crawford gives a steely powerperformance as the head nurse though only now and then. Herbert Marshall briefly appears as an aging wise figure in his second to last film. The rest of the cast is made of lesser known actresses who act out the different characters of this woman's ward with disarming conviction or theatricality if you don't buy into their illnesses. The lead doctor is played by Robert Stack who never strikes me as quite up to any acting task but then he's just a figurehead of authority and progress. The movie is in the hands of the women.Director Hall Bartlett doesn't have much of a career as director but he's managed to get a terrific cinematographer Lucian Ballard to make it a visually brooding and beautiful experience. And the music is by one of the best Elmer Bernstein. The copy of the movie that streams on netflix has a flaw in the sound which was unfortunatethe quiet portions including some important conversations were very quiet and then when the music and screaming explodes in other scenes it'll hurt your ears. Very very loud. It made for a clumsy viewing moving the volume up and down backtracking now and then to see what we missed. Expect to be impressed and moved and possibly slightly shocked. Overlook some of the neatened up psychology that is a product of both the era and the era the movie was made. And don't look for a surprising plot. Instead you'll get to know a few of the women and when it gets to the final scenes it'll be moving and even a little joyous. If you let it.".

The problem with this film is that it tries to be groundbreaking with its depiction of mental illness but this is something we have seen over and over again. This is essentially a poor man's version of The Snake Pit. While that classic touched your heart and cheered for the heroine in The Caretakers there is no likable character around.Polly Bergan plays the nut eh patient. Dressed in fashionable clothes and quaffed hair that reaches gigantic proportions she gets hauled in when she freaks out at a local movie house. You know she's crazy when she doesn't even wait for her change! Not only does she freak out but she runs up to the movie screen doing her little I'm crazy holding my head dance! She gets hauled away by men in white coats. She then enters the world of The Caretakers. It should have been called General Hospitol because there is tons of conflama going on here. Joan must have had flashbacks when she played the same character in Possessed. A top notch thriller and a great performance.Nurse Lucretia Joan is the head nurse who teaches her nursing staff karate during work hours so they can protect themselves from the patients. Robert Stack speaks so softly that I had to continually turn up my volume control. I guess that was his attempt to create drama the earnest Doctor. This movie tries so hard to be groundbreaking and that is the problem. There's very little entertainment value here no likable characters and Joan looks totally plastic including her hair which is AquaNetted to death. This film has a made for TV feel to it. I give this movie 2 limp bitch slaps out of 5. Seeing Joan in leotards earned and extra point from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that tries very very hard to be profound and say something. However due to some overthetop performances and almost angelic leading man Robert Stack the film turns out more like a soap opera than a meaningful drama. As such it is almost like a guilty pleasurea film you can laugh at from time to time and enjoy on a camp level. It's a shame really as the central message is important and timely.The film begins with Polly Bergen going nuts in a movie theater and being taken to a psychiatric hospital. Despite her very flamboyant performance I actually think Miss Bergen did an excellent job playing someone losing her mind perhaps reading through parts of the script helped her achieve this. It must have been very tough to overemote that much and yet still stay convincing. In fact most of the other mental patients were acted well and the film did a great job of showing the mentally ill.My problem with the acting in the film should be squarely placed on Robert Stack and Joan Crawfordor at least the writers for creating such ridiculous and black and white characters. Stack was an idealistic psychiatrist who always knew what he was doing and never made a single mistake despite being a bold innovator. He was like a god in human form and everything he said seemed wise and profound. On the other hand Crawford seemed like both Nurse Ratched from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST as well as Fay Dunaway from MOMMY DEAREST!! She was the head nurse and not even once did she do anything good or decent but instead was a complete obstructionist who fought good Dr. Stack at every turn. While this sort of bickering seemed very much like the film THE COBWEB also set in a mental institution but made in 1955 it was a bit less like a soap opera and focused more on the patients and their progress. THE COBWEB was pure 100 soap.Now the idea behind all this was good and predated the deinstitutionalization movement by about a decade. The idea of treating patients as people and putting them in the least restrictive environment was wonderful and a welcome change from the horrible days of institutionalization for life common up until that time. It just needed to address these valid concerns in a more realistic less sensationalistic and more balanced way. Overall it's a good intentioned and interesting film that is also quite bad in places and can't rise above mediocrity as a result.By the way during the picnic scene look for the hot dog cart. It has a HUGE Pepsi sign on it at the insistence of Miss Crawfordwho was on the board of directors for the beverage at the time and insisted on such product placement in all her later films. It makes watching the films funyou can play who can spot the Pepsi? with your friends.".

It just needed to address these valid concerns in a more realistic less sensationalistic and more balanced way. Overall it's a good intentioned and interesting film that is also quite bad in places and can't rise above mediocrity as a result.By the way during the picnic scene look for the hot dog cart. It has a HUGE Pepsi sign on it at the insistence of Miss Crawfordwho was on the board of directors for the beverage at the time and insisted on such product placement in all her later films. It makes watching the films funyou can play who can spot the Pepsi? with your friends.";

For example the opening scene of Polly Bergen breaking into hysterics in a movie theatre as she wanders in front of the screen is a GREAT visual idea but Bergen's performance of madness looks ludicrous. The film without quite knowing it is really all about how society victimizes women by making them crazy or diagnosing them as such if they stray out of line. Therefore the nuthouse aspect is best seen as a metaphor because it's hard to take seriously the valiant understanding doctor with newfangled ideas about group therapy or Joan Crawford as bitter resentful head nurse with big eyebrows and very tight face. Watch it for the camera work and the subtext.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a terrible movie. Well let me qualify that. The photography by Lucien Ballard is fine.First we have a psychiatric facility basically run as a prison by stern and unyielding Joan Crawford who works under the spineless director Herbert Marshall. Crawford teaches her scowling nurses judo. Then psychiatrist Robert Stack arrives with his assistance full of new ideas such as group therapy and grounds privileges. Nasty sparks fly between Crawford and Stack. I will not spoil things by mentioning who wins. I needn't bother since you already know.But this is all unimportant anyway. The main point of Hall Bartlet's and Harry Greenberg's screenplay is to put a lot of suffering on the screen. Polly Bergen is a middleclass housewife who has taken to hallucinating and is committed by her loving husband Robert Vaughn. We see Bergen reassured by the reassuring Robert Stack then subject to electroconvulsive therapy and rape. We get to enjoy Janis Paige's rants against everything in the world especially men. There is a mute patient. There is always a mute patient sometimes several. We get to see a pet bird squashed by a demented inmate. There is a good deal of blubbering about formulaic personal problems in the group therapy sessions.First the clinic or whatever it is could have been designed by Princess Cruise Lines. It's plain gorgeous. And you get to smoke whenever you want and you can smuggle in a bottle of booze and have a party without the screenplay explaining just how you are able to do that.Then the facility must have a make up department of its own perhaps run by Max Factor Incorporated and a hair salon staffed by Sidney Guilaroff's students. The wardrobe is exquisite. Patients get to lounge around in gear derived from the tailored clothing of China with just a touch of elegance in the handembroidered frogs.Polly Bergen is an attractive woman and a decent actress but I do wish she'd quit being raped on screen. In Cape Fear it was the brawny and feral Robert Mitchum. Here it's a grim gang of frowning determined lovestarved male patients  in a dark room with the radio blaring some crummy jazz. She's probably been raped in all her other movies as well though the assaults may have taken place off screen and never mentioned in the dialog. I wouldn't go so far as to argue that she got to like rough sex but it wouldn't surprise me if she had. Who knows what games one plays in the boudoir? I don't mean to single out Polly Bergen. Half her dialog seems to consist of hoarse screams and there's nothing she can do about that. Robert Stack on the other hand has made two or three good movies. In To Be Or Not To Be he was animated. Here he acts according to the configuration he so successfully parodied in Airplane. When he tries to smile the viewer hears an agonized creak.It's not really worth going on about. It's a psychiatric soap opera. The movie dissolves in sobs of relief at the end. Birds chirrup joyously. A new sun peers over the horizon. Flowers sprout buds and then bloom in quick motion as in a Walt Disney nature film. The atmosphere is suffused with hope and the poor viewer with a sense of having wasted part of his life.".

In the Thirties it was Private Worlds the Forties gave us The Snake Pit the Fifties the Cobweb and finally in the Sixties The Caretakers. In the following decade it was One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. You can see a bit of that and the other films in The Caretakers.Joan Crawford plays the head nurse in the hospital who is a great believer in discipline in the ward. She has an assistant a regular nurse Ratched in training in Constance Ford. She's got no use for the new fangled ideas that Robert Stack is bringing to the hospital most prominent among them group therapy. In fact my favorite scene is Crawford giving judo lessons to her nurses the better to protect themselves from some patients who might turn on them in an instant.Both Crawford and Stack battle for the soul and mind of the hospital head Herbert Marshall who is old and tired and basically listens to whomever talks to him last. The best acting is done by the women in the group which consists of such varied types as Polly Bergen Janis Paige Diane McBain Sharon Hugenny Virginia Munshin Barbara Barrie Ellen Corby and Ana St. Clair. The film is almost a combination of The Women and Caged only set in a mental hospital ward for women instead of a prison. Each one of these actresses presents a sharply delineated character. Joan who after Baby Jane got nothing but horrorterror films was lucky to get this part the better for her fans to remember her in something other than trash in the Sixties. Stack is his usual professional self who makes psychiatry look like a noble calling. The two have some interesting scenes together as professional rivals who see the treatment of the mentally ill from different perspectives.But the real heart of this film is the patients. Above all Polly Bergen is one you will remember best from The Caretakers.".

Why? Because they were almost always severely abused as children... often sexually and often by fathers older brothers grandfathers uncles andor a single mother's boyfriends. And they were threatened within an inch of their lives if they told anyone about it by the perp andor the perp's accomplices often including mother and other family members. Put another way they were Raised In Hell. And when temporarily disinhibited They... Are.... ANGRY about that. Suffice it to say that The Caretakers is overdramatic and histrionic to the point of being incredible by current standards. But in many ways the script was barking up some of the right trees. TG most posttraumaticstressdisorderstricken borderlines are no longer dealt with in anything remotely like what is seen here but... back then... they were.";

None of the characters is totally evil they are ambiguous and develop a sort of empathy with the viewer. Scott Glenn plays an owner of a brothel but also a family man concerned with the future of his son. The addicted and violent character of Brendan Fraser has a deep trauma from his childhood. Angie played by Catalina Sandino Moreno is divided between Sinatra and Paul. Wemba played by Mos Def is a simple honest worker that accepts to participate in a dirty business to raise easy money. The excellent Brazilian actor Matheus Nachtergaele performs a travesty in a key role. Watching this film somehow I slightly recalled After Hours a comedy of errors in New York. The lighting uses weird colors yellow red green and together with the bad weather highlights the underworld of a poor and dark area in the cold So Paulo in a filmnoir style. The story is predictable there are many coincidences but I liked this movie. My vote is seven.Title Brazil 12 Horas At o Amanhecer 12 Hours Until Dawn".

Films they hadn't been able to see under German occupation. These BW flicks initially came into vogue in the '40s became more popular in the postwar era especially as Bfilms played behind more conventional cinema from Hollywood and lasted up until the classic Golden Age to about 1960  or maybe 1958  as Touch of Evil is usually cited by film professors as the end of the classic noir period.It's interesting to note that film noir is not a genre but rather a mood style pointofview or tone of a film. This tone can be blended with other genre's to form a most satisfying effect most recently the film Brick exploited noir conventions in High School setting!.Caper films with its intricate plotting and criminalcharacters existing on the periphery of society are some of the most significant examples of famous noir works. Most feature a tone of pessimism and darkness and mainly share the form's visual style. But their main focus usually lies in the way they detail the strategies of the crime that typically end up in fatal outcome suggesting that there is a moral order to the universe and that bad guys should not succeed.Crime Capers fall into several categories. In recent times we've seen the jazzy stuff produced by Guy Richie and Soderbergh. In the 70s we saw the existential masterpieces by Melville. In the eighties we've seen caper films that were really romantic comedies at heart. Indeed the fusion of capers has made its way into many a subcategories heading.The same can be probably said for thrillers although less fusions exist with classic thrillers. This category usually sticks to increasingly tense dramatic situation and if anything veers into the realm of action films. Note that both Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct feature action set pieces that could easily be cut into a Bruckheimer film.JTTEOTN is not a caper film a thriller an actioner or even a straight noir  its all those things and none of them. Journey to the End of the Night suffers wrongly from being a not instantly categorizable work not in the marketing sense but in the processing sense i.e how our brains orient to story who am I supposed to root for? Brendan Fraser? No. Scott Glenn? No. Mos Def yes finally but not wholeheartedly because even the saintly Wemba is a drug runner who undertakes his mission solely out of greed. Its these types of transgressions that play against the contemporary mores and a viewer's desire to enjoin and identity within the first ten minutes with a hero. Still and all I would argue that it is precisely this break with convention that has such an a lasting effect on the viewer. And makes JTTEOTN a most powerful postmodern noir.".

The effect is wonderful and stirring and by the end of the movie you feel like you've been on an emotional rollcoaster. The plot is plain. Brendan Fraser is in love with his father's wife. He wants to run away with her and start over in a new country. Brendan has no respect for the old man because he is essentially a pimp  Scot Glen owns a nightclub where girls sell themselves. One night a man is offed in the club and leaves behind a bounty of drugs.

The effect is wonderful and stirring and by the end of the movie you feel like you've been on an emotional rollcoaster. The plot is plain. Brendan Fraser is in love with his father's wife. He wants to run away with her and start over in a new country. Brendan has no respect for the old man because he is essentially a pimp  Scot Glen owns a nightclub where girls sell themselves. One night a man is offed in the club and leaves behind a bounty of drugs. Scot Glen and Brendan decide to sell the drugs rather than hand it over to the cops  Scot Glen has his own designs about starting over and getting out of the business.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting work in the film noirgangster genre. The story has to do with the bad blood between father and son played out over one night in Sao Paulo. The tone and mood of the movie seem to reference many more famous high profile films that deal with the same topic matter. This one seems very interested in stylization over telling a completely coherent story. And its this stylization that sets it above regular crime dramas. Bredan Fraser plays the loser coke addicted son without any fear of looking bad. HIs performance is very emotional and wild. Not easy for any actor to pull off. His character is a villain without any morals. Made that way by his father Scott Glenn an initially likable sympathetic sort who as the tale unravels is not so nice a guy after all.By far the film's hero Mos Def the only hero because everyone else is evil or not big enough to really know gives a winning career defining performance as a Nigerian immigrant who out of loyalty to his employer agrees to partake in a drug deal. The raptor gives a nuanced thoroughly believable performance as wemba in maybe his best role as a film actor.The other big star of the film are the colors. The nighttime images and camera. It appears to be heavily saturated and grainy and apparently enhanced through the DI process. Cinematographer aficionados will surely want to see this for the interesting lighting.If the film has a flaw I would cite an overall bleak and hateful tone of the script. Very anti human being. The violence feels almost gratuitous with some shots of face slashing feeling too long or ultimately unnecessary. The squeamish will look away! But nothing very troublesome compared to the gore in the horror genre.Recommended to those who like dark material.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Director Searching for his Signature March 3 2007 Reviewer Grady Harp Los Angeles CA United States  See all my reviewsFor those of us who found much to admire and appreciate in Eric Eason's 2002 little powerhouse of a film MANITO that placed Franky G in the limelight as a sound actor inside that hunky exterior the release of JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT held much promise. Unfortunately with moving into the arena of 'major features' with popular big actors in a script that is deeply in need of surgery proves a step too quickly taken. While it is easy to see Eason's intentions in this very dark literally! film it is compulsively doctored with phony 'reality ideas' that misfire.The basic story is a family of Americans who are deeply involved in the crime scene brothels of So Paulo Brazil intricately bound in their crime acts but both planning to escape the quagmire of the dingy life of the city and return to America. The father Sinatra Scott Glenn is living with Angie Catalina Sandino Moreno  the star of 'Maria Full of Grace' and they have a small child Sinatra's son Paul Brendan Fraser is also in love with Angie and plans an escape from the dregs of Sao Paulo after he manages to work a drug pass engineered by his father. The sale is to Nigerians who speak Yoruba and when the 'messenger' meant to pass the drugs for the money abruptly dies in a brothel with a transgender prostitute the panic begins who can make the pass that night? Sinatra hires a Nigerian Yoruba speaking dishwasher Wemba Mos Def who agrees to take the drugs to the drop site and it seems Wemba is the only decent character to keep his bargain and his word. Paul is enraged with the death of the original middleman and ends up disfiguring the prostitute present at his death. The drug deal falls into problems Paul is unable to convince Angie to stand by him which mean leaving Paul's father and the possible endangerment of her son and things bog down plotwise so that story ultimately ends with the only persons to care about are Angie and Wemba.Eason makes his story all happen in one night and the constant factor is a greenish darkness that hides almost everything  and that may be a good thing! The script is Swiss cheese the acting is for the most part sadly directed the cast is poorly chosen and the only real redeeming factor is the chance to watch Mos Def continue to flesh out his career with well executed character roles. Eric Eason holds much promise as a director he was the awarded best emerging filmmaker by first annual Tribeca Film Festival in New York City in 2002 so perhaps this excursion into the 'big screen realm' can be forgiven as overstepping his material. In the end JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT is hopefully just a sidestep for a director who obviously has considerable talent. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting that so many people either rated this movie a 910 or a 12. I would suggest that those at the high end were dazzled by the setting and those at the low end were disappointed by the hodgepodge of what occurred there. I can't get excited enough to go to either extreme.I agree with those who said that Brazil was unused except perhaps as a marketing tool for the movie. There was virtually no interaction with the local culture except as a passive backdrop. The acting was uninspired. I didn't think Def was all that great although at least he underplayed his pathetic role unlike Fraser who was over the top to the point of ridiculous. In fact the only character that seemed decently played was the relatively obscure blind seer.The plot was full of holes disjointed and had no twists of any note. While others have detailed some of the major problems I would add in the assertion that thieves set upon Def knock him out and then ignore the backpack laying next to him and run off without it. And he lays there in what appears to be a high crime district for quite some time and nobody chances by to see what might be in the backpack. You also have to swallow a gang packing all manner of weaponry who decides who they deal with and don't deal with based on which Nigerian dialect they speak. How's that again? I can make a million dollars doing a drug deal with you but only if you speak a specific language from my home country. Otherwise the deal is off. Right. Then we have Def with a suitcase full of cash but unable to make a phone call. It wasn't clear why that might be exactly but he never asks anyone for change tries to change one of the bills in the pack or does anything else to make what is supposed to be a critical call. Someone said he was cast in a racist and degrading role. I don't know about that but he certainly seemed to be playing a character who was just plain stupid and unassertive. Quite a contrast with Hitchhiker in which he was the hip insider. I'll take the latter.Still there was some action enough of a plot not to fall asleep on a few bizarre characters of passing interest some gore a touch of sadism interesting lighting at times ... I didn't fast forward it at any point. Mediocre but sufficiently entertaining to keep your attention. See it if the alternative is reruns on TV.".

But most of all it was set in Sao Paulo Brazil. Exotic locations fascinate me. Big mistake! The plot revolves around the owner of a brothel Glenn and his degenerate son Brendan Fraser. The clueless pair stumble across a suitcase full of heroin plot to sell it and divide the loot. We soon find out the cokehead son plans to doublecross his father. The tale is complicated by the sudden unexpected death of their coconspirator a cocainelaunderer whom the father replaces with a dishwasher he hastily recruits from his brothel's kitchen. The story goes downhill from there.The plot is shot full of holes. As a consequence I was tempted to pull the DVD and watch cable news. Instead I stuck it out. Another big mistake.Virtually every character in the movie is braindead and morally twisted. Fraser and his cronies are about as stupid and believable as the Keystone Cops or the Three Stooges. There is no character development possibly because characters drop in and out of the story for no apparent reason destiny?. Consequently the action is contrived. Predictably a bunch of characters are destined to be bulletridden but by the end of the film who really cares?To make matters worse the script is a poorly written piece of junk. Characters repeat themselves time and time again either because the writer thinks we're as dumb as his characters or he wanted the film to last more than five minutes. As a result the actors either sleepwalk Glenn through their role or play it so over the top Fraser as to be farcical. All the other actors similarly struggle with the poor script and weak plot.What is the point of this pretentious tripe? It's hidden no doubt somewhere in the taglines You can escape anything but your destiny and Where life is cheap... and hope is priceless.. If you can make something out of that nonsense you're wiser than I. This movie is pure fluff.Oh and since all the action takes place at night Sao Paulo Brazil is nothing but a dark yelloworange blur.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at the Tribeca FF on Friday night. The cast ensemble is one of the finest the problem was the bad script and the out of control actors. Catalina looked like a deer caught in the headlines the director could not seem to get her to emote anything more mild confusion. Brendan Fraser of whom I'm a big fan just spun out of control it was overacting that should have clearly been reined in. The death scene by Scott Glen at the end elicited many a laugh which says a lot about the bad script. To suddenly come back to life just long enough to save his love and friend with the final words of go.... before croaking was hilarious I felt bad but could not help laughing out loud actually I was hysterical with laughter. A big plus to Mos Def and Alice Braga they were the saving grace of the film obviously in little need of direction I hope to see them all in a better directed film. Agreed that the cast seem uninterested or perhaps defensive during the QA session but I can't blame them after the audience's reactions.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and it is without a doubt one of the WORST films I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. It is a truly awful offensive unpleasant and hamfisted movie.Let me get the tiny bits of praise out of the way right now. Both female leads are good but totally under used. The film looks good but this is achieved by the lazy trick of filming a city at night through different filters here blue and yellow mostly. Also Mos Def is good.However the character he plays is a horrible racist stereotype the good and loyal black servant that I haven't seen in cinema in decades! He's a decent enough actor and manages to bring some humour and humanity to an essentially one dimensional role but he must have been embarrassed sitting up there watching his Steppin' Fetchit role unfold. It's lucky for him that he wasn't really on screen that much.Brendan Fraser was AWFUL. I've never seen a good film with him in it and to be honest I didn't know he was in this just there to see Mos or Mr. Def as referred to in the credits! but he is a terrible actor. At some moments when he was supposed to be portraying the low point to which his character had sunk he was overacting so badly that at least four or five people around me started laughing! The character he played was incomprehensible too. In an attempt to have his character merely seem complex he veers wildly between sobbing schoolboy brutal sadist doting boyfriend and petulant cellphone destroyer after he threw his second or third phone out the window we all started laughing at the idiocy of having the exact same lead character is violent and unstable he destroys phones motif repeated again and again. Scott Glen was okay I suppose. He did what he could with some of the worst dialogue ever committed to film but his character just didn't have anything going on beyond some very obvious and heavyhanded moments with his young son see he is a complex man he is a pimp who loves his son I am a smart writerdirector!.As I said earlier both Alice Braga and Catalina Sandino Moreno are good but have nothing to do except look scared and get battered.By the way if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this film please pay attention to the use of language. The clumsy way all the characters even when it's a Nigerian talking to a Brazilian transition into English is hilarious!The plot is a derivative mess of neonoir clichs and is so full of holes that I could have driven a bus up the red carpet and through the movie with no problems. I'm not going to dignify the film by summarizing it but lets just say that it involves a drug deal gone bad a crooked cop a few doublecrosses and a wacky shootout where multiple people who've been shot still manage to shoot back and take their own killer out. Total bull and ripped from so many other movies that I can't even list them though if you've seen Lock Stock and Reservoir Dogs itself a near parody of other noir crime movies then you've seen everything in this film's plot done waaaaaay better. Oh and there's an exotic psychic dude thrown in for good measure just in case you didn't get the memo that read Brazil is exotic.And so we come to the worst part of the movie its location in Brazil. There is absolutely NO NECESSARY REASON for this movie to be set in Brazil other than to dress a supercrappy crime film up with exoticized characters in short racist stereotypes and locales. As it began I was hoping for something that actually engaged with the complexities of Brazil like maybe City of God but this film is the polar opposite to that one! Do not believe anyone who says this movie is like City of God! They share nothing in common Journey to the End of the Night could be set in any city in the world. The hilarious thing is I was watching it and thinking that here was another example of a filmmaker using an exoticstrangedangerous setting to make a totally boring movie SEEM more interesting and then the director Eason gets up in the QA session and ADMITS IT!!! Someone asked why Brazil and he basically said No reason just wanted to set the story somewhere exotic! And he had the gall to suggest that he was thereby doing something revolutionary because this was a movie that wasn't about middle class white men! Eh hello you hypocrite?? The two leads are middle class white men!! The movie is about them they just happen to be in Sao Paolo exploiting Brazilians and an African! They're on the screen the majority of time and are the only characters with any discernible agency.I could go on and on and I have probably gone on way too long but I'm procrastinating on some work and this was easily one of the worst films I have ever ever seen... and I've seen The Avengers!In sum the characters are terrible most of the performances are as bad as the characterizations the plot is boring and derivative the dialogue is laughable and the politics of the whole endeavour are deeply suspect. Eason made a film about some white men exploiting some Brazilians. He somehow missed the irony of his being a white man setting a movie in Sao Paolo JUST to exploit stereotypical ideas about Brazil...".

If the script writers borrowed Celine's title for some allusive reason it escapes me.The movie is an unremarkable and predictable crime thrillerfamily drama. The dimlylit and grainy cinematographyset in the seamy redlight district of Sao Paulo Brazilis nothing special and the sentimental sound track weak plot and uninspired dialogue contribute nothing original to the genre.The roles are thankless and the actors in them give about the performances you'd expect from their Bclass status. The worst by far is Brendan Frazer. He makes a fine Dudley DoRight but his performance as a ruthless crime lieutenant is laughable. Frazer's baby face squeaky voice and limited range couldn't convey threat malice or even the weak psychological conflict the script calls foreven on his best days. The other performers are just about as bad.However there is one astonishing exception to all this lackluster ness and that is the performance of rap artist Mos Def who plays a Nigerian dishwasher turned drug courier when the real couriera genuine tough guydrops dead while having sex with a transsexual prostitute. Mos Def's character Wemba is a retiring young man a meek shortstatured student with only the most modest of aspirations in life. When we first meet him his drugdealing boss asks him about his background. Mos Def replies laconically but his dropped words halffinished sentences and subtle facial gestures convey his melancholy character and difficult and disappointed past to us at once. It's a beautiful morsel of acting.Wemba takes on the job partly out of need but mainly out of loyalty to his boss. While the written role of Wemba is hardly Shakespearian Mos Def is brilliant in what he does with it. And while one could barely give a damn what happens to the rest of these flat and unappealing characters Mos Def creates for his unenthusiastic but diligent courier a vivid likable threedimensional figurea simple soul who when push comes to shove shows unexpected couragenot because he has anything to back it up but just because he is good guythe sort of person who naturally does the right thing. He is not smart or capable or strong. And when he politely sticks to his guns figuratively speaking he is practically the only person in the filmother than the blind soothsayer and his dogwhose isn't popping a cap into someone at some point and defies the people who threaten him you know that he certainly won't be rescuing his own behind.Fortunately for Wemba if not for the movie the writers have thrown a bit of magic and fate predictable as always into the story mix here. And it is only that little bit of luck that leaves Wemba as last man standing in this otherwise silly little drugdealing bloodbath.I know nothing of rap music or Mos Def's career as a performer. But if this part is any indication of his thespian potential I'd say that boy can act!".

	schema:reviewBody "Mos Def plays the Bob Cratchit clone called Wemba here on his own time Wemba is studying to follow in Cratchit's footsteps as a bookkeeper a dead giveaway of director Eric Eason's remake intentions. Wemba works as a dishwasher for brothel owner Sinatra aka Rosso Scott Glennthe Scroogelike character. Sinatra gives Wemba a chance at a new life if he can pull off the sale of a fortune in cocaine left behind at the brothel when the Mr. Fezziwig standin The RussianJohannes Sioberg is gunned down in a murdersuicide by Mrs. Fezziwig Carla Esposito here in a tragic love triangle involving Sinatra's original drug mule Baaba Henry Babatunde Fadayumi. All Wemba need accomplish is to exchange the coke for the moneyfilled backpack of the Spirit of Christmas Past aka Bosco Tang Faroouq Olawale Sadia.Unfortunately Sinatra's partner the Jacob Marley character his son Paul Brendan Fraser is still alive and wants to get his hands on both the coke money and Fanny Scrooge known here as Angie or the second Mrs. Sinatra Catalina Sandino Moreno. Paul also believes he's the actual father of his stepbrother Tiny Tim dubbed Lazar Luke Denis Nolan in this retelling. In an effort to learn why Wemba is late returning to the brothel Paul sends his personal thug Rodrigo Milhem Cortaz in the Undertaker role to kidnap the Spirit of Christmas Future the blind seer Rui Polanah to learn which way the cookie will crumble.Meanwhile Wemba has made the exchange but he's knocked unconscious by the two Collectors designated as such in both the 1951 and the 2006 renderings. Fortunately his cash pack is still at hand when the Spirit of Christmas PresentMonique Alicia Bragacomes to Wemba's rescue. Before he can return to the brothel Rodrigo guns down Monique as well as the clairvoyant's seeingeye dog.Back at the brothel Paul already has sliced open the face of this movie's Mr. Groper the transsexual prostitute Nazda Matheus Nachtergale probably because Nazda had earlier snuffed out Baaba's life. The disfigured Nazda returns to Sinatra's office just after Paul has informed his dad he's confiscating all the drug money if Wemba ever returns. Nazda shoots Paul twice Paul shoots Nazda once and then Nazda puts two more bullets into Paul blasting him to his death in the courtyard way below the brokenout office window. Nazda dies of his own bullet wound a moment before Wemba finally brings home the bacon. Rodrigo is hot on Wemba's heels but Sinatra and Rodrigo exchange fatal shots with the brothel owner bestowing his wife and money upon Wemba before expiring. The Seer looks on benignly as Wemba Angie and Lazar prepare to depart. Unbelievably the Spirits have accomplished Wemba's transformation in a single night!While this remake was okay I still am most partial to the 1951 version of A CHR!STMAS CAROL aka SCROOGE starring Alistair Sim in the title role.".

All Wemba need accomplish is to exchange the coke for the moneyfilled backpack of the Spirit of Christmas Past aka Bosco Tang Faroouq Olawale Sadia.Unfortunately Sinatra's partner the Jacob Marley character his son Paul Brendan Fraser is still alive and wants to get his hands on both the coke money and Fanny Scrooge known here as Angie or the second Mrs. Sinatra Catalina Sandino Moreno. Paul also believes he's the actual father of his stepbrother Tiny Tim dubbed Lazar Luke Denis Nolan in this retelling. In an effort to learn why Wemba is late returning to the brothel Paul sends his personal thug Rodrigo Milhem Cortaz in the Undertaker role to kidnap the Spirit of Christmas Future the blind seer Rui Polanah to learn which way the cookie will crumble.Meanwhile Wemba has made the exchange but he's knocked unconscious by the two Collectors designated as such in both the 1951 and the 2006 renderings. Fortunately his cash pack is still at hand when the Spirit of Christmas PresentMonique Alicia Bragacomes to Wemba's rescue. Before he can return to the brothel Rodrigo guns down Monique as well as the clairvoyant's seeingeye dog.Back at the brothel Paul already has sliced open the face of this movie's Mr. Groper the transsexual prostitute Nazda Matheus Nachtergale probably because Nazda had earlier snuffed out Baaba's life. The disfigured Nazda returns to Sinatra's office just after Paul has informed his dad he's confiscating all the drug money if Wemba ever returns. Nazda shoots Paul twice Paul shoots Nazda once and then Nazda puts two more bullets into Paul blasting him to his death in the courtyard way below the brokenout office window. Nazda dies of his own bullet wound a moment before Wemba finally brings home the bacon. Rodrigo is hot on Wemba's heels but Sinatra and Rodrigo exchange fatal shots with the brothel owner bestowing his wife and money upon Wemba before expiring. The Seer looks on benignly as Wemba Angie and Lazar prepare to depart. Unbelievably the Spirits have accomplished Wemba's transformation in a single night!While this remake was okay I still am most partial to the 1951 version of A CHR!STMAS CAROL aka SCROOGE starring Alistair Sim in the title role.";

The characters are very richly done with lots of tension over a deal and the entire movie revolves around it.A number of characters accidentally cross each other's path and wind up influencing each other and I enjoyed that part of it as well. This is a dark and violent movie but very well acted and a decent script that has an attention to detail you don't normally see these days.The only part I didn't like about the movie is it was unrealistic when Brendan's character actually cared what a fortune teller had to say it's hard to believe a hardened criminal would worry about what he had to say for a second.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you ever doubted the impact that music has on movies just listen to Elia Cmiral's score in this film. From the titles on it creates the perfect mood for this dark thriller set amongst the urban sprawl of Brazil's So Paulo.A combination of elements makes this movie seem better than it really is. Although it has a setting that is more likely to crop up on World Movies with subtitles I was surprised to find that it starred Brendan Fraser and Scott Glenn and is in English for the most part.The film is set over the course of a single night. Sinatra Scott Glen runs a brothel in So Paulo. After inadvertently coming into possession of a large quantity of drugs he is about to make a deal with a Nigerian gang the proceeds of which will allow him to live comfortably in the US with his wife former prostitute Angie and their young son. He has the drugs and the Nigerians have the money. He intends to hand the brothel over to his older son Paul Brendan Fraser. However Paul plans to hijack the deal and steal the money for himself. The plan starts to unravel when Sinatra's Nigerian gobetween is killed the Nigerian gang will only deal with a Nigerian. Sinatra enlists Wembe Mos Def a Nigerian dishwasher from the brothel to take the drugs to the gang and return with the money.This arrangement sets off a great deal of paranoia especially in Paul. Then in the best traditions of the genre chance intervenes to disrupt everyone's plans. Before the fade out we are shown that there really isn't much honour among thieves especially down So Paulo wayThe setting is used to great effect and we get a feeling for the dangerous side of So Paulo. This obscures the fact that there are some fairly standard action scenes and the downbeat finale also seems fairly standard for this kind of film. Brendan Fraser as Paul taps his inner bad for this role  addicted to gambling and cocaine in one scene he slices off the earlobes of a transvestite after a fight and in another to prove he is beyond redemption he has an old man's dog shot.Scott Glenn always brings depth to his roles. He gains sympathy for his character despite the fact that he is not only a brothel owner but has now also become a major drug dealer  showing how easily movies can distort values.The only character to emerge with dignity is Wembe an unlikely hero who sticks to his word despite everyone's doubts and attacks from all sides on the streets of the city.The film is worth a look just for the fact that a fairly typical plot has been transferred from the mean streets of Los Angeles or New York to the even meaner streets of So Paulo.".

Plot holes the size of Manhattan and a cast of characters that are risible to say the least. The sleaze factor is high but then who gives a damn if the movie is any good  which it ain't! Scott Glenn and Brendan Fraser as a fatherson duo who own a brothel in Sao Paulo who enlist the aid of a Nigerian dishwasher to sell a suitcase full of cocaine to fellow Nigerian gangsters. Glenn hands the suitcase over to the dishwasher and sends him on his merry way to do the deal and bring back the money with only the dishwasher's word that he will return. Hmm... Bound to be a doublecross there. Well guess what? There ain't. And the gangsters hand over the money with no argument even though they are armed to the teeth the dishwasher is completely alone and unarmed. Okaaaaay... There's also an old geezer of a fortune teller in the mix who tells the grandmother of a girl who has absolutely no purpose in the story that her granddaughter is going to die. And she dies. The fortune teller drifts in and out of the story for no apparent reason is he symbolic of something? Only the writerdirector knows. The dishwasher is mugged but the muggers overlook the backpack full of money he is carrying. Okaaaay... Various complications including a shootout between Brendan Glenn and a transvestite who gave such great sex at the start of the movie that the original Nigerian scheduled to make the drug deal dropped dead. Hmm... Only the writerdirector knows. An unbelievably convoluted plot that careens all over the place with zero credibility. Where the performances are concerned Fraser does his hardest to flesh out his thoroughly dislikable character as does Glenn who has his legs chopped out from under him by the writerdirector's unsympathetic backstory. Catalina Moreno as the love interest for both father and son gives a credible performance though she has little to do aside from being abused and insulted by Brendan. The one good performance in the movie comes from Mos Def as the dishwasher. Nicely understated.The movie was made on the streets of Sao Paulo which is five times the size of Paris but might as well have been made on a couple of backstreets in Brooklyn or Queens for all the scope of the movie. The contrast between the wealthier neighborhoods of the real Sao Paulo and the impoverished backstreets fails to appear in this flick. The dialog is graphic in the extreme which only produces guffaws of laughter at the writerdirector's expectation of shock value in the viewer. If the story was stronger or more credible the dialog might have worked. As it is one merely chuckles at the naughty words.This reviewer virtually NEVER consigns a DVD to the garbage bin paid good money for the damn thing! but one viewing of this waste of time was enough. Watching the interviews with the people involved in the making of this movie one has to wonder what they ever saw in it in the first place. As mentioned at the beginning of this review it cost six million to make and only earned forty nine thousand at the box office. Those people who paid forty nine thousand would now like their money back.".

The fight is about the white town people blaming the Apache for the various crimes in the area. By watching this scene I know why I'm watching a Roger Corman movie. I'm not an expert on Roger Corman movies but I think he is always trying to make his movies different from other movies by doing scenes that no other director would do.The theme of the film is what makes this western somewhat different from other westerns. Corman is trying to deal with prejudice between the Indians and the white people. Anne LeBeau who is a 'halfbreed' lives with her brother some miles out of the Apache reservation. Her brother Armand LeBeau Lance Fuller is leader of a band of outlaws who are committing the crimes the Apache are blamed for. The town people want military troops from the government but they send Rex Muffett Lloyd Bridges. He starts an investigation and he starts with Anne. Anne who thinks she belongs to the Apache refuses to help him but somehow the fall in love anyway. Rex suspects Armand and questions Anne some more who is now troubled by the fact that Rex might be right. What is she going to do? Betray the Apache by turning her brother in? Or be responsible for a war between the Apache and the white men by protecting her brother. This is an interesting notion but I think it's poorly played out in the film. At the end Rex and his men are trying to ambush Armand and his men. It ends in a plain ol' shooting festival with Rex and Armand in a fist fight with Armand falling off a cliff. I think Corman could do a lot more with the theme in his film. By showing more of the tension between the Indians and the townspeople there would be a lot more tension in the film and then we could understand better why Anne has such problems. I think the story is OK the acting is OK Lance Fuller does a great job at playing Armand LeBeau the casting is OK everything is OK. That makes it a very dull movie. It had potential but in the end it turns out to be just another Hollywood western.".

You think a swarm of giant scorpions is bad wait until you see the biggest and baddest of the bunch...The Black Scorpion!!Willis O'Brien the effects genius from King Kong gets more than alittle help from Pete Peterson animating these arachnid monstrosities in all their stopmotion glory.The effects were very well done but unfortunately the transparent matte shots of the Black Scorpion entering Mexico City are terrible. Almost to the point where it ruins the movie. As is the constant once or twice would be enough close up of the scorpions face which is a drooling animated prop. It would have been wonderful to see the Black Scorpion trashing buildings and attacking people in the city rather than a poor matte shot of the scorpion running through the streets.Still overall a very enjoyable flick. The acting was actually pretty good compared to most of the genre films from the time. The best scene from this film hands down was the descent into the underground lair of the scorpions which also features not only a giant freaky worm but a huge freaky looking trapdoor spider as well! The spider and worm prop were from the famous deleted bottom of the ravine scene from King Kong. So this is as close as you're going to get to reliving that infamous lost scene. Other great sequences include two scorpions battling the giant worm in a fight to the death the scorpions swarming over and attacking a train at night the Black Scorpion slaughtering the smaller scorpions and the climatic fight between the Black Scorpion and the Mexican military in a soccer stadium.I miss these kind of movies!".

These creatures got released during a volcanic eruption and started wreaking havoc in the area around Mexico City.Of all the monsters created by the special effects guys including the great Ray Harryhausen the ugliest meanest nastiest creatures ever brought to the screen were these scorpions. They are ugly as sin emit an obnoxious drool when on the prowl and make a noise guaranteed to scare any kid or kid at heart out of his comfortable movie seat. And they are one of the few creatures which are not either from outer space or caused by radioactivity.When the scorpions start doing their thing scientists Richard Denning and Carlos Rivas are in the area as is ranch owner Mara Corday. In between trying to figure out how to combat the scorpions a little romance gets going between Denning and Corday. And there's a cute little kid around played by Mario Navarro who gets in all kinds of trouble tagging along with the scientists. But you can mute the romance and get into the action. I guarantee you will like the scene inside the volcano where Denning Rivas and little Mario have to deal not only with the scorpions but with giant earthworms and spiders. And the final battle in the Mexico City soccer stadium between the scorpion and the scientists and Mexican army is a tingler.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT  A volcanic eruption and earthquake in Mexico ravages the countryside and opens a fizzure into a subterranean world.  When citizens turn up missing it's discovered that huge scorpions the size of tanker trucks are coming out of the hole and preying on the locals.  An American and a Mexican scientist team up with a lady rancher to investigate and try to stop the killings taking a perilous trip down into the bowels of the earth where they witness battles to the death between oversized spiders clawed worms and scorpions.  They seal the fizzure opening but then find that several of the giant scorpions have escaped and are making their way towards Mexico City devouring anything they come across.  They attack a commuter train and peel the cars apart like bananas to eat the humans inside but this is where the largest of them a black 100footer turns on its smaller brethren and kills them all.  The lone black scorpion goes on to the city where it engages in a violent battle with the Mexican Army's tanks and helicopters in the city's Colisseum before being electrocuted.  As a big fan of Willis O'brien and Ray Harryhausen's stopmotion animation work I was impressed with this lowbudget monster flick as a youngster and remain so to this day.  I found it on VHS a couple of years ago and was pleased to see it released on DVD recently along with Harryhausen's Beast From 20000 Fathoms and Valley of Gwangi. The budget for this movie is barebones and the acting and story dull but the effects are incredible! O'Brien pulled out all the stops here and I've seen nothing in the genre more effective.  The scenes in the cavern where the monster insects prey on each other and the human interlopers would raise the hair on anyone and the attack on the train is absolutely nightmarish.  The final battle between the black scorpion and the mechanized army is a tour de force though the miniscule budget is glimpsed here and in a couple of other shots in the use of looped reels repeated for padding.  But if you're a fan of this stuff BUY IT.  You won't be disappointed.  Trivia Detail  I read in a review of the DVD release recently that O'Brien made use here of the spider models filmed in the lost cavern floor sequence in King Kong which was then edited out for being too scary.".

The cavern scene with the worms and scorpions is pretty damn good but that little brat Juanito needed to be scorpion bait from the beginning! Probably the funniest thing in the film is the reaction of the military men in the stadium when one of their own gets electrocuted because someone forgot to turn off the power....they just blow it off and go on.

Mexico setting works well music and sound effects are exemplary subEarth sequence featuring more creatures is eerie. Title refers to the largest creature in the climax budgetary limitations revealing a black traveling matte still mystical with fascinating zoomin camera shots. Some have faulted the scorpion's drooling closeups but I find them bonechilling. Even the main titles are innovative  alternating flashing whiteblack letters on whiteblack backgrounds set to gripping soundtrack. Defects some poorlyexecuted process shots and the leading actors Corday Richard Denning and Carlos Rivas are hammy and unsubtle and a CordayDenning romance occurs too late in the script especially after all the mayhem.".

Some have faulted the scorpion's drooling closeups but I find them bonechilling. Even the main titles are innovative  alternating flashing whiteblack letters on whiteblack backgrounds set to gripping soundtrack. Defects some poorlyexecuted process shots and the leading actors Corday Richard Denning and Carlos Rivas are hammy and unsubtle and a CordayDenning romance occurs too late in the script especially after all the mayhem.";

As cheesy 50's films go this one is entertaining if not a little slow in places.  The Mexican landscape looks authentic and the scorpions themselves are pretty good when left in the hands of Willis O'Brien.

The scorpions kill each other off until one giant one is left to wreak his vengeanceand whet his appetite in Mexico City.  The best scene is the one when scientist Richard Denningand his incredibly boring assistant Carlos Rivas and annoying stowaway Juanito are lowered into a giant cavern and the realm of Willis O'Brien's wonderful stopmotion animation.  The rest of the film is rather predictable but still entertaining and Mara Corday is at least pleasant to the eye as she must have had her clothing painted onto her.".

Seeing his involvement listed on the back of the DVD combined with the 6.99 price tag and the wonderful cover art made this one a nobrainer.From the very first few minutes it is very apparent that they are going for the same look and feel of the 1954 big bug classic Them! using the same dusty surroundings and a rundown house that looks eerily similar to the one used in that film. We do have to wait a pretty long time before being treated to our first sighting of the titular bugs and they look wonderful thanks to FX pioneer Willis O'Brien. My only complaints are that the screechinggroaning noises that they make are the same in tone and length every time they are on screen. Being from Ohio and unfamiliar with the machinations of an angry scorpion perhaps I am unqualified to comment on the realism of these effects. Another small problem I have with the presentation of the scorpions especially big daddy is that they always cut to the same closeup stock footage no matter where the action is situated nor if it is day or night. Other than that the effects are wonderful especially the stopmotion chases and the shadows of the pincers chasing after their human prey. Great stuff.The acting isn't too bad although it is underplayed a bit too much for my taste. If you're truly in peril you probably shouldn't be quite as interested in sharing a cocktail with the locals even if the lead actress is as hubbahubba worthy as this one.All in all this is truly one for your collection especially if you're a deadlybugaholic like me. I still prefer Them! but this one still sits proudly on my shelf.".

This picture was not only scary at times but funny also. Set in Mexico City for the final battle what made it funny were all the public announcements in English as well as the telephone operator speaking English was stretching the creditability. In the deep cavern a little boy named Juanito was truly a kid that you wished the scorpions would eat. He was a stowaway and when asked why he did it his answer was enough for any logic minded person to slap him I wanted to help. Another funny scene was when the military man had shot the weapon and missed the throat of the huge black scorpion so he was pulling the weapon and cable back in to try again and forgetting to tell the generator operator to shut off the 600000 volts of electricity in the weapon. He got the shock of his life. The scorpion sting is so deadly and after viewing this film you will understand why!".

The monsters are fantastic and you see them a lot. This isn't one of those cheapies where you have to imagine what the monster is doing offscreen. If I want to imagine I can go lie down in bed close my eyes and imagine a whole universe  plus it's cheaper than buying a DVD. When I spend my hardearned dough on a monster flick I want to see monsters! This one did not disappoint.2. The details in this movie put it in a class above the rest. For example every time the geologists would get near the volcano we see them in an otherworldly environment where smoke pours from the barren earth  no life or vegetation. Also the scenes at the bottom of the cave are surreal and primordial which supports the fact that these giant scorpions are a remnant of a time before memory.3. How about the fact that they actually use real Mexicans in a movie about Mexico! I know it sounds like a nobrainer but these old movies always have white people playing the part of locals. Yeah I know  the voice of the police chief on the radio sounds like Gary Owens instead of Speedy Gonzales that's why I rated 8 instead of 9. 4. The closeup of the drooling slathering slobbering scorpion is one of the greatest shots in the history of cinema. You just know he can smell that delicious human flesh and he can't control himself. Plus that scene at the train wreck where one of the scorpions has a human in its claw and the others come over and try to rip it out while the guy is screaming is pretty horrifying.Is this film perfect? No of course not but when you compare it to other films in this genre and time period it stands head and shoulders above the rest.

	schema:headline " A duller Mexican version of Beginning Of The End or Them";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very basic meat and potatoes monster film. It seems to be inspired by the giant grasshopperslocusts in the minor classic The Beginning Of The End only with giant scorpions instead of hoppers. Or maybe by the giant ants from Them. The whole movie just reeks of some Mexican producer seeing a movie like those two and saying Hey we could do one of those!! Only with something even scarier like er... One thing that distinguishes Black Scorpion is that the special effects are quite ambitious. Although Them had much more atmosphere. Instead of laughable process shots hoppers swarming an obvious picture postcard etc Scorpion features stopmotion animation of the sort later used by Harryhausen in movies like Clash Of The Titans. We all basically watch monster movies for the special effects for the featured monster so I think you could argue that Black Scorpion ups the ante somewhat from the original. Indeed there is a scene with giant scorpions swarming over the derailed cars of a passenger train that is actually pretty chilling even now and the final showdown with scorpion vs tanks and helicopters is almost worth the time spent getting to the end.The cast is attractive and likable enough except for an annoying little kid who obviously exists for no other reason than to endanger himself so the adults can rescue him. The screenplay changes things up a bit by offering two male leads  I couldn't tell who was supposed to be the alpha male for a while until the blond American started romancing the lead actress at which point the Hispanic guy seemed to get demoted to comedy sidekick. The writers surprised me though because I then expected the Latin fellow to get eaten once he was proved to be expendable...but instead he made it all the way to the end of the film and even got a few of the better lines.Verdict? I wasn't especially impressed by Black Scorpion.

The dubbing didn't suck nearly as badly as is usually the case with this kind of import but the voice acting was still nothing to get excited about. And the whole thing just kind of plodded along without picking up any momentum. One thing you could say about Beginning Of The End is that it did pick up steam near the end. Still it is a decent effort. It's certainly much much better than the 'remixed' crap K. Gordon Murray shoveled at us about this time. One aside  this was covered by MST3000 in their first season pre Kevin Murphy and it is obvious that the writers hadn't hit their stride yet. The riffs are mildly funny enough for a chuckle here and thereand enough to keep you coming back for more. But the writers and actors hadn't reached the level of drollery and whimsy they would achieve once Mike Nelson became the head writer and Murphy assumed the role of Tom Servo. At that point the folks at Bad Brains stopped trying to impress us with their bachelor of arts degrees and settled down to make some serious funny. Still as a taste of things to come their coverage of Black Scorpion is worth seeking out to see...once anyway.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very basic meat and potatoes monster film. It seems to be inspired by the giant grasshopperslocusts in the minor classic The Beginning Of The End only with giant scorpions instead of hoppers. Or maybe by the giant ants from Them. The whole movie just reeks of some Mexican producer seeing a movie like those two and saying Hey we could do one of those!! Only with something even scarier like er... One thing that distinguishes Black Scorpion is that the special effects are quite ambitious. Although Them had much more atmosphere. Instead of laughable process shots hoppers swarming an obvious picture postcard etc Scorpion features stopmotion animation of the sort later used by Harryhausen in movies like Clash Of The Titans. We all basically watch monster movies for the special effects for the featured monster so I think you could argue that Black Scorpion ups the ante somewhat from the original. Indeed there is a scene with giant scorpions swarming over the derailed cars of a passenger train that is actually pretty chilling even now and the final showdown with scorpion vs tanks and helicopters is almost worth the time spent getting to the end.The cast is attractive and likable enough except for an annoying little kid who obviously exists for no other reason than to endanger himself so the adults can rescue him. The screenplay changes things up a bit by offering two male leads  I couldn't tell who was supposed to be the alpha male for a while until the blond American started romancing the lead actress at which point the Hispanic guy seemed to get demoted to comedy sidekick. The writers surprised me though because I then expected the Latin fellow to get eaten once he was proved to be expendable...but instead he made it all the way to the end of the film and even got a few of the better lines.Verdict? I wasn't especially impressed by Black Scorpion. The 2nd rate derivative screenplay was too predictable and bythenumbers decent stop motion effects were undercut by laughable ridiculous closeups of the 'drooling' scorpion that looked like a rubber theater mask made by talented seventh graders.

It helps that we get some good close ups of the scorpions showing off the practical effects. Wait does stop motion count as practical effects? It doesn't seem to hold up well.I was disappointed the scorpion didn't appear at first but to be fair most of the movie did in fact feature it. I didn't know there would be other giant creepy crawlies in this film. It was hard to even recognize that worm. Well realize it was a worm is what I mean. It would have worked better if it was trimmed by a half hour. Then again that wouldn't have been enough for a full length movie. As a cheesy little 1950's scifi movie it's just mediocre. I remain impressed by how it looks with the designs. 12".

Like most 'red blooded' scientist males of this era he is suitably wolfish towards women. In this case though he meets Teresa Alvarez Mara Corday who is no pushover. She can ride shoot and run a ranch and when she wants a man she gets him on her terms. I enjoy watching the interplay between these two.Most of the other characters tend to just clutter up the screen  Hank's companion scientist has little to do but be a sidekick and the 'great' Dr. Velazco is an awkward midmovie addition. The little kid is cute but cute little kids are so overused in 50s movies. He gets annoying fast. Every time I watch the film I keep rooting for that underground spider...but it never quite catches up to the kid. In my dreams though the outcome is very different. Bwaah hah hah hah.One of the best things about watching 50s B movies is the science or the absurd lack thereof. In this film the scientists are very lax. In several situations Hank acts as if he could care less about geology he is much more interested in Teresa. And how is it that two geologists explore a giant underground grotto and don't even consider that it might link up with nearby and wellknown caverns? Later the two geologists learn about the proximity of the grotto to caverns under Mexico City and and are shown...a map! Duh. Why didn't they think of studying a map before now? Ah those wacky geologists always chasing after women and forgetting about basic scientific procedure. But the local scientists are hardly more dedicated or professional. Heck they down test tube shots of tequila in the lab during coffee breaks.The monsters are the showpiece of the film and they do not disappoint. The creatures are awesome and the stop motion action makes them look really creepy. They move fast and attack swiftly. Very cool. I love the close ups of the drooling creature  how did they make it look fabulous and goofy and scary at the same time? The paintedin scorpion rampaging through the city is not at the same level of quality as the stop motion creatures but it certainly does not ruin the movie for me. And how about that grotto sequence! By far the very best part of the movie and as good as it gets in the 50s.All in all an excellent giant bug monster movie one of the best. I think most people consider Them! to be the better movie and they are surely correct. But personally I think this movie is more fun.".

	schema:headline " One of Willis O'Brien's  Pete Peterson's best StopMotion Films!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Black Scorpion 1957 is an awesome 50's SciFi Film with Top Rate Effects Supervised by Willis O'Brien The Lost World '25 King Kong '33. Top notch StopMotion Animation some of the best I have seen done by grip turned animator Pete Petetson  his first film was some of the StopMotion on the original Mighty Joe Young 1949. Which was near the end the animation he did. I have read 2 other comments they say Them! 1954  Tarantula 1955 are far better films I don't agree with that simply because neither of them match the special effects that were used in The Black Scorpion. I mean Them! they were like large Prop Ants controlled by crew members on the side off set so u can't see. You are already limited there with how much the ants can move which makes that not the greatest technique but Them! did win an Oscar for best Special Effects good effects just not as good as StopMotion Animation Special Effects. Now Tarantula 1955 more movement since most scenes of that film used a real Tarantula magnified on screen to look 100 Feet Tall. Some scenes actually used a large scale prop Tarantula with movable limbs. On the close up scenes of the eyes gazing through the house window at a Pajama Clad Mara Corday that was the large prop Tarantula. Also the inside shots of the Tarantula ripping the house apart on the inside shots that was the Large Prop Tarantula as well. The outside shots were of course the real Tarantula magnified. Which I know how they did that if you really know Tarantulas it was actually in a struggle with another animal or insect on the scene of it pounced upon the house  destroying it. All Brilliantly done too. So with a real Tarantula  Large Prop Tarantula you are limited to what u can do. Now with StopMotion u are not limited u can have the creature or creatures do whatever u want by moving them one frame at a time. And if u only move them so much each time the animation can look very smooth  not jerky cause I have seen some jerky shitty animation  this is some of the best I have seen. So I think The Black Scorpion 1957 is a better 50's Atomic SciFi Thriller Giant Creature Feature then Them!  Tarantula. Because of the spectacular StopMotion Effects done by Willis O'Brien  Pete Peterson. Any fan of StopMotion  fans of Effects used for older SciFi Films would know StopMotion was the best just like CGI is for those types of films now. Even in a computerized world I pick StopMotion over CGI. The acting  cast is also a par over the usual in this film. Great acting from the stars Richard Denning  Mara Corday both recognized for B SciFi Films of the 1950's Corday was also leading lady in Tarantula '55  The Giant Claw '57. My favorite scenes in the film are probably 1 when the 50 Foot Scorpions dislodge the train from the tracks  devour humans like they are flies. Then the 100 Foot Black Scorpion comes fights then kills them. My other favorite scene would have to be at the end in The Stadium when the Black Scorpion is fighting the military with the tanks guns  helicopters. How they finally hit that soft spot under the throat with the electric cable how it keeps on fighting  getting back up I thought when I first saw the film it was awesome it was like the thing was never gonna die. So I give this film an 8 It is the second best 50's Giant Monster Movie. The best I think is It Came From Beneath The Sea 1955 of course because of Master Ray Harryhausen's ground breaking StopMotion Animation Work in that. The Octopus had so much character in It Came. More so then any of the scorpions in Black. But still The Black Scorpion is awesome! I don't care how much better Them!  Tarantula did in the Theaters then The Black Scorpion. Also what the critics say means nothing. I like The Black Scorpion better then both those films. The only film from that period similar that I think is better is It Came From Beneath The Sea 1955The Master Of StopMotion Animation Ray Harryhausen obviously is the reason which I already stated. So any StopMotion Fan or Fans of 50's Giant Monster SciFiers should check it out.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Black Scorpion 1957 is an awesome 50's SciFi Film with Top Rate Effects Supervised by Willis O'Brien The Lost World '25 King Kong '33. Top notch StopMotion Animation some of the best I have seen done by grip turned animator Pete Petetson  his first film was some of the StopMotion on the original Mighty Joe Young 1949. Which was near the end the animation he did. I have read 2 other comments they say Them! 1954  Tarantula 1955 are far better films I don't agree with that simply because neither of them match the special effects that were used in The Black Scorpion. I mean Them! they were like large Prop Ants controlled by crew members on the side off set so u can't see. You are already limited there with how much the ants can move which makes that not the greatest technique but Them! did win an Oscar for best Special Effects good effects just not as good as StopMotion Animation Special Effects. Now Tarantula 1955 more movement since most scenes of that film used a real Tarantula magnified on screen to look 100 Feet Tall. Some scenes actually used a large scale prop Tarantula with movable limbs. On the close up scenes of the eyes gazing through the house window at a Pajama Clad Mara Corday that was the large prop Tarantula. Also the inside shots of the Tarantula ripping the house apart on the inside shots that was the Large Prop Tarantula as well. The outside shots were of course the real Tarantula magnified. Which I know how they did that if you really know Tarantulas it was actually in a struggle with another animal or insect on the scene of it pounced upon the house  destroying it. All Brilliantly done too. So with a real Tarantula  Large Prop Tarantula you are limited to what u can do. Now with StopMotion u are not limited u can have the creature or creatures do whatever u want by moving them one frame at a time. And if u only move them so much each time the animation can look very smooth  not jerky cause I have seen some jerky shitty animation  this is some of the best I have seen. So I think The Black Scorpion 1957 is a better 50's Atomic SciFi Thriller Giant Creature Feature then Them!  Tarantula. Because of the spectacular StopMotion Effects done by Willis O'Brien  Pete Peterson. Any fan of StopMotion  fans of Effects used for older SciFi Films would know StopMotion was the best just like CGI is for those types of films now. Even in a computerized world I pick StopMotion over CGI. The acting  cast is also a par over the usual in this film. Great acting from the stars Richard Denning  Mara Corday both recognized for B SciFi Films of the 1950's Corday was also leading lady in Tarantula '55  The Giant Claw '57. My favorite scenes in the film are probably 1 when the 50 Foot Scorpions dislodge the train from the tracks  devour humans like they are flies. Then the 100 Foot Black Scorpion comes fights then kills them. My other favorite scene would have to be at the end in The Stadium when the Black Scorpion is fighting the military with the tanks guns  helicopters. How they finally hit that soft spot under the throat with the electric cable how it keeps on fighting  getting back up I thought when I first saw the film it was awesome it was like the thing was never gonna die. So I give this film an 8 It is the second best 50's Giant Monster Movie. The best I think is It Came From Beneath The Sea 1955 of course because of Master Ray Harryhausen's ground breaking StopMotion Animation Work in that. The Octopus had so much character in It Came. More so then any of the scorpions in Black. But still The Black Scorpion is awesome! I don't care how much better Them!  Tarantula did in the Theaters then The Black Scorpion. Also what the critics say means nothing. I like The Black Scorpion better then both those films. The only film from that period similar that I think is better is It Came From Beneath The Sea 1955The Master Of StopMotion Animation Ray Harryhausen obviously is the reason which I already stated. So any StopMotion Fan or Fans of 50's Giant Monster SciFiers should check it out.";

	schema:reviewBody "When popular Hello! Project Jpop idol Matsuura Aya Ayaya was first announced as the new Sukeban Deka in Fukasaku Kenta's big budget movie adaptation of the popular 80's TV crime drama I had my serious doubts. I thought that the pixie faced Aya was just too girlie to portray the tough talking rough and tumble schoolgirl cop. I am happy to report that my fears were unwarranted and that Matsuura Aya proved to be a worthy successor to the role following successfully in the footsteps of her predecessors Asaka Yui Minamino Yoko and the always fetching Saito Yuki. Sukeban Deka Codename  Asamiya Saki is a fun movie which manages to stay true to the original TV series and at the same time update the character for current audiences. There is a lot to like about the movie  from the Maurice Binder 007 inspired opening credits to the finale showdown between Saki and renegade Tokumei Keiji Special Detective Akiyama Reika played with sheer camp by Vyuden idol Ishikawa Reika. Yet some may be turned off by all the rip offs Fukasaku seemed to have taken from other movies and popular entertainment. The haunting music more than echoes Silence of the Lambs with Fukasaku going so far as to introduce Saki a la Hannibal Lecter complete with a straight jacket and restraining mask. There is also the dooms day clock countdown which seems to be in imitation to the series 24. Even the forementioned showdown with Reika seems like a copy of the Bride's showdown with GoGo Yubari in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Fukasaku even takes elements from his own Battle Royale II with the use of human bombs and youth terrorists. Yet these elements add to the mayhem and madness of the film. While very much more darker than the TV series and the 80's movies the film also has some funny moments such as Saki's first attempt to use her trademark steel Yoyo. Aya fans will definitely cheer at the sight of her in a skintight battle suit in the finale. The movie isn't perfect however as there are frequent disjointed subplots that don't seem to lead anywhere and needless introductions of boring secondary characters. Takeuchi Riki is great as Saki's gruff handler Kira Kazutoshi and Sukeban Deka 1 Saito Yuki also makes a surprise cameo as Saki's mother in a bit of fan boy casting. Allinall the movie is great retro entertainment and does a good job at introducing new audiences to this cool character as well as giving fans of the 80s TV show something to cheer about. Probably the best of the Sukeban Deka movies which isn't a major accomplishment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to confess the weird title and sexy pictures of its star on the DVD box were what first attracted my attention with this film that and the fact it was directed by one of the minds behind Battle Royale. In fact the box cover suggested this would be another bloodbathstyle film along the lines of BR or Suicide Club. But while the film does follow some of the similar theme lines as those two films I don't know if I'd ever have wanted to go to school in Japan with all the suicides that are apparently going on! Yo Yo Girl Cop is far removed from these other shows.As I understand it YoYo Girl is sort of a female James Bond or Doctor Who in that it's a venerable role that has been featured in several other films and TV shows over the years and played by different women the actress who plays Saki's mother in this film was the first to play the role and she's treated with the same reverence you might see if Sean Connery appeared in a Bond film today. As a result there are a few things Western viewers might not get such as the significance of the YoYo for example. Or why when the villain suddenly reveals that he has brightly dyed hair that this is somehow significant. The entertaining behindthescenes featurette also reveals that the somewhat stilted proclamation Saki makes before her big battle at the end is a traditional part of the franchise much as 007 saying My name is Bond James Bond is a moment everyone waits for in the 007 films this film also pays homage to that tradition too.Western viewers might also not get the fact that this film's star Aya Matsuura is sort of a Hilary Duff type over in Japan actially I think all the female leads are singers. Aya does a great job and I could see how this role might make her a film star over there. Apparently she did all her own stunts which involve some slapstick action of the type you'd never expect her counterparts in America to do. Rika Ishikawa as the resident bad girl steals every scene she's in which in true Bond fashion is what a good bad girl is supposed to do.There are a few inconsistencies that detract from the film. You have to take it as given for example that Saki is able to heal a rather seriouslooking eye injury within the matter of only a few hours and also become a master of yoyo flinging although to be fair the film does show her screwing it up initially. And the revelation as to the true origin of the Enola Gay suicide club is very disappointing. But the performances humor and action  not to mention the cute girls  make up for it.One good thing though is unlike the horrific experiences with the North American DVD releases of Cashern and Avalon there doesn't appear to be any indication of major editing or alteration of the film. Hopefully that means distributors are finally starting to understand that North American viewers aren't interested in bastardized versions of these films.However do NOT watch the Englishdubbed version. I usually prefer watching the versions with the original language and subtitles but understand those who don't want to read their movies. But in this case the dubbing was pretty awful and would definitely give firsttime Wetsern viewers a bad impression.PS. Since writing this review I've read some very negative comments about this film on websites and forums where this new film is being treated the way most TV show remakes are treated  with contempt. Well just to add to my earlier comments I was able to enjoy the film in part because I approached it from a completely fresh perspective. It may or may not be better or worse than the original series but I'm definitely going to try and track down episodes of the original show if I can.".

The plot is disconnected and schizophrenic which wouldn't matter if the action were good but sadly it is not. The action scenes are far too infrequent and disappointing. The actors playing these bad girls are so thin and soft that every shot of action is laughable. I'd rather see the cast of Dawson's Creek take each other on. The quick and choppy editing during the fight scenes is necessary to cover up the actors' inability even to swing a rubber prop convincingly. The director Kenta Fukasaku continues to spiral down in his inability to follow in his father's footsteps Kinji Fukasaku director of Battle Royale The Shogun's Samurai The Yakuza Papers and Tora! Tora! Tora!.The DVD cover claims From the creator of Battle Royale. That's quite a stretch. That claim could be made only by the novelist Koushun Takami or director Kinji Fukasaku. And any comparison to the exciting Battle Royale does not stand up.".

That in itself is a reason to watch as far as I'm concerned!Aya Matsuura stars as Saki a hot rebellious teenager who is recruited by a special lawenforcement agency to work undercover in a school where students are being being turned to anarchy by a mysterious website that is counting down to an unknown event. With only 72 hours to go Saki must try and find out who is behind the site named Enola Gay after the plane that dropped the Hbomb on Hiroshima and what is due to happen when the counter reaches zero.Saki befriends Tae a hot nerd Yui Okada who she defends from a group of hot school bullies led by the very hot Reika Rika Ishikawa. And it is Tae who helps Saki discover what exactly is going on who is responsible and why.YoYo Girl Cop is an incredibly stylised movie it begins with some impressive opening credits in which the silhouetted title character flings her spinning weapon across the screen and the 'artistic flourishes' continue right up to the final. Sometimes the trendy editing gets a bit annoying particularly with irritating sound effects accompanying every cut or zoom but it generally suits the subject matter so I'm willing to be a little more forgiving about this particular bugbear of mine in this instance.Unfortunately the film doesn't really get going until towards the very end when Saki gets seriously miffed and dons her sexy getup. Up until that point she only dabbles in a bit of generally unimpressive yoyo flinging and gets involved in a couple of brief dustupsnothing too spectacular. Much of the time prior to this is spent on developing a plot line about bullying in the schoola commendable bit of social commentary which is vital to the plot but not exactly riveting stuff.For many western viewers YoYo Girl Cop with its OTT action and convoluted plot might be too much to handle. But for those who have learnt to appreciate the manic style of eastern fantasy cinema it is passable entertainment.It's also recommended viewing for those who dig Japanese cuties in PVC hotpants.".

Dumped on the streets she's given a chance to help the Police find out who's behind a plot to blow up kids in a school and possibly blow up the city as well. She's given a school girl uniform and a killer yoyo with which to protect herself. or something to that effect Made by the director of the second Battle Royal this is an improvement over that film while at the same time borrowing some of the angst and visual flourishes of that film. This is a good little movie that movies along even when you don't understand most of whats being said. The action is good its mostly martial arts until the final confrontation and several of the fights are better than many of the fights in recent American action films.There are a couple of problems for me. Allowing that I'm watching this in a language not my own the plotting of the villain makes little sense. There's something about the plan that suddenly peters out about an hour in. As I said I couldn't really understand what was being said but there was this sudden WTF moment when I suddenly had the feeling I missed about 10 minutes.I hope this will be cleared up when I see this in English dub or sub.The other problem is that the yoyo of the title doesn't really show up until the last half hour. Sure there are a few tentative uses but mostly its seen just in the final battle with the female baddie. It also doesn't help that the battle is also a tad anticlimatic after all thats gone before. I won't go into the fact that the battlefield changes a couple of times to work against our heroine like when a bad magically appears for her to trip over Definitely watchableassuming they don't blow any English dub The wrong dub will kill this so go for subsjust opt for rental or cable.".

It starts off well enough introducing us to our leads a juvenile delinquent and a grizzled old expoliceman working for some secret CIAesquire unit. But then it stops making sense fairly quickly. Why is it that our heroine able to singlehandedly fight off a roomful of cops is easily taken down by a few thugs? And why is it that later in the film she's able to take down the same group of thugs without breaking a sweat? The villains aren't particularly well fleshed out. No explanation is given as to why the head thug has amazing seductive powers over women without even saying a word yet it seems every female character falls madly in love with him. A subplot about websites for tormented teens is convoluted and nonsensical. Ridiculousness abounds and not in a goodfunny way at one point for example a tenminute monologue takes place entirely by text messaging. Really? They couldn't just say call? But the main problem with YoYo Girl Cop is simple not enough yoyoing! The yoyo weapon is introduced early on and then only teased at until the last reel. Even then it's not terribly exciting to watch in action.For those hoping this would be nonstop cute Japanese girls kicking ass with yoyos prepare yourselves for disappointment. 310 for the cute girls. The lack of yoyo action left me feeling a little ripped off though.".

	schema:reviewBody "The latest entry in the decadesold Sukeban Deka franchise is a worthy successor to the name and while it isn't at all necessary to be familiar with the other incarnations of the title to enjoy the film it does help the viewer catch a few mythology gags and shoutouts here and there. Production values are amazingly high for a lowbudget Japanese film it looks almost like a midbudget Hollywood effort at times which is a tribute to the director and the production design team as well as their selection of impressive and sometimes beautiful locations for shooting. It does suffer from a couple mysterious plot holes particularly near the climax but they shouldn't really impede enjoyment of the surprisingly wellcrafted story. Aya Matsuura's dark and gritty turn at Saki is a pleasant surprise to anyone who knows her primarily from her ubercutesy idol persona Ayaya and Rika Ishikawa likewise successfully plays against her image in her role as badgirl high school queen Reika. Despite the goofy sound of the title in English this is easily worth the money to rent or even buy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning If someone reports an instance of abuse again where none is obviously present than I will personally email the administrators here and ask them to suspend your IMDb account. And yes they can find out who you are.A deadly yo yo throwing girl goes undercover at a high school in an attempt to stop a terrorist organization. The lead actress has the charisma and time is spent developing some of the characters. The action is few and far between but suddenly the pace explodes as the viewer is treated to a laudably creative schoolgirl yo yo duel to the death. A showdown between the yo yo girl and half a dozen heavily armed madmen quickly follows. The score especially the theme song is excellent. Finally a schoolgirl fight movie worth watching.To elaborate on my summary paragraph above let's do a quick contrast between Sukeban Deka Kodo Nemu Asamiya Saki aka Yo Yo Girl Cop with the much touted and highly overrated Hollywood epic 300. While they are two very different films in terms of storyline and setting they are both firmly fixed within the encompassing genre of Action.That said the action in Sukeban Deka is far superior to anything seen in 300 in terms of choreography. I never knew there were so many ways to use a steel yo yo to capacitate an enemy  straight shots arm wraps floor bounces object manipulation etc. 300 showed us nothing we haven't seen before in terms of choreography because it focused too much on photographic tricks rather than on weapon movements which makes the experience tiring and repetitive. Such repetition can be avoided in two fundamental ways exceptional diversity of choreography e.g. Tom Yum Goong and situational excellence e.g. Sky High. 300 has neither but Sukeban Deka uses the latter because the first 75 minutes are used to set up the 15 minute finale.Now there's nothing particularly groundbreaking in terms of the general storyline or dramatic elements but they do provide a series of effective anticlimaxes that taunt the viewer into doubting the existence of a grand finale. This is a good technique because when the showdown between the two schoolgirls finally makes its appearance the excitement and intensity is enhanced due to the character interaction that preceded it. This makes for interesting comparisons to 300 which has almost no intensity whatsoever since antagonists are introduced mere seconds prior to getting slaughtered  which explains why critics get bored DURING the battle scenes in 300. A major no no for an action film.It took me two viewings to come to these conclusions because Sukeban Deka provides a different type of action experience that may leave the viewer in a bit of shock after an initial viewing. The opening hour may seem weak at first but is much better following a repeated watch because the viewer  now aware of the grand finale  can appreciate the buildup even more so. This is good stuff! I now wish to respond to some IMDb comments that I find grossly inaccurate. Jmaruyama points out some obvious references to American films i.e. 007 opening credits Silence of the Lambs restraining mask etc.. However this commenter makes a major mistake in claiming that the showdown seems like a copy of the Bride's showdown with GoGo Yubari in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Um huh? The fight in Kill Bill involved a sword and a meteor hammer while the fight in Sukeban Deka involved two steel yo yos. How on God's green earth are these duel's even REMOTELY similar? The only possible similarity is that a yo yo and a meteor hammer are marginally alike in structure  a blunt object at the end of a line  which means that the characters must swing or sling them in vaguely similar ways. Other than that there is absolutely NOTHING comparable between the two scenes so the claim that Sukeban Deka copied from Kill Bill is unwarranted. And considering how this film is a spinoff of other Sukeban Deka movies made in the 1980s makes the assertion even more ludicrous.Oobleckboy criticizes the action unsuccessfully by pointing out that the scenes are too infrequent but he doesn't seem to understand the concept of buildup and intensity detailed above which more than adequately explains the infrequency of the action as a positive element. He complains that the schoolgirls are too thin and soft apparently expecting some butch 200pound lady bodybuilders instead. Let me go out on a limb and say that such casting would have been a really bad idea. He then claims that the editing was quick and choppy but he provides no specifics as to what he's referring to. I never found the editing to be overtly choppy because the timing of the cuts were all logical in that they enhanced the action. I suppose that Oobleckboy expects Japanese actresses to be able to kill someone with a yo yo at 30 yards or throw a bladed yo yo so perfectly that it barely grazes the other actress's cheek. For the rest of us who live in the real world such cuts are expected.Make no mistake about it. Sukeban Deka requires a suspension of belief but that's one of the reasons it's such a fun experience  another being the outrageous overthetop and frequently cheesy premise. You may need to exercise a bit of patience for the first hour because the action is laid on thick and heavy at the very end but I highly suggest you give this one a shot considering the currently pathetic state of American cinema.".

To begin with just take a look at the DVD cover  a Japanese schoolgirl complete with uniform and a lethal yoyo striking a pose in front of a fiery explosion. How awesome is that? And the plot sounded very promising Saki Asamiya Aya Matsuura is terrific in the role a very troubled and violent teen is handpicked by a secret government agency to infiltrate a group of wouldbe high school terrorists. The group has already killed at least one other agent. They tied her hands together strapped a bomb to her and sent her out into the crowded streets. Nice huh? On the group's website they've started a 72 hour countdown clock but a countdown to what? It's Saki Asamiya's job to find out  and do it before time runs out. The film gets off to a great start with the whole explosion in the streets scene Saki's fight on her first day at school and a chase through a crowded mall. Add to that a funky vibe that runs through much of the movie the incredibly stylized look and a nice score the makings were here for a real winner. Unfortunately YoYo Girl Cop abandons the promised action and all but slams on the brakes in favor of melodramatic teenangst claptrap during the second act. It was enough to make me want to hurl. Life's tough  get over it already and get back to the yoyo buttkicking! The movie does redeem itself somewhat in the finale as Saki and her female nemesis don leather outfits for the highly anticipated allgirl yoyo fight to the death. As cool as that may be it comes way too late to save YoYo Girl Cop from being anything other than average at best.".

Okay. the main story premise is frankly absurd but the fans of the manga series are familiar with it and by this point don't care. Anyway what sets this version apart from its predecessors is the greater use of cutting edge special effects to go along with much more elaborate fight choreography. The camera tracks with the yoyo during fights creating great point of view action for one thing and often switches to the weapon or fists of her opponent during crosscuts. The shotmaking here was clearly influenced by first person shooter games and the action has a video game fluidity and sense of fun.

	schema:reviewBody "Only in Japan...Yo Yo Girl Cop was actually really cheesy but it worked on a great level. The action was nice overthetop and outrageous as you'd find only in Japanese movies.The storyline was equally cheesy and silly. A young girl is recruited by some odd police force to infiltrate a school and she is given a yoyo as a weapon. A yoyo! Yeah cool... So it is no secret that it is not the story that drives the movie but the action keeps the engine running.Despite it being a nonplausible story and cheesy movie then Yo Yo Girl Cop was actually great entertainment. It is a total nobrainer with lots of adrenaline and action.

The action was nice overthetop and outrageous as you'd find only in Japanese movies.The storyline was equally cheesy and silly. A young girl is recruited by some odd police force to infiltrate a school and she is given a yoyo as a weapon. A yoyo! Yeah cool... So it is no secret that it is not the story that drives the movie but the action keeps the engine running.Despite it being a nonplausible story and cheesy movie then Yo Yo Girl Cop was actually great entertainment. It is a total nobrainer with lots of adrenaline and action.

It's pretty hard to go into films like these without pretty low expectations of the splatstick stuff you're going to be exposed to but this came off like a cheap Suicide Club with imitations of Silence of the Lambs. Well again that sounds a lot more exciting than this movie was. Basically the problem is you watch this movie to see a girl kick butt with a yoyo and you get maybe ten minutes of that with a whole lot of random other stuff getting in the way.Not to argue with the writing. The dialog is pretty terrible but actually the plot isn't halfbad if someone would have taken through a few more drafts and maybe even tried to make it either more serious or more silly than it is. Instead it tries a little too hard to be both and through Kenta Fukasaku's poor control of tone ends up failing at both. Kenta has an eye for digital effects and making every edit seem like an exclamation mark but he doesn't know when to sit back and let the story tell itself. At least not in this movie it seems like the arena is open for him to do better elsewhere.So basically Saki Asamiya is deported from New York City and taken back to Japan where she's conscripted La Femme Nikita style into finding out what's up with this teenager suicide bomber website with a mysterious ticker. She integrates into school as only a moody teenager can is given a yoyo to play with and starts her investigation mostly by sneering and getting into petty arguments with classmates. Luckily though the classmates she despises the most are involved with the website in some random way or another and she's able to basically use momentum to find the badguy at the end. Kinda. There are a lot of plot holes and weird diversions involving Kira Riki Takeuchi the best performer in this movie and one of the best Japanese actors currently working the policeman who recruited her. Kira also has another important relationship with Saki which again could have been really welldone if taken more seriously but instead just came off as random and weird.Anyway one thing somehow leads to another a few bombs go off and you'll eventually get your yoyo fighting awesomeness. Actually even during the more terrible bits this movie is quite entertaining. It just has an illgotten attempt at emotional seriousness that doesn't work out for it or it's an actually emotionally serious film that can't stay serious what with the whole yoyo fighting thing or something. It should have been one or the other but it failed at both.PolarisDiB".

I've watched it twice with some friends since but they weren't very enthusiastic about it so I can imagine that for many people it won't pay off. It's an ingeniously constructed film that takes some patience and attention to watch. Made by the erratic Richard Rush this was his pet project for nine years. Although the direction is fine it's mostly a virtuoso piece of scripting credited to Rush and Lawrence B. Marcus based on Paul Brodeur's novel that makes this such a special film. A short plot outline Fugitive Cameron Railsback stumbles onto a movie set where megalomaniac director Eli Cross O'Toole promises to hide from the police if he replaces his ace stunt man who got killed earlier on the set in a freak accident while filming a scene. Is Eli trying to capture Cameron's death on film while he is performing a stunt? Reality and imagination soon blur when Cameron grows increasingly paranoid because Eli Cross doesn't let anything or anybody get in the way of shooting his masterpiece the way he wants. He doesn't seem to care about human life as long as his movie is shot in the way he wants it.Railsback is an odd choice for the main role but apparently the makers wanted a lowkey actor for the main part. Barbara Hershey gives a great performance but without Peter O'Toole's tourdeforce performance I doubt if the film would have worked as well as it did especially with such a challenging and multilayered script. He delivers his lines with such vigor that you cannot look away a grand performance by perhaps my favorite actor off all time. Such a pity that his later career mainly consisted of mediocre films at best and some disastrous ones sadly... I cannot imagine this kind of film being made in Hollywood today and even back then it might be called a small miracle it got made in the first place let alone released in fact it sat on the shelf for two years before release. Perhaps it's all a little too ambitious at times but with a cast like this and such a dazzling script it's definitely worth the effort. The DVDrelease by Anchor Bay comes with an extra disc loaded with extra's. Lots of interviews including one with O'Toole and a very peculiar  almost twohour !  documentary about the making of the film presented by Rush himself almost worth seeing in itself.Camera Obscura  810".

He doesn't seem to care about human life as long as his movie is shot in the way he wants it.Railsback is an odd choice for the main role but apparently the makers wanted a lowkey actor for the main part. Barbara Hershey gives a great performance but without Peter O'Toole's tourdeforce performance I doubt if the film would have worked as well as it did especially with such a challenging and multilayered script. He delivers his lines with such vigor that you cannot look away a grand performance by perhaps my favorite actor off all time. Such a pity that his later career mainly consisted of mediocre films at best and some disastrous ones sadly... I cannot imagine this kind of film being made in Hollywood today and even back then it might be called a small miracle it got made in the first place let alone released in fact it sat on the shelf for two years before release. Perhaps it's all a little too ambitious at times but with a cast like this and such a dazzling script it's definitely worth the effort. The DVDrelease by Anchor Bay comes with an extra disc loaded with extra's. Lots of interviews including one with O'Toole and a very peculiar  almost twohour !  documentary about the making of the film presented by Rush himself almost worth seeing in itself.Camera Obscura  810";

This movie has NEVER gotten the attention that it deserves. Maybe that's in part due to the difficulties involved in categorizing it. I don't even know in which section of the video store I'd start looking.Peter O'Toole is so swell in it. I love that enigmatic character movie director Eli Cross! Like the movie and O'Toole for that matter he's so hard to cubbyhole. You like him but you don't trust him. Like CameronLucky Steve Railsback's escaped convict character does you NEED to know exactly where his motives lie ... all in good time. You know Cross'll do whatever's necessary to get the shot but he's still got a conscience ... right? Would Cameron have been better off read safer just staying in jail ... hmmm?All the action in the film circles around this question and while the viewer and Cameron decide what to make of Eli it's a fun trip through the world of filmmaking how realistic a trip I've no idea. Great performances by O'Toole and Railsback along with Barbara Hershey Allen Garfield Alex Rocco and Sharon Ferrell add so much to the suspense.See this movie. You can feel how much fun it was for the cast to make. Look at Eli's devilish grin as he tries to soothe Lucky's worries. Try to imagine how many other movies have you sympathizing for an escaped convict. And don't worry if you don't know what to make of mad genius filmmaker Eli Cross because nobody else does either and if they do they ain't talkin' ... that might spoil the movie!".

The fact that the truth depends on the angle you happen to be watching from gives us all our unique if skewed and unfair perception on life. We're all puppets in someone else's dastardly play and we never know when that person that entity that divine being will cut our strings.This was director Richard Rush's dream project and it took him nine years to get it on the screen. And of course it would! It's multilayered original funny and packed full of story and circumstance that makes you think. Why would any studio want to touch it? Fox even sat on it for two years before giving it a limited release. Even on its umpteenth viewing it delivers again and again offering new angles and subtle clues.The viewpoint of this metafictional masterpiece is Cameron Steve Railsback a Vietnam vet on the run from the law. He stumbles onto the set of a WWI movie and accidentally kills a stunt driver. The director of the movie is the eccentric and megalomaniacal Eli Cross Peter O'Toole in one of his best ever performances who takes Cameron under his wing and protects him from John Law as long as he keeps his mouth shut about the accident.Cameron practices to be a stunt man and takes the place of the man he killed. But as the movie shoot becomes more elaborate and dangerous he falls in love with the leading lady Barbara Hershey and starts to suspect that Eli is trying to capture his death on film.Although it seems nasty the movie is wonderfully lighthearted and the outrageous stunt scenes are backed up by an awesome score by Dominic Frontiere. I've been humming that theme since I was 12yearsold when I taped it off Channel 4 in December 1992. I didn't quite get it back then but I nearly wore out that VHS watching it over and over. A long scene with Cameron running over a rooftop as biplanes attack and enemy soldiers give chase is pure joy. There is a great comic sense of humor in watching them trip over each other fall off and get blown up.John Law do not back down on their suspicion of Eli and through halfheard conversations and eavesdropping Cameron's paranoia becomes increasingly justified. Because the movie is seen through his eyes we never quite know what is going on with Eli. Is he a madman or just a crafty director? Would you believe that Peter O'Toole based his performance on his experiences with David Lean? Why he never won an Oscar it went to Robert DeNiro for Raging Bull is beyond me. He truly gives the performance of his career far exceeding even Laurence of Arabia. It also sucks that Rush never won for Director or Adapted Screenplay. Had he been awarded the golden statuette maybe he would have received more recognition. He's clearly a better filmmaker than most of today's hack artists.You simply have to see The Stunt Man. It's an overlooked gem and despite the wide praise it received it has never really reached a large audience. Now is definitely the time to rediscover this forgotten classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I won't carry on about the plot of this marvelous flick since it's already been adequately limned but do let me emphasize a few points that have been kind of grayed out in other comments. The score by Frontiere is outstanding from the uptempo opening blast to the final credits. It's not only unnerving but vertigo inducing so it supplements the plot perfectly. The photography is outstanding as well the colors appallingly vivid as in an MGM cartoon which in this context is most apt. It is a mysterycomedythrillerphilosophical disquisition after all. The Hotel Coronado in San Diego has never looked quite so palatial not even in Some Like it Hot. Rush's direction boggles the mind to coin a phrase. The film begins with a helicopter. A hand pops out of the helicopter and drops a halfeaten apple. The apple bounces on the hood of a parked car. We follow without comment the apple the line of events and it turns out to be what gets the story moving. There are multiple very strange touches throughout. As a movie star myself having been a faceless extra in half a dozen films I have to add that movies are simply not shot this way. An expensive and dangerous and ultimately lethal stunt is performed as we enter the actual narrative and there is only one camera rolling  and that in a helicopter so far away that its engine can't be heard? But it doesn't really matter. The movie plays tricks all along with the difference between reality and illusion an old game into which it's difficult to inject more life as this movie manages to do. At one point Railsback is told to perform a short if dangerous stunt leaping from one roof to another. He does so but the stunt escalates. Not only escalates but goes on and on with Railsback unexpectedly crashing through ceilings and floors in a shower of glass before winding up in the midst of drunken partying enemies who shout at him and laughingly lift his body above their heads and pass him around the room. It will shock you almost as much as it shocked him. O'Toole asks him after this long gag what it is he wants. Says Railsback Not to think I'm going crazy. The smallest parts are done well. A very authenticlooking German soldier with a cheery old face and big white mustache is loading his rifle for a scene in which he and his comrades are going to fire at Railsback. I hope those are blanks Railsback tells him. It doesn't say so on the box replies the soldier with a friendly tone and a big smile. Let me mention Eli Cross the director played by O'Toole. At one level this movie is made through his character into an examination of God and his whimsical sense of responsibility towards the human beings whose lives he controls. Eli Cross? I mean  okay  Elihu the crucifixion  the whole JudeoChristian tradition is embodied in that cognomen. Cross has a habit of riding around the sky in a giant crane whose seat drops unexpectedly out of space and into the middle of peoples' conversations. Before the shooting of the final stunt Cross raises his hand looking at the horizon and says something like I hereby decree that no cloud shall pass before that sun. And while shooting another scene the cameraman calls Cut. Cross pauses then asks WHO called cut? The cameraman explains that there were only a few seconds of film left on the reel so they had to cut at that point. Cross like the angry God of the Old Testament shouts that NOBODY cuts a scene except ME! After chewing the cameraman out thoroughly he fires him on the spot. You see if a movie is supposed to resemble life then ending a scene suddenly ends the filmic exposure of the two human conversants and only  well you get the picture. A lot of this rather obvious theological stuff seems to have gotten by unrecognized or at any rate uncommented upon. It doesn't need to be dwelt on. There are already so many layers to this film that the viewer can afford to be only half aware of any one of them at a given moment. It stands by itself as a kind of very strange comedy. I didn't find Railsback's background as a Vietnam vet put on very thickly by the way. It would be nice if God really were as accessible as Peter O'Toole is in this movie. All you would have to do to find salvation is jump through some welldefined hoops. As it is though I for one find myself muddling through from one day to the next simply hoping not to step on too many toes. Gimme a fiery hoop or a dive off a bridge any day. Just as long as my scene isn't cut too quickly.".

	schema:reviewBody "SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!Though I saw this filmwhich I highly recommendprojected with its 'Making of' documentary and enjoyed an inperson QA with director Richard Rush at San Diego's marvelous Museum of Photographic Arts in Balboa Park a year or so ago it didn't occur to me till last night that this brilliant entertainment bears striking resemblance to William Shakespeare's last great play 'The Tempest'. ConsiderEli Cross Peter O'Toole in a masterly memorable performance is Prospero the victimized yet himself rather cruel sorcerer who commands the spirits fairies and pixies of a remote island updated as a flamboyant eccentric royalmannered movie director in charge of many cast and crew members craftspeople stuntmen etc. as they shoot a film on and near Coronado Island. Whereas Prospero was embittered by betrayal and losing his Dukedom Eli is embattled by studio investors who would squelch his artistic vision. Both Prospero and Eli can be tender or sadistic by turns. Both can seem to appear from nowhere Prospero using his magic to become invisible at will and Eli popping in and out on his ubiquitous crane chair director Richard Rush's most fabulous contrivance.Nina Franklin gorgeous Barbara Hershey in perhaps her best role is Miranda Prospero's innocent wideeyed daughter updated as an upandcoming movie actress who is Eli's protg and former lover. Like Miranda to Prospero Nina is torn in her relationship to the mercurial director as he vacillates between the behavior of a loving father and that of a treacherous tyrant.Cameron the titular stunt man Steve Railsback whose performance one can't quite decide is canny underplaying or merely vacuous and weird is Ferdinand to Nina's Miranda the handsome mystery man who captivates her imagination and Caliban to Eli's Prospero the subhuman slave who is grateful for his master's protection and resentful of his abuse. Like Caliban Cameron's past is haunted but we later discover that he's actually much more an innocent like Ferdinand.

Rush's complex layered exploration of reality doesn't cop outand in contrast perhaps Shakespeare's play does. Cameron like Caliban survives and may advance. But Eli unlike Prospero 'this rough magic I here abjure' will likely carry on creating emotional chaos throughout his sphere of influence.

	onyx:emotionText "SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!Though I saw this filmwhich I highly recommendprojected with its 'Making of' documentary and enjoyed an inperson QA with director Richard Rush at San Diego's marvelous Museum of Photographic Arts in Balboa Park a year or so ago it didn't occur to me till last night that this brilliant entertainment bears striking resemblance to William Shakespeare's last great play 'The Tempest'. ConsiderEli Cross Peter O'Toole in a masterly memorable performance is Prospero the victimized yet himself rather cruel sorcerer who commands the spirits fairies and pixies of a remote island updated as a flamboyant eccentric royalmannered movie director in charge of many cast and crew members craftspeople stuntmen etc. as they shoot a film on and near Coronado Island. Whereas Prospero was embittered by betrayal and losing his Dukedom Eli is embattled by studio investors who would squelch his artistic vision. Both Prospero and Eli can be tender or sadistic by turns. Both can seem to appear from nowhere Prospero using his magic to become invisible at will and Eli popping in and out on his ubiquitous crane chair director Richard Rush's most fabulous contrivance.Nina Franklin gorgeous Barbara Hershey in perhaps her best role is Miranda Prospero's innocent wideeyed daughter updated as an upandcoming movie actress who is Eli's protg and former lover. Like Miranda to Prospero Nina is torn in her relationship to the mercurial director as he vacillates between the behavior of a loving father and that of a treacherous tyrant.Cameron the titular stunt man Steve Railsback whose performance one can't quite decide is canny underplaying or merely vacuous and weird is Ferdinand to Nina's Miranda the handsome mystery man who captivates her imagination and Caliban to Eli's Prospero the subhuman slave who is grateful for his master's protection and resentful of his abuse. Like Caliban Cameron's past is haunted but we later discover that he's actually much more an innocent like Ferdinand. As Caliban escaped a painful life to arrive at a less painful but more confusing scenario so does the army deserter Cameron escape the authorities and probable imprisonment only to find himself in Eli's kaleidoscopic clutches.Chuck Barton the stunt coordinator Chuck Bail an actual stunt coordinator would seem to be Ariel the foreperson of spirits and Prospero's right hand updated as the 'goto guy' who can arrange for Eli's every whim. As Ariel will be set free of service at the end of Prospero's scheme Chuck will further his career elsewhere when this production wraps.Sam the screenwriter Allen Garfield as one of his signature sensitive 'everyman' roles could I suppose be seen as Stephano the comicrelief character who befriended Caliban in hopes of exploiting him updated as an insecure fellow who knows his contribution is considered to be bottomofthetotempole by Hollywood tradition and yearns for greater income and respect.

He crosses a bridge and dodges away from an old car that is out of control. The car disappears. Later on he encounters a film about World War I being shot on the beach. The director is Eli Cross O'Toole who offers Cameron a job as a stunt man. It turns out that the stunt man was in the old car and drove the car off of the bridge as part of a scene being filmed and drowned. The police are sniffing around so O'Toole introduces Cameron as Burt the missing stunt man and the rest of the cast and crew play along.Cameron learns a lot about stunts as do we and he falls for the film's leading lady Barbara Hershey who at one time was involved with Eli. Cameron over time becomes increasingly paranoid and believes that the manipulative kind of crazy Eli wants to kill him.O'Toole Railsback and Hershey are all excellent  we first see Hershey in an old lady mask and clothing. Throughout the film she is beautiful silly and flighty as Nina Franklin and intense and committed as the character Nina plays. O'Toole is madcap and doesn't seem to care what happens to anyone as long as he gets the shot he wants and one can see how Cameron would be unclear about his motives.The print I saw didn't look particularly good  I wonder about the budget for this film. I think a good deal of the budget went to O'Toole and some of those amazing stunts as the film has a lot of TV actors in it  all good but TV actors nevertheless Alex Rocco Sharon Farrell Allen Garfield.This film is a little hard to follow but it's a good one about the value of perception and how it can change from person to person.

It has always been my feeling that if you are working with an original idea you are not highly thought of by Hollywood standards. I tend to scoff at bigbudget Hollywood productions tending to lean towards the sleeper films with individual stellar performances and this film has quite a few. Steve Railsback is in every scene in the film but his presence as the central character is not the only plot point. Peter O'Toole and Barbara Hershey are equally effective in their roles but directorscreenwriter Richard Rush is the driving force behind this movie and the entire production was dedicated to Rush and his vision. This is one of a few films which I can say is a visual joyride from beginning to end and Rush's need to get his product out to as many viewers as possible shows his love for the story. Many things are happening in The Stunt Man. Yes it is a film about the making of a film but it is also a comedy war drama love story actionadventure and yes even audience participation. If you haven't seen it yet rent it or buy it take a nice twoandahalfhour break and enjoy!!!

	schema:headline " How Tall Is King Kong?";
	schema:reviewBody "The original King Kong was 3'6 and the central gimmick of The Stunt Man is blurring the distinction between reality and the illusion created by film. Steve Railsback the main character is on the run for a silly crime and finds his way to a beach resort. As he enters the resort a song begins playing on the soundtrack 'Out of nowhere out of darkness into lightand you watch and wonder where you belong and the crowd it moves and takes you along.you ask yourself what good are your dreams in a world where nothing is as it seems'. The song sums up the title character's situation and its melody will replay several times later in the film. He joins a crowd watching the film production of a WWI battle sequence. The crowd politely applauds at the end of each take. Then during a new scene there are huge explosions and smoke obscures much of where the action is being staged. The onlookers and we viewers look on with horror as the smoke clears and reveals a beach saturated with blood and dismembered bodies. The onlookers scream the director yells cut and the stunt men pull themselves out of the sand unhurt. The crowd goes wild with applause far more appreciative about being fooled by the 'fabricated reality' than they were by their glimpse behind the scenes of the moviemaking action. And this is the structure with The Stunt Man viewers like those in the crowd are supposed to be kept off balance by this movie within a movie.Yet this is merely a device to advance the storyline which involves a complex theme about paranoia and trust. Railsback likens his relationship with the movie company's directorPeter O'Toole and by analogy everyone's situation at some point of their life to an incident he witnessed in Viet Nam. Someone stepped on a 'Bouncing Betty Mine' an antipersonnel device that while triggered by a person's weight does not actually detonate until the person steps off the device. At this point there is no choice but to remain standing on the mine trusting that something will happen to favorably change the situation. Just as in life there are times in the 'free will vs destiny' interplay when there is nothing you can do but place your trust a higher authority. Like 'The Ninth Configuration' a film made about the same time and highly recommended for those interested in this theme an authority figure works to redeem someone in his care by teaching them to trust someone or something even when everything screams for them to step off the mine. While The Stunt Man is an excellent movie which tells a valuable story in an interesting multilayered fashion it is not really the masterpiece that Director Richard Rush and its biggest fans claim. A lot of effort was made to portray Eli Cross the O'Toole character as an omniscient 'Godlike' figure and a genius filmmaker a necessary characterization if the film's theme is to be sold to the viewing audience. Unfortunately these efforts are largely undermined by the moronic nature of the film within the film. The artistic picture this eccentric genius is making is not even on the intellectual level of Laurel and Hardy's 'Flying Deuces' and it has about the same level of slapstick with none of the humor. So there is a major credibility disconnect. You have to sympathize with Wells as he had huge obstacles to overcome getting this film into production and he simply did not have the resources to stage a credible actionadventure tale. But a better approach would have been to stage small things well rather than grand things cheaply so the painfully onthecheap production design is ultimately his fault. A director bent on misdirection has a huge arsenal for manufacturing illusion look at the widely different techniques successfully employed in 'Pulp Fiction' 'The Sixth Sense' and 'State  Main' for viewer misdirection. It is easy because the viewer only knows what the director chooses to reveal yet the director must be careful that the viewer does not feel cheated. As Roger Ebbert said some of the stunts are staged so that they're not only deceiving to Railsback as intended but plainly impossible. And the stunts are sneaky at one point Railsback is on a tower that's blown up in flames. There is no plausible way he could have escaped alivebut the movie merely cuts to another shot of him without explaining his escape. A film that depends on deceiving us has got to play by its own rules. Deceiving the audience is the magic of movies but they can't be cheated on particulars. Overall the degree of misdirection was rather spartan and not particularly clever that darn low budget  meaning that they did not begin to create the degree of suspense that was necessary.That said there were some interesting little details to look for when watching this film A tight twoshot of Railsback and O'Toole on the beach they step onto a platform which turns out to be attached to an unseen crane and are lifted into the air the actors do not betray that this is happeningtheir conversation continues as the background changes. O'Toole compares Railsback to Alice about to enter Wonderland he asks him to close his eyes and then the scene cuts to a hairdresser telling Railsback to open his eyes and see his physical transformation. Watch for the many deep focal transitions particularly at the dinner scene and the literal framing like a painting with a frameof many shotswhich is used to promote the everything is a fabricated illusion message. Watch for the piglets spilling out of the baby carriage during one of the battle scenesanother Alice element. Watch for the very inventive shot of Railsback looking into the rolled down car window shot through the rolled up window on the other side with Barbara Hershey's face reflected in the frame.".

	onyx:emotionText "The original King Kong was 3'6 and the central gimmick of The Stunt Man is blurring the distinction between reality and the illusion created by film. Steve Railsback the main character is on the run for a silly crime and finds his way to a beach resort. As he enters the resort a song begins playing on the soundtrack 'Out of nowhere out of darkness into lightand you watch and wonder where you belong and the crowd it moves and takes you along.you ask yourself what good are your dreams in a world where nothing is as it seems'. The song sums up the title character's situation and its melody will replay several times later in the film. He joins a crowd watching the film production of a WWI battle sequence. The crowd politely applauds at the end of each take. Then during a new scene there are huge explosions and smoke obscures much of where the action is being staged. The onlookers and we viewers look on with horror as the smoke clears and reveals a beach saturated with blood and dismembered bodies. The onlookers scream the director yells cut and the stunt men pull themselves out of the sand unhurt. The crowd goes wild with applause far more appreciative about being fooled by the 'fabricated reality' than they were by their glimpse behind the scenes of the moviemaking action. And this is the structure with The Stunt Man viewers like those in the crowd are supposed to be kept off balance by this movie within a movie.Yet this is merely a device to advance the storyline which involves a complex theme about paranoia and trust. Railsback likens his relationship with the movie company's directorPeter O'Toole and by analogy everyone's situation at some point of their life to an incident he witnessed in Viet Nam. Someone stepped on a 'Bouncing Betty Mine' an antipersonnel device that while triggered by a person's weight does not actually detonate until the person steps off the device. At this point there is no choice but to remain standing on the mine trusting that something will happen to favorably change the situation. Just as in life there are times in the 'free will vs destiny' interplay when there is nothing you can do but place your trust a higher authority. Like 'The Ninth Configuration' a film made about the same time and highly recommended for those interested in this theme an authority figure works to redeem someone in his care by teaching them to trust someone or something even when everything screams for them to step off the mine. While The Stunt Man is an excellent movie which tells a valuable story in an interesting multilayered fashion it is not really the masterpiece that Director Richard Rush and its biggest fans claim. A lot of effort was made to portray Eli Cross the O'Toole character as an omniscient 'Godlike' figure and a genius filmmaker a necessary characterization if the film's theme is to be sold to the viewing audience. Unfortunately these efforts are largely undermined by the moronic nature of the film within the film. The artistic picture this eccentric genius is making is not even on the intellectual level of Laurel and Hardy's 'Flying Deuces' and it has about the same level of slapstick with none of the humor. So there is a major credibility disconnect. You have to sympathize with Wells as he had huge obstacles to overcome getting this film into production and he simply did not have the resources to stage a credible actionadventure tale. But a better approach would have been to stage small things well rather than grand things cheaply so the painfully onthecheap production design is ultimately his fault.

Apparently he has only the one facial expression freaky. Even during love scenes he looks freaked out. There is no tenderness when he smiles it never reaches his eyes. That was apropos for Helter Skelter but perhaps not for this movie.During the first few minutes I wondered if I wasn't seeing some odd retread of First Blood. Where's Rambo when you need him?In short don't waste your time. If you want to see freakedout Railsback watch Helter Skelter  it's a better movie and is actually based on a true story.

	schema:headline " Great in many ways but especially the performances";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater or rented it in the very early eighties  I honestly can't remember which but then didn't see it again until quite recently when I bought the double DVD with the Sinister Saga Of... movie and the commentary. I watched the movie at least three times in the first weekend I got it. Obviously I consider it a terrific film  one of the rare times when I disagree entirely with Ebert.O'Toole is magnificent as he was a couple of years later in My Favorite Year. The roles both call for a person who absolutely is Larger Than Life who dominates the screen every moment he's on it. O'Toole personifies that quality. I've often thought that's why The Lion in Winter could work  Hepburn was the same kind of woman especially as she got older and they were the only two who COULD have stood up to one another on screen although at that time there were still a few people around who could have managed Richard Burton comes to mind  when he was on he was ON.Some of the comments have stated that they thought Railsback was just muddling through. According to O'Toole's comments the two of them would spend hours after filming each day was over sitting around talking about the roles and interpretations and acting in general  whether you liked Railsback's performance or not I did it had to have been VERY deliberate. That HelterSkelter had come out before The Stunt Man was a lucky coincidence since The Stunt Man was filmed first but it was great in convincing you subconsciously that this guy might be a serious wacko from the start. But there were little throwaways Rush stuck in that helped you in that way like a little overheard remark the pretty and slutty hairdresser makes about that guy who killed all those campers as she's getting out of the car after dinner. These all combine to make the denouement when Cameron's crime is finally revealed especially exciting and hysterically funny.Hershey is remarkable. In one scene they are filming the film within the film and she is made up and dressed like an old woman at the grave of her long dead lover. You KNOW she is really a young and beautiful actress not an old woman you KNOW that this is a fictional script within a fictional script the scene lasts all of three minutes and her performance never fails to bring me to tears. Interestingly what immediately follows the propman knocking over a light and her bursting into tears was not scripted at all. Rush in a rather Eli Crosslike move told O'Toole to wait until Hershey really got the scene right that kind of emotional workup apparently can take several takes to really hit the spot at which point he Rush would signal O'Toole to go out and speak to Hershey. O'Toole being the experienced actor he was didn't need the signal he just walked over to her and hugged her whispering You were brilliant in her ear at which point HERSHEY not the character burst into tears and jumped into a full body hug on O'Toole legs around the body I mean. The whisper was later overvoiced by O'Toole for the movie as Thank you my baby. which was more appropriate for the director I'd never really thought about it but doing that kind of scene well has GOT to really take it out of you!. A brilliant idea on Rush's part superbly executed by O'Toole. But Hershey whose character was loosely called by the cast The Dream Girl obviously from Cameron's viewpoint gave an excellent performance all the way around of a complex woman neither totally good nor totally bad. She's egotistical selfcentered a bit spoiled but not to the point of losing her humanity or general niceness. And she's SO damned beautiful! I hate movies where you have no idea what's going on or where there are simply no characters you can stand. I am not an intellectual film buff who infinitely prefers Indies and Foreign films to mainstream American stuff. But I LOVED this movie. You know that you're not sure exactly what's real at any given moment but that's fine because eventually you FIND OUT. You're not left at the end of the movie going huh? And in the meantime there's a real honesttoGod plot happening that you CAN follow and a lot of humor and wit to enjoy.This is and I expect will remain on my top ten movie list for life. Part of that is a major love of Peter O'Toole but most of it is that the movie itself is just plain great if you don't mind being jerked around when you know you're being jerked around this seemed to be Ebert's major gripe  once it became obvious early on that the movie was going to be jerking you around he no longer gave a darn. It was very clever and I LIKE clever movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Woman Between Wolf and Dog or Een Vrouw Tussen Hond en Wolf as it is known in The Netherlands and Flanders is a very brave film. It focuses on the thin line between resistance and collaboration in the Second World War. Protagonist is Lieve a woman married with Adriaan who serves in the SS on the eastern front. The people in Antwerp ignore because of this and she leads a lonesome life until Francois member of the resistance takes shelter in her house. After a couple of days they start a relationship with saves Lieve from punishment after the German defeat. But then it turns out that Adrian returns safe and sound physically at least from the battlefield. He is imprisoned but Lieve still chooses to save her marriage to the astonishment of Francois. It appears that Adriaan has no regret of his choices and living with him becomes harder and harder for Lieve and their son.Because choices in a situation of war are so difficult we also see a lot of hypocrisy. People of Antwerp who played no role in the resistance but show a lot of bravery after the Germans are gone. People in the countryside who live a life of plenitude while people in the city are hungry.It is always difficult to prevent a story that takes fifteen years to become fragmentary. This movie doesn't succeed in avoiding this. We see a lot of very short scenes that try to tell a coherent story. Sometimes I was confused by the choices made by the director. You need to have some knowledge about the history of the Second World War in Belgium to understand why Adriaan choose to fight with the Germans at the east front while he is a Flemish nationalist. On the other hand there is a scene inside a cinema that seems to be inserted to give the viewer more specific understanding of history.The acting is slightly disappointing. It is strange when you have a great actor like Rutger Hauer on the set to leave him out of the script for about an hour. It is also unbelievable that a flamboyant guy like Francois falls in love with a woman like Lieve who is very withdrawn and seems to carry the weight of life on her shoulders. What doesn't help is the lack of chemistry between these characters. Because the film is so fragmentary you are not drawn into the story and the characters. In the mass scenes you see clearly that the budget of the movie was limited. It almost seems that beside some extras the streets of Antwerp are abandoned. I think the film could have benefit from a shorter time span say the moment that Antwerp is freed from the Germans with some flash backs to tell the background of Lieve Adriaan and Francois. It would involve the viewer more and the main characters would have been more present.".

Starting with just a few boys in a rented house Father Flanagan eventually establishes Boys Town on 200 acres of land 10 miles outside of Omaha Nebraska. Much of the film focuses on Flanagan's attempts to influence one boy Whitey Marsh who will become a hoodlum if he doesn't change his ways. When Whitey is implicated in a bank robbery it puts all of Boys Town at risk. Throughout it all Flanagan has to fight prejudice in those who believe delinquents should just be locked up and the never ending shortage of money to accomplish his goals.";

	schema:headline " Giving the kids a break";
	schema:reviewBody "Boys Town is not the actual story of the founding of the famous orphanage in Nebraska for homeless male youth. True some of the problems that Father Edward J. Flanagan had in making his dream come true are dealt with here. But about a third of the way through the story line changes and it deals with the problems of one of the youths Boys Town takes in.The youth is Mickey Rooney and Father Flanagan is played by Spencer Tracy. They are some contrast in acting styles. It's a tribute to Director Norman Taurog in that he was able to reign in Rooney who's performance some times goes a little over the top. Tracy however beautifully underplays against Rooney. San Francisco two years before was a milestone film for Tracy. Previous to San Francisco Tracy had played mostly roughewn types on either side of the law. No pun intended but as the priest there Spencer Tracy became the wise paternal figure so beloved in so many films. There's a lot of Father Tim Mullin continued on in Tracy's Father Flanagan. No new ground was broken but the ground was carefully cultivated by Tracy in Boys Town earning him a second Oscar in a row. That Oscar resides at Girls and Boys Town today the place did go coed in the Seventies.Tracy was under a lot of pressure in this part because Father Flanagan was still alive. Rumor hath it that he enjoyed Tracy's portrayal very much.Well if my life story was ever important enough to bring to the screen I couldn't ask for anyone better than Spencer Tracy to play me.".

Flanagan had in making his dream come true are dealt with here. But about a third of the way through the story line changes and it deals with the problems of one of the youths Boys Town takes in.The youth is Mickey Rooney and Father Flanagan is played by Spencer Tracy. They are some contrast in acting styles. It's a tribute to Director Norman Taurog in that he was able to reign in Rooney who's performance some times goes a little over the top.

Flanagan was spurred to action by the execution of a prison inmate whose life paralleled many of the boys that Flanagan has come to know in his own home town. With a shoestring budget and the aid of practical but good hearted businessman Dave Morris Henry Hull Flanagan begins the task of building a home and a legacy for hundreds of troubled young men.Flanagan soon meets Whitey Marsh Mickey Rooney a street wise punk who is about to follow in the footsteps of his criminal brother but it was big brother Joe Edward Norris who asks Flanagan to befriend Whitey. At first Whitey wants none of it but there always seems to be something holding Whitey back whether the thought of a good meal the effort to make an impression on the other boys or just the friendship of another young boy Pee Wee Bobs Watson who looks up to Whitey. Rooney gives an incredibly fine performance here portraying a wide range of character and emotions. His near breakdown when Pee Wee is injured and the thought that he was responsible is enough to cause a tear jerk reaction. The film does get a bit simplistic at times and some of the situations seem contrived to keep the story moving. But it's anchored by a sense of faith and hope in Father Flanagan's crusade to make the world just a little bit better for one boy at a time. In that the film has a timeless appeal and resonates as strongly today as it must have in the late 1930's.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film takes a long time to get going  I almost gave up on it after the first halfhour. But mercifully after the documentarystyle and resolutely nonjudgmental opening Boys Town acquires a plot  and some sense of direction. The trigger for this is the introduction of the first character in the entire film who is allowed to be flawed. So far everyone else has been shown to be either a curmudgeon with a heart of gold a rascal with a heart of gold or an unashamed saint but Joe Marsh is a flashy and unrepentant young criminal.He is not entirely beyond redemption however. He loves his younger brother who heroworships him in turn and longs to emulate him and it is doubtless a sad reflection on human nature that it is only with the arrival of strife in the Eden of Boys Town in the shape of Joe and Whitey Marsh that the film manages to become at all interesting.What follows is a story that has been told many times before from Louisa May Alcott's Jo's Boys onwards. This is the story of a rough boy who rebels against unaccustomed gentle surroundings and tries to corrupt his new world to match the one he knows and whose ultimate saving grace is his protective love for a younger child.The main problem for this film is the role of Father Flanagan a thankless part for any actor. The man has  literally  no weaknesses no human flaws not even any selfdoubt. His charm can apparently melt the hardest heart and conjure water out of a stone  or out of a hardheaded pawnbroker which according to the script comes to the same thing. The man is too likeable to be 'insufferable' but it was surely not the intention of the director that the audience should end up by willing Whitey to resist the priest's moral pressure to shield his brother even at his own expense and that of his adopted community  and to be so pleased when the boy attempts to do so.To be honest I don't see that this part deserved to win an Oscar for Spencer Tracy  not because the actor played badly but because the character as written simply doesn't present him with enough challenging material to demonstrate his craft. It is the child actors who play the various boys who deserved the real praise in this film. Ultimately I suspect Tracy's Oscar was an award aimed at rewarding the efforts of the real Father Flanagan rather than at his performance in this film.".

Father Flanagan performed a wonderful service during his 62 years on earth and we should be grateful for that self sacrifice.

Father Flanagan performed a wonderful service during his 62 years on earth and we should be grateful for that self sacrifice. Thanks to Father Flanagan the world is a better place and children are cared for in the way that they deserve. Because without well adjusted children how can we expect to be surrounded by well adjusted adults? Bottom line this movie will make you think and perhaps re evaluate what is truly important in life.";

But I think the guy who really steals the show is Mickey Rooney.  He was only 18 but he was so talented!  In this he really shows the audience what an incredible actor he is.  I think he should have won an Oscar too!My favorite part of Boys Town is when Pee Wee gets hit by a car and Whitey really shows his emotions for the first time.  This part really just rips my heart out to see a tough kid like Whitey just fall apart.  Pee Wee was the only boy who stood by Whitey right from the start his only true friend.  But thank goodness Pee Wee lives!Boys Town is a movie that really defines the Golden Era of Hollywood by displaying a wonderful cast and a beautiful story.  So I give it a 10 hoping that it brings up the IMDb score of a low 7.2.  It deserves much better than that!!".

It is of course about Father Flanagan Spencer Tracy who sets up a selfgoverned community for wayward homeless boys in Nebraska a sort of humanitarian answer to the often brutal and authoritarian reformatories. Flanagan's biggest challenge proves to be Whitey Mickey Rooney tough and selfserving kid brother of a convicted felon. Though Flanagan repeatedly claims 'I only know one thing There's no such thing as a bad boy Whitey's surely testing his patience and ends up endangering the whole future of the enterprise.Actually and that came as a shock to me Rooney's Whitey was the surprise of the movie. Whereas Tracy is going through the motions as the archetypal priest with a heart of gold and whereas too many of the boys are acted with the sort of saccharine sweetness that must have been grating even in the mid or late 1930s Rooney is perfect. I myself never gave him credit for his versatility his instinct and his willingness to take risks. From his initial streetwise swagger when told that On a clear day you can see all the way to Omaha he retorts Yeah? THEN whadda ya got? he gradually so gradually as to be believable evolves into a decent young chap. The scene in which he falls apart because he believes he has caused the death of a heroworshiping little boy rings very true in its sobbing and crying earnestness. The director alas ends up destroying the honesty of the scene by applying scores of boys kneeling in fervent prayer with a soprano soaring above them all.All in all 'Boys Town' ought to have been a whole lot better. Another director would have helped. It's a nice touch though to have the scrawny destitute kid hitch for a week to get to Boys Town only the night before it is destined to foreclose.So watch it for Rooney and the occasional touching ensemble scene.".

And of course it won him an Academy Award. Highly fictionalized or not his portrayal made him the real Father Flanagan to many people. It is a remarkable performance in part because as usual he plays his roles in somewhat of an understated way which makes them seem all the more realistic. There's quite a bit about the making of this film in the new Tracy biography and it's interesting to compare the confidence of the character he was playing here with his insecurity in playing a priest.The other star of the pic was Mickey Rooney. Interestingly this film was made the same year he began making the Andy Hardy films. What a cocky character and in some ways ala the Tracy biography he may have been pretty much the same in real life. But despite some overacting he plays this part memorably.Most of the other supporting actors do very nicely but special mention should be made of Henry Hull who does an especially nice job as Tracy'sFlanigan's crusty friend with a soft heart. And it is a hoot watching Bobs Watson cry! Some of the scenes in the picture were filmed at Boys Town and overall it's a nice production. While the aura of Boys Town and the basic history isn't far from the truth the actual plot of the movie is a little farfetched. Would the iconic Father Flanigan really lead his boys to overtaking and capturing a trio of bank robbers and murderers? But it makes a swell story and is very entertaining. This film was interesting enough  and over the years I've probably watched it half a dozen times  that since I now live in Colorado I just might make a trip out in Nebraska to visit the real Boys Town.This is one for your DVD shelf!".

	schema:reviewBody "SPENCER TRACY underplays the role of Father Flanagan who was the man behind the creation of BOYS TOWN and yet Hollywood thought his performance deserved an Oscar in 1938. The film looks very dated now and the sentiment is laid on a bit thick. The delinquent boys seem more like stereotyped cardboard characters dreamed up by the scriptwriter with only occasional glimmers of truth in the acting.Best among the supporting cast are GENE REYNOLDS always a fine child actor who later turned his talents to directing and little BOBS WATSON who does a remarkably convincing job of playing the little boy who worships Whitey played by MICKEY ROONEY. Rooney's performance is a bit too blustery but there are moments when his acting nails the truth.Still it's hard to know how much truth there is in the story told here since so much of the script seems to depend on contrivances that make one suspect it's a purely fictionalized account of the actual story behind the development of Flanagan's Boys Town. Anyone with a fondness for Tracy and Rooney will find it easy enough to sit through but I don't think it's the finest work of either star.".

He drifts through a range of emotions here from pious sincerity to pious righteousness to pious tolerance via pious determination and resourcefulness  all of it smothered in a sickly dose of pious nonsexual love for his ever growing brood of anklebiters. In real life Tracy is one of the cussingest harddrinking womanisers in Hollywood and it must have amused him no end to have received an Oscar for his portrayal of the saintly Father Flanagan.The film takes a left turn halfway through as if it has grown tired of watching the rather dull father to concentrate on the problems endured by Whitey Marsh played by an 18yearold Mickey Rooney. Rooney clearly thinks he's in a comedy. Just look at the way he struts around as the mayor of Boys Town shows him around the town he lifts each leg as if he has glue on the soles of his shoes and twitches his head this way and that like a particularly alert sparrow. Later when things go particularly bad for his character Rooney overacts outrageously determined to tug at the heartstrings of all those mothers who had made him one of America's favourite teens.Of course this being a Hollywood product of the thirties everything works out OK in the end. Father Flanagan saves the boys' home from closure Whitey becomes accepted and liked by his peers all of whom are wonderfully likable young tykes 'there's no such thing as a bad boy' Tracy repeatedly intones and little Pee Wee inspired by Tracy goes on to become a reallife Methodist minister.This one's so sugary you're going to want to brush your teeth after watching it.".

He and Judy Garland teamed up for those Andy Hardy movies when he was a child actor and then he had numerous other roles that pushed him farther. In this he plays a punk who arrives at Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska. The priest who runs the place Father Flanagan became inspired by a deathrow inmate who told him what it was like to grow up friendless. So Flanagan created Boys Town and took those that society rejected and provided love and care for them. It was often at great risk because they were always under close observation from an unconvinced population. This is really a story about Flanagan's relationship with Whitey Marsh Rooney who tests his patience to the limit. Flanagan knows that if he fails with this boy it could all go down. The other boys resent Whitey because they have their own government and are experience worth for the first time in their lives. Tracy won the Oscar for this performance.".

Truly a fairy tale ending but what about the beginning of the fairy tale? Missing in Action 2 The Beginning is his most personal mission of all! Because it's when he was a POW himself!

Norris and his crew are holed up in a prison camp for the whole picture ruled by tyrannical Colonel Yin SoonTek Oh who resorts to psychological mind games torture and murder to try to make Braddock sign a statement admitting to war atrocities he never committed.There seems to be no end to the different scenarios and interesting scenes that play out during the film escape attempts arranged fights between prisoners a guy who stumbles onto the prison camp and gets executed. Things really start to pick up when Braddock gets really mad and you see him sneaking here and there setting bombs picking off people one by one freeing people blowing up stuff and staying behind after everyone leaves because he doesn't believe Yin really died when he bombed Yin's hut. But Chuck really delivers in the end especially in his final feel good showdown with Yin. In my opinion Missing in Action 2 The Beginning is the best of the Braddock movies it's part action film and part action drama which sets it apart from the other movies.The first time i ever watched this film was in the early 80's in the cinema and it was great and i still think it's great...".

From that point on the movie is set ten years later where we find the men still being held hostage and all but forgotten.For some reason the prisoners just don't seem like they have been there ten years though. In the opening prison camp scene one of the prisoners is complaining how he can't sleep and explains that every time he closes his eyes he sees his wife GINA! If he had been there ten years wouldn't he have established at some point that his wife is named Gina? Couldn't he just say when I close my eyes I see my WIFE!? Well either way the story is they've been there ten years so we'll go with that. Why they have been held hostage in a remote Vietnamese torture camp for ten years without being killed makes no sense although there is a faint attempt to explain it for the sake of giving the men a reason to be there the colonel a reason to torture them and the film a reason to exist.The reason Norris and his men are being held you ask? Apparently the Vietnamese colonel is a very prideful man although he's not above sentencing himself to live in a jungle prison camp for ten years in order to monitor it and ensure that nobody escapes and he requires that Norris sign a document stating that the Americans have committed war crimes against the Vietnamese and accept their guilt. The fact that this is the entire reason these men have been held in the camp for TEN YEARS is completely ridiculous. We are to believe that Norris is such a dedicated soldier that he refuses to sign the document even though he could simply sign it go home eat a pizza get some reinforcements and go back to finish off the remaining Vietnamese and any record of what he signed.Because Norris refuses to sign the document the vengeful yet oddly patient Colenel Yin keeps him there and occasionally tortures him now and then for good measure. Apparently Colonel Yin has no problem imprisoning degrading and killing human beings but he draws the line at forging someones signature.The movie does provide some of the best jungle action pre Arnold Schwarzenegger's Predator however. There are some good fight scenes with many two and even three hit combos dealt out by Norris. Throughout the movie the Colonel always has the upper hand and uses the line you lose every time he foils Norris. With a one liner as great as that there's little doubt that it will be used against him once Norris turns the tables by the end of the movie. And in the jungle Norris doesn't disappoint.By far the best part of the movie is the end when Norris gets his mitts on a cache of Columbian firearmsexplosives and comes back to the camp for sweet revenge.And the most hilarious part of the movie is the fact that the only escape from the jungle camp is by crossing a very long wooden bridge over a huge ravine and this wooden bridge is guarded by a guy who's only weapon is a flamethrower. Stop and think about that. Instead of a machine gun they give the guy guarding the WOODEN bridge a flamethrower to defend himself. So does that mean every time someone tries to escape he shoots at them with the flamethrower the bridge burns down and he has to rebuild it the next day to go back to the camp?In the final scene Norris gets his revenge and beats down the colonel like an arcade wizard using cheat codes at the Mortal Kombat machine. Like I said before the phrase you lose is conveniently dropped right before the death blow is administered. What more can you ask for in a movie that gave the entire premise away with the title?".

I'm not one of them but they're out there. Don't get me wrong it's a decent war movie and I like it. It's not actionheavy though it never drags and the action does pick up towards the end. It's more of a drama for the first hour or so. Chuck is his usual stoic self. SoonTek Oh is a suitably despicable villain. Steven Williams plays the POW who betrays the others. Christopher Cary has a brief but enjoyable role as an Australian photographer who tries to help the POWs.

It may be manipulative but damn is it ever satisfying. The villains are the kind of loathsome scum whom you JUST CAN'T WAIT to see messed up in a variety of ways. And the good guys are fleshed out enough as characters that you do feel bad for them and want to see them get their revenge.As one can guess this is a prequel to the original Missing in Action film of 1984. It shows how Chucks' colonel character James Braddock was shot down and captured during the war and the tortures that he and his men are obliged to endure for the next several years even after the war has basically ended. The sadistic colonel in charge of his work camp Colonel Yin SoonTek Oh acts like a dictator and just when you think you can't hate this guy any more he ups the stakes yet again.With Lance Hool taking the directors' reins this proves to be a high old time for the action junkie underscored by the genuine poignancy to be found in stories about prisoners of war. This is exciting much of the time with kick ass battle footage lots of explosions lots of gunfire and some breathtaking scenery. Chuck is a formidable hero as always and Oh is a deliciously evil bad guy. Lending strong support are Cosie Costa Joe Michael Terry and especially John Wesley as the ailing Franklin. Steven Williams is good in an initially unlikable part as a captain eager to cooperate with his captors in exchange for better treatment. It's also cool to see hulking screen heavy Professor Toru Tanaka and Ninja III The Domination villain David Chung as two of the guards.All in all this is solid entertainment complete with a high body count and never ever boring.Eight out of 10.".

I mean I have watched some USSR films that are rated here straight high 7 to 9's and actually really are horrible so you know IMDb is populated by a leftist crowd. Having gotten that off of my chest it has been a long time since I've seen this trilogy but the prequel is the best. One could say it's a B movie Rambo part 2 and thats fine it probably is but it does have differences and that lies in character development. Without giving away any spoilers lets just say that all the characters are way over the top and that if you are an American you will love the Americans here and loathe all the enemies down to the last guard tower guard but especially the leader. Pleasant surprises the Aussie journalist and the black American POW collaborator. Chuck shows a full range of emotion as best as he's able and hey thats why I think this is the best Chuck Norris film I really was blown away by parts of this when I first saw it and despite it's cheesy low budget feel or maybe because of it I rate it a 9 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an above average prequel with a good enough pace and good performances. It has a few shocking moments and all the characters were pretty cool plus SoonTek Oh is extremely menacing as the main villain. Chuck was somewhat bland at times in this however this was a challenging role and for the most part he was up to the challenge as were the rest of the cast. It had a few dull moments here and there and the characterizations could have been a bit better however it's helped by a good enough pace good performances and for the most part unpredictable. The finale is pretty exciting and the story is kind of engaging however it could have been a lot better plus Chuck seemed to be a little bored in places. This is an above average prequel that's well worth a watch!. The Direction is good. Lance Hool does a good job here with good camera work good angles nothing overly fancy but he got the job done plus he kept the film at a good pace. There is a little bit of violence. We get quite a few bloody gunshot wounds a couple gory impaling's and a gory wound. The Acting is very good. Chuck Norris for the most part was fantastic as always and really did good with some of his emotional scenes however he looked bored at times and as a result was kinda bland however he kicks that ass and for the most part was tons of fun to watch! Norris rules!. SoonTek Oh is fantastic as the main villain he is extremely menacing evil and was very interesting to watch as he was so unpredictable!. Steven Williams does pretty good with what he had to do i liked him. Cosie Costa and John Wesley are both good with what they had to do. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall well worth a watch!.  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "This middle chapter of the James Braddock trilogy is a prequel to the original Missing In Action that traces the origin of Chuck Norris's notquiteiconic franchise player. The film is centered around Braddock's detention at a Vietnamese prison camp with several other American POWs who are held at the mercy of a malevolent colonel who subjects them to a variety of cruelties. Of course Norris is never one to sit idly by while injustice is being done and he soon navigates a daring escape blowing tons of stuff up and gunning down dozens of bad guys in the process.Though The Beginning boasts all of the hallmarks of an enjoyable Baction flick slow motion explosions liberal use of machine guns a hero seemingly impervious to damage etc. Missing In Action 2 spends a lot more time developing the characters and the scenario than fans of the genre may be used to. While this relegates most of the action to the third act and slows the pace a bit the film benefits from the more immersive approach and delving deeply into the horrors of the POW experience brings home the realworld resonance of the piece while simultaneously bolstering the payoff when the guns n' grenades portion of the plot gets underway.The dramatic emphasis also allows the usually stonefaced Norris to showcase his acting chops a bit and even when he's called upon to express actual emotions he does a capable job of humanizing Braddock beyond the scope of an interchangeable action hero. I'm keenly aware that most people curious about the Missing In Action series aren't all that interested in seeing Norris cry so I should postscript that endorsement by adding that even though this outing is a bit more seriousminded than some others you'll encounter from the era Chuck still doles out plenty of vengeance upon his captors with flamethrowers Uzis explosives and good oldfashioned karate leaps out of trees.Your basic goodvsevil movie is only as strong as its villain and we get a suitably malicious match for Norris in SoonTeck Oh's Colonel Yin who notches up serious baddie points by burning people alive tormenting Norris with news from the homefront and humiliating one prisoner by having the least attractive prostitutes you'll ever see strip him naked and mock his genitals. In adherence to the sort of muddled logic you only find in '80s action films Colonel Yin is a rare breed of Vietnamese overlord who speaks perfect English and is proficient in advanced martial arts.The presence of veteran henchman Professor Toru Tanaka is a welcome addition and always entertaining character actor Steven Williams lends his services as a conniving turncoat who in true Williams fashion fights valiantly to steal the movie by taking big meaty bites out of every scene he's in.Most of the shoot 'em up aspects of the film are fairly standard but MIA2 does boast a few truly memorable scenes during the extended prison camp segments the most effective of which is the rat in a bag sequence. Though the majority of Colonel Yin's tortures aren't all that creative when he orders his men to stuff Chuck's head and an agitated rodent into the same burlap sack it becomes impossible not to recognize his ingenuity.Though The Beginning dramatizes the true fates of some American soldiers left behind in Vietnam any parallels to reality are readily negated by Chuck's propensity for invincibility. He does get kicked around a bit as a prisoner but once he assumes the mantle of heavilyarmed liberator his we assume highlytrained captors suddenly forget how to aim their weapons and Norris is able to elude even the most voluminous volleys of gunfire by simply rolling out of the way. The absurd apex of Chuck's super hero capabilities arrives when he opens a hatch to free some of the prisoners only to discover that he has been lured into a trap. Instead of POWs the compartment is filled with a dozen enemy soldiers who immediately open fire with their machine guns inches from our sturdy protagonist's face... and somehow miss him entirely.Of course such silliness is to be expected from a film like Missing In Action 2 and when the result is a fun and entertaining 90 minutes it seems beside the point to complain about the improbabilities. Judged against the other work being churned out by Norris and his contemporaries during the era The Beginning is a surprisingly thoughtful offering that balances its heart and its gonads rather adeptly. Above average is definitely good enough in this case.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prequel to Chuck Norris' quite successful first film in the Missing in Action franchise. The prequel tells the story of how Norris' Colonel Braddock was captured and held prisoner by the NVA during the Vietnam War. The film is a fairly standard POW war film story complete with an evil camp commandant cruel torture and daring escapes. Norris has always been limited in his acting ability but this film wisely did not ask much of our hero in that department. Unfortunately the film also did not ask Chuck show off his martial arts skills much either with the exception being a final confrontation with venerable character actor SoonTek Oh as the evil Colonel Yin. Chuck takes some beat downs from Professor Toru Tanaka and has some nasty torture scenes particularly one involving rats throughout the film as the NVA try to get him to confess to war crimes but why have a karate champ in your film if you're not going to let him fight? The film's production company realized this was a weak film and had already filmed a sequel backtoback with this one. Producers made the wise choice to release what was originally filmed as a sequel Missing in Action where Chuck goes back to Vietnam to rescue POWs as the first of the franchise and then released this weaker film later as a prequel. In the plus column for this film it does feature music by Max Max composer Brian May. Also as clichd of a POW story as it is it's a pretty sturdy one that's hard to resist for fans of this war film subgenre.".

	schema:reviewBody "A superior sequel to Chuck's first Vietnam effort this is a smallscale drama of prison camp torture and escape the second half packed with simplistic but pleasing action as Norris kills off dozens of enemy soldiers and generally acts as a hero. Yes this is violent bonebreaking stuff with graphic head shots people burning and a protracted finale which just about celebrates Norris causing extreme bodily harm to his enemy. The tortures rats are placed in bags over prisoner's heads living men are burnt are brutal in the extreme and give the movie a hard edge. The realistic jungle locations give the feeling that this was filmed in the middle of a sweaty tropical inferno somewhere and add to the experience.Norris reprises his role as Colonel Braddock in what is a prequel to the first film explaining how he managed to escape from the bad guys.

	onyx:emotionText "A superior sequel to Chuck's first Vietnam effort this is a smallscale drama of prison camp torture and escape the second half packed with simplistic but pleasing action as Norris kills off dozens of enemy soldiers and generally acts as a hero. Yes this is violent bonebreaking stuff with graphic head shots people burning and a protracted finale which just about celebrates Norris causing extreme bodily harm to his enemy. The tortures rats are placed in bags over prisoner's heads living men are burnt are brutal in the extreme and give the movie a hard edge. The realistic jungle locations give the feeling that this was filmed in the middle of a sweaty tropical inferno somewhere and add to the experience.Norris reprises his role as Colonel Braddock in what is a prequel to the first film explaining how he managed to escape from the bad guys.

Braddock and his fellow soldiers are routinely tortured and subjected to harsh cruel and sadistic practices thanks to maniacal commander Col. Yin Oh and his sidekick Lao Tanaka. Will Braddock escape to see freedom? Actually you know he will because this is a prequel but just ignore that.The fans clamored for more Braddock and more Braddock is what they got with this sequelprequel. Cannon provided more jungle action and Prerequisite Torture with that trademark Reaganstyle patriotism that we've all come to know and love. There's even stock footage of Reagan in the actual movie. It could definitely be argued that this sequel is superior to the original because the plot is more streamlined and the final fight between Chuck and SoonTek Oh absolutely delivers the goods. The movie primarily takes place in one location  the prison camp  and you see their travails everything from Punchfighting to dealing with Professor Toru Tanaka. He's a fan favorite and his presence improves the proceedings.Like the first film you kind of have to wait for any substantial action but when it comes it's a true crowd pleaser. Adding to this you get to see the origin of Chuck's beard. When he was first captured in 1972 he did not have a beard. But he had to grow one in captivity because Col. Yin did not provide razors. Apparently he liked the way he looked so he kept it. Because of Chuck's long hair and beard and the way he's treated in Missing In Action 2 The Beginning there are certainly some parallels to the story of Jesus. Think about it.Director Lance Hool who was credited with writing and producing credits on the first film here steps into the director's chair with successful results. He obviously understands the Braddock character and that's probably why he got the gig. Once again Aaron Norris is on board for stunt work as is fan favorite John Barrett. Dean Ferrandini usually part of the stunt team here steps in front of the camera in the role of Kirtle. It appears everyone knew what they were doing and did their best to expand the story of Braddock and it certainly worked.It was released in one of those cool MGMCannon silver big boxes so the collectability factor is high. But the movie is definitely worth seeing as is the first one. But the highest heights of Braddock were yet to come the final installment of the trilogy was still three years away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prequel to the 1984 hit Missing in Action depicts the hardships of the prison camp where Col. Braddock is held and his attempts to escape with the few remaining American soldiers. The film is a cut below the original in terms of just about everything. Hence the original was released sooner. This film due to its storyline had to rely a bit more on drama rather than action. Most of the actors in this film just cannot cut the proverbial mustard in that department though. It's a bad sign when Chuck Norris is pretty much the best actor in a film. No M. Emmett Walsh to steal any scenes this time unfortunately! The story begins with Braddock and a helicopter full of soldiers getting shot down behind enemy lines. We then have some newsreel type footage of Memorial Day ceremonies for MIAs back in Washington DC. President Reagan even makes an appearance. Then back to the POW camp we go. We meet the sadistic Col Yin who runs the place. And we see that there isn't much left of Braddock and the Americans after several years in captivity. The scene is basically stolen from Bridge on the River Kwai as the Col. explains to the men what they must already know. Escape is pretty much impossible due to the Vietnamese troops and the perilous jungle surrounding the camp. Two hapless prisoners of course try to make an escape right after this speech and are killed in gruesome fashion. The only way any of the men could ever possibly get home again would be for Braddock to sign a confession of his war crimes. But this is BS and Braddock knows it. There is no way Yin would ever let these men get out alive.The balance of the film basically depicts the torture that these men endure before Braddock is able to escape and eventually free the other prisoners. Col. Yin is a real S.O.B.. He uses hungry rats mock executions you name it. At one point he even burns an American soldier alive after shooting him up with a gigantic dose of morphine. AMC doesn't show the burning scene as it is particularly disturbing. Over the years the psychological and physical abuse gets to the prisoners. One man even swears his allegiance to the Vietnamese so he can live better. His rationale Our country has forgotten about us so does it really matter? Maybe in some ways he has a point but he is considered a filthy traitor by the other Americans.Finally Braddock is able to get free and get his hands on some weapons. Lots of gun battles and explosions result. This film must have set a record for the most stunt men jumping off trampolines with an explosion behind them. Then a scream is dubbed in. The effect comes off as pretty fake actually. There are some neat stunts and camera work though. In one scene a guy falls down a steep cliff and splatters on the rocks below. It kind of looked real! And there is an excellent martial arts showdown between Norris and Soon Teck Oh at the film's conclusion. Looked pretty painful! Unfortunately the entire film just looks kind of cheap compared to part one. It was filmed in Mexico in case you were wondering. I believe part one was made in the Phillipines. Director Lance Hool doesn't seem as confident with the material as Joseph Zito did with the original. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

I'm glad I went. Over the last couple of years I've found that reviews on movies have become extremely undependable. It seems as though a lot of folks who fancy themselves as reliable movie critics have become quite snobbish in their reviews. It's so easy to be critical. Some critics like to feel that they are a step above the rest of us and therefore more likely to understand how the movie should have been written versus the flawed production that was actually released upon the public. I'd have missed many a good movie had I listened to the professionals. This is an entertaining movie. It's not The Godfather or Shawshank Redemption but it's a good old fashioned action movie that keeps your attention. Get some popcorn and soda sit back and enjoy the show.".

The third element in the blender mentioned above along with a script short on genuine character development You'll sometimes forget that Hayden Christensen and Zoe Saldana are in it are distracting for a film which develops a serious tone but there are positives depending on your genre preferences. The film moves along briskly even as we deal with a cringeworthy first half and when the actual robbery gets going the fun starts. Though the cinematography is modeled too much off of the Bournestyle shaky cam the set pieces are still very well pulled off. The extended car chases and shootouts contain a level of energy and suspense that really makes them standout comparable to similar scenes in the above mentioned films along with an onfoot chase clearly modeling itself off of the Madagascar chase in Casino Royale. Every car whizzing by bone crunch or gunshot affects the audience due to mostly proper use of slow motion and great editing both sound and film wise.The melodrama may make some engaged viewers start laughing due to how it's put on screen but as the stakes get higher gels with the storyline. The main cast considering the material they are given do the best they can and their charisma is enough for us to care about them when the stakes get REALLY high particularly in the case of Matt Dillon and Idris Elba.It's highly unoriginal and contains several other elements worthy of nitpicking but after evaluating how I had spent the past 107 minutes of my life I think it got the job done.B".

The film opens with a bank heist that desperately wants to be like the bank heist in Michael Mann's Heat except that instead of a hardass bastards like DeNiro Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore we have a bunch of softass pop singers and pretty boys like Paul Walker and Hayden Christensen.You're supposed to believe that these guys are highly disciplined and badass outlaws?! Gimme a break! After they grab the cash they escape by running to the roof of the building and tricking a news chopper into landing so that they can use it to escape! Right there I was like what if the news chopper decided not to be stupid? Now you're stuck on top of a damn skyscraper with nowhere to run! Can you imagine if DeNiro's crew in Heat decided that their only escape plan was to chopper jack an escape vehicle?! It's beyond stupid and utterly ludicrous! The filmmakers rip off a plethora of classic and notsoclassic heist films including Heat the Italian Job and True Romance. If you have never seen any of these movies you may find this somewhat entertaining.".

	schema:headline " My Head is Spinning";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is fastpaced and the cinematography specifically the shaky camera thing is clever and interesting when it's not irritating. Also there is some eye candy for the ladies and some of the cast is full of interesting and appealing characters some who actually do decent acting jobs some is the operative word. Those are the good points.Now the other side. I like T.I. as a rapper and even thought he did an okay acting job in ATL a few years ago but his acting here was just downright criminal. There was one scene in which he dominated the dialog that I actually said out loud his acting is so bad it's offensive. You're actually offended that that is being pushed off as something you should buy as a viewer. You're wondering how no one in the director's booth was offended by it. In fairness the fast action of the bulk of the movie shields the poor acting a bit so the blow is blunted a bit. But between his poor acting and Chris Brown's sometimey acting it was just a lot being asked of the viewer. Speaking of characters the lack of character development is also a low point of the film. I agree with another commenter that you're asked to feel something for a character who dies but you feel nothing because you really haven't been given anything to know or care about. And finally as others have stated the plot is clichd to the point that you're wondering if it's supposed to be a satire of some sort. But no no satire. They're seriously trying to wrap Heat and Set it Off and Dead Presidents up in a big bow and pass it off as a new present. Just not a good thing to do.I rate it a 5 on a 10point scale because while it's not a great movie it does hold your attention and as bad as some parts are it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. So I say giving it about half credit is pretty accurate. In that vain I won't say you should pay to see this or you shouldn't pay to see it. I say do the 5050 thingflip a coin. Either way the earth won't shatter. This movie is just not that significant either way. It will probably be forgotten pretty soon.".

	schema:headline " Takers Gives You a Solid Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I need a new suit. That's what I kept thinking during the movie Inception and again during Takers. I like that Hollywood is dressing up their leading actors more often these days.Takers is a story about a group of efficient professional thieves who meticulously plan their robberies a year in an advance. They take their jobs seriously and leave little room for error. There is no one shining star in this crew. The team has great balance between the members played by younger Hollywood such as Hayden Christensen Paul Walker and Michael Ealy.The audience is tossed into two different action sequences from the start with no explanation of why we are watching these scenes. It's like waking up in the middle of cage fight then getting punched in the back of the head and the face simultaneously. After the disorientation your head starts to clear up and things start coming into focus. The moment of clarity arrives and you are in the movie.After the opening bank robbery we are introduced to the team of Takers. These guys are suave and know how to present themselves. It was like watching a group of Esquire magazine models relax after a hard day at the office if that office specialized in bank robberies. They all wear expensive suits drink highend scotch and smoke fine cigars. They each retreat to their own slice of heaven to relax. The director John Luessenhop I don't know who he is either spends a lot of time building their image through a slow motion reunion before they go into their own private club. For having only recently done a bank job together they seem to revel in their male bonding and handshaking quite extensively.This life of the Takers seems too good to be true with very little conflict. That is why we are introduced to Ghost played by Tip T.I. Harris an exmember of the Takers crew who is being released from prison. Seems that back in 2004 these guys did a job where Ghost was shot and sent to prison. He's not mad about it though in fact he has one last big score for his old crew.Meanwhile the two detectives Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez assigned to the Takers' bank robbery start gathering the information they need to track this crew down. We turn to the classic cops and robbers formula and we have seen it before.The Takers start getting ready for the heist while more is being revealed about their personal lives. These side stories set the movie apart from the rest of the movies in the genre. In this case it is a close family member that gives Gordon played by Idris Elba a reason to accept this heist but it also gives him a lot of problems.Family is also giving the detectives problems. Jack Welles Dillon the detective is a single dad who is having problems going through his separation. This immediately brings us back into the typical cop drama. Why is it that almost every movie cop in LA is divorced? Seriously I think Danny Glover's character in Lethal Weapon was the last detective who as able to bust bad guys take hundreds of bullets to the chest and still keep his marriage together.The story progresses at a good pace until the big action fueled bank heist. There was a little too much of the shaky camera syndrome. Note to Hollywood  we know what you are doing stop it. The shaky camera action sequences don't work every time. Slow it down and try something else it's giving us a headache.Warning you have seen the heist scene before in a previous film I won't say which one but this time they didn't use Mini Coopers for the action sequence. Instead there was an elongated foot chase that seemed to last for hours. Another note to Hollywood  most Olympic athletes can't fall from a tall building be hit by a bus and then sprint for a 14 mile while dodging bullets so don't try making us believe that Chris Brown can pull it off and still look good doing it.Should you see this movie? Yes it will keep your attention and most of the action is believable. There is genuine balance and chemistry amongst the characters. The director did try something different by putting a twist in the middle of the movie instead of at the end. He gets points for that. He also gets points for the elaborate shoot out scene I applaud his choice of string instrument background music and lack of loud gun noises to give it a huge impact. Now if you will excuse me I am off to shop for a new suit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say this film was entertaining at best. The best performances coming from Matt Dillon and Tip T.I. Harris. The actions sequences while very intense were ruined at times by the shaky camera movements especially during the chase sequences. The storyline while it had original elements was flawed and certain scenes you could see coming from a mile away. The only thing I admire from this film is that it tries to give all of its stars equal screen time and importance just like the far superior film it tries to emulate Heat. Takers attempts to be an heist film with a heart to which the younger generation can connect but fails to deliver the goods. I commend T.I. for his performance and executive producing this project but I think it still needed work as far as the storyline and the filming are concerned. My suggestion is to skip it and wait for it on DVD.".

This pop culture stuff is a clich that films use for success when released over and over.With some substance in the plot though it really makes the difference between bad and alright.

	schema:headline " Wishes it was Heat....minor spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Takers is a film with a simple crime premise. It follows a group of criminals who are good at what they do. They can complete any high stakes job and enjoy living it up with no worries and tons of cash. A former member of their crew is released the same day they hit a bank in the city. He comes back to them claiming he's got the biggest job they will ever do. Their rule for jobs is to wait at least a year to lay low. Reluctant to take this high paying job the crew agrees to it and the plan goes into motion.All the movie ends up doing is trying to be Heat but with a more hip and modern crew of criminals. Heat opens with a armored car heist scene has a midtown bank heist that goes wrong and ends with a shoot out on an airport runway. Takers has all of these scenes as well just mixed around a bit and they literally do the armored car heist scene from The Italian Job. This time the midtown bank is the opener and the armored car hit is the big one which goes all wrong. It feels like the writer and director John Luessenhop thought that the targeted audience for this film wouldn't see that he literally stole the same scenes from Heat and just traded their position. I think it would be fine if they took one scene and made it their own. But when they try and add a bit of his own he ends up ripping off the scene from another film! It is just poor film making and blatant copying. As for the characters they are nothing but one sided lacking any substance at all. A few of the key members of the crew have some interesting flaw or addition that tries to make their character more empathetic but it doesn't add any depth to their character at all. Both the Edris Ilba and Michael Ealy have these additions that really do nothing for their character. As for the rest of the crew they just exist. Hayden Christensen's character is the typical faux badass who has tattoos all over his body. At no time in the movie did I feel like he was tough at all. He has only a handful of lines and his murmuring acting style just reminds how terrible he is as an actor. The Chris Brown and Paul Walker characters just exist because the crew needs more people. The cop character played by Matt Dillon who is trying to get them has no bearing on the plot at all. He barely has any chance of ever getting them and when he does finally meet up he gets shot and simply told You shoulda stayed out of this. They try to get some emotional feedback from the viewer by killing characters you feel bad for but it just comes off as utter blandness. You could really care less what happens to these characters.Yet another action movie with action scenes ruined by the shaky cam effect. If done right the shaky cam can really add to the action. Movies like the Bourne series and Cloverfield use this well and get you into the frantic nature of the action. Takers film makers did it just for the heck of it to make the action seem more intense than it really was. Through the whole Chris Brown chase scene it is pretty much incomprehensible what is going on. The camera tries to shake with the action to add motion to it but I couldn't tell what either side was doing most of the time. I didn't even know if the cops were relatively close to catching him until they finally settled the camera. I can kind of imagine the director telling the camera men Keep the characters in the shot but just shake it as much as you can!! Make it more actiony!!!!!It tries too hard to be a cool heist flick but fails miserably by severely lacking on all fronts where it must succeed to be an enjoyable movie. The director should be ashamed of this poor piece of work. He obviously has no talent and finds it okay to copy both a film already done and the style the original director pretty much made him well known for. Michael Mann should seriously consider legal action. I guarantee if Heat had not been made  Takers would not exist in the form we see it today. But who knows...maybe there is an unwritten rule in Hollywood where if you wait long enough it is okay to copy the plot of an older movie with the hopes the current generation and target audience hasn't seen the original film. Same thing happened with DJ Caruso's Disturbia didn't it? I guess the studio feels the same seeing as they didn't release it until two years after it was finished filming and then decided to dump in in the end of summer garbage weeks. Just got rent Heat its cheaper and better.".

	schema:headline " A GQ ad on speed";
	schema:reviewBody "Envision a GQ ad on speed with a dash of The Italian Job and you will have a good idea of what Takers has to offer. Though a slick and mostly kinetic heist flick there is not a single frame of the entire running length that has not been borrowed from another usually better film. I don't consider it a spoiler to reveal that the structure of the central robbery is identical to that of The Italian Job down to the street erupting armoured car interception and traffic light tampering. You would think that with all the talent drifting through Hollywood that they could come up with an original caper at least. Actually never mind.Stealing eyerolls along with cash Takers also piles on a heap of clichs the obsessive detective the agile parkour thief the robber who is never going back to prison and of course for good measure the takers walk away from an explosion in slow motion Armani ties flapping in the breeze. Despite an utterly unoriginal premise Takers remains quite entertaining for the first three quarters running at a breezy pace with some flashy scuffles and gunfights. It is in the final act things not only turn dumb but oddly depressing for what preceded it was essentially escapist fun.The cast is a slapdash of rappers and actors the most notable of the former is obviously Chris Brown who got some bad press around the film's original release date when he got into a cough argument with singer Rihanna. The standout by far is Idris Elba employing his natural British accent to smooth effect. Takers makes the second film released this weekend to star a cast member from HBO's The Wire the other being Dominic West who you can find in Neil Marshall's Centurion. Zoe Zaldana also pops up but has the definition of a nothing role. She has all of two minutes screen time and a maximum of five lines but hey every movie needs a little eyecandy.Takers ramps into a robbery right off the start finding a gang of savvy thieves including Paul Walker Hayden Christensen Chris Brown Michael Ealy and Idris Elba laying siege to a bank with a nifty escape plan. They plan all of their heists thoroughly always have an out and never pull off two jobs within the same year. The day of a former partner of those known as Ghost another rapper this time T.I. is released from prison and contacts his old gang.

	onyx:emotionText "Envision a GQ ad on speed with a dash of The Italian Job and you will have a good idea of what Takers has to offer. Though a slick and mostly kinetic heist flick there is not a single frame of the entire running length that has not been borrowed from another usually better film. I don't consider it a spoiler to reveal that the structure of the central robbery is identical to that of The Italian Job down to the street erupting armoured car interception and traffic light tampering. You would think that with all the talent drifting through Hollywood that they could come up with an original caper at least. Actually never mind.Stealing eyerolls along with cash Takers also piles on a heap of clichs the obsessive detective the agile parkour thief the robber who is never going back to prison and of course for good measure the takers walk away from an explosion in slow motion Armani ties flapping in the breeze. Despite an utterly unoriginal premise Takers remains quite entertaining for the first three quarters running at a breezy pace with some flashy scuffles and gunfights. It is in the final act things not only turn dumb but oddly depressing for what preceded it was essentially escapist fun.The cast is a slapdash of rappers and actors the most notable of the former is obviously Chris Brown who got some bad press around the film's original release date when he got into a cough argument with singer Rihanna. The standout by far is Idris Elba employing his natural British accent to smooth effect. Takers makes the second film released this weekend to star a cast member from HBO's The Wire the other being Dominic West who you can find in Neil Marshall's Centurion. Zoe Zaldana also pops up but has the definition of a nothing role. She has all of two minutes screen time and a maximum of five lines but hey every movie needs a little eyecandy.Takers ramps into a robbery right off the start finding a gang of savvy thieves including Paul Walker Hayden Christensen Chris Brown Michael Ealy and Idris Elba laying siege to a bank with a nifty escape plan. They plan all of their heists thoroughly always have an out and never pull off two jobs within the same year. The day of a former partner of those known as Ghost another rapper this time T.I. is released from prison and contacts his old gang. He lets them into the loop on a one time job involving a rather large withdrawal from an armored truck. But with Det. Jack Wells Matt Dillon and his partner Lt. Carver ironically the name of a character from The Wire still hot on their trail from the last robbery they break their rules and things begin to go wrong.This is only T.I.'s second acting job following a small role in American Gangster and he is not bad in the role.

	schema:reviewBody "Loved it. This movie is a quintessential guy movie. No wasted dialogue or subplots not directly related to the main plot. All comparisons to this work are nowhere close to what lies at the heart of this film. If you want to complain about the Italian Job trick it's pointless because T.I.'s character points it out that he wants to do an Italian Job snatch and grab. Needless to say it goes a bit differently. This is a unique take on a classic premise. This film is all about the point of view it follows. Guy goes to jail doesn't turn on his friends guy gets released friends worry about future police contact and being seen with a marked man things get sketchy. These are very believable ideas and a fresh spin. Too many times in movies you're left thinking there is no way someone could pull that off and then things become silly. Not here. If you feel the need to compare Takers to another film it's basically a sexed up hipper Heat a complement because it's another gritty believable crime drama. Right down to the high rollers armored truck and black duffel bags used to carry the load. Only instead of Michael Sizemore making a run for it with a trunk load of dough you have bad boy Chris Brown showing off his dexterity as he tries to allude being captured.If you know anything about film making every director and writer gets influenced from previous works. The very first movies got influenced from great literary pieces. So to complain about similarities is ignorant. This isn't a synopsis so I won't waste your time summarizing the movie. Highlights for me where it got stimulating and raw were the fight scene with Hayden Christensen laying down the law and the free running getaway chase scene with Chris Brown sic. I'm a theatre arts senior so I can appreciate quality film making when I see it. Old school action without the seizure inducing over digitalizations. I used to be a computer arts major. Boring not to mention tedious no matter how fun it is to watch. Not needed here. All biases aside this was a great film. It's quick witty detailed fashionable and above all believable seemingly without trying. For everyone complaining about T.I.'s acting get your head examined. For one he basically is this character in real life so whatever he does is believable. Do you not know that he did just get out of prison for being set up by the FEDs for purchasing an arsenal. T.I. is one of the best cross profession actors out there including Will Smith who is also great. This movie took some of the best young talent and gave them a script which brought out their better qualities. The ensemble was brilliant in it's own right. You get Christensen Elba Dillon Hernandez Walker T.I. the infamous Brown all costarring and pulling it off like they've been friends for years. What I liked the most about this film is that it's all substance and no meandering into pointless directions. If anything it could have gone into even more background information about the characters. The fact is it doesn't have to. This is the world that is created where everyone is on a need to know basis even the audience. We get all of the meat with very little fat. If you don't like this movie you must have an aversion to action movies and or be really feminine. If you're a guy and don't absolutely dig this flick I'm pulling your man card.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying I am a movie buff. I go to the movies at least 2xs a month  love a variety of films. Takers is a good movie. The movie is basically about some guys who are professional bank robbers. I don't mean those ones who just walk in  say give me all your money. Professionals who can tap into the video systems elevator systems  use a lot of C4. Pretty basic movie to follow. Nothing deep or thought provoking like inception. Just a good old fashion bank robbery story.But this is a review so let me start with the bad parts.1. Not a lot of character development. While we are introduced to the characters this movie doesn't spend an hour telling you about the characters backgrounds or doing the cheezy flashbacks to when Ghost T.I got shot  sent to jail.2. Did not really understand why Ghost T.I wanted to set up the whole crew when a. they saved his money from the heist he got caught in  b. the only person who betrayed him was Jake  Michael Ealy.Other than those 2 points I didn't see anything worth mentioning. I am not one of those people who complain about the camera controls or the lighting. I come into movies with an expectation to be entertained not looking for a technical  mechanical masterpiece. I could care less about the lighting as long as the it isn't in the way  the story is good.Okay now one to the good parts 1. There were 2 high famous music entertainers in the story Chris Brown  T.I. Where other directors would have tried to make them the focal piece of the story  have them in every scene. This director used them as supporting cast members  it played out beautifully. Each had about a 30 min scene where they shined  the story focused on them. Chris Brown Jesse had a great chase scene where he is jumping over cars  doing acrobatic flips. Very entertaining. T.I Ghost has a very big ending where he is great.2. Action Action Action. While I know this story has been done a few times this summer in their defense this movie was slated to come out to come out last year but T.I went to jail so it was pushed back a year. So I can't fault them for that. The action was great. Blowing streets lots of gun shots  killing. Just great.3. Lack of character development. I hate movies that spend 1hr over explaining things. Action movies are about actions. If I want deep character development I will go watch a chic flick. So while I think more character development could have been done I am happy it wasn't to some extent.4. The cast was amazing. Marianna Jean Baptiste Idris Elba Chris Brown Paul Walker Matt Dillion  etc all were great. No one dropped the ball. Each character was believable  showed off their talents.So in short... this is a good movie. Don't go in expecting anything but an opportunity to be entertained  you will love it.".

Apparently their routine is holdup a bank once a year and split the 2 million between the five of them. But you can't live the high life for long on that take so when recently paroled exteammate Ghost played by rapper T.I. makes an appearance with a job to knock off an armored car you can bet the team is willing. But with rule bending cop Jack Welles Matt Dillon in pursuit will they be able to get away with it?I'm seeing a pattern that I hope finds an end. As with The Expendables Takers has a gang of men who are too similar. Whereas the former had a bunch of instruments of death the latter's team isn't as easy to categorize. I can't begin to describe their personas. It appears they can each fight and handle a gun. At one point it looked like A.J. was the wheelman but that didn't last long as he's next used as the demolitions expert. Until recently it was always possible to label one as the prankster but there has been such a blogosphere backlash against comic relief that Hollywood seems afraid to provide personality. Sure would have been nice to see their interaction with each other extend beyond posing outside a nightclub and explaining the situation.Takers is so overridden by a nonabrasive lack of imaginationa mentality to not screw up the film which backfires by failing to provide anything newthat I'm forced to give attention to the only creative outlet I could find and that's cinematography. Many scenes feature monochromatic lighting sometimes with a complimentary color in the background. It's pretty much the only thing saving Takers from a straighttovideo release as even the star power is suspect. As far as serious movie fans are concerned the exclusion of Matt Dillon from the poster art is a red flag. We are left to ponder at a bunch of guys who are mostly infamous for their performances. To their credit Paul Walker and Hayden Christensen didn't overpower me with a full throttle force of awkward pauses and tone deafness. Chris Brown on the other hand you should stick to crying over Michael Jackson. Now that we are coming to the end of the summer movie season I'm starting to gain appreciation for The Losers. In that movie Idris and Zoe had better written characters. In that movie the core team members had distinct roles within the group. In that movie an explosive climax ensued. I gave The Losers what I still feel is a justifiable two star rating but compared to the lack of surprise humor or drama found in Takers I do feel tempted to retroactively adjust. Getting back to the task at hand I can't fault the blandness of Takers as total failure but I think we all know that two stars isn't an endorsement.".

What really impressed me about the film was the use of Parkour by the Chris Brown character. They brought it down from the rooftops of Europe down to the busy streets of Los Angeles. This free running art was used to go through a subway station a park a commercial building and through moving traffic. To me Parkour is much more exciting than a car chase. The one unbelievable part was that the the two cops played by Dillon and Hernandez could keep up the chase without being trained in the art. It was not the best Parkour I have seen in a movie but I applaud the effort and it made watching the film worth it and for a while suspenseful.".

The cast includes Matt Dillon Idris Elba Paul Walker Hayden Christensen who after having to deliver such awful dialog and mellow drama in the last three 'STAR WARS' films has actually done pretty well for himself careerwise compared to like Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher Jay Hernandez Zoe Saldana Michael Ealy Jonathon Schaech pop singer Chris Brown and rapper T.I. Brown and T.I. Also executive produced the film. Like 'THE EXPENDABLES' this film made the smart choice of putting all these actors together any one or even two by themselves wouldn't have drawn much attention or cash but adding them all together made for a flashy looking film It made 21 million in it's first weekend that's pretty impressive for this type of film. The movie is a pretty routine cops and robbers film sort of a second rate 'HEIST' but it's also surprisingly entertaining! The film follows a team of five expert and professional bank robbers Elba Walker Christensen Brown and Ealy as they team up with an expartner of theirs T.I. who was just released from prison on a dangerous armored truck heist worth 20 million. The movie also focuses on an obsessed cop Dillon hot on their trail and his seemingly more 'by the book' partner Hernandez. Drama ensues as the 'loose canon' cop neglects his young daughter and the bank robbers feel friction and mistrust for their expartner. There's also a side story revolving around the crooks leader Elba and his drug addicted sister played by Marianne JeanBaptiste.For the most part the characters are underdeveloped and what is developed isn't something we haven't seen hundreds of times before but the cast adds a lot of character and charm to their roles. Each actor is cast perfectly in his or her part although the female parts are pretty small Dillon and Elba are always at their best but actors like Walker and Christensen are actually given a brief chance to shine in movies like this. The action scenes are also stunning. The two heists are extremely impressive and there's a breathtaking foot chase scene! The movie is surprisingly entertaining. I went into the movie expecting to be mildly amused but I was hooked for the most part largely due to the cast and action.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vyNa6Ky58lm8".

It is one of those films that once it has ended you will soon realise what a waste of time it is. One important feature to include with a film about robbers is the motive. Without why should they be putting themselves through such a risk. T.I enters the scene with a proposal to his former bank robber friends having been released from prison. Everyone in the team is wealthy and has no need for risking arrest. This makes no sense! The plan itself is ridiculous yet it appears the police can never land a bullet on one of them. The characters themselves are flat and lifeless. The lack of a motive doesn't help matters. Idris Elba's character has a troubled sister and Matt Dillon and his partner also have troubles but they lack any interest and serve only as a way to draw out the runningtime. Whatever happens to them by the end you will not care.Regardless of the story or characters the action is where the film should entertain the audience but it fails poorly. One decent footchase through an office can't redeem an ambush scene resulting in a shootout. The audio is reduced while music plays in the foreground taking any excitement away. The films almost nonexistent ending will also annoy viewers making this something that should be missed without hesitation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rather than repeat what others have written I'd like to comment on how this film managed to get into circulation.The only known print of the film was found in the basement of a building in Montana in 1976. Preserved and not too soon given the deterioration seen in the middle of the film it was part of a series of films shown during the New York Film Festival representing titles which had recently 1978 been saved. I remember seeing all of them they included Lillom recently issued on DVD in the MurnauBorzage box and worth seeing and The Letter with Jeanne Eagles which blew everyone away. It is a miracle that films still turn up in such a manner even this late in the game. Most films from this time period have long ago turned into flammable dust they started to deteriorate as early as the thirties and it is particularly fortunate that Regeneration is now among the living. Despite its crudities it feels like a documentary of the seedier elements of New York and it still works its magic it has matured very well. Given that we can see how the streets of New York really looked almost 100 years ago the film may play better than it did back then. Most of the people in this film are not actors they are real people and that is what we reacted to when we saw this back in the seventies. Additionally the film is a real window into the transitional period when the onereeler had turned into a longer more ambitious feature. As a first feature for Walsh this film is really extraordinary when we consider that the tools of filmmaking were still crude the comments on the editing of the film are correct. However the abruptness plays better on the big screen. Even more the film also reminds us that the numerous features made between 1914 and 1920 included some real gems that are gone forever and cannot be reevaluated. How many really good actors and directors are known in name only because their work has disappeared?I consider this one of the finest examples of an early silent feature and one of the landmark films of the silent era. It is an illustration of how the director of that time found his or her way made mistakes and had chances to improve. It shows how filmmakers were taking the vocabulary used by Griffith and some European filmmakers to expand the techniques of storytelling to hold an audience's interest for an hour's worth of entertainment.A mustsee if you are interested in silent films.".

	schema:reviewBody "In cinema 1915 is best known as the year of DW Griffith's epic Birth of a Nation. While I won't play down the talents and achievements of Griffith his debut feature was merely a culmination of his prior achievements a milestone in cinema culture but adding nothing to cinematic language. Regeneration however a largely overlooked film although it has its champions was perhaps truly the most important picture of that year.Raoul Walsh previously an assistant to Griffith and already having a handful of short features to his name made his fulllength debut with this romantic gangster fable. The picture opens fairly conventionally for the time Walsh displaying an incredibly firm grasp of film form for such a young director. The opening shot establishes the mood  the recently bereaved protagonist sitting alone in a bare room a curtain billowing forlornly behind him after which we cut away to the hearse bearing his mother in the street outside. However we then see the lad go to the window and look down. In the very next shot the camera is looking down at the hearse exactly as he would see it. Bam! The pointofview shot is born.The pointofview shot is not merely a convenient alternative angle for storytelling. It places the audience into the position of the character. It's something unique to cinema  you can't recreate that in the theatre. The only real equivalent is in novels when the narrative is told from a character's perspective. Walsh here gives cinema that ability and moves the audience from the position of spectator to that of participant. It's particularly apt too for Regeneration as it was adapted from an autobiography. Walsh remains consistent to the story's roots by primarily showing the points of view of the protagonist Owen.Another great thing about Regeneration is its use of dolly shots  that is moving the camera in or out towards or away from the action. This wasn't an innovation as such the dolly having been invented by Giovanni Pastrone for his 1914 epic Cabiria but the dolly shots in that picture are largely uninspired at best creating smooth transitions between different length shots. Walsh however really explores the possibilities of the technique. First he uses it to home in on the young Owen in the scene where his adoptive parents argue over the dinner table. Again this is a move which draws us into the character's world as if we are being pulled forward and forced to look. Much later in the scene where Anna Q. Nilsson bursts into the gangster's den the camera itself rushes forward reaching the centre of the shot at the same pace she does. In effect the camera movement mimics hers and gives the audience a little taste of her sense of urgency.Needless to say there is a lot more to Regeneration than these pioneering camera techniques. Walsh's handling of the dynamic moments is particularly adept with a climactic ridetotherescue worthy of Griffith and some particularly realistic fight scenes. But he was just as capable of great tenderness as he was of great action and the picture is shot through with the sense of melancholy romanticism that is typical of Walsh. And let's not forget the fine naturalistic acting on display although stars Rockliffe Fellowes and Anna Q. Nilsson would soon fade into obscurity.By way of a disclaimer I should point out that Regeneration may not literally be the first motion picture to use pointofview shots. There was after all a wealth of experimentation in the early days of cinema and many films are obscure or lost. It is shortly after this though that the technique seems to enter mainstream usage. For example Cecil B. DeMille's The Cheat made several months after Regeneration features pointofview shots whereas DeMille's Carmen made about the same time as Regeneration does not. Tag Gallagher in his superb essay on Walsh for Senses of Cinema makes similar claims. Whatever the case Walsh certainly excelled in a new kind of cinema one which placed the audience inside the story and this principle would shape much of Walsh's work throughout his fiftyyear career.".

	schema:headline " Raoul Walsh's first feature one of his best and one of the earliest features to utilize New York City locations effectively.";
	schema:reviewBody "Raoul Walsh had just come off The Birth of a Nation both as one of Griffith's assistant directors and as an actor most prominently as John Wilkes Booth when he made this film. In his autobiography Walsh credits Griffith with teaching him not only about much of the art of fiction filmmaking but also about production management technics that aided him in taking full advantage of many of New York City's most pictorial exterior locations.The locations play an important role in adding to the naturalism of an otherwise highly melodramatic plot with the high society young woman turned heroine social worker much overplayed by a major star of the 1910s Anna Q Nilsson and the regeneration of the onetime Lower Manhatan gang leader.The wonder of this film is the performance of the male star Rockliffe Fellowes who played in over a dozen nearly unremembered films until he died in 1950. His performance is so subtly varied and electrically alive that one is reminded of Brando in his early 1950s films. An interesting sidenote about his performance The movieola film editing machine  that magnified the small 35mm frame to about 4 inches by 6 inches as it ran the film stock through the viewer at the proper projection speed  was not invented until much later. In 1915 editors had to hold the footage up to the light to see each frame andor use a magnifying glass but they could not also run the film at speed at the same time. Hence many of the subtlest nuances that cross the hero's face could not be clearly seen and judged in editing Regeneration's editor often cuts away before the movement has settled or cuts into a close or medium shot of the hero after the nuance has already begun.Watching the film on a large screen today one is aware how powerful presentday editing technics are at capturing all such movements in the hands of a skilled editor. In Regeneration there is a distinct feeling of rough editing at the moments we leave or cut to the hero at the wrong instant. By the way the original title was NOT The Regeneration but Regeneration alone. From which we can surmise that Walsh was looking to create a work with universal meaning.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raoul Walsh aged 28 has already done it all  he's been a Cowboy an actor and Griffith's assistant for BIRTH OF A NATION in witch he also played Lincoln's murderer. That's certainly why his very first movies as this Regeneration are already so mastered and so mature. The story of the movie is quite simple  it tells us the life of a gang leader  Owen from his unhappy childhood to his regeneration thanks to Mary a young lady who believed in his kindness and allows him a second chance. But beyond this classical story this movie is both a brilliant example of Griffith's omnipotent influence on early American cinema and also a totally original and new form of cinema for it invents the codes of the Gangster's movie and of the Film Noir for the years to come. As in a Griffith's feature the ideas of the movie are developed thanks to an original use of the editing. For instance at the beginning of the movie Walsh superposes a frame of Owen adult drinking a beer with one of the same character as a child eating an ice cream in the exact same position. This editing has of course a narrative function  it reminds us that Owen is the same character of the beginning of the movie only few years after  but it also presents him whereas he could appears as a dangerous criminal as the same innocent victim that he was younger. This king of narrative and yet symbolist use of the editing is both a homage to Griffith and an introduction to Walsh'own style and thematic. Griffith's influence is also very strong in the movie's will to be spectacular. When Walsh wants to show how Owen tries to change in the contact of Mary he creates for instance a gigantic fire on a boat where Owen risks his life saving children. Of course we're not really in the bigger than life world of INTOLERANCE or of BIRTH OF A NATION but still it's the same spectacular idea of the cinema that Walsh and Griffith share. In 1915 Raoul Walsh is certainly still in the shadow of Griffith but Regeneration is a lot more than a copy of Griffith's cinema and can be fully appreciates without its relation to its style.The movie is particularly realistic and has nothing to see with Griffith traditional romanticism. It's the adaptation of an excriminal autobiography and Walsh is really good in showing sordid and realistic details especially in the description of Owen's terrible childhood. The movie is surprisingly strong violent and realistic for its age. But Walsh also adds to this realistically point of view a sort or mythification of his Gangster's character who almost become an icon witch we'll find again in the all American Cinema to come from Hawks 's SCARFACE to Scorsese's movies. Fiction is already torn between realism and myth and a large part of Walsh's Cinema will develops this thematic as in his absolute masterpiece  THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. The realism of the movie even goes with the myth for it's mostly in the realistically description of a gangster's everyday life that the Film Noir will takes its future codes. Owen and his gang spend most of their time doing nothing  they walk on the docks in the streets or drinks in clubs but we almost never see them in action. Or when we do we see them doing good things for action time is in the movie regeneration time. Morality is in Walsh'Cinema a rhythm question. Inaction and immobility stuck to the Gangster's life whereas action and movements is associated to honesty and to the opportunity to grab a good life. That's how  Regeneration  always seems to be torn between external GriffithWalsh and internal realismmyth conflicts that are the extension of Owen's inner fights between a honest's life and a gangster's one between the soft world of Mary and the harsh and masculine one of the Gang. The end of the movie literally destroys this psychological conflict when the two characters that symbolized each side both died. After having destroyed the two conflicted sides of his personality Owen's life can really begins as well as Walsh's cinema.".

When there's a fight it seems pretty real. When you have some toughs they're tough and not just acting tough.There's a shot early in the story where the star as a teenager has a fight. One of the spectators has a nose tumor. Its just the sort of thing you'd see in a bad area. These details make it real.The camera is stationary except for very few moments. As I say the editing is clumsy but there is some terrific irising and two very effective superpositions. Those two elements the effective use of the city and the camera make this worth watching.The story is trite in most respects except the ending which is intelligent.

	schema:reviewBody "What a super movie  it had thrills suspense and a very surprising finish you have to keep reminding yourself it is over 96 years old!!! Anna Q. Nilsson may well have been one of the first film stars to freelance. She was a beautiful Swedish actress who had been working at Kalem for four years. Unfortunately her salary had not increased much and she had just divorced her husband who happened to be Kalem's leading actor.Raoul Walsh esteemed her talents as an actress enough for him to cast her in Regeneration his first major directorial assignment and a sensational crime movie based on Owen Kildare's popular play My Mamie Rose which was said to be autobiographical. Walsh a disciple of D.W. Griffiths may even have surpassed his master in some of the scenes from this movie. The crowd scenes at Grogans captured the color and vibrancy of the city's melting pot of people. Outside of a few scenes in a Bowery mission it was all filmed on the streets of New York including scenes on the Hudson River.The film begins with young Owen due to the death of his mother being taken in by his neighbours the Conways a rough couple who soon familiarize Owen with tough unforgiving tenement life. Owen Rockcliffe Fellows is eventually hardened to the might is right way of the streets and by his mid twenties is the leader of a tough street gang. The new D.A. vows to stamp out the gangsters but bows to pressure from butterfly socialite Marie Nilsson who longs to see a gangster close up. He takes her to Grogans the local gangster haunt but is involved in a scuffle and Marie's real distress catches Owen's attention. He breaks up the fight but the incident awakens Marie's better self and she soon finds herself running a settlement house in the heart of the gangster district. The day everyone looks forward to is the annual treat a day of pleasure on a large boat. The fire on board the boat showed Walsh's superb handling of crowds  people madly running everywhere the plunging into the river the frantic scramble to get to a boat that eventually collapses through overloading and the end title that declares All the kiddies were saved!!! Apparently Walsh hired thugs from Hell's Kitchen to round up some extras from the Bowery and when there weren't enough women he offered some men extra money to dress up as women and it made for a vivid and realistic sequence when they all jumped into the water. William Fox was so impressed that he raised Walsh's salary to 800 a week!!There is even a graphic for 1915 scene of drug use. A woman flees to the settlement begging that someone rescue her baby from the dwelling she shares with her drug addicted husband. Owen who is not involved with the settlement is deemed the man for the job and when he goes to the room and finds the man in a groggy state by rescuing the baby his salvation begins. Children are symbols of innocence and purity  Owen as a child was seen as a loving little boy who was corrupted by the adult couple who took him in and in the fire sequence Owen runs back to the boat to save two little girls. Griffith's influence is seen in the pathos when Marie realises Owen has secretly helped a friend Skinny to avoid a serious charge although in Owen's favour he wants nothing more to do with Skinny  it was as a favour to repay a childhood debt.Interspersed between a brutal near rape scene are various Griffith inspired titles very flowery some with biblical quotations.".

To think that this fulllength feature was made in l915 is astounding. Maybe it's because of its amazing star Rockliffe Fellowes who looks so much like Marlon Brando you'll be doubletakes. That he never became a legendary star is a real tragedy but when you think of it almost none of the film actors from that era survived into the 20s except for Mary Pickford and a few comedians. Rockcliffe is so natural as is his costar the beautiful Anna Q. Nillsen you have to remind yourself that they were acting. This movie should be studied in film courses to show today's younger movie buffs what dynamic work was being done back int he dinosaur age of films. And maybe like myself they'll never forget the fantastic Rockliffe Fellowes. This guy coulda been a contendah!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd been meaning to return to this film Regeneration for some time and finally did after seeing it on the double feature DVD with Young Romance 1915. This review is replacing the one I wrote over 5 years ago. I was overly hasty in my previous comment I think now and I want to elaborate on some things and make some new comments. Moreover only 2 out of 13 people found my prior comment useful so that's a good indication that I should try to at least write and express my opinions better. I considered this film less than average the last time I saw it whether for a film from 1915 or for a film from anytime and I still consider it such. Others however clearly consider it a good to excellent picture and some of them have made good arguments to that effect in their IMDb comments and so that has also encouraged me to revisit Regeneration.The best part of this film is probably as others have said its realism in using locals as extras and for minor parts its location shooting and that especially through the scenes of violent parents I think convincingly demonstrates the cycle of violence in such a slum. Most of the photoplay however concerns itself with the plot of the regeneration of supposed gangsters. There are quite a few title cards that setup the picture to be a gangstercrime film of which there had already been some in the US The Musketeers of Pig Alley 1912 and Alias Jimmy Valentine 1915 are the most accessible ones today but here they're only gangsters in so far as they gather together and do little and rough up someone they don't like occasionally. There's no on screen impetus for a politician to want to crackdown on these gangsters at least not before he seeks to do so but doesn't that plot line is dropped abruptly and never much develops. Near the end there are some rather unprovoked outbursts that are especially violent by the Skinny character but there's still no sense of any organized crime.The storyline becomes more akin to a William S. Hart Western and similar hackneyed formulas Owen either lazily drinks and smokes and gathers idly with his friends or gets into some fights what Hart did at saloons in the first parts of his films for comparison until he falls in love with the white virginal Christian woman often a reformer and from a higher class as here and so begins his regeneration becoming Christian and civilized.The acting here isn't special either although the leads do OK enough for back then. Anna Q. Nilsson in particular would have a decent career in the silent era including playing the pure woman for Hart's Western The Toll Gate 1920 and continued acting long after that. The only consistent problem with the acting was the tendency of Nilsson and Rockliffe Fellowes to turn away from other characters and stare at nothing to project that they're thinking or are conflicted. The uncredited actor despite appearing to have the third most screen time who plays the little fellow at least stares at Fellowes and Nilsson in some queer adulation.The attempted rape climax the rescue attempt in addition to further influence for the Marie Deering character are taken straight from the formulas of D.W. Griffith which makes sense since this film's director Raoul Walsh was fresh from working on Griffith's The Birth of a Nation released earlier in 1915. Griffith had mastered this formula from his multiple lastminuterescue shorts at Biograph and brought the pure woman the attempted rape of her and her rescue together in The Birth of a Nation. The editing in the climax of Regeneration and its constant crosscutting throughout use of match cuts irises and so on demonstrate further the influence of Griffith but in Regeneration most of it's choppier clumsily derivative and often rushed and lacking as in the rescue and denouement.The good woman and regeneration plots and other themes probably have more ancient roots dating to the stage as well. There are a couple other seeming influences on smaller parts of Regeneration I'd like to comment on though. The fire scene on the boat recalls similar sensational sequences rather irrelevant to the rest of the plot from earlier Danish silent films. The Great Circus Catastrophe Ddsspring til hest fra cirkuskuplen 1912 which involved a fire in a hotel and Atlantis 1913 which involved a ship sinking if little fire come to mind. Regeneration was based on an autobiography and its theatrical adaptation but it also seems plain to me that it's based on preexisting movie conventions. On film technique another aspect that stands out are some brief dolly shots which were likely inspired by Cabiria which used comparatively boring slow dolly shots. Dolly shots had been exploited in cinema since at least 1903 but Cabiria seems to have briefly popularized it and influenced their use in some subsequent films.Nevertheless in Regeneration there's the realism of the surroundings in contrast to the shallow development and formulaic nature of the narrative a gangster's world without gangsters real people surrounding movie clichs. The film techniques and style are not original but are lesser imitations.Note There's considerable bleeding and deterioration to the surviving print.".

The use of real locations and real actors is a nice touch but the story drags along and the editing which Walsh is clearly trying to copy Griffith is a mess. The 70minute running time feels a bit long as well. From a historic standpoint this is worth viewing once but I doubt I'd go back for a second viewing. The highlight of the film is one scene where people are partying on a boat which catches fire and they must try to make an escape. This here is certainly one of the great scenes of the silent era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Raoul Walsh this is an exciting and poetic film using all the elements at play in his greatest movies. Those signatures really stand out even all the way back at the beginning of his career.It's the story of a tenement street kid who loses his kindly mother at age 10. The scene that starts the film is quite moving. This is not to be a comic adventure film but a very serious drama. The boy is taken in by a neighbor woman a harridan but a kind hearted one whose husband is a drunkard who beats her and the boy every chance he gets. The boy starts to lose whatever humanity he had due to the influence of this battling couple.He rises to a position of 'prominence' in the tenement community over the years since he has all the things that the denizens of the street find attractive  a devil may care attitude a sense of daring a lot of strength and good looks. He's never lost his inner gentle nature but it's hidden under a mask of bravado and cynicism that he needs to survive. The actor Rockcliffe Fellowes looks like a cross between Marlon Brando Jimmy Cagney and Jason Segal. He's quite good... in fact he totally reminds me of Brando in THE WILD ONE. The camera loves him. As Owen he's able to play both sensitive and tough which is a magic combination for Walsh.He falls for Marie whom he calls Mamie Rose Anna Q.Nilsson a wealthy girl who is being groomed by her parents for marriage to the city's new District Attorney. The DA has just been appointed and tells all the newspapers that he is cracking down on crime. One night the girl tells the DA that she wants to see what the street toughs are like for herself. The DA tells her and her friends that he knows a dive where they can see all the lowlifes they want to. Of course after having his picture in the papers all over town the DA is immediately recognized and the crowd starts to heckle him showing him how tough they really are. The girl cries out for someone to help the foolish DA and our Owen breaks up the crowd and leads them to safety. Owen is smitten and Mamie is struck hard with the need to help the poor and destitute.She immediately starts work in the neighborhood doing good deeds and handing out medicine and money to the needy. The rest is just about what you would think a Walsh film would be with Owen trying to make good out of unrequited love for Marie who doesn't really realize his feelings. He finds inspiration to become better educated and make something of himself through her ministrations. She turns to him as a pillar of strength when things go wrong.His loyal pal a street kid who has a deformity who Owen once saved from being made fun of is a splendid actor. All of the street toughs really look like street toughs which is refreshing and a bit scary. Walsh builds up the action in a very similar way to The Roaring Twenties with a really evil gang leader who takes over when Owen tries to goes straight. There was a surprise ending for me anyway.This film was very well done for the time it was made and I can see how it made Walsh famous. It made me love him all the more for his sensitivity and realism.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walsh had much more spotlight subsequently. Can we ever forget White Heat High Sierra The Roaring Twenties? He's the reason John Wayne is on the map and he has worked in a vocation where he has given many actors their magnum opus and moreover he's one of the directors that inherited story before methodology.The role that he left an indelible impression on me was his portrayal of John Wilkes Booths. He was a harrowing figure in it and aptly it worked as he had just started off acting and was probably the right age to give the portrait a verisimilitude. The time place and cause and effect were balanced by a brooding canvas in historicity a momentum of perfection.The same year he graced his own project to the screen. It's 96 years old and has barely withered its original acetate despite being heavily smudged on blue tints of the negative especially near the beginning when Owen goes and gets a bucket for his dipsomaniac adopted Father. But a lot of it is fairly pristine.The film is based on a book about a young boy Owen. As we go through the pervasively impressive film there's one thing for certain  it's a commentary on the civilisation of susceptible parents and their malicious effect to this young adopted boy. It reflects later on when Owen saves a boy who Marie Deering a girl who works in Grogan's and then is drawn to his joint. The period periodically changes and we're then lead to believe that he has ran down to the lowest status in a derelict area. Potent in the way it's looked at we watch a society without poise were fighting is ample in mustering entertainment.The character of Owen and the regeneration of his clique is hellbent on the omnipresence of Marie Deering she aids Owen in his studies influence and loving compassion. She's the thing that also destroys him he never reconciles in the gang he originally lead and they're causing a havoc with their abuse of Police and their brutal comeuppance. One bit that's sort of disjointed from the narrative is when Marie Deering during the second act invites him and his Friends into a party and throughout it Owen leers at another woman who's docile and unfazed. He then throws his cigarette on the boat unbeknownst that it burns. I guess the scene was used as a visual provocation yet it still does leave a grand and lyrical impact inherent. It's also perhaps a way of uniting them all and separating it later.It's a deep film. The seminal Gangster film has a lot of heart and you can even sense its seminal films on such films as Howard Hawks' Scarface The Public Enemy and his own film Roaring Twenties. The manipulation of lighting to emphasise by masking the gun or dissolving is not dissimilar to how it's done today. Though the way it's used here is a bit more vivid looking at the way the officious guy is introduced to the scene where Marie is working to entice us with important plot points. The most impressive of these sequences is an abrupt scene where a Gang Member is harassed by an Officer and takes out a knife to go in for the coup de grace. Most films would chiefly employ blood to give it the verisimilitude  the realism to set it apart  here though to keep its gritty and taut realism Walsh uses off screen cutting to let the Audience comprehend the outcome.It's probably fundamentally great to understand like Fleming with his primitive films that Walsh was just a disciple of Griffith who he was influenced by watch The Muskateers of Pig Alley and his literary influences this film was adapted from Owen Kildare Frawley's My Mamie Rose autobiography which hitherto I was startled to find out that the film was reciting a time of an actual boys life and memoirs to accompany it making it of even more valuable commodity.The thing is the character is visceral and not intellectual. The story grows in a cerebral way and does not descend to ruthless violence probably because it would have been harder to sell. But in a way it's adscititious it would be faltered in its tone and focus.Another thing that will definitely jolt audiences today is the fact that the film relies on visuals. If when looking at the narrative through the camera you actually notice that in fact your mind gives the character their contours. You have to understand the struggle  with other films to justify it all seems pretty well grounded in the genre of its tradition  and it will not leave you with disappointment.While not epic the film is a character study a utopian and dystopian story  truly taut hard stylised with little bits of emotions and a veracity.".

He's the reason John Wayne is on the map and he has worked in a vocation where he has given many actors their magnum opus and moreover he's one of the directors that inherited story before methodology.The role that he left an indelible impression on me was his portrayal of John Wilkes Booths. He was a harrowing figure in it and aptly it worked as he had just started off acting and was probably the right age to give the portrait a verisimilitude. The time place and cause and effect were balanced by a brooding canvas in historicity a momentum of perfection.The same year he graced his own project to the screen. It's 96 years old and has barely withered its original acetate despite being heavily smudged on blue tints of the negative especially near the beginning when Owen goes and gets a bucket for his dipsomaniac adopted Father. But a lot of it is fairly pristine.The film is based on a book about a young boy Owen. As we go through the pervasively impressive film there's one thing for certain  it's a commentary on the civilisation of susceptible parents and their malicious effect to this young adopted boy. It reflects later on when Owen saves a boy who Marie Deering a girl who works in Grogan's and then is drawn to his joint. The period periodically changes and we're then lead to believe that he has ran down to the lowest status in a derelict area. Potent in the way it's looked at we watch a society without poise were fighting is ample in mustering entertainment.The character of Owen and the regeneration of his clique is hellbent on the omnipresence of Marie Deering she aids Owen in his studies influence and loving compassion. She's the thing that also destroys him he never reconciles in the gang he originally lead and they're causing a havoc with their abuse of Police and their brutal comeuppance. One bit that's sort of disjointed from the narrative is when Marie Deering during the second act invites him and his Friends into a party and throughout it Owen leers at another woman who's docile and unfazed. He then throws his cigarette on the boat unbeknownst that it burns. I guess the scene was used as a visual provocation yet it still does leave a grand and lyrical impact inherent. It's also perhaps a way of uniting them all and separating it later.It's a deep film. The seminal Gangster film has a lot of heart and you can even sense its seminal films on such films as Howard Hawks' Scarface The Public Enemy and his own film Roaring Twenties. The manipulation of lighting to emphasise by masking the gun or dissolving is not dissimilar to how it's done today. Though the way it's used here is a bit more vivid looking at the way the officious guy is introduced to the scene where Marie is working to entice us with important plot points. The most impressive of these sequences is an abrupt scene where a Gang Member is harassed by an Officer and takes out a knife to go in for the coup de grace. Most films would chiefly employ blood to give it the verisimilitude  the realism to set it apart  here though to keep its gritty and taut realism Walsh uses off screen cutting to let the Audience comprehend the outcome.It's probably fundamentally great to understand like Fleming with his primitive films that Walsh was just a disciple of Griffith who he was influenced by watch The Muskateers of Pig Alley and his literary influences this film was adapted from Owen Kildare Frawley's My Mamie Rose autobiography which hitherto I was startled to find out that the film was reciting a time of an actual boys life and memoirs to accompany it making it of even more valuable commodity.The thing is the character is visceral and not intellectual. The story grows in a cerebral way and does not descend to ruthless violence probably because it would have been harder to sell. But in a way it's adscititious it would be faltered in its tone and focus.Another thing that will definitely jolt audiences today is the fact that the film relies on visuals. If when looking at the narrative through the camera you actually notice that in fact your mind gives the character their contours. You have to understand the struggle  with other films to justify it all seems pretty well grounded in the genre of its tradition  and it will not leave you with disappointment.While not epic the film is a character study a utopian and dystopian story  truly taut hard stylised with little bits of emotions and a veracity.";

Fascinating film one of a kind. The festival closer Taxidermia a study in the gymnastics of regurgitation made enough people in Hungary puke this year to convince the critics that it was the Best Film of the Year  different shucks for different folks. All things considered however 2006 was not a bad year at all for the steadily reviving Hungarian cinema and White Palms is one if the best of the new breed.";

If this is not a true life story I would guess that it must be based on one as it is so very credible. The choice of athletes and actors was good and the role of the coach who trained the young gymnasts was played menacingly well. What a horrible character and unfortunately there may be more than one of those in the real world. The parents were disgusting  I'd run away from home if they were mine. After all his misadventures I hope that Mikls enjoyed his time with Cirque De Soleil in Las Vegas because by then in my opinion after all the hardships he endured he deserved to be treated as a very unique person.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hungarian director Szabolcs Tajdu's new film White Palms has its moments of excellence in a fairly uninteresting account of the life and career of a national gymnast named Miklos Dongo. Dongo is trained under a brutal and authoritative coach when he was very young. His life is changed when he suffers a serious nonsport related injury. He signs up to be a coach many years later and is forced to train Kyle Manjak a young Canadian gymnast whose talent is immense but is lacking in discipline. Should he lash out on his student with the same brutality shown by his coach? Or should he stick to a softer approach? In the end he decides to set an example by training rigorously together with Kyle and qualify themselves for the World Gymnastics Competition.Tajdu presents White Palms as two narrative threads of different timelines with the central focus on the character of Dongo. The present thread shows Dongo and Kyle together as coach and trainee respectively and as opponents in competition. The 'flashback' thread shows the anguish and misery suffered by Dongo when he was under his diabolical coach. Both threads run backandforth with each other and it is difficult to see what the director wants to achieve. Only crossing the hour mark does White Palms become thematically clearer. The two threads eventually converge into a rousing climax of slowmotion balletic images that suggest the fickle psychological state of Dongo whose past comes back to haunt him.White Palms concludes in an inferential manner that is slightly odd. More questions will be asked than answers given out by the time the end credits roll. It tries to explain the psyche of Dongo by further revealing his character's actions. Some may see it as a proper closure for the film's lead character but it is done halfheartedly that it loses most of its impact.

	schema:headline " Gripping story  at least the half of it";
	schema:reviewBody "So I've recently seen this movie and have very mixed feelings about it. It's like 2 different movies and as such has its ups and downs.Long story short it is the story of Dong Zoltn Mikls Hajd a Hungarian gymnast whose career had been broken in two due to a childhood accident. 19 years later he starts to rebuild his life in Canada where he becomes a trainer but the shadows of his past still haunt him. He commits physical abuse against a child under his care and almost expelled from the gym club for that. His only chance to redeem himself is to take care of and train Kyle a promising but utterly stubborn and rebelling teenager gymnast the country's greatest hope for the next Olympic games. The story's last quarter takes place at a world championship in Hungary where we simultaneously learn the happenings of the past which led to giving up the protagonist's career and how he looses the championship but finding some moral remedy for himself. In the closing scene we see Dong as a member of the worldfamous Cirque du Soleil.Let's start with the good one. Parts taking place in the 80's are phenomenal. The stories of young Dong Orion Radies are full of with throatgripping scenes about childhood abuse parents forcing their child to fulfill the parents' dream the physical and psychical breaking of the gymnasts so they can be the best of the best. Even more appalling and aggravating how the parents assisted to the abuse especially rough scene the one with the whipped boy whose father a state intelligence agency's member sat down and watched the whole thing like nothing happened. These scenes are clearly from the childhood memories from the writerdirector Szabolcs Hajdu. Acting is superb Puma the trainer Gheorghe Dinica though not as frightful as for example Fletcher in Whiplash still delivers the character greatly.And now the low parts. The storyline in the 2000's is nowhere near as wellmade as the first half of the movie. The whole situation feels overly madeup and you cannot escape the feeling that they just connected 2 completely independent storylines just to make the movie longer. Kyle's character and motivation are hardly fleshed out. Drives behind adult Dong's actions are also poorly portrayed and though Hajdu the writer and director's brother physically suits for the role his acting is nothing to write home about. The same can be said about the Canadian gym club leader who looks a bit fake and exaggerated. The ending is also somewhat confusing but acceptable. The movie itself is also a bit hypocrite. Upon the commitment of physical abuse the club leader scolds Dong that this is completely not OK. As if abuse physical and psychical was a thing of the past. However abuse remains even today in almost every branch of the competitive sport. Now the main drive is not the national or personal pride but the money of the sponsors and still the expectations of the parents.Even though I would like to praise the movie for letting the people know about the harsh and unforgiving regime of the world of the professional sport  or at least a tiny slice of it. It helps you to realize how many broken childhood mentally and emotionally disfigured juvenile men and women are behind the medals of the Olympic and world championships. And it successfully convinced me to encourage my children to do sports but keep them the hell away from the professional sport if I want to grow mentally healthy adults out of them.".

	schema:headline " Gritty But Entertaining Spaghetti Revenge Opera";
	schema:reviewBody "Quintana Dead or Alive writer  director Vincenzo Musolino's Spaghetti western May God Forgive You . . . I Won't epitomizes the blood vengeance that the swiftshooting protagonist extracts from the gang of coldblooded killers that massacred his defenseless family at the McDonald Ranch while he was away in town on an errand. George Ardisson is sufficiently rugged in both appearance and reputation as Cjamango in the character's second film and nothing thwarts this flinty hero in his quest for revenge. Before he learns about the massacre of his family Cjamango goes to the devilish dastard who held the mortgage on the McDonald spread Stuart Luigi Pavese of For A Few Dollars Less and paid the villainous jackal off. This doesn't prevent Stuart from hiring the Smart brothers and his guntoting army to finish off Cjmango. Although Cjmango is invincible he finds himself more often than not an underdog who must submit to an obstacle course of pain and suffering when he confronts the elder Smart Dick Smart Anthony Ghidra of Hole in the Forehead and his triggerhappy bunch of sixgun toting sadists. Our hero shows the murderers a black  white photograph of his family before he executes them. The first gunfight occurs in a saloon during a poker game. The second takes place in a private residence where our hero doesn't even give the villain a chance to defend himself and ultimately murders him. The third shootout transpires in another saloon with gunslinger Jack Smart Peter Martell of Long Days of Hate wiping out three gunmen who challenge him. Not long afterward Cjamango comes calling and blasts Jack off his feet. Musolino stages the gunfight with Jack standing at the top of a staircase and Cjamango below him on floor level. Naturally genre stalwart Pancho Sanchez provides comic relief as Garcia Ramirez 'Barrica.' Basically he claims the bodies of the dead men that Cjamango kills and turns them in for the reward money on their heads. Predictably Cjamango undergoes torture at the hands of the elder Stuart. At one point Stuart's henchmen gang up on our hero repeatedly punch him out and then force him to walk with ropes bound to each wrist. He escapes from his captors but putting his bound hands into a fire to burn his restraints away. Eventually our hero escapes and he finds himself a weapon to even up the odds against the Smart gunmen a multibarreled Gatling Gun.As my synopsis indicates May God Forgive You . . . I Won't boasts all the key ingredients of a typical Italian western revenge a high body count a blonde tough guy hero who is beaten and tortured by dastardly unrepentant villains and a Gatling gun. Photographed in splendid widescreen by Vengeance Is My Forgiveness lenser Mario Mancini this entertaining horse opera horse opera benefits not only from the strikingly cenic but austere Spanish terrain but also Giovanni Fratalocchi's colorful art direction and Giovanni Fratalocchi's atmospheric set decoration. Mancini creates some interesting visuals with his use of Dutchtilt angles especially during the second attack on the McDonald ranch. Composer Felice Di Stefano's orchestral soundtrack is good but sometimesparticularly during the first duelwhat we hear are clips from John Barry's music from the James Bond thriller Thunderball. Mancini's harsh lighting accentuates his flavorful oater. Clocking in at 86 minutes Musolino stages several brisk and bloody shootouts that should please Spaghetti western plans.".

	onyx:emotionText "Quintana Dead or Alive writer  director Vincenzo Musolino's Spaghetti western May God Forgive You . . . I Won't epitomizes the blood vengeance that the swiftshooting protagonist extracts from the gang of coldblooded killers that massacred his defenseless family at the McDonald Ranch while he was away in town on an errand. George Ardisson is sufficiently rugged in both appearance and reputation as Cjamango in the character's second film and nothing thwarts this flinty hero in his quest for revenge. Before he learns about the massacre of his family Cjamango goes to the devilish dastard who held the mortgage on the McDonald spread Stuart Luigi Pavese of For A Few Dollars Less and paid the villainous jackal off. This doesn't prevent Stuart from hiring the Smart brothers and his guntoting army to finish off Cjmango. Although Cjmango is invincible he finds himself more often than not an underdog who must submit to an obstacle course of pain and suffering when he confronts the elder Smart Dick Smart Anthony Ghidra of Hole in the Forehead and his triggerhappy bunch of sixgun toting sadists. Our hero shows the murderers a black  white photograph of his family before he executes them. The first gunfight occurs in a saloon during a poker game. The second takes place in a private residence where our hero doesn't even give the villain a chance to defend himself and ultimately murders him. The third shootout transpires in another saloon with gunslinger Jack Smart Peter Martell of Long Days of Hate wiping out three gunmen who challenge him. Not long afterward Cjamango comes calling and blasts Jack off his feet. Musolino stages the gunfight with Jack standing at the top of a staircase and Cjamango below him on floor level. Naturally genre stalwart Pancho Sanchez provides comic relief as Garcia Ramirez 'Barrica.' Basically he claims the bodies of the dead men that Cjamango kills and turns them in for the reward money on their heads. Predictably Cjamango undergoes torture at the hands of the elder Stuart. At one point Stuart's henchmen gang up on our hero repeatedly punch him out and then force him to walk with ropes bound to each wrist. He escapes from his captors but putting his bound hands into a fire to burn his restraints away. Eventually our hero escapes and he finds himself a weapon to even up the odds against the Smart gunmen a multibarreled Gatling Gun.As my synopsis indicates May God Forgive You . . . I Won't boasts all the key ingredients of a typical Italian western revenge a high body count a blonde tough guy hero who is beaten and tortured by dastardly unrepentant villains and a Gatling gun. Photographed in splendid widescreen by Vengeance Is My Forgiveness lenser Mario Mancini this entertaining horse opera horse opera benefits not only from the strikingly cenic but austere Spanish terrain but also Giovanni Fratalocchi's colorful art direction and Giovanni Fratalocchi's atmospheric set decoration. Mancini creates some interesting visuals with his use of Dutchtilt angles especially during the second attack on the McDonald ranch. Composer Felice Di Stefano's orchestral soundtrack is good but sometimesparticularly during the first duelwhat we hear are clips from John Barry's music from the James Bond thriller Thunderball. Mancini's harsh lighting accentuates his flavorful oater. Clocking in at 86 minutes Musolino stages several brisk and bloody shootouts that should please Spaghetti western plans.";

So many facets are perfect Loy at her peak of gorgeous wry sophistication the Deco sets Powell's gentle irony the relationships of various characters and the consistency of dialog even the physical pranks were greatand I don't like slapstick all that much! This film reminded me of Shop Around the Corner. It wasn't as good that's a tall order but there was something bigger going on in this movie than just the usual romantic farce. I have to admire the writer's and director's ability to pull off a romantic comedy between two such diametrically opposed people. The heroine is the quintessential control freak the hero as laid back and tolerant as a hippie of the sixties. No one apologizes for their quirks which is refreshing and neither of them had to change all that much to make the ending work. And as far as acting goes Loy and Powell don't hold back any punches literally! whenever the two characters collide. It is amazing to watch them knowing how they were reacting to Harlow's death during shooting. I love finding old movies and this one is buried treasure.".

The idea of these two getting together is pretty farfetched! But because this is a Hollywood film you know that eventually the two will find love. However how they get there and how much fun the film becomes is exactly why you should see the film.It all begins with Powell teaching a young couple to act and they are discussing his latest screenplay. The three are fast friends and have fun planning on making a film together. HOWEVER when the very controlling sister Loy finds out about this she assumes the worst and demands Powell stop seeing her sister and her fianc. Mostly this is because Powell isn't in her plan for the twoas Loy has decided the two will marry where they will go on their honeymoon etc.and the two idiots allow this! Little does this compulsive planner and controller know that Powell has plans for her! Overall this is yet another fun pairing of Powell and Loy. While the film is silly and contrived it's also very entertaining and clever. The ending was insanely chaoticlike a Marx Brothers filmand a lot of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Margit Agnew Myrna Loy owns a dress shop that she runs with the precision of a Swiss watch. In fact she micromanages every aspect of her life and the lives of her sister Irene Florence Rice and Irene's fianc Waldo Beaver John Beal. In fact she put the happy couple together in the first place. Except that the couple is not so happy because Margit's forte is managing not feelings.Irene is disappointed in her intended because he is basically a dimwitted though likable dolt. And he never takes charge like she thinks a real man should. Not to worry though because this is a comedy and their dissatisfaction is merely the setup for fun.Irene and Waldo are rehearsing for a movie written by the bohemian artist Charles Lodge William Powell who is teaming with Myra Loy for their seventh film together. When Charlie shows Waldo how to conduct himself in a love scene Irene convinces herself that she now loves Charlie. She tells Margit who needing to put her plan back on track marches over to Charlie's trailerparked at the curb on a city street. But she is no match for the eccentric whimsy of the easygoing Charlie.This film has much to recommend it but it is the writing that drives this film and makes it so much fun. The plot is fairly routine but the dialogue is full of comedic gems. Some are understated some are wacky. They deliver some great zingers and classic pratfalls.Also notable are the fashions. Loy in particular is dressed wellfitting for the owner of a dress shop. The background music is superb often utilizing a recorder to achieve the needed whimsical quality.The cast is wonderful. Waldo's personality is sometimes trying but that is how he is written. Sidney Toler portrays Keough a butler who is a former policeman and who behaves like a detective with his powers of observation and deduction. In 1938 Toler will take over the Charlie Chan franchise. It seems like he is preparing here. I do not think this was an easy script to pull off. Between the director's attention to timing and the actors' commitment to their characters Double Wedding works very well.Despite the slapstick and some scenes that devolve into a general ruckus the script is clever. Loy's determined dryness and the scattered non sequiturs are highlights. How smart they were to toy with the chemistry of the successful PowellLoy team and put them in this different film that still plays to the strengths of each.".

	schema:headline " The Bohemians vs. Ms. Business  screwball all the way";
	schema:reviewBody "Clearly this movie is screwball comedy. It has all the elements of the standard definition. The domineering female who challenges the man's virility. The fast and witty dialog with rejoinders and clever ripostes. The farcical scenes and antics. Double Wedding veers off in places and seems to chop off scenes with poor segue. But these few instances that might be a distraction or fault in any other film fit perfectly with the zaniness of this movie. It's not the best of the screwball films but it still rates 10 stars for laughter. The cast are all outstanding in their roles. The sets filming and other technical aspects are very good. The IMDb Web site gives the plot and other reviewers discuss it and the script. I'll just give some of the funniest lines. Myrna Loy's role is one of her biggest dialogs in her pairings with William Powell. She seems to have more lines as Margit Agnew than does Powell's Charles Lodge. Margit gives this gibberish genealogy to Mrs. Bly about the young man she has chosen to marry her sister Irene. Margit Waldo's a sort of distant relative of ours. Mother you know was a Leslie. The son of her brother Edward Leslie married one of the Boyer girls Anne Boyer. Anne's sister Hermione married Steve Carroll divorced Steve and married Elmer Beaver who had three brothers Andrew Paul and Alexander. Andrew was married twice. His first wife was a Brewster. His second wife was the widow of Morton Thomas nee Caroline Cook. Andrew and Caroline were the parents of Waldo. Get it? Mrs. Bly Nope! Obviously a viewer wouldn't be able to get it either  to write it down like this without DVD technology. This must be the longest silly genealogy recitation in filmdom.Margit has some of the funniest lines in the film. She delivers persiflage at will toward Powell's Lodge. She calls Lodge's living style adolescent Bohemianism. The ending is one of the funniest zaniest scenes of mayhem and pratfalls I can think of from any film. Here are some more very funny lines. Irene Agnew played superbly by Florence Rice to Charles You just don't understand her. She's different form you and me. She's a businesswoman. We're Bohemians. Waldo played very well by John Beal Why do Bohemians have to stay up all night?Mrs. KensingtonBly played excellently by Jessie Ralph It's beginning to look more and more like a hot house. Margit Or a nut house.Charles I was a professional guide in Paris at the time. I used to show people through the sewers. Margit I can think of no one better qualified.Judge Blynn played wonderfully by Donald Meek Would the bride and gloom please join hands. sicWaldo To know Charles is to love him. He's got yumpf. Irene He's got a monopoly on it.Margit You were the best police detective on the force Keough? Keough Yes Miss Agnew. Margit My my! How we all missed being killed in our sleep.Charles Did you want to talk about something? Margit Yes. Do you take dope?Mrs. Bly I 'angeled' this joint for only one reason to put one over on the income tax to lose money. You make profits. Do you want to ruin me? I know! I'll double your salary.Here's another dialog sequence that's hilarious prattle between Margit and her gardener Angelo done very well by Henry Taylor. Margit Angelo? Angelo Yes Miss Agnew? Margit The paper says cloudy probably rain. You won't have to water the garden today. How's your bambino? Angelo Don't water the lawn. The bambino? Oh he's fine. Margit So you can use that time to get rid of all these weeds. Be sure he gets his cod liver oil. Angelo Yes Ma'am. Pull the weeds and oil the bambino. Yes Ma'am.Some reviewers have noted the delay in completing this film and the strain particularly on William Powell and Myrna Loy over the death of Jean Harlow. She and Powell were planning to be married and Loy was a close friend. Harlow was just 26 years old when she died June 7 1937 from kidney failure. She had been ill on and off for the past year but her illnesses had variously been diagnosed as influenza and an inflamed gallbladder. Only toward the end was she diagnosed with kidney failure for which there was no treatment at the time. Her kidney problems may have stemmed from the Scarlet Fever she had as a child. For her short career Harlow was well liked by people all across the movie industry. MGM closed its studio the day of her funeral. At the time of her death she was starring with Clark Gable in Saratoga. The film was finished using three doubles for distance shots and some revisions. It was a box office hit when it came out in July. And Harlow's close friends in the cast of Double Wedding completed it under emotional duress for its release in October of that year.".

Myrna Loy in particular seemed off her game with the usually sophisticated banter coming back at Powell and she barely managed to crack a smile throughout the picture. Other reviewers here put the performance of both in context with the death of Jean Harlow during the movie's filming so that quite likely had a disconcerting impact. Nevertheless there's lots of neat stuff here for fans of both actors along with a few bits of nostalgia for older viewers. Like ten cent hot dogs and hamburgers for sale during one particular scene and a theater marquee promoting A Day at the Races a Marx Brothers flick released in the same year as this film. Regarding the story the tempo seemed uneven at times what with Powell's character switching gears between Margit's sister Irene Florence Rice and Margit herself. There were times it seemed like he was making a play for both and neither one if you know what I'm trying to get at. The character of Waldo Beaver John Beal was a little too wishywashy for this viewer I wish he'd made up his mind for once instead of being consistently run over by Charlie and Margit.But I did get a kick out of some of the supporting players like the spirited Mrs. Bly Jessie Ralph and Margit's butler Keough Sidney Toler.

	schema:reviewBody "You could have William Powell and Myrna Loy read the Sunday comics on camera and it would be a hit. They are just too likeable for the viewer not to be engaged by their screen chemistry. However I've seen most of the their screen pairings and this is my least favorite...but its still fun.Powell is Charles a bohemian director who lives in a small trailer. Loy is the pampered and controlling Margit who tries to run her sister's life as well as everyone else's around her. Her sister Irene Florence Rice is engaged to the milquetoast Waldo John Beal who was handpicked for Irene by her mother and Margit is enforcing the marriage. Trouble comes when Margit believes Irene is falling in love with Charles against her Margit's wishes. This leads to the typical romcom misunderstandings as Charles plays along to make his real love interest Margit jealous. Margit for her part despite trying to run him off finds herself falling in love with him.The supporting cast is superb. I'm not going to list them all here but they do a fine job of adding to the proceedings and the confusion.While most of the movie is pretty tame the witty dialogue between Charles and Margit is reminiscent of Powell's and Loy's snarky digs at each other in the Thin Man movies. The end sequence of a wedding going on in Charles' trailer is a hoot. So many people are crammed inside the trailer that no one can really move. A crowd forms outside and all hll breaks loose. Powell is hilarious as he keeps getting hit on the head.".

Margit for her part despite trying to run him off finds herself falling in love with him.The supporting cast is superb. I'm not going to list them all here but they do a fine job of adding to the proceedings and the confusion.While most of the movie is pretty tame the witty dialogue between Charles and Margit is reminiscent of Powell's and Loy's snarky digs at each other in the Thin Man movies. The end sequence of a wedding going on in Charles' trailer is a hoot. So many people are crammed inside the trailer that no one can really move. A crowd forms outside and all hll breaks loose. Powell is hilarious as he keeps getting hit on the head.";

But the whole thing is lacking in anything like focus timing plot progression or even good gags. The director seems not to know what to do but just stands back and lets the script do the work which it doesn't. A Sturges might have been able to make something out of it but it would have involved a huge rewrite. And may I blaspheme here and say that Powell and Loy are way off form too. Neither manages to generate much sympathy for their characters. Loy is a cold stick even at the end and Powell's attempt at Bohemianism is unconvincing. Pacing is slow dialog is redundant and the tacked on slapstick at the end is strictly by the numbers. I guess we can be charitable and lay the blame on Jean Harlow's demise.".

I did have a little trouble seeing Loy's character married to Powell's character. A sequel would have been great to explore that.For me however there are 2 problems with this film. The first is the first 15 minutes of the film. Frankly it should have been totally rewritten with a better scenario. But after we get to Powell and Loy interacting things turn around pretty well.The other problem is the supporting cast. Florence Rice is okay as the second female love interest. But John Beal floats along like a rock in water. Jessie Ralph as an elderly friend is the one standout among the supporting actorsactresses. And  unfortunately  Sidney Toler is along as the butler and once again proves he had virtually no talent.So for me the film was uneven. But William Powell's masterful comedy instincts make this a film worth savoring while overlooking the problems with the film.".

There must be a story about what happened to the screenplay because it really seems as if a fine tight story was given over to a committee who hacked it to pieces or something.The basic elements of a great comedy are there. Excellent cast. Some fine quirky characters. Powell and Loy's characters are particularly fine setting up a wonderful contrast and conflict. But the plot is a shambles the movie keeps setting itself up to go places that it never actually goes.For instance at the beginning of the film the movie that Charlie wants to make which is going to make Irene a big star is a big deal central to most of the main characters' motivations. And Charlie has it all figured out all they need is to find some rich person to back the film. And gee what a coincidence it turns out that rich Mrs. Bly who backs Margit's dress shop is actually annoyed that the shop makes money she's looking for a tax loss! So what could be more perfect than if she were to back the film they want to make? And then when it turns out that she and Charlie are actually old friends! Well surely that seals the deal! Surely now part of the happy ending will be that they'll get to make the movie!But no actually the whole makingamovie thing is cast aside and forgotten about by about a third of the way into the movie.And then there's the big finale scene where Charlie is faking that he's going to marry Irene while it's clear he's actually plotting to have Waldo arrive and insist on marrying Irene leaving Charlie clear to try to marry Margit at the same time. Surely this is what's going to happen right? I mean come on the movie is named Double Wedding for chrissakes!And yet we got no double wedding. We don't even get a single wedding. For some inexplicable reason instead the entire final scene dissolve into one massive brawl. Whose idea was that? Again seems like a committee got its hands on the script.Well you get the idea of what I'm complaining about. But there was of course a lot of good here too. Great characters good performances some good dialog. I definitely laughed out loud a number of times. But by the end I just felt gypped. The meandering story that can't remember what it's trying to do is just a glaring flaw. It's a shame because handled more skillfully this had all the ingredients to be wonderful.".

It seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time including MGM's own Libeled Lady which featured two of the same stars and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years into their pairing they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's Libeled Lady and the two Thin Man movies they had done prior to this. Double Wedding tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer Myrna Loy who is intent on dominating the life of her sister Florence Rice future brotherinlaw John Beal and her own servants which include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon. When the independent spirited William Powell comes into her life having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control Loy meets her match. Sounds good so far right? Yeah an interesting premise falls short sad to say because Loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see Powell fall in love with her which we know will soon happen. It's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading something Hollywood did often during its golden age. When Loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life its a groaner.Fortunately other than Powell there is freespirited Jessie Ralph on board. A salty wealthy older woman who helped Loy start her business she has an acquaintance with Powell and can see immediately through Loy's cool claims that she loathes him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple and the whole premise of Powell getting between them is senseless. Then an exwife of Powell's shows up which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story and the final wedding scene where a crowd of people try to get into Powell's tiny trailer is a weak attempt to bring some farce. It is funny though that Powell keeps getting hit by items meant by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy with Those chuckles are most welcome since there are so few others. Powell and Loy would do better in two later screwball comedies I Love You Again and Love Crazy which are sophisticated witty and fun. This film attempts to be all three but ends up a sophisticated bore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although this movie is not as well known as most of Luigi Comencini's other films I believe it to be one of his best. It deals with the love of a young boy Mario for his surrogate father Righetto who along with the boy's mother Ada takes care of the child while the husband Aldo is separated from his wife and son as he works in Africa for long stretches of time and barely ever sees his family.After the mother dies in a street accident Aldo returns to Rome where his family lives but only with the intention of putting the boy in an orphanage so that he can return to his job. Mario is indifferent to this father that he barely knows but is deeply devoted to the affectionate and caring Righetto. Righetto works at odd jobs and has not had much in the way of financial stability and yet the boy wants to become like him when he grows up. He does poorly in school.A rivalry develops between real father and defacto father Righetto. The boy runs away to be with Righetto until the father retrieves him. Righetto is a kind and meek man and very patient with the boy but also honest is confronting the boy's father about his relationship in the past with Ada when Aldo hints they were lovers. Always the gentleman in fact nearly a saint Righetto reassures the man that nothing had ever taken place except his genuine affection for the boy.Righetto urges the father to remain fulfill his parental duties get to know his son and not abandon him. By the end of the film in a reversal it is Righetto who goes off to work on a farm and it is Aldo who at Righetto's urging will remain. Righetto has a last meeting with the boy at the nearby amusement park of the film's title and urges the lad to walk toward his dad which he does. In the last few moments of the movie we see the father carrying the boy on his back to a carnival ride which they will go on together though he claims fear and though the boy doubts it. It is the birth of a new relationship a boy with his true father finally capable of the love he needs to give his son. And it is heartfelt and really a moving episode.The movie is beautifully acted by Gastone Renzelli as Aldo a magnificent Pierre Trabaud as Righetto Giulia Rubini as Ada mostly in flashbacksand wonderful trouper Giancarlo Damiani as the sensitive eightyearold Mario. Luigi Comencini has given us many films dealing with the lives of children. Some of the ones that come to mind are his Proibito rubare Voltati Eugenio Cuore Incompreso Un ragazzo di Calabria even Pinocchio. My own personal favorite is this one The Window Overlooking Luna Park.".

	schema:headline " Buffalo Gals won't you come out tonight . . . . ";
	schema:reviewBody "An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast.As the film opens it is Christmas Eve and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy Ryan Weaver Ray Liotta doing the kind of character he does best. He's a goodlooking charmingonthesurface killer who has come to be known as the Lonely Hearts Strangler because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman romance her for a time and then . . . well they do call him Strangler. After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend next intended victim's place he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective Hector Elizondo who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him? In a clever bit of opening misdirection we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine waifish but not anorexic blondehairedbigblueeyed Lauren Holly in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new girlfriend when in fact she is not.The two do meet however since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con Brendan Gleeson in a Gleeful performance who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question What would you like? referring to drinks. His response? I'd like to nail you baby in the slimiestsounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom uses the soapthingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BADASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dustup the other con and several others are shot. The pilots have in the midst of all this been killed.Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy asking her if she believes in capital punishment to which she answers No. Our Heroine is sharp however and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his copilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground however and they patch her through to a pilot Ben Cross who brings his presence and accent to the rolewho instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the planeto LAND it of course. Our Bad Guy however is determined that they will crash and he hopes take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wackpot. As the plane tosses them toandfro did I mention that they're headed into a sixonascaleofonetosix thunderstorm? our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes at one point she uses sex  or at least the promise of sex  to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment but hey it's one of the few weapons she has at her disposal along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus comeon. Why under these circumstances does our psychobutsharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie children! Anyway after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psychokillerchiller and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.".

He begins to win her sympathy asking her if she believes in capital punishment to which she answers No. Our Heroine is sharp however and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his copilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground however and they patch her through to a pilot Ben Cross who brings his presence and accent to the rolewho instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the planeto LAND it of course. Our Bad Guy however is determined that they will crash and he hopes take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wackpot. As the plane tosses them toandfro did I mention that they're headed into a sixonascaleofonetosix thunderstorm? our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes at one point she uses sex  or at least the promise of sex  to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment but hey it's one of the few weapons she has at her disposal along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus comeon. Why under these circumstances does our psychobutsharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie children! Anyway after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psychokillerchiller and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.";

So this personal favourite of mine has the best of both world's  a wisecracking total lunatic in charge of a 747 he intends to crash.Ray Liotta is absolutely excellent as a sarcastic lunatic in this movie! I love indulging in Turbulence every now and then. Just to watch Ray Liotta's character 'giving it large' to his nemesis  some cop who framed him  on a plane that he intends to crash just for him the cop  to make him famous cos he was hopeless at catching Liotta and had to plant a teddy bear in his car to get a conviction Liotta's character supposedly strangles women after giving them a teddy bear for Christmas btw.Anyway the dialogue on the plane between the cast in the early stages is quite good. Especially the drinks and dinner menu scenes. Once the movie becomes cat and mouse between Liotta and the air stewardess some of the dialogue is very good and quite amusing if you view it from the point that Liotta's character is a crazed psycho with nothing to lose but wants to have a bit of fun along the way.Some of the scenes involving the landing of the plane are quite good as well especially when it almost collides with a hotel restaurant and you get a POV on it. Forget that it is a stupid idea where a stewardess gets a crash course from the ground crew pun intended to land a 747. Plane movies are always spectacular when they involve some kind of crash idea or a novice attempting to land one.So Ray Liotta as a crazed psycho with a grudge against a cop and on a hijacked empty 747 a guy who is destined for the chair and with nothing to lose is pretty good idea for a movie....in my opinion. The premise may be mindless but who cares  it's a wonderful life.LOL".

	schema:reviewBody "35 STARS It's Airport 1975 meets Friday the 13th in this thriller at 35000 feet. Set aboard the ultrasophisticated Boeing 747200 a serial killer and flight attendant battle for control of the airplane as both his mental condition and the plane's altitude deteriorate.A group of U.S. marshals is escorting two convicts aboard a nearly empty 747 on Christmas Eve.  One convict escapes and kills all of the guards along with the pilot.  The copilot is taken out just as efficiently by failing to observe the fasten seat belt sign!  After sitting back and letting them kill each other serial killer Ryan Weaver Liotta fills the power vacuum and systematically secures control of the airplane.  He has no intention of mounting an escape however.  Because he was already en route to death row he plans to slowly torture his group of holiday captives while the plane flies itself into the ground.Flight Attendant Teri Halloran Holly will have none of that and we find ourselves with a far more capable flight attendant than Karen Black from Airport 1975 at the helm of this 747.  A lot can change in 22 years and this time our flight attendant is strongwilled empowered and ready to brandish a gun if necessary to defend her safe passage to the ground. But just as significantly it's the technology that has changed in two decades.The airplane the set design and the special effects steal the show. Airplane buffs will be wowed at the display of realworld commercial jet technology including the autoland system which effectively replaces Charlton Heston from Airport 1975 as the emergency pilotincommand. Most of these whizbang gizmos are already present and functioning aboard commercial jets worldwide.  By choosing such a hightech plane the producers were able to simplify the plot and omit the flight engineer altogether.  He's been replaced by a bank of computers as is becoming standard practice among domestic carriers.The reality factor does have to be put on hold rather often such as when the 747 flips over and our stars are forced to struggle on the ceiling of the cabin.  Or when the plane's landing gear becomes entangled in a rooftop restaurant and subsequently scoops up a parked car.  The 747200's autopilot isn't nearly smart enough to recover from either crisis but it's easy to let the disbelief slide because the visuals are so startlingly fresh.External shots of the plane are well lit and lightyears beyond what we have seen in any other aviation disaster film.  Inside the plane the sets are vibrant and alive with color.  Brilliantly lit instrument panels along with a talkative computer warning system keep the audience involved.  Even the avionics bay is bright and downright inviting!It's a good thing the director let the art designers run amuck because the psychosis of our serial killer would've sunk the picture otherwise.  This character should have been penned as a standard mental case but instead he's a serial killer and a sex fiend which makes for a variety of uncomfortable confrontations between himself and the flight attendants. Women generally do NOT like this movie primarily because the sexuallycharged power struggles are repulsive to a modern temperament. The audience is officially fed up when Teri strips to seduce Ryan just so that she can hit him in the head.  Of course he regains the upper hand moments later.If just five minutes of this rubbish had been cut out the film the result would have been much more satisfying. Liotta demonstrates his rendition of the crazed lunatic very well and is highly entertaining until the script leads him to overly indulgent pastures.  But ultimately Turbulence is reluctant to decide whether it wants to be an action thriller or a teenage slasher movie.  Although it eventually makes the right decision half the movie has already passed by that point and those who would have abandoned ship have already hit rewind.Compared to Airport 1975 Turbulence is at once both a much bigger and a much smaller film.  Turbulence has an abundance of topnotch special effects and is a colorful visual assault.  Yet the simple story of a frightened stewardess struggling to fly a jumbo jet is lost in this psychotic game of catandmouse.  In the world of the seven minute attention span Turbulence plays by the new rules and thus belays its weakness  it is too youthful to know that by simply sitting back and letting the suspense build the end result can be so much more satisfying.".

To be honest it wasnt really a choice since Id already reviewed GOODFELLAS and I hadnt got round to seeing TURBULENCE so decided to watch the movie I hadnt seen!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!! As soon as the credits started Id worked out how this movie was going to play out . Dont ask me how but Id got it into my head that this was going to be very similar to CON AIR with a serial killer taking over a jumbo jet with Ray Liottas character Ryan Weaver saving the day . In this respect my prediction was half right with a psychotic nutcase taking over a jumbo jet but its Weaver whos the serial killer . I guess the producers can claim this is a shocking plot twist but for some strange reason it doesnt feel convincing in anyway  in fact it feels downright ridiculous . Judging by the comments on this page it seems that many people like myself feel cheated as to how the story progresses  here we were expecting the doe eyed Weaver to risk life and limb to over come evil scumbags  And getting a pardon from the President after the feds finally track down the real serial killer  only to find Weavers the main scumbag I dont know if its down to the script but Liotta doesnt make a convincing bad guy . No hold on  the more I think about it the more I believe Liotta should start taking more and more of the blame for this fiasco . Its difficult to tell how his career might have panned out if hed been given roles as good guys but Liotta has always seemed miscast as a violent killer and TURBULENCE proves it . Just so Stevie Wonder and all the blind people in the audience can get the point Liotta goes so over the top that hes in danger of going into orbit  into orbit around the planet Jupiter by my reckoning  theres no subtlety at all to Weaver and would have probably brought the film down if it wasnt for the fact that there wasnt much of a film to begin with Note to Hollywood producers  Try casting Ray Liotta as a good guy . Considering hes appeared in so many turkeys since GOODFELLAS Im sure hed be very cheap to employ".

	schema:reviewBody "In the tradition of hilariously bad movies like Roadhouse and The Postman Turbulence truly delivers the goods. Convicted serial killer Ray Liotta is on his way to LA to take up residence on death row. What follows makes one wonder if they're watching a twisted remake of Airplane. After the lampooning that air disaster movies took with that landmark spoof you would think filmmakers would be wary about returning to the skies with such a halfbaked over the top implausifest. I get the feeling that after a while they realized the comic potential of the movie and started playing it for laughs. How else to explain the truck stuck on the landing gear sequence the she's not a stewardess she's a flight attendant quote and the plugging of a gun fire induced hole in the fuselage with a briefcase. Of course my favorite is when Liotta finds himself in the avionics bay and discovers what appears to be a tomahawk like ax. Ground control notes his presence and gasps that He may take out the autopilot. Cue the next shot a sign on a panel Caution Autopilot controls which is dutifully smashed by our ax wielding friend.

	onyx:emotionText "In the tradition of hilariously bad movies like Roadhouse and The Postman Turbulence truly delivers the goods. Convicted serial killer Ray Liotta is on his way to LA to take up residence on death row. What follows makes one wonder if they're watching a twisted remake of Airplane. After the lampooning that air disaster movies took with that landmark spoof you would think filmmakers would be wary about returning to the skies with such a halfbaked over the top implausifest. I get the feeling that after a while they realized the comic potential of the movie and started playing it for laughs. How else to explain the truck stuck on the landing gear sequence the she's not a stewardess she's a flight attendant quote and the plugging of a gun fire induced hole in the fuselage with a briefcase. Of course my favorite is when Liotta finds himself in the avionics bay and discovers what appears to be a tomahawk like ax. Ground control notes his presence and gasps that He may take out the autopilot. Cue the next shot a sign on a panel Caution Autopilot controls which is dutifully smashed by our ax wielding friend. The landing sequence is hilarious as well. If you're looking for a serious thoughtful action movie skip this one. If you're looking for a few good laughs check it out.";

One viewer commented that this was the best worse movie they'd seen. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is in the 'worse' category because it had a lot of good qualities. There was a long list of favorite character actors enough suspense to keep you interested great performances by Holly and Liotta two of my favorite Soap turned Hollywood actors one of everyone's 'worst nightmares come true' and...none of it was spoiled by a romantic element often inserted in a good heart stopper action movie.Kudos to Ms. Holly on her performance during the last fight scene. By this point I was having to remember this was a movie not live action. I was asking myself what I would do and how I would be feeling in a similar situation. That was the time when I realized I was hyperventilating and had to make myself take a breath. This is definitely a movie that I am glad I didn't watch just before bedtime. I would have not slept from the charge this movie gave the nervous system.".

The premise is that a Christmas Eve plane flight from NY to L.A. decorated for Xmas no less will have less than a dozen passengers. Obviously the scriptwriter hasn't been near an airport in some time.  Even if such a thing were to happen the flight would be canceled and the passengers put on other flights it's simply not feasable for an airline to fly a jumbo jet cross country for 12 people. Lauren Holley's flight attendant is the stupidest hero ever committed to celluoid.  The fact that as someone who supposedly works on a plane doesn't know how to the use the radio is not only moronic but rather scary.  That she is also unaware of the rating system used for storms proves that the writer has very little respect for the profession. As a related stupidity said storm lasts from Cleveland to L.A. It must be the biggest storm in recorded history Other writing blunders  we are expected to believe that a jumbo jet flying on auto pilot can not only fly upside down??!! but then miraculously right itself.  The big action scenes near the end are of various collisions between plane and land bound objects.  Let's see in a battle between aluminum plane wing and steel framed billboard who do you think will win?  A similar question is then asked about the cement roof of a parking garage  vs. plane landing gear.  Of course in this movie the plane somehow wins both of those contests. With this much care put into the believablity of the script you can only guess at how much care was taken with the acting or direction.  Even bad movies often have something to make them at least worth sitting through. Not this one.  It is a complete and utter waste of 90 minutes that you could spend cleaning lint out of your navel.  It is the only film in the 90's I have ever given a 0 on my 110 scale.".

The cockpit should have gouges switches and a flight engineer station rather than having computers. How can a 747 have very little passengers on a holiday? Why would the police transport a convict on a civilian airliner? I thought that convicts should be transported on a Boeing 727 like the one they used in the film Eraser and U.S. Marshals rather than a Boeing 747 unless there are more than 300 convicts. Why would the autopilot kill the pilot? Pretty stupid invention. I tested what would happened if a Boeing 747200 would do if flies upside down on Flight Simulator  by Microsoft not the real one. The 747 would lose a lot of altitude instead of flying at leveled altitude And there is no way a 747 would have an outside viewing window in the avionics bay. Neither does it have a sliding door on the staircase to block access to the upper deck. The staircase of a 747200 is not suppose to be straight it's suppose to be spiral styled. Even the Tower Air 747  the aircraft that Capt. Bowen flies while helping Teri to fly the plane  has the same stuff like the Trans Con 747. Most of the scenes in Turbulence has been placed in films like Turbulence 2 and 3 and Ground Control. Turbulence 2 and 3 all have something in common and that is their destination is always LAX. I really don't like this film but I like to keep on watching it whenever there is nothing to watch on TV.".

The trap springs and the armada sets sail to rendezvous with French ground forces and to attack.

	schema:reviewBody "Overall I enjoyed the movie. There have been too many recent films about the Tudors and Elizabeth in particular but this film looks good and it keeps you entertained. It's set at the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Elizabeth is shown as tough smart and married to her country. She also suffers from bouts of insecurity and irrational jealousies. This film is more hagiographic and melodramatic than its predecessor. The film tends to ignore the facts when they get in the way of the story. Elizabeth was 55 at the time of the Spanish Armada and she was never a looker. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive. Blanchett's acting performance is powerful and impressive but also a bit stagy. The way the politics of the time are depicted is a bit too black and white. The Spanish look grim and are dressed in dark colors. They are portrayed as crazy religious zealots. Spain had a right to be upset at English privateers  pirates who attacked their ships and stole their gold. Mary Queen of Scots is shown as a dowdy schemer who disliked Elizabeth. The reality was that Mary was a pretty bimbo who made bad choices when it came to men.Parts of the film veer too much towards soapopera. Sir Walter Raleigh Clive Owenbecomes a favorite but when Bess Throckmorton one of the Queen's ladiesinwaiting and Raleigh get secretly married Elizabeth becomes jealous and behaves badly. Later Raleigh and Francis Drake are shown defeating the Spanish at sea. In reality Raleigh was looking after the coastal defenses in the South West of England and didn't marry Throckmorton until 1591. The real Raleigh was a brilliant man soldier explorer writer poet and courtier and probably deserves his own film. The film is good fun but it's simplistic cartoon history.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a dream cast a fascinating subject and a budget larger than a pirate's booty this film could have been great. But the chance is missed.Pros The cast is definitely the film's biggest asset. Cate Blanchett is incredibly brilliant even at times that the script fails to provide her with a worthy line. Her powerful performance is utterly captivating. Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh is as dashing as a man can be. As the man who charmed the Queen out of her heart and wits and dared to tell her not to act like a fool Owen's Raleigh is daring at times vulnerable at others but always compelling and spectacular. Geoffrey Rush makes the best out of the very little that he's given to work with and Abbie Cornish and Samantha Morton are each great in their parts.It's also worth a mention that the costumes and the locations are spectacular paired with a few moments of good storytelling only if those moments would last all through the film they make a few absolutely extraordinary scenes. Another great characteristic of this film is it's subtlety the emotions that are there yet not talked about the wishes feelings disappointments desires and fears that are only hinted are the best parts of an otherwise disappointing storytelling.Cons Sloppy editing campy scenes and poor writing are what mostly hurts the film. Unfortunately the film's precious time is spent on sidestories that could have easily been discarded and consequentially not enough time is spent on the development of the main story. Everything that happens after Sir Walter meets Elizabeth seems forced. Vague at times the film seems to be in rush to hit certain notes at certain times. Elizabeth meets Walter and a few lines later she's mad about him so is Bess and so on. The audience is not given the chance to feel or take in what's really happening not even enough time to get to know the characters let alone feel what they are going through. At times it seemed as though many of the scenes were cut short in the editing room and had lost their essence in the process. If that's the case lets hope the DVD includes the director's cut. The film could have benefited from more climax and action the battle is barely touched other than a few great scenes most of the story is told through conversations in closed areas. More than anything the writers leaned on poetic lines to deliver their story. Also for all it's subtlety the film takes sides so obviously that it hurts any chances it had at reaching some level of realism or fairness. For instance not only Phillip of Spain is utterly evil he's one ridiculous petty dim character. Overall the cast certainly makes the experience worthwhile and as long as one does not expect absolute greatness or historical accuracy this film can be great entertainment for most.".

	schema:headline " Cate Blanchett shines in biographical drama some fiction added to the events";
	schema:reviewBody "Cate Blanchett reprises her role as the Virgin Queen Elizabeth I and is the film's greatest highlight. She exudes power strength and influence in portraying the 16th century monarch. Her commanding presence on the screen really gives the majestic qualities that the real queen certainly had. At the same time she gives us a personal glance inside the woman's heart where she has suppressed from public view an inner vulnerability and melancholy. Elizabeth certainly endured many sorrows and this portrayal gives us a glance inside the woman's who carried all this upon her shoulders and is credited with raising England to prominent status on the world stage.In addition to Blanchett the supporting cast all turn in superior work. The sets costuming and period speech are all mastered well creating a true feel for the era being depicted. Although many of the people and events are real a few liberties have been taken apparently to spice up the drama. Such fictionalizing probably wasn't necessary enough happened during this queen's rule to make the story interesting without it. One example the flashy Sir Walter Raleigh was indeed a favorite of the queen but this movie puts them in a romantic triangle that just gets in the way of other things going on. Also Raleigh better known as an explorer was not the hero in the battle with the Spanish Armada.Blanchett shines when she delivers the famous speech to the troops on the eve of the Spanish invasion. But even she is burdened by the director's preoccupation with Elizabeth as a suffering angstfilled woman facing middleage with less bravery than facing the world's most powerful fleet at that time. We get endless views of her taking her wig off in secret and staring at a mirror. The first time this device is used is fine to get the point across of her hopeless situation of never taking a husband and the slow advance of time having its way but we see her looking like a shriveled ghost in too many such scenes and it's way overdone in this context. Her real hair sans the wig looks like an inebriated Edward Scissorhands was her hairdresser and her pale complexion looks like somebody pasted whiteout all over her face.Those few mistakes notwithstanding this is a fine biopic with superior acting by Blanchett and is recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another Elizabeth I film? Why not? The Elizabethan Era's indeed a fascinating periods in English history  an era when England was relatively well off compared to other nations  even if its wealth was unevenly distributed! Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Does he give his audience any insight into the Golden Age when English Literature poetry music theater architecture scientific and technological advancement and exploration expansion flourished? Nope. His film does offer some interesting hints that women did enjoy the freedom of movement ah ha even a queen's closest and dearest ladyinwaiting could play cuckold to her mistress' favorite man! and that competing interests and ambitions of colonial powers made it easy for ambitious sailors to legalize acts of piracy! Serious crimes could well resort in severe tortures. Director Kapur does stress that she was the peoples queen!The story continues from where Cate Blanchett's young flighty and reckless Elizabeth made her finale masculinelike entrance in the prequel Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen with her face heavily laced with the 'whiteasmilke' makeup  an image of a queen ready to lead her citizens.At a deliberate slow pacing the introduction with its scenes characters and their dialog prepare the audience to receive Elizabeth as the Queen with a more focused more rigid personality in charge of hers and her country's destinies. Yep a woman with ready suitors but offering a sense that she is wedded to her Empire! She seems very philosophical in her ideals and yet we see her court filled with sorts of political characters. Elizabeth then is seen with roving eyes easily distracted by the presence of attractive men. Indeed it's a crafty way to introduce Elizabeth before Director Kapur plunges his audience into a compelling tale of treachery assassination attempts and romance that affects the Virgin Queen during her reign. The film carries a mix of intriguing historical facts legends and myths in ways that one can only expect history teachers of English public schools to apply to make their lessons interesting or hear from gossipy English peers from history classes wanting to impress their friends with strangerthanfiction tidbits and hearsay of those times. This film does promise a refreshing tale to grasp! There are those tongueincheek whims and antics that mischievously provoke thoughts of the political and religious changing tides of modern times. Director Kapur has certainly avoided the creation of a history epic based on dull dry substance! Blanchett is magnificent in her strange enigmatic and multidimensional character constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counterplotting to take her down at her Court in her government and from foreign lands. She's seen as almost as a brutal ruler at times and on her consistent guard in her determination to hold on to her throne alternating between her seemingly vicious whims her heroism and tangled romantic emotions! Yet she comes off gracefully as a person who has the heart to forgive. Oh yes there's also that scene that prompts me to think of Joan of Arc! It's not hard to want to cheer for the Queen in her determination to fight against the religious intolerance barbarism and fundamentalism of the Spanish Inquisition. Spain was a very powerful Catholic foe and the Church did try to destroy this Protestant Queen and to restore England back to Catholism! The battle in the calmtostorm scene is exhilarating to watch. We also witness her struggles in her attempt to balance her duties to her country and her vulnerability to infatuation and tempestuous relationship. Clive Owens superbly handles his role as the dashing Walter Raleigh  indeed one of the most colorful and controversial character of the times and of whom English history has spun numerous tales about. This film also charts Raleigh's colonizing dreams his involvement in a love triangle his sweeping in and out of the Queen's favor and his immense dislike for Catholics  that did historically determine his fate beyond this film's exposure. Geoffrey Rush returns as the loyal and polished spy master Sir Walsingham and historically seen as the man who attracted conspiracy theories. Hhhmh was he responsible for the birth of modern espionage? He's truly fascinating to watch. This film has a great stellar cast of actors who don't disappoint. There's so much onscreen chemistry oozing out between characters in this film. Oh yes the villains are so agitating and annoying to the core. The background music soundtracks come across as dramatically bold and nailbiting poignant at times and emotionally mystifying at others appropriately matching the many guises moods and whims of the Virgin Queen  the cold and strong and always majestic personality vs .her sentimentally vulnerable images  and also effectively reinforce the moments of gripping horrors of the events witnessed or felt. The sounds do have an interesting mix. Some of the scenes really deliver visual cinematic effects that remind me of the paintings of the period. The somber settings work beautifully to support and give intensity to the horrifying scenes and moments. Just love the way the sets and backgrounds are crafted to avoid overshadowing the characters. Oh yes I love the color schemes presented in this movie to bring credibility to the scenes! The naval battle and Sir Walters' underwater escapade are so fabulously and stunningly crafted  without going overtheboard with extreme flashy special effects and colors to highlight the events. I was captivated from beginning to end. Oh yes this film does entertain sending me on a delightfully exciting spellbound journey in my attempt to separate legend and myths from historical facts. Oh yes this film will make English history fun to browse all over again. Yep I was absolutely entertained!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This rates as high as it does for me because of the cinematography. It is dazzling and Blanchett can't be denied but Elizabeth The Golden Age is like a chickflick with explosions plus costumes super hair and loud intrusive music. The result is faux epic.My wife summed it up well as we left the theater I feel like I've just flipped through a coffee table picture book for two hours and somebody turned up the stereo. History wrote this plot but Nicholson and Hirst thought they could do better. They couldn't or certainly didn't. Freshmen composition classes come up with better stuff. Trite forced predictable. Did they even run this by an expert in English history? You gotta wonder. The script is oozing with 21st century mores and clichs. It made me think during the movie mind you of the way Dutch painters depicted Homer and Aristotle in the garb of 17th century Holland. Are we that dumb? Sir Walter Raleigh is a caricature and Sir Francis Drake never properly introduced was a throwaway. Geoffrey Rush is wasted as Walsingham. Come to think of it nearly everybody is wasted. Every single character is underdeveloped with the possible exception of the title characterpossible exception.Golden Age set the target high and then turned and fired in the opposite direction. Realizing the script had missed Director tried to make up for it with window dressing. Substance would have served this queen better. With the colon in the title I almost expected to see Bruce Willis saving the day.You can see why Golden Age came out in October because it's not going to compete for Oscars in categories that anybody cares about. With all the budget they had for this movie you'd Universal could have found better writers.".

Did they even run this by an expert in English history? You gotta wonder. The script is oozing with 21st century mores and clichs. It made me think during the movie mind you of the way Dutch painters depicted Homer and Aristotle in the garb of 17th century Holland. Are we that dumb? Sir Walter Raleigh is a caricature and Sir Francis Drake never properly introduced was a throwaway. Geoffrey Rush is wasted as Walsingham. Come to think of it nearly everybody is wasted. Every single character is underdeveloped with the possible exception of the title characterpossible exception.Golden Age set the target high and then turned and fired in the opposite direction. Realizing the script had missed Director tried to make up for it with window dressing. Substance would have served this queen better. With the colon in the title I almost expected to see Bruce Willis saving the day.You can see why Golden Age came out in October because it's not going to compete for Oscars in categories that anybody cares about. With all the budget they had for this movie you'd Universal could have found better writers.";

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't heard too much about this film but had seen the posters for it so I gave it a shot. And after leaving the theatre I really wasn't sure what to say about it.There's a lot of good stuff in this film but there're some pitfalls as well. On the plus side the sets and costumes are magnificent. A great deal of care and love when into the art direction to bring us an Elizabethan renaissance film replete with court intrigue and foreign emissaries who threaten invasion because of high seas thievery courtesy Clive Owen's character. Visually this film is very lush and impressive though somewhat confining at times. We're never really shown Elizabethan England just the important parts that are salient to the story.And as Elizabeth's favorite playwright would say there's the rub. And by this I mean that the film is a bit all over the place. It's a costume drama it's a romance it's a period political thriller it's a military epic and so forth. It even skids the fantasy genre with some of the fancy camera work that was done. But all in all the film's primary thrust is to try and grab hold of all of these genres and tie them together into some kind of cohesive and suscint manner.The romance the intrigue the sisterly emotions the rivalry between matriarchs and the battle scene hearken back to a time when Hollywood used to crank out these kinds of movies with some regularity. But the context between those films and Elizabeth The Golden Age are nearly day and night even though both are striving for a high water mark in historical drama.I thought Elizabeth The Golden Age was technically a competent production. In fact given the difficulties there must have been getting some of the shots I'll give it high marks as a pure production effort. But as a film I simply found it to be a touch too ambitious and overindulgent near the end.That's not to say that I didn't enjoy a lot of the film because I did. Blanchet's Elizabeth is a strong woman full of zest energy and a bit of anger which she levels at her adversaries. But she's also a chief of state internationalist and of course the queen of England. She doesn't wear several hats. She wears a crown. But even so and this is where the film falls a bit short she doesn't demonstrate a cohesive ability to command all. She shows she's in charge but doesn't act like she's in charge until near the end.The film was geared and aimed at a female audience a thing which I had not expected and so a lot of the energy is directed at that audience with the appropriate emotional flourishes. Combined with some soso CGI for the action sequences and a horse with a perm which almost had me laughing one wonders where the film was headed. Elizabeth didn't save England with her emotional power alone and yet this is the gist of the film. It's a real let down in this regard.The film is a mixed blessing. There's a lot of decent acting and some exceptional performances by the leads. Married to a rather extravagant art director to bring to life palace throne room chambers and galleons at sea and one can easily see that this was meant to be a top notch production. But some of the logical loopholes where Blanchet's character is concerned conspire with some of the story loopholes to hold back a better film.As a guy all I can say is that it's not something I'd watch again and I'm not too sure I'd recommend it to any female audiences. But if you don't mind your period dramas skirting the edge of high kamp then splurge on a ticket and see what Elizabeth The Golden Age is all about.".

But  I am sad to say that this film was a disappointment. It suffers from numerous overdramatic sequences which rely much too heavily on symbolism. After all how many times  ways should one be forced to view Cate Blanchett posed in an angelic persona?Unfortunately as one sits through this film one must wonder what the writers  director were thinking. It is obvious that someone was unsure of which directions they wished to steer this film toward  romance war epic dramaetc. The awkwardness of this film projected a feeling that various pages of the script must have been stuck together as it continues along  giving it a feel that can only be described as disjointed and forced.The problems with this film seem to be caused by a combination of a weak script bad direction and bad editing which resulted in this shortchanged followup to the welldone original 1998 epic of 'Elizabeth'. Cate Blanchett and the entire cast are good actors  do not disappoint in their character portrayals. But sadly this film was not up to the performances of these fine actors and we left the theater wondering why the director the editors and screenwriters all failed to do their jobs.".

	schema:headline " Flashy disappointing sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "It is now 1588 and Queen Elizabeth I Cate Blanchett is no longer the fragile naive young princess of England but an accomplished monarch with a knack for public relations. England's empire is growing and Elizabeth develops an attraction towards explorer Sir Walter Raleigh Clive Owen. But soon war looms as Spain's King Phillip II Jordan Molla threatens to invade England and a cabal of Catholics led by the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots Samantha Morton plots against the Queen's life. With the aid of Raleigh and aging spymaster Francis Walsingham Geoffrey Rush Elizabeth confronts these foes and earns her place in history.Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth was a visually stunning brilliantly acted and extremely compelling film which depicted a young Princess forced by circumstances into one of the most delicate situations imaginable. The movie was gorgeous to behold in its art direction cinematography and costumes but also had an intriguing story and a very strong cast headed by the brilliant Cate Blanchett. Elizabeth the Golden Age has a lot to live up to but surely the history behind the film would ensure an entertaining sequel about one of the history's most compelling individuals.Unfortunately 'twas not to be. The Golden Age is a very weak disappointing sequel to a great film. The story plods the characters become twodimensional and the impressive cinematography and visuals bog down rather than enhance the film. With all of the intriguing aspects of Elizabeth's reign and the fact that director and star were back from the original it's doubly disappointing.Where shall we begin our criticism? The story which is all over the place. The original film has a multifaceted plot but all of the characters and actions tie together with consummate skill. Here the various intrigues and plots are introduced incrementally we don't even know who the English Catholics are until well into the film and their relation to the plot despite a lengthy introductory scene. Golden Age's various subplots cease to be layered and interesting and simply become a great big muddle.Another huge criticism of the film is its characterization of historical personages notably the Spanish. Elizabeth's portrayal is spoton but otherwise? King Phillip in particular is a hateful stereotype most of his dialog is pronouncing Elizabeth as evil even saying at one point Elizabeth is the darkness I am the light. He might as well twirl his mustache and laugh maniacally a la Snidley Whiplash. Mary Queen of Scots is the only villain who comes across as remotely human and even she is hurt by very little screen time. The film makes very little of Mary herself relegating her and the other supporting characters to the background choosing to focus on a ridiculously overwrought historicallyimprobable love triangle between Elizabeth Raleigh and Elizabeth's servant Abbie Cornish.All this might have been forgivable if the movie had delivered on its promise of a riproaring climax. Throughout the film's length we are impressed upon of the Spanish Armada's vast size and perceived invincibility. We see epic CGI shots of the fleet setting sail. We hear Elizabeth's ministers portentously pronouncing the Spanish as unstoppable. We get Elizabeth's rousing speech to the troops in full battle armor. And the payoff for all this buildup is... nothing. A few brief CGI shots of ships in battle and an ohsofancy shot of a single horse swimming through the wreckage of a sinking Spanish ship. Pathetic and unforgivable. I wasn't expecting a Rambo film but I was expecting a scene that made all of the dread mutterings of the past two and a half hours worthwhile.The movie is as visually splendid as any you'd care to name. The use of imaginative lighting costumes and art direction is simply a site to behold. The film reaches its high point during an abortive attempt on the Queen's life when her wouldbe assassin pronounces her a whore  followed by a shot of Elizabeth dressed in white with immaculate sunlight streaming down around her. This scene is absolutely stunning but it is also indicative of the film's basic problem. All of the interest is in the visuals and costumes and there is no real substance to them.The movie has one major redeeming factor and that's Cate Blanchett. Blanchett is a brilliant Elizabeth showing her to be a great leader but also a desperately lonely woman whose best asset is her PR abilities. The supporting cast is woefully underused particularly Geoffrey Rush. In the original Rush's Walsingham was an intriguing slippery character. In this film his contribution is to sit in the background and mumble a portentous line every once in awhile. The rest of the cast except Samantha Morton is unexceptional through no fault of their own.Elizabeth the Golden Age should have been a great followup to a great film. With a talented director an amazing lead performance and one of the most compelling chapters in history Golden Age should have been something special. Unfortunately it is nothing more than a big shiny leaden disappointment.510".

	schema:reviewBody "For sheer sartorial splendor this movie is unbeatable. But the raves end at the costume department everything else about this movie is awful. I so loved the first Elizabeth that I was ready to love the sequel but it was a complete disappointment.Blanchett's acting is good enough but none of her supporting cast do much more than deliver wooden lines with no sentiment. Rush who was such a powerful figure in the earlier movie is not much more than window dressing here. He has little to say little to do and adds no drama to the story. Owen is stiff and unconvincing. Perhaps the best is the Spanish king who at least is interesting. Or maybe Tom Hollander as Mary's jailer he has only a few lines but he delivers them with intensity and makes them count. The rest seem to have had a really bad time of it.And as with most lousy movies this one dies because of its story or lack thereof. The script has a mix of equal parts love family jealousy religion politics intrigue militaria and does none of them justice. The battle scenes look phony and unconvincing there is the hackneyed scene of the great speech before the big battle but the battle never happens. The love stories are never convincing neither one of them and we never sympathize with either of the heroines. There is some smattering of religious thought thrown in along with anachronistic sentiments of freedom triumphing over the inquisition but the real issues Catholicism vs. Protestantism are never touched upon. One might think love of one's native land would be a theme in such a picture but it's hardly even mentioned. There are so many minor subplots I can't even remember them all and none of them amount to much of anything. Oh yes Mary Queen of Scots she makes a few cameo appearances as well and we spend many minutes in lurid anticipation of her beheading but then that too seems to have no connection with anything else.Seems like the directorscreenwriter couldn't choose which story they wanted to dramatize so they tried to dramatize all five at once and ended up with a pointless hodgepodge.I hate to admit it but I was ready to walk out about halfway through but was too embarrassed. This from a guy who loves historical period films and who has the original Elizabeth near the top of the alltime list. Apparently the genius of the first film has completely eluded the makers of the second.I give it 310.".

This is the case for The Golden Age the sequel to Elizabeth a film that turned Cate Blanchett into a star introducing her considerable talents to the masses. In The Golden Age Blanchett is given more screen time and the opportunity to show the range she is capable of giving us a portrayal that is complex rich exquisite and ultimately glorious.As a matter of fact it's hard to imagine anyone else having the power this actress is capable of showing on screen. She carries the film and it's her ability to interact with such varied characters that gives the film its strength. It all depends on the chemistry between her and the talented actors that support her particularly Clive Owen's rogue pirate.The Golden Age depicts another critical moment in the life of the Virgin Queen as she must find the strength in herself to gather the support and strength she needs to save England from a brutal military attack by the Spanish Armada the most powerful navy at the time. Elizabeth must deal with family issues ethical issues sentimental turmoil another selfconfidence crisis and much more intrigue and attacks from both the Spaniards and their supporters on both sides of the ocean.There are scenes in this film that will be remembered as perfect examples of what cinema can achieve as the camera frames key characters during critical times in the story... Most impressive are all the scenes in which Cate participates as she is able to show the amazing nature of a woman who endured much criticism and political turmoil and eventually transformed herself and her nation into one of the most powerful empires in the world.There are interesting analogies in the film particularly as Elizabeth adopts one life over another and allows her spirit to soar vanquishing any negative impulses and nurture the surrogate child that her country becomes. According to the film she finds herself incapable of finding an equal mate because of special circumstances and then she rediscovers the strength that she has always possessed and turns into the leader everyone will respect follow and somehow adore.The Golden Age is a very handsome film with superb production and some spectacular costumes exquisitely worn by Ms. Blanchett. It's definitely on its way to becoming a classic a proud example of what some might call an intimate epic.".

In this day and age of religious strife to pit Elizabeth the white English Protestant who supposedly in the film supports freedom of belief nothing could be further from the historical truth against the swarthier Arabic looking religious fundamentalist Philip of Spain note his Arabic appearance is historically accurate but still creates an uncomfortably clear reductionist parallel to modern conflicts that detracts from the film. Philip giggles like a madman the whole time clutching his Bible.Moreover in attempting to make Elizabeth an accessible woman the film focuses so much on her 'feminine vulnerabilities' and need for love that it drains her of the power and political astuteness that marked one of the greatest leaders male or female that the world has ever known. Elizabeth I was a POWERFUL POLITICIAN not a giggling girl simpering at the feet of a man.When the film focuses on the political intrigues and the decisive destruction of the Spanish Armada it shines. When it focuses on the love triangle and reductionist religious fundamentalism it fails. Sadly so much of the film focuses on the latter that it is a trial to make it through the two hours.".

Overall though it was good but not too special except for Cate Blanchett. After her the costumes and art direction it wasn't too great.The acting of this movie overall was OK. Cate Blanchett was phenomenal showing her vulnerability and the complexities in her character having to deal with so many problems and yet having to stay in control. She fit her part perfectly as she did in the first movie. Like the first she really actually gave you the feeling of what a queen from back then might have been like. I like Clive Owen but I hated hated him in this movie. His style was too clich and what really brought him down was not really realizing the point of his character. I understand Blanchett is supposed to be in love with him but he really just feels like he could have been cut from the entire movie and it wouldn't of made the slightest difference. I would have liked to have seen Geoffrey Rush much more in this movie but unfortunately his role was very limited.The art direction and costume design was great. You could see some great photography and landscapes with great setup with the clothing. It was sort of able to fill the void with some of the mistakes made in this movie but it just was not enough.Overall though the directing and editing was poor. The directing failed miserably at giving you an idea of what is happening. Even if you do get it the movie fails at really showing how this event makes Elizabeth important great and why it is important. This has to do with the editing a lot as well.I would recommend this movie strictly for Blanchett's performance. This is not really a movie too understand history through though.".

Was there any particular reason that one of the key members of court not to mention Essex another incredibly influential member of the Elizabethian courtwas not included? The RaleighElizabeth 'love story' was really a load of nonsense  is there ever going to be a film about Elizabeth where she is NOT fawning over all the men of her court? Yes she was human and probably struggled with her feelings but I suspect that there was more to her life than whether or not she was ever going to marry.As for Mary Queen of Scots my main upset with this is her accent. She is Queen of Scots but she was raised in the FRENCH court and was briefly Queen of France before the death of her sickly husband.The film was rather complicated as those with little or no knowledge of 16th Century British history could easily be lost  many of the characters aren't actually introduced properly and it took my family some time to work out what exactly was going on. It would have been a much MUCH better film if they had cut out all of the dramatic uplifting music and spent more time on the script. As for clichs  my entire family gave up by the point of the horses leaping off the ship Guinness anyone? If you are passionate about history I would strongly recommend that you AVOID this film as it will end up frustrating you and those around you if you are anything like me  I just have to comment when I'm watching a bad film...

	schema:reviewBody "If nothing else Elizabeth The Golden Age 2007 is an instructive case study in the failure of most sequels to live up to the successes of their progenitors. The original Kate Blanchett Elizabeth 1998 was one of the finest historical dramas of the last 20 years. In addition to the usual virtues of wellmounted period dramas e.g. sumptuous costuming makeup and setdesign it offered a fresh point of view on familiar historicalbiographical material a sparkling script filled with memorable lines secondary characters that burned themselves onto the screen and understated but powerful cinematography and score. By contrast Elizabeth The Golden Age while in some respects even more visually sumptuous than its predecessor is overproduced overacted and overblown.The problems with this sequel start at the core a screenplay that lacks originality and wit. Whereas the first film brimmed with quotable lines like I am no man's Elizabeth and The dead have no titles not a single phrase from the sequel sticks to mind. Even worse its lack of imagination is compounded by systematic cannibalizing of key dramatic situations in the original script and by the regurgitation of dialog  minus the poetry and rhythms of the original language. When poor Kate Blanchett winced at the clip of her performance at this year's Oscar ceremony it wasn't from false modesty. As a great actress she recognizes unconvincing bluster when she sees and hears it. That she received a best actress nomination for this Elizabeth was a clear case of an Academy makeup call for not having given her the award when she really deserved it.In addition to a wonderfully realized protagonist the first film developed a rich cast of secondary characters like Sir Richard Attenborough's Lord Cecil and Geoffrey Rush's chilling but fascinating Sir Walsingham Elizabeth's chief of security. In The Golden Age Walsingham returns as a poor shadow of himself little more than a stooped and aging whipping boy for Elizabeth's frequent shrill tirades. To experience the trashing of this wonderful character and actor was emotionally painful. The sequel also lacked the compelling villain supplied by Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk in the original. In The Golden Age the villain's role is filled instead by Philip King of Spain but the cutaways to his religioninspired vendetta against Elizabeth are distant emotionally as well as geographically and the physical stereotyping of all the Spanish characters is embarrassing. Even the attempted assassination of Elizabeth one of the most obviously recycled scenes pales in the sequel. In the original we get the spooky hoodclad specter of a preBond Daniel Craig pursuing the Queen on behalf of the Pope a wonderful cameo by the legendary Sir John Gielgud while here we get a shaky nondescript youth pointing and firing a pistol at point blank range and either missing or forgetting to put a bullet in the gun. Who knows or cares which? On a positive note Clive Owen's presence as Sir Walter Raleigh is The Golden Age's most interesting addition  but while Owen cuts a fine convincing figure in 16th century garb his relationship with Elizabeth is far less interesting and less satisfying than the one provided by Joseph Fiennes as the youthful Elizabeth's first love Sir Robert Dudley the Earl of Leicester.Futilely attempting to compensate for a weaklywritten script The Golden Age offers up lingering protracted visuals one of the most overbearing musical scores in contemporary cinema and  naturally these days  special effects galore. Unfortunately the detailed CG rendering of the Spanish Armada's destruction succeeds less as drama than as an emblem of a Hollywood big budget vessel crashing and sinking under its own rudderless bulk.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the brief period between Clint Eastwood's string of spaghetti westerns and his Dirty Harry films he and director Don Siegel teamed up to make this unusual picture. Eastwood plays an injured Union Army corporal during the Civil War who is taken in by a southern school for girls until he recovers from his wounds. It has been a while since the young women most of which seem to be teenagers have had a man on the premises so they are reluctant to turn him in to the local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous shocking erotic or even downright grotesque as Eastwood slowly regains his strength and begins to brood over the establishment.The basic storyline almost sounds like the makings of a porno film. We have a masculine male suddenly surrounded by young nubile women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread the love amongst them. The material never really slips down to the level of tasteless however. Eastwood Siegel and cinematographer Bruce Surtees are such skilled filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity.Eastwood's John McBurney is like no other character he has ever played. McBurney is an amoral conniving and lustful charlatan. He knows that most of the women even the youngest want his bod and he lets more than one of them have a shot at him. McBurney often uses flattery to butter the women up then uses his rugged good looks to reel them in. He is like a drunken player at a cocktail party often hitting on different women even in the same scene! Eventually his lustful ways cause him great agony and loss in a way you must see for yourselves. This author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions but there is little doubt he has them coming.Eastwood gives a typically great performance. He seems to be having a blast with the role until things turn really ugly then he turns mean and ugly. Geraldine Page is a treat as the steely Btch who runs the school. We know she wants McBurney as much as the other girls but with her checkered past shown to us in flashbacks we find out that isn't all she's after! Mae Mercer as a slave belonging to the school gives a great performance too. She obviously knows McBurney is a skunk from the beginning and she never lets his phony charm bring her guard down. This is a character you will want to know more about after the film is over. She seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film.The Beguiled did poorly in its theatrical release. Nobody was quite sure what to make of it and some of its content no doubt raised a few eyebrows in 1971. For example in an early scene we see Eastwood romantically kiss a 12yrold girl. Is he just trying to keep her quiet when the rebel soldiers get close or is he really enjoying it? Probably both! A fantasy sequence later on even shows Clint getting it on with not only Page but her young assistant! Truly some interesting goings on in this one. It's a good thing Eastwood became the star he did or this one might have been long forgotten.Highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Beguiled is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films and a departure from his typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films it was made a year before Eastwood's directorial debut with Play Misty For Me. An alternate title considered for the film was PussyFooting Down At The Old Plantation which thankfully was not used otherwise I am sure raunchy jokes about the fact that it takes place at a girls' school would be difficult to avoid. I first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid1970's and was immediately taken with it. I only had an old battered VHS tape of it until I recently purchased the widescreen DVD which also includes the hilarious awful trailer that makes the film come across as a Peyton Place soap opera and conveys none of the creepiness of the film.Interesting notes Eastwood and Siegel had to battle with Universal Pictures to keep the original ending and they won out and the film was billed as a standard Eastwood western which it certainly is not. It is a Gothic tale of deception and horror set in the time of the Civil War with an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension running throughout.I'm not putting any spoilers in this review and if you want to see the film as it should be seen then be careful of looking it up on the internet as spoiler reviews of it do abound.Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney a Union soldier who is shot on Confederate ground and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls' school. She rescues him and takes him back to the school but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence so that he will be taken to prison the headmistress Miss Martha Geraldine Page her assistant Edwina Elizabeth Hartman their black servant Hallie Mae Mercer and the mostly teenage girls take him in heal him and fall under his spell. The film sets its tone of creepiness and Gothic horror right from the titles as it shows real battleground shots from the war while Eastwood's voice is heard quietly singing a funereal song of the time.The opening scene of his encounter with the little girl who saves him sets the tone of his character and the tone of the entire movie. To say any more than that would spoil the surprises in that first scene. To say much more about the film itself might ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it...if you are into creepy Gothic tales find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in the film and it is interesting to see him in an early role or any role where he portrays a character that is for the most part very unsympathetic.Geraldine Page had a plum role in the film as the headmistress and I cannot imagine another actress of the time being as good in the role a long shot could have been Piper Laurie but I don't think Laurie could have embodied the role in the same manner as Geraldine Page.Elizabeth Hartman whose wonderful performance in the film A Patch of Blue as a blind girl who falls in love with Sidney Poiter's character is another high point in her short career is at her prime here delicate and masterful at the same time. Unfortunately her delicacy on film was also a part of her real life she committed suicide at age 45.I end this review with this observation one manipulative lying Yankee man is no match for a houseful of deceptive and libidinous Southern belles.".

A fascinating character study with some great women for Squint to deal with. Geraldine Page was one of our supreme actresses and she's perfectly cast. Young Jo Ann Harris is a flirty minx and Elizabeth Hartman who died too young is undeniably repressed.A 7 out of 10. Best performance  C. Eastwood. Released the same year as DIRTY HARRY this did no business beside getting some good reviews. Seek this out unless you're only into Explosion films. Very subtle and frightening this piece will stick with you.".

There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed.Pamelyn Ferdin did a fine job as Amy and would go on to play Wanda June. This must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelveyearold girl on camera wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy's turtle Randolph it is no surprise that Ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist.Geraldine Page was likewise excellent playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. It is interesting that she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide throwing herself through a fifth floor window as they had also worked together in You're a Big Boy Now.Hartman who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister was wonderful as Edwina and should have gotten an Oscar no other performance was even close that year but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her. Edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in The Misfits the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing.Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty Carol. For my money Harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970's combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the Most Wanted television series and the only reason to watch Wild Wild West Revisited. Hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star.".

Like Corporal northerner McBurney we are gradually drawn into the negative atmosphere and everything seems to shrink as trapped in the boarding school and its occupants.A wellmade film with a team that is now well known and confirmed her talent we just mentioned the most famous talents Eastwood Don Siegel Lalo Schifrin for music ... After 'Coogan' bluff and psychology more indepth with The Beguiled  we looking forward to the next movie of this team ... Dirty Harry ...A well done psychological drama and suspense we can feel a very good Hitchcock spirit or touch that fully confirmed by the next film of Eastwood Play misty for me.JeliosJelioshotmail.fr";

And every female within sniffing distance  from 50yearold Martha to the 19yearold virgin to the 16yearold slut to the 10yearold innocent  wants a piece o' dat beef Clintcake!McBurney encourages every flirtation with that twinkle in his eye and a neverending stream of compliments for all the women on his ohsokissable lips. Even the cynical black slave gets it into her head that she can get her a piece of that action.Of course McBurney is playing them all planning to desert his regiment and sit out the war in their figurative and literal embrace.Any other actor in the role of McBurney this would have been a somber drama of obsession and womanly retribution. But because it's Clint it's dangerously hilarious as he spreads his manmusk with that Philo Beddoe charm. We always knew that anyone who could burn down so many men would be a master juggler of women.McBurney's constant stream of lies and false promises would be his undoing. He tells Martha he was wounded carrying an enemy soldier to safety while in fact he was sniping he promises to run away with No.19 Elizabeth Hartman then accepts the lecherous advances of No.16 Jo Ann Harris he promises innocent love to No.10 Pamelyn Ferdin then smashes her turtle against a wall. And when Martha's fantasies of sliding her aged skin against that taut chest are dashed by discovering No.16 in his bed it's hell from so many angles at once that no man  not even The Man's Man Clint  can withstand its emasculative fury.The most amazing aspect of BEGUILED is that it's filled with women and doesn't get screechy or intolerable. Yet it is scarier than any horror movie with its castration allegory  for the sake of petty scorn. And never has an allusion to Michelangelo's Pieta been so hot hot threesome hot.There are no shots fired and no bombastic battle scenes even though it's set during the American Civil War. Revenge doesn't have to be a mushroom cloud it can just be... mushrooms...From the novel by Thomas Cullinan BEGUILED is a study in betrayal and director Don Siegel not only paces it with a solid mix of tension pathos and black humor he fits the female cast perfectly to their roles  from Page's yearning spinster with a very dirty secret to Hartman's naive nineteenyearold with the chaste romantic fantasies to Harris's teen slut with the upturned nose upturned lips and upturned breasts.

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to know what category to put this film in most films set in this time period of US history are westerns but here instead of the wide open plains of the west the action is almost entirely confined to a claustrophobic girls boarding school in Louisiana.The film opens with Amy a young girl walking though the woods picking mushrooms as she does so she stumbles upon Corporal John 'McBee' McBurney a wounded Union soldier who she takes back to the school. We know that he isn't a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from alerting a passing Confederate patrol even though she told him she was twelve.Once back at the school opinions are divided about what should be done with their new guest some think they should look after him till his wounds are healed while others believe that it is treason not to hand him over to Confederate forces at the first opportunity. The former group prevail and he gradually recovers. As he does so his presence has an effect on all of the girls who haven't had a man on site for a long time including a young teacher and the head mistress who's previous relationship appears to have been with her own brother. McBee sets about seducing them emotionally if not physically this leads to considerable jealousy amongst the girls.While this film is rated fifteen it is definitely not for younger viewers both for the sexual content of which little is actually shown but much is implied and for a very gruelling scene which had me squirming more than any other scene in any film I've seen for quite some time. It is interesting to see Clint Eastwood play against type instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and for most of the time at the mercy of the women around him. The acting is solid throughout not just from Eastwood but also from all the actresses including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who played Amy.".

	schema:reviewBody "A doublebill of THE BEGUILED Thomas Cullinan's source novel is a civilwar drama positing a tantalizing scenario where a wounded union soldier fetches up in a southern allgirls' school nurtured to recovery by the apparently goodwilled women but also subjected to temptations from female gazes and one false move he will go through purgatory of his sorry life. The 1971 version is directed by Don Siegel the third of his five collaborations with Clint Eastwood who plays the Yankee Corporal John McBurney and is discovered by a 12yearold Amy Ferdin an absorbing talent to whom he indulges with a peck on her lips a blatant way to take away a child's first kiss also pretty provocative by today's regressive yardstick instantly what Siegel hammers home to viewers is that he is not a humdinger and through glimpses of fleeting flashback interleaved into the narrative John emerges as a congenital liar flippant and manipulative currying favor from his petticoat accompany to slough from a possible fall of incarceration whether it is Miss Marsha Page the headmistress of the seminary school Edwina Hartman the virginal teacher to whom he claims his attraction a nubile 17yearold student Carol Ann Harris who is sexually active even the slave Hallie Mercer a defiant soul hampered by her identity cannot evade his comeons. The advent of a hotblooded albeit bedridden male inevitably causes an erotic disruption among the exclusive distaff clique whose members are circumspectly secluded from the battlefield merely outside their perimeter and sexually repressed for pert callow girls they are inclined to project John as a perfect specimen of their untested sexual allure versus the opposite sex in the cases of Edwina and Carol one is the prudish committed type and the other is a wanton nymphet. But the most complex character amongst them is no doubt Miss Marsha whose incest past and subliminal lesbian proclivity get a full treatment in the audacious script and visual presentation the latter is even coalesced with a flagrant religious connotation to soup up the film's maverick idiom. When the crunches arrives a man's conceit in his potency is punished by blunt castration and signifies a rude wakening of the priapic worship. On top of his virile stallion credence Clint Eastwood imbues a cunning almost overweening facade which audience isn't familiar with not cut from the same cloth from his hardboiled toughguy legend. Geraldine Page emboldened by her matriarchal gravitas and demanding onus doesn't shy away from any extraneous intrusion the Union and the Confederacy alike and builds a palpably beguiling tension through the mind games she plays with Eastwood yet holds the rein from stem to stern in unyielding resolution of taking the escalating situation in her own hands. Elizabeth Hartman the fragile Oscarnominated actress whose premature demise was a harrowing tragedy ripe for cinematic transposition brings about something equally tangible and visceral as she is bedeviled by the discord between a man's promise and his action but still holds out the last remaining benevolence out of her own impressionable nature. Crowned BEST DIRECTOR in Cannes Sofia Coppola's remake is an aesthetically beguiling psychological intrigue superbly recreates a mystical Gothic quaintness in the closing days of the civil war entrapped within the terrain of a majestic mansion of antebellum south which certainly is a scintillating upgrade from the 1971 version's sepia retro flair. But storywise Sofia's script not only eviscerates the role of Hallie which is a doubleedged sword since she claims that out of the respect of this sensitive issue she doesn't want to tread lightly but also can be easily accused of racially insensitive but also leaves no allusion of all the taboo issues tackled in Siegel's movie lesbian kiss incest depravity and of course that inappropriate kiss between a grownup man and a teenage girl are outright sanitized and in fact the whole story has been strenuously internalized for instance John's transgression where is given a plausible justification in Siegel's film is carried out in a slipshod manner indicating that it is nothing less than a spur of horniness. Atmospherical over dramatic it is beyond reproach that Coppola opts to tell the allegory with her own agent but unfortunately the resultant impact doesn't meet up with expectation especially when juxtaposed with its far more entrancing antecedent. Nicole Kidman intrepidly takes the mantle from Ms. Page and actualizes an extremely sensual spongewashing scene with Colin Farrell's less forthcoming and more sympathetic portrayal of a soldier turns paraplegic when he is subjected to an ambiguous retribution out of the necessity of saving his life. Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning don't make a splash in the shoes of Hartman and Ann Harris respectively save Oona Laurence whose Amy precisely captures a child's malleable mentality.So the jury is out the remake is humbled by the original which is quite a shocker because on the paper Coppola's feminine sensitivity seems to be more adept to parse this ageold gender ax battle than an actioninclined Mr. Siegel again there is no sure thing in the film industry and that is exactly why it keeps us intrigued every time.".

	schema:headline " American Civil War Gothic";
	schema:reviewBody "Downbeat yet at times almost Gothic in its evocation of atmosphere this is a disquieting but involving drama based around the unusual premise of a wounded Union soldier being taken in at a private school for girls of the southern confederate persuasion.Clint Eastwood is the duplicitous soldier who takes advantage of the miss lonely hearts who duly line up for his attentions and from an uncharismatic start develops into a more complex character who too late repents of his dark side and that he might have been kinder to animals especially pet turtles as well as the womanfolk who come his way.The film is certainly condescending towards women with three of the adults if 17 counts as an adult and a young child all smitten with Eastwood's handsome cripple. Eastwood's soldier on the other hand perhaps goes too much to extremes and could perhaps have been shown to be a bit more sympathetic but it was a brave decision for him to play a character who on the surface compliments his hostesses eloquently but on the other hand has no compunction about bedding any of them who take his fancy.Director Don Seigel lets situations develop at their own pace and the characterisations to deepen as they go perhaps overegging the narrative with the lurid backstories of the headmistress played by Geraldine Page and the female black slave but I liked the Gothic touches of heightened passions with characters voicing their thoughts while the mordant conclusion is appropriately unsensational and unheroic.There's a thin line of good taste which Seigel has to negotiate and apart from an early shocking scene when Eastwood escapes detection by a Confederate patrol to set up the film's first and in the end most significant infatuation and a later menageaquatre dream sequence he skirts around it adroitly. Beautifully shot well paced and excellently acted by all the actors this film strikes me as one of Clint Eastwood's best all the better for being so far off the beaten track.".

	onyx:emotionText "Downbeat yet at times almost Gothic in its evocation of atmosphere this is a disquieting but involving drama based around the unusual premise of a wounded Union soldier being taken in at a private school for girls of the southern confederate persuasion.Clint Eastwood is the duplicitous soldier who takes advantage of the miss lonely hearts who duly line up for his attentions and from an uncharismatic start develops into a more complex character who too late repents of his dark side and that he might have been kinder to animals especially pet turtles as well as the womanfolk who come his way.The film is certainly condescending towards women with three of the adults if 17 counts as an adult and a young child all smitten with Eastwood's handsome cripple.

These feelings appear to be confirmed as Eastwood grizzled Union officer John McBurney comes into shot clearly wounded and hanging on for dear life following a bloody battle with Confederate soldiers. He is discovered by Amy Pamelyn Ferdin a 12 year old student at the nearby Seminary for Young Ladies who quickly takes a keen interest in the handsome but battered young man. As some bloodthirsty Confederate soldiers trot by and they are forced to hide John plants a lingering kiss on the child's mouth which immediately cause feelings of discomfort for the viewer. No The Beguiled is not your typical Siegel toughguy actioner but something all the more fascinating and complex.John is eventually smuggled back into the school run by Miss Martha Farnsworth Geraldine Page a woman with a secretive past of her own. She wants the Union soldier gone immediately but the soldier is charming and badly wounded so she and the fellow ladies of the school tend to his injured leg and give him a bed. He is kept under lock and key but he is often visited by the curious ladies including virginal teacher Edwina Elizabeth Hartman and precocious 17 year old student Carol Jo Ann Harris. With Martha still insistent on turning him over to Confederate troops once he has regained his strength John seizes the chance to seduce as many of them as he can taking full advantage of their time away from men and natural curiosity towards the opposite sex. He becomes unnervingly comfortable with his methods of manipulation and is soon playing the women off one another. But these ladies have seen it all before whether it be a father a sibling or a drunken soldier stumbling onto the school grounds with cruel intentions.The Beguiled is a film about jealousy sexuality and bitterness so it's no surprise that it flopped and didn't go down well with fans of Siegel's tougher more straightlaced output. The film also threatens to venture into horror territory as emotions begin to spill over and John's scheming becomes apparent. There were cries of misogyny upon the film's release but although the claim is certainly open for debate this is not a film by a director who hates women. To label the film misogynist would be to cruelly over simplify it as the likes of Martha and Edwina aren't just coy women to be easily taken advantage of but incredibly complex characters both scarred and enlightened by past experiences with men. John is clearly the most loathsome character an evil man who uses his physicality and charm to worm his way into their lives and gain their trust and Siegel makes little attempt to make him sympathetic. It's an incredibly claustrophobic and intense experience with careerbest performances from Page and Hartman. It is Siegel's favourite of his extensive filmography and it isn't difficult to see why.".

It's extremely well acted stylishly made  with Clints' frequent collaborator Don Siegel in the directors' chair  and often sexy and sinister in equal measure. It's nice to see Clint take chances like this with his projects but then he's always been a very interesting leading man. Another Clint vehicle that's somewhat in this vein is 1984s' Tightrope. The period recreation is sound and there are also doses of sex and gore in this film that earns its R rating.Clint plays Yankee officer John McBurney severely wounded during the latter days of the Civil War. He's discovered by Amy Pamelyn Ferdin a child who escorts him back to her girls' school. The staff led by Martha Geraldine Page agree to keep him there basically for the purpose of nursing him back to health before he can be surrendered to Rebel troops and taken to prison. However Johns' arrival in this female setting is the trigger for an escalating series of ugly incidents as the male stranger cons his way into the hearts of some of the ladies.Clint is impressive as he puts a smarmy and selfserving spin on his screen charisma. Page and Elizabeth Hartman likewise impressed this viewer with their takes on these vulnerable characters. The child actresses are all good without being overly cutesy. Jo Ann Harris is the sexpot teenager Carol and Darleen Carr the rigid Doris. Mae Mercer is able to play her slave character of Hallie with dignity and she really holds her own in confrontations with Clint. Ferdin is appealing in the role of the girl who gets the ball rolling in terms of plot. Melody Thomas Scott of 'The Young and the Restless' fame is another of the girls character actor Matt Clark has a small role.Highly memorable stuff with very quick flashback cuts that add to the somber quality of this tale by Thomas Cullinan.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Working my way through a boxset of the eight films Eastwood made with Universal in his early film career I expected from The Beguiled a good quality western drama in the vein of the actor's other collaborations with director Don Siegel.Slowly dying from his wounds Yankee soldier John McBurney is found and rescued by a schoolgirl who has him taken to her boarding school where he is tended to by her classmates and the school's staff who eventually decide not to turn him in to the Confederate soldiers under whose watch they reside.Set toward the conclusion of the Civil War The Beguiled is if we insist upon generic classification more a war film than a western. That said it is far removed for being simply a war film. Immediately unearthing the idea of wartime loyalty to one's cause the film examines the moral conflict engendered by the women's knowledge that McBurney will be killed if handed over. They are all loyal to the Confederate cause but are uncomfortable with the thought that a man's death will be on their hands. This is not however the film's primary thematic concern nor even one which is explored beyond its base dilemma. The issue of sexual appetites and the implications when they are not satiated is that on which the film focuses portraying to us that of three of the film's female characters. Eastwood's character early identifies his power within this house despite his handicap his phallic presence key to his manipulation of the sexually charged women who each wishes to have him in their bed. Using his masculinity as a weapon he engages in a variety of mind games attempting to prey upon the exasperated libidos hoping to manipulate them so that he may make his escape. The film explores the issue of gender politics the ideas of masculinity and femininity the danger of sexual repression. Surprising enough in itself it is another aspect of this film which will ensure its ability to be instantly and vividly recalled in the minds of all who see it. The third of these explorationsthat of sexual repressionleads to the film's shockingly escalating horror aspects. A Gothic drama by its conclusion more than anything else the film tilts toward scenes more terrifying than many selfproclaimed horror films in its latter half pulling out all the stops to completely frighten and baffle the audience with darkness matched only in its comprehensiveness by the darkened wonders of Bruce Surtees' cinematography. McBurney's eventual fate as he becomes the emasculated prisoner of these sexstarved women is truly shocking in every sense of the word. Though the film builds toward this all along it softens none of the blow leaving us wideeyed and dropjawed.One of the most surprising narrative progressions I have ever seen in a film and one of the most quietly harrowing along with it The Beguiled is a traumatisingly dark drama that is a shocking output from all concerned. Benefiting from this greatly it is a simultaneously exasperating entertaining and electrifying experience that poses some deeply interesting thematic questions about sexuality and violence.".

While most people catalogue it as a western to include the folks at The Western Channel The Beguiled is a problem because you don't really know what it is A sort of war movie? A drama? Psychological thriller? Maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought Noir films starring Kirk Douglas? I actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man who likes to kick back with the cheap gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like The Wire saw that high angle medium long shot of Geraldine Page wrapping a tourniquet around Clint's bloody leg Pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the Outback Bowl right before he absconded to another room. My advice watch this one and make sure it is on a very large screen preferably run on that DPL home theater projector you're contemplating. I would put The Beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase turn the overheads out throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall and try not to lose your grip because just like Norman Bates We all go a little mad sometimes even the beguiled.".

In this film he is pure villain and he plays it well.As a wounded union soldier he is brought into a confederate girls school by the students and teachers to heal. Soon after he begins to seduce the ladies no matter their age and some are quite young. He also plays upon their jealousies and pits them against each other. In the end you are never so happy to see Clint die a terrible death.That is what makes this film such a gem. Clint has never done any other film like it and after seeing this film you wish he had. He plays the role of the villain so well it will make you wonder why he never did any more films like it. It also explains why the film is not seen very often. Most people don't want to see Clint as the villain and with Dirty Harry being released shortly after this film it has become a hidden gem. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan you owe it to yourself to see this film. You might not like what you will see but you won't soon forget it.".

Her life revolves around her job as a nurse at a busy New York hospital until one rainy night her sister Jenna abandons her newborn autistic daughter at her home. Maggie takes the baby in and she becomes the daughter she never had. Six years later Jenna suddenly reappears with a mysterious new husband Eric and abducts Cody. Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody FBI agent John Travis an expert in ritual homicide and occultrelated crime takes up her cause when he realizes that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children. The little girl it soon becomes clear is more than simply special. She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved in the end by the strength of one small child...";

Never have I seen so much intense negative interest in a really bad movie.Before watching Bless The Child tonight my only prior knowledge of it was seeing the trailer a couple of times on TV when the movie was about to be released. And then I only really noticed because the Icon label attached to it seemed to be out of place.But the movie really wasn't that bad though it could have used more much more focus and better lines and more intensity from the lead actors.The story is classic good vrs. evil. What seems to have peeved many of the reviewers is that good in the form of a little girl Holliston Coleman was actually presented as having some real and quiet strength for a change. I suppose in these reviewers jaded view of reality this seems unrealistic. Besides in horror movies you know the realistic kind the evil thingamabob is always indestructible and just when good manages to triumph  we find it really didn't. How dare the Bless the Child producers have the gall not to be cliche in this respect!So to sum up my feelings. I liked the story I don't suffer from antiCatholic bigotry so the charge of being too Catholic wasn't a concern. I liked the little girl's acting. I thought Kim Bassinger did a credible job  though her part lacked some intensity as did Jimmie Smits' part. I thought the Stark character acted by Rufus Sewell was well acted and convincingly evil. Miss Ricci's cameo was well done and the special effects were very good. Overall taking into account my earlier criticism of lack of focus lack of intensity and a few lines that made me wince  it was not a bad movie. I would suggest it for those who do like a clear cut distinction between good and evil. And oh yes. No nudity. Very little profanity and violence that was intense but not overly graphic or gory. I know  this crew simply doesn't know how to make a real horror film do they?".

After watching the DVD last night I was kicking myself for missing a chance to see this movie a year earlier.Bless the child is full of new or unknown actors but reguardless it is well acted... Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits both play their parts well and the script and their acting allows the viewer to see something that may be chemistry building between the two but doesn't throw it in our faces. The problem with most movies of this type is that the villian is flat and poorly acted... That is not the case in Bless the Child. Rufus Sewell does an excellent job portraying the evil Eric Stark. Although she has a nominal part in the movie Angela Bettis played the part of Maggies drugaddicted sister so well I was absolutely hating her. Even with all of this the movie would not be what it is without the superb acting of Holliston Coleman who plays 6yearold Cody. At 7 Holliston has more ability than many adult actors. She definately has a future.The story and directing were both done well. Although it is not the most original story line it is done a different way. Rarely if ever is the force of good allowed to manifest itself in a visible presence. In Bless the Child however the good can be seen along with the evil. Although I not by any means a very religious person this struck a cord with me. There's a sense of hope within this growing evil... The world may just have a chance not because a big guy with a big gun blew away Satan... no because there is good out there. The battle between good and evil does have two sides... It's just nice to be able to see the good for a change.The special effects are also good in this movie. It is by far a special effects movie but they are used in a smart fashion to provide a glimpse at the battle that goes on all around us although we don't see it... Only the rat bedroom sequence left me somewhat disappointed the rest provided a eery mood to the film.Bless the Child is a great film for what it is and maybe be known as the starting point to the great career of Holliston Coleman. 810Although it may not be a perfect movie".

As slowly the years pass by it seems that cody Holliston Coleman suffers from some kind of autism. Her disorder is hard to explain but it is bluntly obvious that Cody isn't like ordinary children. Meanwhile in the neighbourhood are some horrible murders going around. Kids are being found dead in a gruesome ritual where they all have the same satanic symbol burned on their bodys. No one can explain who is doing this but when Cody becomes a target for these murders Maggie will do anything to save her niece. I enjoyed this movie i think the acting was very good especially by Kim Basinger and Angela Bettis. My favorite actress Christina Ricci had only a very small part in this movie but I still enjoyed seeing her. I would give Bless The Child 810".

So we decided to see it the Friday it came out.  But when we walked out of the theater we were laughing our heads off because of how dumb the movie was. First the plot was not believable did not move along smoothly and was generally boring.  Yes the leads act really well but the plot made them look like chickens running around with their heads off. Second the effects were mediocre.  Although I did not expect much in the ways of effects in the movie this was pretty bad.  Have you ever seen someone trying to kill someone else with a butter knife?!  I have in this movie! Thirdly almost the entire preview was spent on Christina Ricci's role. But the length of her onscreen in the movie is equal to the amount of time she is in the trailer.  Her role could easily be filled by an extra!  Her role had no challenge hardly any lines and hardly any effect on the movie. So if you want a good laugh at a stupid it'sbeendone movie or if you have nothing better to do see Bless The Child.  If not you would be as disappointed as my friends and I were.".

Myth has it too that Saint Margaret the Virgin is known to be the Patron Saint of Pregnancy and who as legend would have it was brought up by a nurse after her father disowned her and having once met with the devil with him in the form of a dragon. Irony and coincidence perhaps for both considering her name being Maggie and her inability to have children and baby Cody's circumstance.Dealing with this child and her seemingly autistic state autism being a condition that is caused by a disorder that prevents the brain developing properly this in turn can impair interaction both socially and emotionally. It isn't until she reaches six years of age that Maggie's worries slowly turn into fears of what exactly is wrong with this exceptional child. There are more than just physical and mental states at play here that are more than concerning and enlightening. Maggie's doubts and fears are soon to be tested to and far beyond the boundaries of human restraint.Bless the Child uses fables and myth to bring old legends to contemporary settings. With the killing of the innocent children to flush out the Prophecy the way in which we see this being done is very subtle and coaxing if a little disturbing bringing an uncomfortable reality that something sinister something malevolent something lurking in the shadows and something extremely evil is all to ready to pounce. Here lies the winning formula the evil that we see is not so much dark forces of the underworld but be warned they exist here too it is more the evil of man and his willingness to be lead and be controlled by them. Man against man sin against morality and the ageold battle of Light against the Darkness. We see Eric Stark and his followers taking parallel lines in the similar vain as the real life Satan and occult master Aleister The Beast Crowley 1875  1947 founder of The Golden Dawn and once labelled The Wickedest Man in the World. With Eric Stark renaming his cult The New Dawn Foundation it is he who most certainly carries this trade of old evils and new Beasts to a tee. English born Rufus Sewell plays Stark with convincing zeal with both phoney exterior compassion and charm to literally devilmaycare cold indifference intermingling both persona's well enough to know that we are dealing with more than just the basic human traits that we see hear and deal with in life. Evil as it seems holds no bounds.Kim Basinger and Holliston Coleman born 1992 bond very well and a great performance as surrogate mother she plays her role with devotion and with an honest and convincing feel. With just three years after winning her Best Actress in a Supporting Role for L.A. Confidential this isn't Ms. Basinger going down a peg but raising the stakes in this thriller horror movie genre. Her integrity is most certainly kept in tact and this is with the assistance of one Chuck Russell director of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors 1987 The Blob 1988 The Mask 1994 and The Scorpion King 2002. A fine team they make and as with the gelling of the two leading ladies it is his fine work in crafting young Holliston Coleman to a standard of highend child acting. Expect to see more of this young girl. Especially if she were to take the good advice from the ever professional and independently versatile actress Christina Ricci as the heroin addict Cheri Post which is always a pleasure to see her working.Bless the child also has its own parallels too and lends itself to the likes of The Omen 1976 The Exorcist 1973 and the 1968 Roman Polanski film Rosemary's Baby where we see children as axis of evils' Bless the Child sees the innocence and purity that is The Child untainted and undemanding. Thus bearing the special gift of Life and the blessing of Divinity sometimes disturbing but slight and at times touching but never over demanding and horrific which sets this movie of as being different and a little unique.With moderate violence and with the help of a little CGI a script that fights its own ground when in the amphitheatres of right and wrong excellent and well cast we can then be assured that Bless the Child most certainly has not been cursed.".

	schema:reviewBody "A cult crime about a mother named Jenna O' Conner Angela Bettis who ran away and left her daughter Cody Holliston Coleman with her Aunt Maggie O' Conner Kim Basinger. Maggie brought her up and she soon discovered that Cody had ADHD. And 3 years later she had amazing abilities. For example she could spin a bowl lid spin a doll's car make the snow in the paperweight move about healed a pigeon magically lit the candles in the church one by one etc.When Cody's babysitter Maria Anne Betancourt said to Cody if she prayed good things would happen. On the following day a child named Martin Nicholas Marti Salgo was kidnapped and found later at the bottom of the lake by police with a symbol of the devil on him! And soon a girl named Cheri Christina Ricciended up in Maggie doctor room. Cheri said that her friends wanted her to end up in a morgue because  she wanted to quit her club! She saw a vision that they were going to get the girl and she said to Maggie that she must NOT let them get the girl.It was fascinating to hear what that satanic symbol symbolized. According to John Travis the symbol was used in Ceremonial Sacrifices in the 16th century in Europe. The top symbolized Satanism because the fallen angel mythology was taken seriously. The crimes were against God and all the victims' bodies had the symbols which meant Like Easter. What ever a man was up to on Easter's Eve. And on the following day Cody and Maggie bumped into Jenna and her new husband Eric Stark Rufus Sewell a master of evil who kidnapped Cody.After the incident Cheri called and said she knew where Cody was. Cheri also told Maggie that Eric believed in the Devil and he was the one who always killing the kids on the 16th of December who were 6 years of age. He would put them through a test and if they failed he would kill them. And Eric had been looking for Cody all along and he wanted to change her. Just to make her look like him! So he could use her power. And if Eric couldn't turn Cody into what he wanted her to be he would kill her because she lead people to God! And on the same night FREAKS came after Cheri! And when Maggie tried to call the cops she was given an injection and she felt weary . And as the gang beat Cheri up in the train station evil creatures were seen flying about. And when Maggie touched Cheri CHERIS HEAD FELL OFF!!! On the following day Maggie found out where Eric stayed. Freaky to see demons flying around his lair. The nastiest killer that Eric had was named Stuart Eugene Lipinski. And pretty creepy to Eric's odd looking eye. And also when Eric strangely removed bullets from Maggie's gun when she tried to shoot him. And she was knocked out by Stuart! And when she woke up she was swerving past every car on Brooklyn Bridge and she crashed on the edge. And she was thankfully rescued when the car was going off the edge of the bridge.And that night Eric tempted a hobo Dwaine McLean with gas and matches through a Satanic practice. It was stopped when Cody said to the hobo that the Loed had not forgotten him and when the hobo opened his hand a rosary was in it. And when Cody left ERIC DROPPED A LIGHTER AND THE HOBO WENT ON FIRE! And then Eric fooled Cody by becoming a Satanist if she did not believe in God she must jump.And soon Travis uncovered Eric's tracks. And when Maggie and Cody were escaping from Eric's helper Dahyna Dimitra Arliss. And once they got in DAYHNA APPEARED AND WHEN SHE SMACKED THE WINDOW SHE TURNED INTO A HIDEOUS DEMON! When Cody and Maggie went 30 miles South of Albany they crashed and when Maggie told Codie to get out and run Cody was caught by a limo and she was taken to an Old Estate North of Albany. And back at Eric's house under some kind of vision The Forensic Detectives discovered Satanic symbols in pinkishpurple liquid. And at the Old Estate Eric told Cody to join them if she wanted to live and her mother said she should. And then she made all the plates on the dinner table spin.And when Maggie and Travis came over  Maggie saw Cody running away with a Voodoo group coming after her. And suddenly one of them attacked Travis!Maggie followed Cody to a demonic church with demonic creatures flying around it. Abd when Maggie approached Cody she hissed at her and the Voodoo group took Maggie into the Satanic church. And when everyone was inside rats appeared and they flooded onto a thrown which everyone was facing and the Devil appeared and then evaporated.Back at the church Sister Joseph Helen Stenborg prayed at the convent. Cody was sitting on a table with Stuart holding a knife to her throat. And then gas bombs broke in and Maggie stabbed Eric. And when Maggie tried to rescue Cody she was shot by Eric and Cody healed her and angels appeared. And cops broke in Travis shot Eric and he died Stuart was shot and the angels disappeared. Maggie rescued Jenna  the church burnt down and everyone got out.In the end Jenna was in ReHab and she told Maggie to adopt Cody.

	onyx:emotionText "A cult crime about a mother named Jenna O' Conner Angela Bettis who ran away and left her daughter Cody Holliston Coleman with her Aunt Maggie O' Conner Kim Basinger. Maggie brought her up and she soon discovered that Cody had ADHD. And 3 years later she had amazing abilities. For example she could spin a bowl lid spin a doll's car make the snow in the paperweight move about healed a pigeon magically lit the candles in the church one by one etc.When Cody's babysitter Maria Anne Betancourt said to Cody if she prayed good things would happen. On the following day a child named Martin Nicholas Marti Salgo was kidnapped and found later at the bottom of the lake by police with a symbol of the devil on him! And soon a girl named Cheri Christina Ricciended up in Maggie doctor room. Cheri said that her friends wanted her to end up in a morgue because  she wanted to quit her club! She saw a vision that they were going to get the girl and she said to Maggie that she must NOT let them get the girl.It was fascinating to hear what that satanic symbol symbolized. According to John Travis the symbol was used in Ceremonial Sacrifices in the 16th century in Europe. The top symbolized Satanism because the fallen angel mythology was taken seriously. The crimes were against God and all the victims' bodies had the symbols which meant Like Easter. What ever a man was up to on Easter's Eve. And on the following day Cody and Maggie bumped into Jenna and her new husband Eric Stark Rufus Sewell a master of evil who kidnapped Cody.After the incident Cheri called and said she knew where Cody was. Cheri also told Maggie that Eric believed in the Devil and he was the one who always killing the kids on the 16th of December who were 6 years of age. He would put them through a test and if they failed he would kill them. And Eric had been looking for Cody all along and he wanted to change her. Just to make her look like him! So he could use her power. And if Eric couldn't turn Cody into what he wanted her to be he would kill her because she lead people to God! And on the same night FREAKS came after Cheri! And when Maggie tried to call the cops she was given an injection and she felt weary . And as the gang beat Cheri up in the train station evil creatures were seen flying about. And when Maggie touched Cheri CHERIS HEAD FELL OFF!!! On the following day Maggie found out where Eric stayed. Freaky to see demons flying around his lair. The nastiest killer that Eric had was named Stuart Eugene Lipinski. And pretty creepy to Eric's odd looking eye. And also when Eric strangely removed bullets from Maggie's gun when she tried to shoot him. And she was knocked out by Stuart! And when she woke up she was swerving past every car on Brooklyn Bridge and she crashed on the edge. And she was thankfully rescued when the car was going off the edge of the bridge.And that night Eric tempted a hobo Dwaine McLean with gas and matches through a Satanic practice. It was stopped when Cody said to the hobo that the Loed had not forgotten him and when the hobo opened his hand a rosary was in it. And when Cody left ERIC DROPPED A LIGHTER AND THE HOBO WENT ON FIRE! And then Eric fooled Cody by becoming a Satanist if she did not believe in God she must jump.And soon Travis uncovered Eric's tracks. And when Maggie and Cody were escaping from Eric's helper Dahyna Dimitra Arliss. And once they got in DAYHNA APPEARED AND WHEN SHE SMACKED THE WINDOW SHE TURNED INTO A HIDEOUS DEMON! When Cody and Maggie went 30 miles South of Albany they crashed and when Maggie told Codie to get out and run Cody was caught by a limo and she was taken to an Old Estate North of Albany. And back at Eric's house under some kind of vision The Forensic Detectives discovered Satanic symbols in pinkishpurple liquid. And at the Old Estate Eric told Cody to join them if she wanted to live and her mother said she should. And then she made all the plates on the dinner table spin.And when Maggie and Travis came over  Maggie saw Cody running away with a Voodoo group coming after her. And suddenly one of them attacked Travis!Maggie followed Cody to a demonic church with demonic creatures flying around it. Abd when Maggie approached Cody she hissed at her and the Voodoo group took Maggie into the Satanic church. And when everyone was inside rats appeared and they flooded onto a thrown which everyone was facing and the Devil appeared and then evaporated.Back at the church Sister Joseph Helen Stenborg prayed at the convent. Cody was sitting on a table with Stuart holding a knife to her throat. And then gas bombs broke in and Maggie stabbed Eric. And when Maggie tried to rescue Cody she was shot by Eric and Cody healed her and angels appeared. And cops broke in Travis shot Eric and he died Stuart was shot and the angels disappeared. Maggie rescued Jenna  the church burnt down and everyone got out.In the end Jenna was in ReHab and she told Maggie to adopt Cody. And suddenly one of the evil helpers appeared whipped out a knife while they were looking at the church Cody then turned around stared at him the evil helper stopped and he ran away! WOW!!!";

However they are notorious for their atrocious acting skills and awful movies. And as Olsen movies go this one is by far the worst.Getting There is about a girl named Taylor Ashley Olsen who wants to go to the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. She could have gone alone but no she brings along her twin sister Kylie MaryKate Olsen after all since when have the Olsens' done a movie without the other? and a bunch of friends.Along the way they get into a load of hilerious mix ups as every attempt they make to get there fails. So it's basically a movie about these teens trying to find a way of getting there.The movie is directed by Steve Purcell who judging by this movie and his other works must be the worst director in the world. Second to Ed Wood though at least Ed Wood was actually entertaining.The camera shots are awful the lighting is terrible the acting is atrocious and the plot is wafer thin. The dialogue is supposed to be funny but the ultracrap catchphrases are cringe worthy. One word that gets really annoying? Hype They all say it like it's a really cool word you watch in and think OMG these kids are SAD! Ashley Olsen as always can be caught acting the entire time and must be the worlds most unnatural actress. MaryKate Olsen does her trademark complete overact with an expression for every word and hands going everywhere. Billy Aaron Brown as one of their friends is just annoying and the other cast are also just pretty irritating to watch.The one good thing about this movie? Actress Alexandra Picatto who plays Charley Simms a girl the twins and their friends meet on their journey. Picatto is the one actress who actually deserves to be doing something better. She's natural in front of the camera has screen presence and can act. However she may only have seemed good in contrast to the rest of the cast.You'll lose the will to live watching this movie. The best advice I can give you is to save yourself and steer clear!".

	schema:reviewBody "This was and is one of the worst kid's movies I have ever seen. It was a pathetic attempt to capture my attention for an hour and a half but it failed miserably. If you give this movie anything about a 3 you should be banned from the IMDB site for misleading the readers. Every single thing was predictable no action or excitement whatsoever. There actually came to a point where I was guessing not only what was going to happen next but exact lines of dialog and what they were going to do etc.  WARNING Do not waste 90 minutes of your life on the dog. One of the worst things I have seen in I can't remember when. I could go on forever about this but I am going to go get shock treatment to help me forget about it. The Olsens were just plain awful in this film. They're not New Yorkers and I have to agree with everyone with saying that the accent just didn't cut it. Their acting was really bad and since their  performance wasn't up to standards I'm glad that her role wasn't any bigger. It seems that a lot of people dislike this movie because they think it is unrealistic or because they don't care about the characters. I think this just goes to show how selfinvolved and classist a lot of Americans are at the moment.It seems that a lot of people dislike this movie because they think it is unrealistic or because they don't care about the characters. I think this just goes to show how selfinvolved and classist a lot of Americans are at the moment.Anyone who thinks that the wild and crazy events that go on in this movie couldn't happen outside of the Olsen movies would are totally and 100 correct.  Who in hell would let their teenage daughters go on a road trip with their boyfriends to the Olymics? And then when their car is stolen they just buy them plane tickets. The two teenagers are both stupid spoiled brats who get everything they want. The writer doesn't even give his characters brains or anything. Yeah it might be a teenage stereotype but it's one that is also incredibly untrue.  You'll probably enjoy this movie if you can relate to any of the situations in the film. If you approach this film with that mindset and without judgment about spoiled brats who get everything they want this film will make you both laugh and wince because it does at times feel more unrealistic than a fairy tale.  An Olsen film that from the back of the box promises twists adventure and fun we will never forget. This film also fools us into watching it by flaunting the Olsens with starring roles. After the first twenty minutes you realize that this movie is going to give you NOTHING. The story goes on aimlessly revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested. All  typical teenager characters have only small grains of back story to force us to care. Just as you reach the end everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience catch up you are left with no idea and more importantly no interest in why. The director who also thought it would be a good idea to costar seems to come into the film with no prior experience or knowledge of useful film making. The entire piece looks like a college film crafted by a freshman film student trying to hide a lack of true talent. Pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people going on a road trip starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses. This film has no point unless that is its point. Additionally it is rather contrived like a cheesy Olsen film that starts out one way and ends up another. The main characters have nothing in common presumably when in fact they do. There is few young males and 4 young females each trying to find something by going on a road trip and that brings them together in an odyssey. The title seems intentionally misleading unless as a synonym for an onslaught. They all appear to come from different places. That's what we are led to believe.The story gets stranger and more bizarre as it goes  more than one is not quite right in the head. Sometimes the camera is just shooting pictures of telephone poles and wires or other spurious details of passing along on a trip to nowhere in particular. The girls have a fancy new car but no money. As her judgement begins to deteriorate more profoundly her three companions seem to grasp for some control of their destiny. Then the whole story well you will have to see it.  The line between fantasy and reality is very blurred and there is a purposelessness to the story. The ending fails to tie us back meaningfully to the beginning. It pretends to give us hope but more like a wish a dream or something hallucinated by a dissociated childlike mind. This is a film more difficult to ignore than to praise. 010.".

Pulver receives a package from someone who was on the ship where Mr. Roberts died. It is medical books that Mr. Roberts wanted Pulver to have because he knew he would like the dirty pictures.This movie is much more of a comedy than Roberts and is alot of fun to watch.Also in the crew you can spot George Lindsey Goober from the Andy Griffith show future TV game show host Peter Marshall a skinny James Coco and a very young James Farentino.Too bad this movie is not on DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was a great movie that did NOT cry out for a sequel it was Mister Roberts with its gruff poignant perfect ending. A bad sequel like Ensign Pulver is particularly disappointing.The setting here is the same as in the earlier classic  a scroungy old Navy vessel on the fringes of the Pacific Theater late in World War II. This movie is built around Ensign Frank Pulver the sidekick of Mister Roberts in the original movie. Unfortunately Robert Walker Jr. who plays Pulver here can't match the original screen Pulver Jack Lemmon. It's almost like they're playing different people.That's the main problem I think too much tinkering with familiar characters. The focus of Mister Roberts was the battle of wits and wills between the idealistic Roberts Henry Fonda and the embittered captain James Cagney. But in this film the captain now played by Burl Ives finds himself psychoanalyzed by Pulver. Cagney's captain was hard to like but easy to understand while Ives' version is as complicated as a Tennessee Williams character.And how about Doc? In Mister Roberts he was portrayed by an older actor William Powell in one of his last roles. A counterpoint to the captain Doc was a man who had grown wise not cynical with age. Walter Matthau though a fine actor is a much younger Doc in this one and one who's not particularly wise. He's just another madcap guy in a madcap crew.Mister Roberts had a lot of wonderful laughs but ultimately it was dead serious about World War II. If you've seen it you know what I mean. But in Ensign Pulver the greatest conflict in history is just an excuse for humdrum hijinks. It's really too bad.".

Just when the crew is about to blow a gasket along comes Ensign Pulver with a spiked projectile  slingshot with the captains name on it! As if things couldn't get worse the captain is washed overboard during a storm....and of all persons Ensign Pulver goes after him..... ends up saving the crabby later on with frogjuice very crocked  mellowcaptains life. As I said in the beginning there have been many things said about this movie......that it wasn't worth being a sequel to Mr. Roberts  the mediocre cast. In my opinion for what it's worth I found Ensign Pulver to be more entertaining  not as serious.....more funny  human. As of this writing I have yet to see this movie in CinemaScope.....as it was originally released. Also the cast in Ensign Pulver is much better  funnier. Enjoy!!".

There is but one redeeming factor in this entire abomination of a sequel and that is the presence of Walter Matthau. He comes off well although the lifeless mess of a script gives him little to work with. The rest of the ensemble is a conglomeration of miscasting the usually excellent Ives actors lacking any talent whatsoever Tommy Sands?! and the completely charmless irritating and horrendously awful Robert Walker Jr. He alone is enough to sink this stinking scow and was better suited to portraying psychopaths on TV when some delusional casting director actually believed Walker Jr. would be just right for some doomed police procedural. While it is somewhat interesting to see young future stars at the start of their careers the performances are really pretty bad and all of these now wellknown actors were fortunate to have survived this wreck let alone going on to win multiple awards appearing in some of the most successful television programsfilms ever produced and earning many millions in cash. Besides a soulless script Ensign Pulver was personally assassinated by director Josh Logan acting without mercy and with a vicious abandon that is painful to witness. Even a gentle soul like Mr. Roberts himself might well have taken some drastic action if he had seen the ruthless damage inflicted upon this rusting tub of unpleasantness and would have desperately deflected Logan's grim pattern of relentless torpedoes. Alas those who saw the original Mr. Roberts will most likely find this ghastly garbage barge a heartbreaking insult to the source material if not an outright greedy criminal assault upon a beloved classic.".

This film makes the assumption that you have seen Mister Roberts so you know who the main characters are and their personalities before you even watch Ensign Pulver.Playing the roles of Ensign Pulver Captain Morton and Doc are Robert Walker Jr. Burl Ives and Walter Matthau. Walker is far more a callow youth than Jack Lemmon was in Mister Roberts. After that show of bravado where Pulver through the Captain's prize palm tree overboard it's once again business as usual with the tyrannical captain going out of his way to be the meanest man on earth running this navy cargo ship miles away from the action in the Pacific theater. At first there's a lot more service type comedy than there was in Mister Roberts but things do take a serious turn when Pulver and the Captain go overboard during a typhoon. Many days on a rubber raft and then on a tropic island make the captain open up and you get some insight why he's the nasty fellow he is.Some other key roles are Tommy Sands who plays a sailor looking to get leave because his wife just lost their baby and Gerald S. O'Loughlin who gets temporary command of the USS Reluctant when Ives goes missing. In fact Ensign Pulver makes an addition to Mister Roberts in that the ship we see has a full complement of officers other than the four main characters from Mister Roberts. Look for Jack Nicholson in a small role as radioman Dolan and as per the civil rights era Al Freeman integrates the crew which was not the case in Mister Roberts.Walker gets a love interest in Millie Perkins an army nurse who sees him for the shiftless character he is and her supervisor is Kay Medford who has a very droll part. Ensign Pulver is not a classic like Mister Roberts but it is an amusing service comedy and holds up well today.".

	schema:reviewBody "We remember the hype about this film  You'll be Pulverized with laughter!!! Umm. . .NOT!! This seadog of a movie has none of the wit or pathos of Mister Roberts it's progenitor. Burl Ives does his level best to save this loser but his efforts are torpedoed by Robert Walker Jr as Pulver a pale imitation of Jack Lemmon. For our money Walker was at his best as a barely recognizable hippie in Easy Rider or possibly as a product demonstrator in toy commercials for MiltonBradley but never ever as a junior officer in the Navy.

For our money Walker was at his best as a barely recognizable hippie in Easy Rider or possibly as a product demonstrator in toy commercials for MiltonBradley but never ever as a junior officer in the Navy.

	schema:reviewBody "I had the unfortunate experience of watching this film today home sick from work with the flu. From the start of the movie I marvelled at the plot being so close to that of Mister Roberts made some 9 years earlier in 1955. Captain Moreton Burl Ives is the captain of a cargo ship in 1945 somewhere in the Pacific. His motley crew just hate his hardnosed manner with no giveandtake no leave and no freedom. His ambition is to become a Commander. Ensign Frank Pulver Robert Walker Jr plays a joke that badly misfires and somehow both men are overboard and spend their next few weeks together in a rubber dinghy. On running aground on a sandy beach Ensign Parker renews aquaintances with a nurse he met earlier in the film. At the same time Captain Morton falls ill and needs an appendicectomy. The two are reunited with their ship to find the Captain is now a Commander. The crew are so dismayed at the thought of having the past come back and haunt them again. Frank Pulver has a confidential talk with the Commander and the next day we see the Commander leave the ship for the last time. The plot and acting was very second rate. The only time Burl Ives realised his true acting talents was just before the end when he had an emotional man to man talk with Ensign Pulver. This was close to his best when playing Bid Daddy in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. An interesting notable came out when reviewing the cast of the movie. Burl Ives was a noted actor back then in 1964 and his colead Robert Walker was not really heard of. He never went on to become a household name. Other actors in the movie who were absolute nobody's back in 1964 were Walter Matthau Doc Larry Hagman who played Billings and Jack Nicholson who played Dolan. Their faces were instantly recognisable and some 40 years later these actors are now household names. Surely it can't have been the making of this movie who hurtled these three actors into stardom. My advice is if you are feeling sick and this movie is rerun don't watch it as it will make you sicker. 210 max.".

I'm not really familiar with the actually boogeyman story but this was pretty interesting. The setting of the movie is somewhat your typical horror film a hospitalclinic but doesn't take back anything. It has a fair amount suspense gore character development and eye candy. The acting was surprisingly above average and actually really well done especially from the main actress who I've not seen before. Now the movie isn't everything great either. Some of the scenes are somewhat over the top and corny and there is some predictability. Overall its not bad though something to watch when you're bored. I rate it 610. Unrated my rating R for Strong horror violence and terror language some sexualitynudity and brief drug content".

The first puts the accent on the horror part this one emphasizes the bloody cruel and disgustful part.As for the plot it's a little bit incoherent because you actually don't know who killed the children's parents in the beginning of the movie.Anyway Boogeyman 2 is definitely not a horror fan's movie and I am a little disappointed in it's shallow approach of the Boogeyman subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "Have you seen the first Boogeyman movie? I have. It was one of those movies that you watch once and don't really ever think about again. However I liked the idea behind it and I'm a big fan of supernatural horror movies so when I heard there was a Boogeyman 2 I thought I'd check it out.This is not the movie I expected. In fact I feel quite deceived. More on that later.After a quite tense opening sequence where Laura Renee O'Connor first encounters the Boogeyman as a child the movie moves onto the main storyline. Whereas the first movie was a man confronting his childhood demons in his family home this movie is set in hospital where the main character also attempts to overcome her childhood fears. As well as finding herself in the worst staffed hospital of all time one of Laura's doctors is none other than Jigsaw himself the wonderful Tobin Bell who is as creepy here as in the Saw movies. Things aren't looking good for her.Once each of her fellow patients has revealed their fears in various nontoosubtle ways I'm not changing the light in your closet because I'M SCARED OF THE DARK! I'm not shaking your hand because I'M SCARED OF GERMS! etc they all begin to be killed by the evil Boogeyman who surprise...surprise uses their fears against them. I actually quite liked some of the deaths here which were suitably graphic and disturbing  I'm sure a lot of ketchup must have been used in the making of this movie.However I ultimately felt deceived by Boogeyman 2. The makers actually trick you in a very naughty way  kinda like going to watch a Nightmare On Elm Street sequel only to discover that Freddie is no longer the evil spirit of a child murderer but is now an evil robot from the future. You'd say Huh? This isn't anything like the first movie. I wanted to see a supernatural horror movie not another Terminator clone!. You'll see exactly what I mean if you've seen Boogeyman and then watch Boogeyman 2 unfortunately I can't be any more specific as it would be a spoiler. In fact Boogeyman 2 has so little to do with the first Boogeyman that I'm surprised they even share the same name. It also features one completely unnecessary scene of graphic nudity  whether this is a good thing or not depends upon whether you're still in high school. I left high school a while ago and found myself wondering why the scene needed to exist at all. Oh well.In summary then this is a very average little horror movie. I can't say I was particularly scared by any of it but it was nicely acted and had some cool death scenes some of which reminded me a little bit of Saw if truth be told  no wonder Tobin Bell turned up!. If you like watching teens running around dark corridors before losing their vital organs and your DVD collection consists of movies such as Halloween Resurrection and Jason X then it's probably worth a rental. However if you really enjoyed the first movie and want more of the same or like me you're just looking for a good supernatural horror movie I'm willing to bet that you'll be disappointed with Boogeyman 2.".

This is a straight up slasher with some supernatural flavor used more as a decoy than for major thrills. If you like these films then get yourself a copy and you will definitely enjoy yourself. They spent less money this time but the addition of Tobin Bell Today's Vincent Price is perfect. I recommend this one for fans of the slasher genre Mr. Bell and cheesy little DVD.

Wheather it be for the good in which its unintentionally laughable or the other good in which its actually good and your not sure why this film ended up here or the bad in which you just shut it off. Well I must say I found Boogeyman 2 plesantly surprising. Although the first one was not a good movie at all I have to admit that it pretty much scared the crap out of me. So although I can't really recommend that film because most of those scares were due to sound FX I have to say i was a little siked going into this film. one 'o'clock in the a.m. just me and my boy watching with the lights off. And I must say it was pretty darn good. This time around it tells the story of two young kids who see there parents murdered in a hugely grotesque fashion. The brother overcomes his fear of the dark ten years later and leaves the lil sis in a mental institution where all the inmates start dying in relaly brutal ways depending on what there fears are. I won't give anything away but some gimmicks include roaches maggots acid and just crazy buckets of goo. This film is so successful in its execution because it acknowledges its plot and dives headfirst into it. It's gory as hell and offers up everything and hungry horror fan could hope for. There are crazy ass death sequences gore by the gallon some TA plus you get to watch the kid from 7th heaven smoke a joint. And it's actually pretty scary and has...wait for it....wait for it...A pretty good screenplay although it's slightly predictable the performances are pretty good and the twists are quite effective. So conclusion equals crazy gore lots of scares hot guys kick ass heroine pretty good plot. Kick ass sequel. I can see why it wasn't released in theatres as it would have been trimmed down and not nearly as effective and also because it lacks the professionalism in it's look that even most the bad horror flicks have. But what it lacks for in professionalism it makes up for in sheer spunk. This movie is so friggin fun!.55".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess that the producers really had learned their lesson with part 1 the use of CGI was a complete letdown in part 1 but here we have a real boogeyman. It is even so that the boogeyman is more a real killer which gives us the fact that we are in the era of the slashers. The start of the movie learns us that two children witness the killing of both parents. The boy was already afraid and guessed that it was the boogeyman due the fact that the killer was never captured. For that reason they watched the children closely in psychiatry. Next stop 10 years later. The boy tells his sister that he has to go. His sister is back in therapy but suddenly one after one people in her neighborhood get killed. She suspect the boogeyman is back in business. Once the killings start it's old school slasher style. I have seen the 93 minutes version in stead of the European version and I can say that the unrated version isn't afraid by showing the killings. It's mostly done in a bloody way or sometimes even in a gory way. The fact that the effects used are without CGI makes it all worth watching. It is also funny to see Tobin Bell as Dr Mitchell. I guess the director made an ode to SAW by putting in a device to rip open a chest. Anyway Bell is excellent as all others who are really believable. You can guess easily who's the killer but the plot change gives it all worth watching. And for the ones wandering if all elements are in it to say it's a slasher yes Chrissy Griffith does show her milky ways in close up a few times. Sadly part 3 was back to the imagination of the boogeyman in CGI but the red stuff made it second best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boogeyman 2 starts as 8 year old Laura Sammi Hanratty  her 11 year old brother Henry Porter Jarrod Bailey witness the brutal killings of both their parents by an unknown 'boogeyman'. Jump forward 10 years later  Henry Matt Cohen has been a resident in the Hillridge psychiatric hospital the day he gets out his sister Laura Danielle Savre checks in to try  overcome her phobia about the boogeyman just like her brother Henry has. With the help of Dr. Jessica Ryan Renee O'Connor  other's who suffer from a wide range of phobia's Laura hopes to stop having constant nightmares however a fellow patient Mark David Gallagher who is afraid of the dark is found sliced in half. While officially it goes down as an accident Laura believes the boogeyman might have done it  as the bodies pile up it seems like she might be right...Edited  directed by Jeff Betancourt I went into the rather generic  uninspiring sounding Boogeyman 2 not expecting that much so I was pleasantly surprised to find a mildly effective Scream 1996 type teen slasher with a twist now I have never seen the original Boogeyman 2005 but by all accounts it's terrible  this sequel has no connection to it other than in title alone. Anyway the script here by Brian Sieve takes itself very seriously  feels like a cross between A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors 1987  Bad Dreams 1988 with it's mental hospital setting it's string of setpiece gory murders  the basic story of some supernatural boogeyman stalking the patients used by someone else as cover for other motives. The film finished with several twists  turns not all of which make perfect logical sense but they work well enough  quite liked them. Teen slashers aren't know for their deep character's but that's one of Boogeyman 2's strength's while they aren't exactly likable  you won't mind or care when they get killed off the character's here have a little bit more to them than one might expect. With the fact that they all have individual fears that affect them them in different ways it gives them a little bit more personality  help them stand out a bit more than than the usual annoying teenager who populate slasher films. At about 90 odd minutes it moves along at a decent pace there's a steady stream of gory  quite inventive murders  is certainly one of the better low budget slasher films I've seen made this millennium.Director Betancourt does a decent job here while it's nowhere near as bad as The Blair Witch Project 1999 he always keeps his camera moving even when it's just shot's of people talking the camera sways from side to side. The whole film reminds me of an episode of Dawson's Creek 1998  2003 with very autumnal colours  that shaky handheld type cinematography although I'm not sure if the comparison is a compliment or not! There are some pleasingly gory  overthetop murder scenes too a guy is literally gutted as his intestines splat on the floor there are knives in throats someone is cut in half  hung up someone is filled with fat which makes their skin expand  eventually explode there's a cool bit when someone has their chest forced open  their heart is pulled out there's a bit which made me queasy not easy to do these days where a girl has maggots crawling all over her arm  burrowing into cuts before she grabs a scalpel  slices her arms open to get them out  a really cool decapitation via garden shears chrome plated no less! which surely was inspired by the classic slasher The Burning 1981. All the usual horror tricks  clichs are used lights not working people jumping out of shadow's  a final fifteen minutes as the killer stalks the one remaining survivor through dark corridors.Technically the film is very good it's much better than most straighttoDVD horror. A lot like Wrong Turn 2 Dead End 2007 in fact only not as good. This is probably one of the few recent horror flicks not to have any noticeable CGI computer effects it's good old fashioned fake blood  proper makeup effects all the way. The acting is alright  probably better than the average straighttoDVD film Tobin Bell is better know as Jigsaw from the Saw franchise while Renee O'Connor is perhaps better known as Gabrielle from over 130 episodes of Xena Warrior Princess 1995  2001.Boogeyman 2 turned out much much better than I had expected. OK sure it isn't any sort of masterpiece but for what it is I liked it  thought it worked surprisingly well. Worth a watch especially if you like horror films. Not to be confused with either of the Ulli Lommel films The Boogeyman 1980 or it's sequels Boogeyman II 1983  Return of the Boogeyman 1994.".

	schema:reviewBody "Credit IMDb The script centers on a young woman with a longterm phobia of the bogeyman who voluntarily checks herself into a mental health facility with the hope of conquering her overwhelming fears. However much to her horror she discovers that some things are terrifying on purpose and confronting her demons was not the best course of action.Boogeyman 2 is a film I've seen twice now and have managed to enjoy each time just as much. It's not your typical lowbudget slasher junk it's actually quite polished for a DTV sequel. It gives us better character development then I've seen in most DTV sequels and not only that they are likable. Aside from a small couple of mentions this sequel is a complete stand alone and it is better for it. As I stated in my review for The Boogeyman 2005 I hated it with a passion so to say I appreciated this one's effort is an understatement. It throws in a surprisingly solid twist at the end throwing in plenty of suspense for it as well. I didn't see it coming nor did I expect it so kudos to the filmmakers for that. Only real complaint is I wish Henry Matt Cohen had a better background story as to why he was so screwed up. Solid suspense throughout good pace a couple of good scares and you have yourself a better then expected slasher.Performances. Danielle Savre is very solid as the lead. She's likable vulnerable but also strongwilled as well. She's the heart of the film and I was impressed by her poise. Matt Cohen is solid when he's on screen as Henry but sadly that isn't as much as I'd like. Christine Griffith is good as the chick with issues but with a heart underneath Michael Graziadei is good but a little too self centered for my liking. Rene O'Connor has a small part and did very well with what she had to do. Tobin Bell's presence alone is awesome itself and he took what could have been a onedimensional part and added some much needed layers to it.Bottom line. Far from original but I enjoyed myself very much with it. It's suspenseful well made and even somewhat stylish. Don't be put off by the title it's a good slasher. Recommended710".

	onyx:emotionText "Credit IMDb The script centers on a young woman with a longterm phobia of the bogeyman who voluntarily checks herself into a mental health facility with the hope of conquering her overwhelming fears. However much to her horror she discovers that some things are terrifying on purpose and confronting her demons was not the best course of action.Boogeyman 2 is a film I've seen twice now and have managed to enjoy each time just as much. It's not your typical lowbudget slasher junk it's actually quite polished for a DTV sequel. It gives us better character development then I've seen in most DTV sequels and not only that they are likable. Aside from a small couple of mentions this sequel is a complete stand alone and it is better for it. As I stated in my review for The Boogeyman 2005 I hated it with a passion so to say I appreciated this one's effort is an understatement. It throws in a surprisingly solid twist at the end throwing in plenty of suspense for it as well. I didn't see it coming nor did I expect it so kudos to the filmmakers for that. Only real complaint is I wish Henry Matt Cohen had a better background story as to why he was so screwed up. Solid suspense throughout good pace a couple of good scares and you have yourself a better then expected slasher.Performances. Danielle Savre is very solid as the lead. She's likable vulnerable but also strongwilled as well. She's the heart of the film and I was impressed by her poise. Matt Cohen is solid when he's on screen as Henry but sadly that isn't as much as I'd like. Christine Griffith is good as the chick with issues but with a heart underneath Michael Graziadei is good but a little too self centered for my liking. Rene O'Connor has a small part and did very well with what she had to do. Tobin Bell's presence alone is awesome itself and he took what could have been a onedimensional part and added some much needed layers to it.Bottom line. Far from original but I enjoyed myself very much with it. It's suspenseful well made and even somewhat stylish. Don't be put off by the title it's a good slasher. Recommended710";

Story starts off with 2 kids who see the death of their parents at the hands of the Boogeyman. Flash forward 10 years later and the kids are all grown up in a hospital trying to overcome their fears. Now anybody who has seen Nightmare on Elm Street 3 will instantly see the parallels of the two. The other patients have phobias and there is a circle group discussion etc. I was waiting for Freddy to show up and start hacking and slicing. Instead we get the Boogeyman who basically exploits everyones fear and kills them in that manner. So its like Freddy just not with the wisecracks. Now some might see some plot holes in it but they are not really that big if you don't make them out to be. Overall a good little movie with a decent looking Boogeyman and with some creative gory kills. Not bad but anybody who has seen Nightmare 3 will have noticed all this before. Still worth watching for fans of the genre.".

Yes I realize that plot description might cause cringing but it really isn't that hard a family film to sit through and the gorgeous snowy environs of Montana add something to the experience. Timothy Bottoms of The Last Picture Show  The Paper Chase is a bit much as a mean and nasty father who constantly nags and growls at his son Ozz Devon Graye Ozz would never not disappoint a father who won't even buy him a pair of gloves or let him ride in the cab of his truck because the wolfdog licked him! Bottoms is such a total asshole he's a caricature. Lloyd and Gade have really good chemistry as grandpa and granddaughter and Call of the Wild is used as a story he reads to her each night while she stays at his Montana home. Gade and the beautiful wolfdog bond over the duration as obvious for the plot to work while she also befriends a local young man named Jack Kameron Knox who races sled dogs against Ozz in contests. Jack also has a crush and vice versa on a local girl named Racy Aimee Teegarden who works the counter at an ice cream parlor. Bottoms' Mr. Heel insists after Ozz tells him about Buck the wolfdog named by Ry thanks to the Call of the Wild Jack London novel that he had temporary possession of it prior to an escape from his rope around its neck. So the sheriff played by Victoria Cartwright Alien agrees to a proposal by both parties to have Buck put up for grabs in a special sled race. So Ozz and Jack will compete for Buck with Gade lending her support to Buck's preparation Jack will train Buck to be his lead dog while Mr. Heel laughs off in mocking tone the sheer idea that it can be trained in two weeks. Wes Studi has the obligatory mystery native mountain man Gade kind of gets nervous around when he shows up in grandpa's Montana town. Studi's Hatcher seems a bit intimidating with his large Rambostyled hunting knife and serious face but there's a heart of gold there. Hatcher once had a wolfdog similar to Buck so if push comes to shove he might just be the right candidate as owner to Buck when Gade must return to Boston. The plot complications are slight and predictable and the characters have little shades of grey. Bottoms seems inhumane with little attributes on the positive side Graye has a bit of attitude shielding a hurt son hoping that his father will cut him some slack Lloyd remains a wholesome and supportive grandpa wanting his granddaughter to adjust to her surroundings while her parents are touring Europe and Gade is the little girl who at first resists Montana only to fall in love with her new pet and the area that lacks satellite television. Call of the Wild is sparingly used in the film but no one in the plot is roughing it too much. The Montana locations to me are the major stars while the story and characters cover the familiar ground with plenty of heart to spare. While I prefer the story and characters from the Jack London novel the Call of the Wild title does adhere slightly to this film in that Buck cannot control the kind of animal that it isthe wild does call to it. Joyce DeWitt of Three Company fame has a cameo as a neighbor of Hale's who complains that Buck ate two of her chickens soon storming off in anger because the feast has little evidence of proof.".

The 3D shows off the beautiful scenery and the story while somewhat predictable has fun tie ins to Jack London's book The Call of the Wild through Grandpa reading his granddaughter the story at night. It has a good message and the acting is really quite good. There are some cheesy parts and some eye roller lines but the kids thought it was wonderful and my wife and I found ourselves pleasantly entertained. Christopher Lloyd plays it pretty straight laced in this one but gives a good performance and we were impressed with Ariel Gade's performance. It really gave the story credibility.Overall an enjoyable family movie for the kids with just enough weight to keep mom and dad entertained as well.".

Darby smiles shakes Gray's hand and proceeds to walk to the car that will take her to her new location.... but no a handshake is just not enough not after what they'd been through... so she goes back and gives Gray a huge hug which he returns.  The mutual respect is there for all to see.  No words are spoken throughout the entire scene they are not necessary.Having read many of Grisham's books and seen all of the movies adapted from those books I wondered how The Pelican Brief would stack up against all the others in the long run.  In my opinion it is still the best of the bunch.My score a solid 10.".

It' a huge cast and everyone is perfectly suited for their role. It moves beautifully it flows like a movie should flow. I can't find any real flaw worth sharing. Just isn't there. I think it sets up Denzel Washington to continue in his escalating career as a wonderful character actor a huge movie star a big talent. Tony Goldwyn since GHOST has this tendency to play the 'bad guy' but what can I say he's good in this film too. Robert Culp I love his impossible character. Julia Roberts is wonderful as the young starryeyed law student who stumbles upon things bigger than anything she ever imagined. I loved every moment of the film. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys good solid film making. It should be used in teaching film  how to construct a story how to keep the story one step ahead of the audience making it suspenseful and exciting without having to resort to unnecessary violence or sex to make a movie work. It almost breaks through 'formula' scripts as suggested by the pundits who often don't have their finger on the pulse of what audiences want. It's one of the few films that when ever on television draws me in again and again and again!".

Pakula was a great director during the 70's his political thrillers such as The Parallax View '74 and All the President's Men '76 or the crime  thriller Klute '71 are among the best made in that decade but in the 80's besides Sophie's Choice '82 his career kind of tanked only saved by the critical and box office success of Presumed Innocent '90 starring Harrison Ford that made Pakula a relevant name again and based on his skill directing those political thriller films Warner Bros. offered him the chance to helm The Pelican Brief which he also produce and provided the screenplay.The story itself even if it was standard became confusing since the start due to badly edited sequences and the lack of information that was given to the viewer about what is happening on screen and who are those people involved in that situations with Pakula assuming that every moviegoer read the book. Scenes were randomly happening characters appear and disappear without proper development or explanation and the way Darby uncovers the truth surpassing the F.B.I. it's too farfetched.It didn't help that the pace is sluggish and the movie didn't involve amaze or even dare it's in fact dull and boring mostly of its length and feels like Pakula condensed half the book in some key scenes to get the storyline moving and the rest was just for showing the imposed by the Studio Julia Roberts in every scene and camera angle possible and imaginary and always with the same irritating expression. A bored looking Denzel was cast in a role that asked for a rich white man playing here second fiddle to a troubled protagonist like he did in Philadelphia the very same year but he was much better in that and refused the interracial love affair with Roberts like the characters in the book which was a good decision not because of the skin color but for the lack of onscreen chemistry between the two.The brilliant supporting cast are wasted here the late great Sam Shepard was given almost nothing to do John Heard  Stanley Tucci failed to leave an impression Robert Culp played his part too goofy to be the President of United States and only Tony Goldwin still in Ghost mode showed some signs of being awake.In short The Pelican Brief is a lifeless film directed by an once big name director far away from his glory days that feels more like a Julia Roberts' vehicle than an exciting political thriller. It may be one of the worst Grisham's adaptations to the big screen if you like the genre you rather watch The Firm The Client '94 or even A Time to Kill '96 because this one is a near waste of time...".

I can surmise however that from reading other Grisham novels it feels like it might be quite close. I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong.The storyline is fairly straightforward. Why were two Supreme Court Justices assassinated? Darby Shaw a curious law student Julia Roberts does a little research and writes a thesis on a possible reason. She shows it to her law professor boyfriend Sam Shepherd who in turn shows it to a colleague also a lawyer John Heard who works for the FBI. The professor is blown up in a planted car bomb and his friend is shot dead in a hotel room. And someone wants the student dead also. She goes on the run and eventually turns to Gray Grantham an investigative journalist Denzel Washington for help.This is a superb conspiracy movie within the genre of All the Presidents Men and In Defence of the Realm and although starting relatively slowly builds up the tension and is never dull. It has an excellent supporting cast featuring Robert Culp as the worried President what President isn't? with John Lithgow as Grantham's newspaper editor British character actor Nicholas Woodeson as an assassin and Stanley Tucci who gave such a wonderfully chilling performance as Adolph Eichmann in the British TV production Conspiracy is equally pragmatically chilling here as a hit man.There is a muted chemistry between the two leads which like the film although there is a little action never quite gets perhaps purposely to boiling point. It's all suitably and superbly played in a low key which helps to maintain a sinister element to the overall development of the plot.I suspect that The Pelican Brief is probably not to everyone's taste but I personally love it and given the oft modern corporate disregard for environmental matters is by no means implausible and indeed has the ring of truth about it.".

	schema:headline " Hohum adaptation still better than The Firm";
	schema:reviewBody "John Grisham's first couple of bestsellers  The Firm The Pelican Brief and The Client  were fairly lively pageturners but none of them received very strong adaptations to the big screen which is a true shame. The Firm especially was a total mess but The Pelican Brief is only slightly better.Two Supreme Court Justices have been assassinated. Tulane law student Julia Roberts compiles a brief which identifies a subtle link between the two which may have been the motivation for the assassinations. She does it as a lark not realizing that her mentor and sometime boyfriend Sam Shepard would pass it on as a document of interest to contacts in the government. Next thing she knows she is on the run from assassins and attempts on her life with only the help of idealistic journalist Denzel Washington.The story definitely requires some suspension of disbelief to get off the ground. In the novel it was possible because Grisham kept the pace nimble and kept the action moving. In the film the credibility issue stands out like a sore thumb largely because the pace is so sluggish. The lead character of Darby Shaw is so bland that it quite frankly does not seem possible for her to have conspired this brief nor that anyone would consider her much of a threat. Alan J.

Even worse Pakula has apparently instructed her to restrain her natural on screen ebullience which robs the part of much needed life. It is only towards the end that Roberts really seems to be enjoying herself on screen.It must have seemed like a great coup to cast Roberts opposite Washington but alas the two have zero chemistry together. With Roberts restrained close to passivity Washington goes all star turn and fails to connect at all with the other actors or his leading lady. Oftentimes it seems like he is reciting his lines directly to an audience rather than the people in the same scene an approach that wears thin quickly.There are no real surprises in the story and with a leaden first half the film falls well short of thriller status. Still it is a much better effort than Sydney Pollack's atrocious adaptation of The Firm and not as fatuous as Joel Schumacher's The Client. Grisham fans would still be welladvised to stick to the book.".

	onyx:emotionText "John Grisham's first couple of bestsellers  The Firm The Pelican Brief and The Client  were fairly lively pageturners but none of them received very strong adaptations to the big screen which is a true shame. The Firm especially was a total mess but The Pelican Brief is only slightly better.Two Supreme Court Justices have been assassinated. Tulane law student Julia Roberts compiles a brief which identifies a subtle link between the two which may have been the motivation for the assassinations. She does it as a lark not realizing that her mentor and sometime boyfriend Sam Shepard would pass it on as a document of interest to contacts in the government. Next thing she knows she is on the run from assassins and attempts on her life with only the help of idealistic journalist Denzel Washington.The story definitely requires some suspension of disbelief to get off the ground.

The message anyone against saving wildlife like the penguins has to be either crooked or a violent thug is preposterous.

Meanwhile Denzel Washington is given so little to do in the first hour to the point he is almost forgotten. Further it takes so long for us to actually discover what was written in the eponymous brief and for the leads to meet and agree to take action that the audience's desire to get to the bottom of the 'mystery' is definitely lessened.

Roberts and Washington do the job required of them but seem to treat it as little more than a day at the office  there is very little of the energy we have come to expect from Roberts or Washington in particular. The secondary roles are filled slightly better  John Lithgow in particular a standout newspaper editor and watch out for a very young Cynthia Nixon Miranda from Sex in the City as Julia Roberts' student friend.

There is little of the slickness the grit and pace characteristic of later John Grisham adaptations such as Runaway Jury.Legal thrillers about corrupt government prepared to kill to save their own position have been done so often and so often much better that little feels fresh about this Grisham adaptation to the extent that were it not for the presence of Alisters Roberts and Washington this film would have long been forgotten. As it is the film does not have enough thrills to save it from the fate of the DVD bargain basement bin.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Pelican Brief' is all about mood and atmosphere. There are a lot of hushed phone calls from people who offer tantalizing bits of information and clues before changing their minds and deciding not to say anything else. Then they are usually killed anyway. They might as well have spilled the beans. I had a hard time keeping up with who got killed and what their relationship to the plot was. They all seem to be blandlooking middleaged white men with pudgy tummies and receding hairlines. But I could be wrong about that. Anyway it's a good thing 'The Pelican Brief' is so sombre and sneaky and foreboding. Once the truth is finally exposed and brought out into the open it's not terribly interesting. A rich oilman wants to drill for oil in Louisiana. In order to do that he has to kill a couple of Supreme Court justices so their successors will rule in his favor. Oh and the brown pelicans of Louisiana's coast will be wiped out as a result too. I don't know I think if I was in this movie I'd be one of the bad guys. I'd rather drill for the oil than worry about the brown pelicans. And didn't FDR have a courtpacking scheme of his own? Of course he didn't kill anybody. That we know of. Director Alan Pakula certainly makes the most of what he has to work with here by keeping the suspense level high and by keeping our interest period. I've read several of John Grisham's books but this isn't one of them from the evidence presented here I'd guess it's one of his lesser works. Denzel Washington plays Gray Grantham does that sound like a superhero's alter ego or what? a Washington journalist in a quietly authoritative manner. It's as if he dares anyone to question his honor. He is the epitome of journalistic integrity if that's not an oxymoron. Were it not for Washington's considerable acting skills his character would simply be too good to be true. He comes to the aid of Darby Shaw played by Julia Roberts. In keeping with the film's quiet and suspicious nature Roberts portrays Shaw as smart but increasingly paranoid which is understandable as she is pursued by quite a few of those middleaged white men who work for the President or the FBI or the CIA or some oil cartel... I was never quite clear on that either. It is an effective performance. I suppose part of the fun of reviewing a film like 'The Pelican Brief' is poking holes or attempting to in the plot's logic. For instance I found it rather difficult to believe that the aforementioned intelligence agencies and assorted bad guys could not capture or kill the Darby Shaw character. She stays in various motels and hotels using her own credit cards they spy on her they tap her phone but by golly they never can seem to get their hands on her. She always outruns them or ducks into a crowd or jumps in Grantham's car at just the right moment. I know this is standard issue stuff for a political intriguemurder mystery but it really sticks out here as improbable. It's almost as if they stop chasing her after eight p.m. so she can get a good night's sleep. There is a funny moment too though I don't think it's intentional during one of those many hushed phone conversations Shaw calls Grantham to give him some tidbits of information and when he tries to find out more she says Don't ask me any questions. Grantham gets a confused look on his face and says quite logically Hey YOU called ME. In that moment he has become a surrogate for the film audience. So kudos to Pakula Roberts and Washington for keeping things fairly exciting and interesting almost to the end 'The Pelican Brief' does peter out as it reaches its conclusion. Still it could have been a lot worse.".

Tying the mysterious deaths to a toplevel coverup a Washington Post reporter Denzel Washington teams up with Darby to crack the case. They follow the trail that takes them across the country and eventually brings them to the home of a dead lawyer. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. borrowing elements of more deservedly remembered Alan Pakula movies like All the President's Men and Parallax View Brief is utterly contrived. It's not as inspired as it is clearly dependent on the cynicism of a jaded public for our leaders and the law. When you look past this flick's slim thrills and its laughable message nothing left makes sense. The script tosses in a highpriced hitman Stanley Tucci only to dispatch him quickly. Others eliminate their enemies with wellplaced car bombs. We're supposed to believe that guys who are expert in killing people without raising suspicions will rely on big loud car bombs going off on public streets in front of everybody and of course they can kill just about anybody but a crusading journalist and a law student? We're also supposed to believe that Darby's brief based on unsubstantiated suppositions is enough to warrant her death  you'd think that those with power are smart enough to know that most routinely dismiss conspiracy theories for that reason. Like all socalled thrillers this one isn't solved  once the story runs out of steam the script merely dredges up somebody who can explain all. Brief is typical of modern thrillers populated by brilliant characters who nevertheless never actually do any detective work  virtually all relying on some mysterious stranger to walk out of the gloaming with all of the answers. Over two hours of overwrought tension aren't enough to match the detectivesmarts you'll get in a single halfhour of Scooby Doo. The final insult is the leaden seriousness that Pakula bathes the script in. We not only have to believe this flick we have to believe IN it. What's impossible to believe is how the Pelican Brief poses any danger at all. You'd think that a cabal of rich rightwingers could afford to do a better job than a law student could uncover. You'd also think that had Shaw been brilliant enough to solve the mystery she would have been smart enough to realize the danger it posed her  illustrating the modern thriller's other big failing its reliance on characters who are gifted and brilliant but never all that smart.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film on a Saturday evening at a prime time hour. It was reportedly an edgy sort of thriller with Julia Roberts and Denzil Washington who apparently gave excellent performances. I was looking forward to it with some suspense. And that suspense was just about the only suspense I got. I don't remember the length of the film but it felt like well over 4 days and it was not time well spent. This has to have been the only film I have seen where virtually nothing happened. Julia Roberts was unusually irritating throughout Denzil Washington's character was hollow and watching it from beginning to end made me feel like I was watching a yearlong golf tournament.

	onyx:emotionText "I watched this film on a Saturday evening at a prime time hour. It was reportedly an edgy sort of thriller with Julia Roberts and Denzil Washington who apparently gave excellent performances. I was looking forward to it with some suspense. And that suspense was just about the only suspense I got. I don't remember the length of the film but it felt like well over 4 days and it was not time well spent. This has to have been the only film I have seen where virtually nothing happened. Julia Roberts was unusually irritating throughout Denzil Washington's character was hollow and watching it from beginning to end made me feel like I was watching a yearlong golf tournament. I nearly fell asleep several times and my overall reaction was that the film simply was a failure. Failure to convince deliver or provide any entertainment or suspense whatsoever.210  and it can count itself lucky to have got that";

Pakula the man responsible for ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN 1976. The near documentary realism of that earlier film has been replaced by Hollywood gloss and contrivance as two of Tinseltown's brightest stars follow a trail of clues to their inevitable conclusion. Pakula's own script thankfully refrains from indulging a romance between Roberts and Washington but there isn't much chemistry between them either as they rush headlong from one scene to the next seeking answers to a complex mystery. Unfortunately the buildup of details isn't nearly as exciting as the film presumes and the punishing 141 minute running time simply adds unnecessary baggage to an already convoluted storyline. Pakula takes advantage of his lavish budget by staging most of the major setpieces within large crowds of people but there are few surprises in either the script or its execution and the happy ending is never in doubt. On the plus side however the film is distinguished by a powerhouse supporting cast of reliable talent Sam Shepard John Heard Robert Culp John Lithgow Hume Cronyn James B. Sikking Stanley Tucci William Atherton etc.. Production values are excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen other movies made from John Grisham novels The Client 1994  and The Firm 1993. I would say this is on a par with those movies and is typical of the mass market thriller genre. For me it's like watching TV or an airline movie the treatment is predictable the plot includes a lot of unlikely action morphed out by various CIA FBI and other serious types according to the general expectation of the audience on a simplistic level with some creativity but certainly nothing original. This is a movie for a tired CEO to fall asleep to. Yet it stars Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington with an interesting cast that includes the very talented Sam Shepherd. Alan J. Pakula who directed and penned the script from Grisham's novel has a number of important movies to his directorial credit including All the President's Men 1976 and Sophie's Choice 1982 and some as a producer most notably the celebrated To Kill a Mockingbird 1962. So what happened here?Just the usual gravitation toward the mean. If you make a movie aimed at a mass audience what's the point of doing anything they wouldn't appreciate anyway? Roberts and Washington are here for their star power not because of their considerable acting talent. Yet perhaps inspired by one another they both give strong performances that carry the movie and make this definitely worth watching.Julia Roberts plays a Tulane law student who gets an idea about who assassinated two Supreme Court justices and why and she writes a brief about it the Pelican Brief. We see her deep in the stacks at the library doing research sporting several hairdos at a little table under various lighting changes so that we know its daytime and then night etc. a clear device about as original as the pages flying off a calender. Tulane law professor Thomas Callahan Sam Shepherd is her mentor and bed mate. She's twentyfour and he's about forty but a girl can learn a lot from such a man and he's warm and loving. Nonetheless we are scratching our head about this match up especially when he begins drinking heavily one of the justices was his mentor and we know now for sure he's not in love. Well the guy that gets Julia Roberts sure as heck can't be wishy washy about his love for her we know that.We are also scratching our head because Denzel Washington the ace of spades of leading men an actor of power and accomplishment is usually found in more serious venues a guy who's played Steve Biko apartheid victim and martyr in Cry Freedom 1987 and Malcolm X in Malcolm X 1992. So what's he doing in this midbrow flick? He plays a beltway reporter right out of the annals of the Bernstein and Woodward legend but there is little real acting for him to do. So why is he here? It's to play opposite Julia Roberts of course! So what we have here is a very expensive entertainment starring two real actors. I wonder how much money it made considering what they had to pay Grisham Roberts and Washington. Surely the subplot has to be romantic. How IS Hollywood going to play the racially mixed duo? Inquiring minds want to know. Hint with great subtlety.Julia is running since the bad guys are after her. Notice that the plot conveniently gets rid of the too old for her guy. Try not to notice the other contrivances the mysterious guy in the background who appears at exactly the last moment for example. Just as one of the bad guys is about to blow our Julia away he somehow blows the hit man awayby the way getting blood on our girl. It's enough to mention one plot contrivance per review unless it's unusually bad but there are others. Well Julia's getting the picture and it's pretty scary. She's on the phone as she's running from hotel to hotel spending cash instead of using traceable credit cards. She can't trust anybody. Even the president of the United States is suspect played incidentally with a kind of glee by Robert Culp as though impersonating Ronnie Reagan halfway into his dementia. Strange thing Julia actually thinks you are supposed to really ACT in a thriller! Denzel knows better managing a kind of controlled emotion throughout saying as little as possible using his eyes and making a lot out of silence which is something an accomplished actor does when the script doesn't give him sparkling lines. Julia really does look scared her face rubbery with a mean crease down the middle of her forehead. Watching just her one could mistake this for an artsysmartsy serious flick. Not to worry. There are some nice explosions and plenty of chases and all sorts of shadowy red herrings lurking about.Bottom line If this is your genre and you've just got to get away from that pile of papers you brought home to work on go for it. This is standard issue escapist fare true but the stars really do shine.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming at the end of the decade in 1950  which effectively ended Hollywood's much cherished Golden Age  was MGM's THE ASPHALT JUNGLE. A superbly structured gritty crime drama it was one of the last of the great Noir thrillers. Produced for the studio by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a novel by W.R. Burnett it was beautifully written for the screen by Ben Maddow and John Huston and outstandingly directed by Huston. The assembled cast couldn't be better even down to the smallest parts such as Ray Teal turning up as a patrolling policeman. The picture is notable also for an early appearance of Marilyn Monroe as the kittenish ingenue of shady lawyer Louis Calhern. Stylishly photographed in stunning black  white by Harold Rosson THE ASPHALT JUNGLE has joined the ranks alongside The Killers 1946 and Out Of The Past 1947 as the finest Noir ever made.An old time criminal Doc Redinschneider Sam Jaffe has just been released from prison and has devised a plan for the perfect caper I could sell it on the open market for 100000. He approaches a small time racing fixer Cobby a brilliant Marc Lawrence who in turn arranges with dishonest lawyer Alonzo Emmerich Calhern to finance the heist of a million dollar diamond haul from a major jewellery firm. Emmerich is also to act as a fence to offload the gems. Hired is expert safecracker Louis Ciavelli Anthony Caruso the humpback Gus James Whitmore as the driver and a small time hoodlum Dix Handley Sterling Hayden as the group's strong arm. The robbery itself is a success a riveting intense sequence but things start to go terribly wrong. First Ciavelli is accidentally shot and then Emmerich along with an accomplice an impressive Brad Dexter attempt a double cross which is thwarted by Dix after a shootout. With the loot now just so much junk Reidinschneider and Dix must go on the run. The movie culminates with Emmerich committing suicide Redinschneider Cobby and Gus being arrested and ends with the fatally wounded Dix making a dash out of the city to reach his family farm in the country.Performances are terrific! Hayden was never better and only came close to matching this portrayal six years later in Kubrick's brilliant The Killing 1956. Outstanding also is Sam Jaffe as the master criminal Louis Calhern as the crooked lawyer Marc Lawrence as the fixer I always sweat when I count money  it's the way I am and John McIntire as the determined Police Commissioner. All things considered THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is probably the most perfectly cast film ever. The only minor disappointment is the sparse music score by the great Miklos Rozsa. There is a splendid dramatic main title and continues after the credits for a short while but then no more music is heard until the final six or seven minutes of the picture when there is a hectic rhythmic orchestral statement to accompany the mortally wounded Dix and his frantic drive to his family's farm. Then as he reaches home collapses and lays dying in a pasture the music segues into a reflective melodic theme for the end title. The lack of a full score however is but a minor quibble and does little to alter the fact that THE ASPHALT JUNGLE remains an exercise in meticulous motion picture making.".

It might even have passed Double Indemnity for the number one spot. It's that good.For anyone who has not seen it the poster art and the videoDVD cover are both misleading. They usually feature Marilyn Monroe in publicizing this movie but she only has a small role. Many times they feature Monroe Jean Hagen and Sterling Hayden all together....and those three are never on screen at the same time. My point being what you see on the outside is not what's on the inside.Hayden is the star of the film but Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern are not far behind. In fact the more I watch this film the more I see the latter two as the real stars here and I especially have begun to appreciate the great acting by Calhern in here.Actually everyone performs at a very high level. The diverse and interesting characters are really fun to watch one of the big reasons I rate this film so high. Hayden with his big body and tough demeanor was perfect for film noir. He is a legitimate tough guy nobody to fool with. Jaffe was fascinating as the little German doctor but until I got the DVD and put on the English subtitles I never understood all his dialog which is terrific and Doc is my favorite character in this film. Kudos also go to James Whitmore and Marc Lawrence for great supporting role performances.The two women Hagen and Monroe also do their bits nicely. I never understood people who criticized Monroe's acting. I thought she was pretty good right from the start with this film as an example. I also liked seeing her thin and in shape. This movie is a gritty tough nononsense crime story concerning a jewel robbery where things go wrong and eventually does everybody in. Actually it isn't just a botched robbery that ruins some of them  it's character weakness from greed to sexual lust.You reap what you sow could be a moral of this story.".

	schema:headline " Film Noir in Full Force";
	schema:reviewBody "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE epitomizes Film Noir. It's dark grim and it's not afraid to show us seedy downandout characters who are nevertheless complex and deeply human. This film has men and women who inhabit the underworld that 'city under the city'. Most of their needs are spelled out and the backgrounds are painted in memorable detail. We see little men like Cobby the late Marc Lawrence in a sweaty realistic performance and Gus James Whitmore a woman with nothing but a romantic illusion to cling to the great Jean Hagen as Doll men whose lives have been crippled by crime and who persevere only through their own follyladen dreams Doc who sets it all in motion expertly played by Sam Jaffe and Dix Sterling Hayden. There is also familyman safecracker Louis Ciavelli Anthony Caruso whose motivations are understandable to us all and whose desperation is painful to watch at times. While Dix is often seen as the central protagonist in JUNGLE he really shares that position with Alonzo Emmerich. Emmerich is a corrupt lawyer a formerly wealthy urbane man reduced to the same doomed schemes as his cohorts men to whom he feels superior and whom he ultimately intends to doublecross. Emmerich is almost tragic in the Greek or Shakespearean mold he has farther to fall than Dix and the rest but he has already met the ground halfway as the film begins. He's broke and no more debts can be called in to support the new scheme. Unlike the younger men who could possibly take other paths there is really nowhere for him to go but down. Emmerich's scenesrendered immortal by Louis Calhern's performance the greatest in the filmare the most interestingly complex. He pretends he is smarter than everyone else but he knows that hubris has brought his life past the crisis point. He is painfully aware that neither the money from the stolen jewels nor the foolish romantic escape with his mistress Marilyn Monroe will ever redeem him. The robbery sequence around which the film ostensibly revolves is very brief and anticlimactic. This is surely Huston's intention it's all over in a few minutes and nobody actually gets what they want. The stolen jewels are brought to Emmerich and a violent scene leads to a foil of the rich man's doublecrossing scheme. In the end everyone can see that this particular gleaming treasurelike the gold dust in TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE or the 'black bird' in THE MALTESE FALCONis ultimately worthless the jewels are too hot and no one dares fence them. So Doc ends up with most of them in his black bag. He begins pursuit of his dream of a tropical isle surrounded with dancing girls and ends up in a roadside bar where he feeds nickels into a jukebox as a pretty teenager bops around for him. The waiting cops close in quickly and all is over for Doc. Emmerich too is soon caught. The alibi plan with the mistress doesn't hold water. And the police make a direct connection to him and his dead henchman Brannom Brad Dexter. Making short work of it he goes into his private office and shoots himself in the head.Other characters meet their ends behind bars Cobby and Gus or with ironic justice corrupt detective Barry Kelley who tries to play both sides or in death Ciavelli. At the close of the film we are left with a mortally wounded Dix driving toward his dreamedof horse farm. At his side is the faithful Doll who knows the jig is up. Dix has never given up his illusions where the other characters probably never believed their own. He dies with poetic rightness in a field surrounded by curious horses as poor Doll is left to her own devices. The film which opened on a dim stretch of urban asphalt closes on a sunny rural vision.What makes THE ASPHALT JUNGLE a great Film Noir? The wide array of doomed characters and a persistent feeling of encroaching doom go a long way to take it in that direction. In this way the film exemplifies the strong fatalism that is essential to Noir. Along the way we hear some of the most intelligent yet convincing dialog in all of Noir by Huston and Ben Maddow characters who sound real who say what someone might actually say or be thinking. This realism is enhanced by the look of the film starkly yet vividly shot in blackandwhite by Harold Rosson. It's worth noting that Rosson uses some sophisticated camera techniques such as deep focus and and the extreme foregrounding of a single character. If while watching the viewer imagines a Bmovie version of this story with conventional camera work and a lackluster cast and script the greatness of THE ASPHALT JUNGLE becomes even more evident. The consummate technical work and artistry involved elevate the film far above any genre or pulp limitations. Underlining the bleakness of Huston's vision right from the opening credits is the music score by Miklos Rozsa who also scored CRISS CROSS in a departure from from his scores for DOUBLE INDEMNITY and SPELLBOUND Rozsa places his cues sparingly. The score only calls attention to itself under the main titles and during Dix's wild death ride. As for the robbery scene Rozsa provides no music for it and dialog is minimal. While it's far briefer we can see this scene as the true precursor of the robbery scene in Jules Dassin's RIFIFI 1955 famed for its nearly complete silence. But John Huston himself may deserve the lion's share of credit for this film.

	onyx:emotionText "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE epitomizes Film Noir. It's dark grim and it's not afraid to show us seedy downandout characters who are nevertheless complex and deeply human. This film has men and women who inhabit the underworld that 'city under the city'. Most of their needs are spelled out and the backgrounds are painted in memorable detail. We see little men like Cobby the late Marc Lawrence in a sweaty realistic performance and Gus James Whitmore a woman with nothing but a romantic illusion to cling to the great Jean Hagen as Doll men whose lives have been crippled by crime and who persevere only through their own follyladen dreams Doc who sets it all in motion expertly played by Sam Jaffe and Dix Sterling Hayden. There is also familyman safecracker Louis Ciavelli Anthony Caruso whose motivations are understandable to us all and whose desperation is painful to watch at times. While Dix is often seen as the central protagonist in JUNGLE he really shares that position with Alonzo Emmerich. Emmerich is a corrupt lawyer a formerly wealthy urbane man reduced to the same doomed schemes as his cohorts men to whom he feels superior and whom he ultimately intends to doublecross. Emmerich is almost tragic in the Greek or Shakespearean mold he has farther to fall than Dix and the rest but he has already met the ground halfway as the film begins. He's broke and no more debts can be called in to support the new scheme. Unlike the younger men who could possibly take other paths there is really nowhere for him to go but down. Emmerich's scenesrendered immortal by Louis Calhern's performance the greatest in the filmare the most interestingly complex. He pretends he is smarter than everyone else but he knows that hubris has brought his life past the crisis point. He is painfully aware that neither the money from the stolen jewels nor the foolish romantic escape with his mistress Marilyn Monroe will ever redeem him. The robbery sequence around which the film ostensibly revolves is very brief and anticlimactic. This is surely Huston's intention it's all over in a few minutes and nobody actually gets what they want. The stolen jewels are brought to Emmerich and a violent scene leads to a foil of the rich man's doublecrossing scheme. In the end everyone can see that this particular gleaming treasurelike the gold dust in TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE or the 'black bird' in THE MALTESE FALCONis ultimately worthless the jewels are too hot and no one dares fence them. So Doc ends up with most of them in his black bag. He begins pursuit of his dream of a tropical isle surrounded with dancing girls and ends up in a roadside bar where he feeds nickels into a jukebox as a pretty teenager bops around for him. The waiting cops close in quickly and all is over for Doc. Emmerich too is soon caught. The alibi plan with the mistress doesn't hold water. And the police make a direct connection to him and his dead henchman Brannom Brad Dexter. Making short work of it he goes into his private office and shoots himself in the head.Other characters meet their ends behind bars Cobby and Gus or with ironic justice corrupt detective Barry Kelley who tries to play both sides or in death Ciavelli. At the close of the film we are left with a mortally wounded Dix driving toward his dreamedof horse farm. At his side is the faithful Doll who knows the jig is up. Dix has never given up his illusions where the other characters probably never believed their own. He dies with poetic rightness in a field surrounded by curious horses as poor Doll is left to her own devices. The film which opened on a dim stretch of urban asphalt closes on a sunny rural vision.What makes THE ASPHALT JUNGLE a great Film Noir? The wide array of doomed characters and a persistent feeling of encroaching doom go a long way to take it in that direction. In this way the film exemplifies the strong fatalism that is essential to Noir. Along the way we hear some of the most intelligent yet convincing dialog in all of Noir by Huston and Ben Maddow characters who sound real who say what someone might actually say or be thinking. This realism is enhanced by the look of the film starkly yet vividly shot in blackandwhite by Harold Rosson. It's worth noting that Rosson uses some sophisticated camera techniques such as deep focus and and the extreme foregrounding of a single character. If while watching the viewer imagines a Bmovie version of this story with conventional camera work and a lackluster cast and script the greatness of THE ASPHALT JUNGLE becomes even more evident. The consummate technical work and artistry involved elevate the film far above any genre or pulp limitations. Underlining the bleakness of Huston's vision right from the opening credits is the music score by Miklos Rozsa who also scored CRISS CROSS in a departure from from his scores for DOUBLE INDEMNITY and SPELLBOUND Rozsa places his cues sparingly. The score only calls attention to itself under the main titles and during Dix's wild death ride. As for the robbery scene Rozsa provides no music for it and dialog is minimal. While it's far briefer we can see this scene as the true precursor of the robbery scene in Jules Dassin's RIFIFI 1955 famed for its nearly complete silence. But John Huston himself may deserve the lion's share of credit for this film. Taking the advice of an older director he had known possibly Josef Von Sternberg? he directs each scene as if it were the most important one in the film. This gives every scene its own sense of urgency and keeps a consistent tone making the film one long tragic descent into doom.";

Not that I'm saying they're rip offs they're not but they are kind of three excellent variations on Huston's theme. 'The Asphalt Jungle' must therefore be seen as the most influential crime movie of the modern era and the blueprint for every subsequent caper movie 'The Anderson Tapes' 'Thief' 'Reservoir Dogs' 'The Usual Suspects' 'The Score'etc.etc. This superb film noir is almost impossible to fault. The script is first rate John Huston's direction is inspired Sterling Hayden  possibly America's most underrated actor  is fantastic as troubled excon Dix Handley and the ensemble cast are all excellent especially James Whitmore 'Them!' Louis Calhern 'Notorious' Sam Jaffe 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' and John McIntire 'Psycho'. The early role for Marilyn Monroe made a strong impact on a lot of people but I was even more impressed by Jean Hagen as Doll. She is unforgettable and her scenes with Hayden are wonderful. Why did she never become a major star? This is a crime classic and brilliant entertainment. Highly recommended!".

The power in the characters that John Huston brings to life is so vivid and you root for them yet you never forget they are criminals.Sam Jaffe a cool and calculating planner brings a scheme to big time lawyer Louis Calhern about a jewel robbery. Calhern is a criminal attorney who really does work both sides of the fence. But he's also got some high living expenses and a young mistress in the shape of Marilyn Monroe in the first film that got her notice. Jaffe needs three to help pull off the job a safe cracker a driver and a strong arm guy a 'hooligan' as he calls it. Calhern provides them in the persons of Anthony Caruso James Whitmore and Sterling Hayden.You wouldn't think it but Jaffe and Hayden bond in this. The educated criminal mastermind and a man who might not have finished grade school. Jaffe sees in Hayden a reliable sort.Sterling Hayden did not think too much of most of the actionadventure stuff he did but he liked The Asphalt Jungle as well he should. He's a country kid his nickname is 'Dix' short for Dixie. His family owned a farm and bad luck hit them as it did so many in The Great Depression. Hayden turns to criminal enterprise because his skills for making an honest living are limited. His biggest accomplishment is having a B girl from a clip joint fall hard for him in the person of Jean Hagen. Both of their characterizations ring well and true dare I say it sterling performances.Of course after the job is done fallible and corrupt human beings like bookmaker Marc Lawrence corrupt police lieutenant Barry Kelley strong arm man Brad Dexter and Calhern himself bring the whole thing crashing down. One of the reasons you root so hard for the criminals to succeed is the magnificent and unheralded performance of John McIntire as the police commissioner. Imagine if Charles Laughton as Inspector Javert had not gotten so tangled up in searching for Jean Valjean and rose to become the head of the Surete in France. You've got McIntire. I don't think any honest cop has been made so unpleasant on the screen before or since. At one point he's telling the press that he'll get Hayden and Hayden is a callous brute. The most callous person in the cast is McIntire and we go through 112 minutes of The Asphalt Jungle and know how very human Sterling Hayden is.Sam Jaffe got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but lost to George Sanders in All About Eve. The film itself got three other nominations including for Huston as Best Director. It had the bad luck to run up against another classic film in All About Eve in it's own way as cynical a film as The Asphalt Jungle.John Huston took a cast and got perfect performances out of the lot of them and The Asphalt Jungle holds up every bit over fifty years later. Should really be seen beside Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas to get a full appreciation for today's generation.".

	schema:headline " Experience has taught me never to trust a policeman. Just when you think one's all right he turns legit.";
	schema:reviewBody "Out of MGM The Asphalt Jungle is directed by John Huston and based on the novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett. It stars Sterling Hayden Jean Hagen Sam Jaffe Louis Calhern James Whitmore Teresa Celli and in a minor but important role Marilyn Monroe. Mikls Rzsa scores the music and Harold Rosson photographs it in black  white. Plot sees Erwin Doc Riedenschneider Jaffe leave prison and quickly assemble a gang to execute a long in gestation jewellery heist. However with suspicion rife and fate waiting to take a hand the carefully constructed caper starts to come apart at the seams.John Huston liked a tough movie having given film noir in America a jump start with The Maltese Falcon in 1941 he also that same year adapted W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra. Burnett also had on his CV crime classic stories Little Caesar  Scarface so it's no surprise that Huston was drawn to The Asphalt Jungle. As it turned out it was a match made in gritty urban heaven.The Asphalt Jungle was one of the first crime films to break with convention and tell its story from the side of the criminals. Where once the pursuing law officersprivate detectives were the heavy part of the plotting now under Huston's crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminalsvillainsantiheroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters yet they have a common bond they strive for a better life. Be it Hayden's luggish Dix who dreams of buying back his father's horse ranch back in Kentucky or Jaffe's Doc who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls it's greed and yearning that binds them together. With alienation and bleakness in true film noir traditions featuring heavily as the plot and gang unravels.With gritty dialogue and oozing a naturalistic feel it's also no surprise that Huston's movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good some bad but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence here. Fabulous in its authenticity and with that out of the way it sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the gang including their respective women Hagen Monroe  Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either. This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate with a finale that is as perfect as it gets in this most wonderful of film genres. 9.510".

	onyx:emotionText "Out of MGM The Asphalt Jungle is directed by John Huston and based on the novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett. It stars Sterling Hayden Jean Hagen Sam Jaffe Louis Calhern James Whitmore Teresa Celli and in a minor but important role Marilyn Monroe. Mikls Rzsa scores the music and Harold Rosson photographs it in black  white. Plot sees Erwin Doc Riedenschneider Jaffe leave prison and quickly assemble a gang to execute a long in gestation jewellery heist. However with suspicion rife and fate waiting to take a hand the carefully constructed caper starts to come apart at the seams.John Huston liked a tough movie having given film noir in America a jump start with The Maltese Falcon in 1941 he also that same year adapted W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra. Burnett also had on his CV crime classic stories Little Caesar  Scarface so it's no surprise that Huston was drawn to The Asphalt Jungle. As it turned out it was a match made in gritty urban heaven.The Asphalt Jungle was one of the first crime films to break with convention and tell its story from the side of the criminals. Where once the pursuing law officersprivate detectives were the heavy part of the plotting now under Huston's crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminalsvillainsantiheroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters yet they have a common bond they strive for a better life. Be it Hayden's luggish Dix who dreams of buying back his father's horse ranch back in Kentucky or Jaffe's Doc who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls it's greed and yearning that binds them together. With alienation and bleakness in true film noir traditions featuring heavily as the plot and gang unravels.With gritty dialogue and oozing a naturalistic feel it's also no surprise that Huston's movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good some bad but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence here. Fabulous in its authenticity and with that out of the way it sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the gang including their respective women Hagen Monroe  Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either. This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate with a finale that is as perfect as it gets in this most wonderful of film genres. 9.510";

The magnificent cinematography created by Harold Rosson speaks by itself. The music score by Miklos Rozsa stays in the background and never interferes with the action.This is a film that looks as good today as when it first was released. In fact one discovers more nuances as one watches it again when it's shown on cable. The cast of the film is one of its best assets going for The Asphalt Jungle. Mr. Huston assembled some of the best talent working in the American cinema of that time.Sterling Hayden as Dix gives a tremendous performance. The excellent Louis Calhern though steals the picture with his take on Lon Emmerich the man who finds he is broke and wants to be at the center of the caper without risking anything. Marilyn Monroe has only two scenes in the movie but she shines in them. Also Jean Hagen an actress that should have gone far but didn't makes a valuable contribution with her Doll Conovan.The supporting cast is amazing. James Whitmore Sam Jaffe Anthony Caruso Brad Dexter and the rest play well together to give the film a seamless look.The Asphalt Jungle shows why John Huston was one of the most influential men in pictures. His films are a must see for all movie lovers and studied by his successors and people working today owe a lot to this master who pioneered a style that stands as his legacy.".

If I am right this shows how much the movie industry has to rely on big names. Sometimes this is a real shame. No movie proves this better than Asphalt Jungle.This caper movie is one of my all time favorites and frankly the best of its genre. Its brilliance lies for me in the fact that no big name of the Hollywood acting community was involved  Monroe was small fries then. Instead John Huston worked with a cast of reliable mostly very experienced character actors many people will know as supports from numerous other movies of the period. And many of those actors probably gave here the best performances of their lives. Everybody is cast dead right this is what is so magnificent about Asphalt Jungle. The balance is perfect the chemistry works all ways. Maybe just one miscast actor or actress would have spoiled the whole atmosphere. No one is overacting at any time and there are many many very moving moments as one can observe these characters struggling on the sidelines of urban society.One is always tempted to name an actress or an actor whose performance one liked best in a movie. Here I could not do it  I liked them all. Yet I want to mention one actor Louis Calhern. Seldom has a sudden change of mood and countenance in a character had such an impact on me as a viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE comes close to being the best film of the film noir style. A study of a complex well planned jewelry robbery that is destroyed by double crosses it is a model for later films like THE KILLING RIFIFI TOPKAPI and THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Sterling Hayden Jean Hagen Sam Jaffe whose sole mistake is giving into a weakness to watch pretty young girls dance for too long Louis Calhern whose death scene is shattering Marc Lawrence and Marilyn Monroe all did first rate work under John Huston's direction. For these reasons alone I recommend the film.But I can't avoid commenting on one irony that Huston and his screenplay writers including W. R. Burnett may have intentionally included. John McIntyre plays the local Police Commissioner Hardy who comes across as a hardnosed S.O.B. fully pushing law and order as the safety of the community. He has tightened down on the town making the plans for the robbery more difficult. When a policeman is shot in the escape of the thieves McIntyre goes ballistic guaranteeing that the criminals are really going to be captured.And no real revelation here they are. But what is ironic is the smug selfcongratulatory way McIntyre tells the media about the triumph of the police and law and order over the criminals  which he fully takes credit for. This triumph involved several crooked cops beating up on at least one suspect. And when I say crooked the one in charge of the beating knew about the robbery. That officer Lt. Det. Ditrich  Barry Kelly is seen standing just in back of McIntyre during the news conference! McIntyre for all of his selfcongratulating and selfpublicity is still a puppet himself of the very corruption he claims he is conquering.To me that moment near the conclusion of the film is one of the most realistic bits in all film noir. How successful can we be in conquering crime? How can we be when depend upon it by not asking too many questions that should be asked?".

For these reasons alone I recommend the film.But I can't avoid commenting on one irony that Huston and his screenplay writers including W. R. Burnett may have intentionally included. John McIntyre plays the local Police Commissioner Hardy who comes across as a hardnosed S.O.B. fully pushing law and order as the safety of the community. He has tightened down on the town making the plans for the robbery more difficult. When a policeman is shot in the escape of the thieves McIntyre goes ballistic guaranteeing that the criminals are really going to be captured.And no real revelation here they are. But what is ironic is the smug selfcongratulatory way McIntyre tells the media about the triumph of the police and law and order over the criminals  which he fully takes credit for. This triumph involved several crooked cops beating up on at least one suspect. And when I say crooked the one in charge of the beating knew about the robbery. That officer Lt. Det. Ditrich  Barry Kelly is seen standing just in back of McIntyre during the news conference! McIntyre for all of his selfcongratulating and selfpublicity is still a puppet himself of the very corruption he claims he is conquering.To me that moment near the conclusion of the film is one of the most realistic bits in all film noir. How successful can we be in conquering crime? How can we be when depend upon it by not asking too many questions that should be asked?";

	schema:reviewBody "It was only a few weeks ago that I described 'Du rififi chez les hommes 1955' as the film that pioneered the traditional crime caper carving a narrative mould that would continue to be reused in films of its sort for decades to come. While Jules Dassin's picture is undoubtedly the finest in a subgenre affectionately known as the heist flick I have now discovered that the concept stretches back at least another five years to one of Hollywood's most revered adventure directors John Huston. Revealing a seedy underbelly of society overflowing with smarmy criminal figures and crooked authorities the film is a potent filmnoir thriller employing dark shadowy blackandwhite cinematography and a selection of suitably sordid characters whose greed obsession and violent temperaments ultimately lead to their own demise. The film's success would trigger a considerable boom in the popularity of heist thrillers most notably in Crichton's 'The Lavender Hill Mob 1951' Dassin's 'Rififi 1955' Mackendrick's 'The Ladykillers 1955' and Kubrick's breakthrough picture 'The Killing 1956' which also starred Sterling Hayden.Recentlyreleased criminal mastermind Doc Erwin Riedenschneider Sam Jaffe has for the last seven years of his incarceration protected the plans for the most ambitious and profitable heist of his distinguished career. He arrives in a dreary smoggy crimeridden city where lowlifes patrol the darkened streets and law officers some honest and some crooked do their best to control the escalating crimerates. The Doc hires a diverse assortment of essential criminals to ensure the success of his caper  a boxman or a safecracker Anthony Caruso with a young family a topnotch getaway driver James Whitmore with a twisted back and a smalltime hooligan Sterling Hayden with a costly passion for horses. Also involved in the elaborate scheme is Cobby Marc Lawrence a sleazy treacherous bookie and Alonzo D. Emmerich Louis Calhern a bankrupt professional businessman who agrees to finance the operation but houses plans for a disastrous doublecrossing. The film's female protagonists come in the form of innocent Doll Conovan Jean Hagen prior to her careerdefining performance in 'Singin' in the Rain 1952' and an upcoming Marilyn Monroe as Emmerich's sexy playful and naive young mistress.As was typical in filmnoir films of the era whose contents were dictated by the meddlesome ProductionHays Code the ultimate moral of the story is that crime doesn't pay. Each of the thieves receive punishment for their involvement in the robbery either through conviction or death as does the fraudulent detective Barry Kelley whose corruption is described as a one in a hundred case. Nevertheless Huston succeeds in creating a certain amount of empathy towards the criminals sympathetically presenting the audience with each man's reasonable motivations towards breaking the law. By recruiting our support Huston invariably places the audience in the shoes of the criminals suggesting as the perfect scheme begins to unravel that our own fates lie in the balance. This evocation of realism is certainly complemented by Harold Rosson's gritty documentarylike cinematography and the heist sequence itself  while falling well short of Jules Dassin's breathless 30minute counterpart  is tense intriguing and authentic. As Huston himself explains in a prefilm introduction on the DVD release each of his characters is immoral largely unlikable and driven by a debilitating vice however despite this or perhaps because of it we can't take our eyes off them.".

This really helped make the movie exciting and worked very well. What also helped the movie was the exceptional acting by mostly unknowns or longtime character actors. Good Noir usually does NOT star big names and having the film anchored by Sterling Hayden who was amazing Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern was an excellent move. To assist them were some other exceptional actors such as James Whitmore and Marilyn Monroe in a small but exceptional role.However despite the amazing acting the biggest star of the film was the taut script. From start to finish it sparkled and abounded with realism and an unflinching message that crime doesn't ultimately pay. The total package is one of the best Noir films everonly exceeded by a small number of movies such as my favorite Noir THE KILLERS.

Quite odd since it presses in the beginning that everything you're about to see in this movie no matter how unbelievable it seems has truly occurred. Oh well just a good and clever marketing trick lets leave it to that. No way they can pull off a trick like this now days in the days of Internet were with only a few clicks you can look up an historical event. Of course the biggest difference between the truth and fiction is the Remington Michael Douglas character who never existed in real life and also the looks of the lions who in real life were not maned. But oh well are these movie changes bad or not believable? No it strengthens the story and makes it all even more interesting to watch.I've always loved watching The Ghost and the Darkness. It's a great adventurous movie with action in it and some good characters all set in a beautiful environment. The story is perfectly adventurous and action filled. It's all the more amazing knowing that the story has actually occurred in real life over an hundred years ago already. The movie and its story is kept simple and allows its images and characters to tell the story.What I like about the movie is that it fully treats the 'Ghost' and the 'Darkness' the nicknames of the two maneating lions as movie characters. It shows them as smart thinking creatures and not simply just as 'monsters' even though they kill for pleasure at least in the movie they do. The movie is definitely helped by its environment and atmosphere. The beautiful African land serves as a perfect backdrop for the movie and also works quite claustrophobic since the movie is for most part set at just this one location the railroad and bridge buildingsite. Also the great Jerry Goldsmith musical score suits the environment and perfectly adds to the atmosphere of the entire movie as does the cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond. Michael Douglas plays a good role and actually shows with this movie how versatile he is as an actor though his role is definitely smaller than he is credited for in the movie. As also the producer of this movie he obviously claimed to become the topbilling actor of the movie as well. In fact the main part of the movie is being played by Val Kilmer who plays his character in a way like we're used of him a humble way and he doesn't try too hard to impress in his role which also leaves room for the other actors to shine and of course allows the story to be told best. Surprising to see that the movie also had actors in it that would later turn into big well known names such as Bernard Hill and Tom Wilkinson in some good roles. Also Om Puri gives a nice performance.A perfectly fun and simple adventurous action movie. This is high quality entertainment.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The beautiful African land serves as a perfect backdrop for the movie and also works quite claustrophobic since the movie is for most part set at just this one location the railroad and bridge buildingsite. Also the great Jerry Goldsmith musical score suits the environment and perfectly adds to the atmosphere of the entire movie as does the cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond. Michael Douglas plays a good role and actually shows with this movie how versatile he is as an actor though his role is definitely smaller than he is credited for in the movie. As also the producer of this movie he obviously claimed to become the topbilling actor of the movie as well. In fact the main part of the movie is being played by Val Kilmer who plays his character in a way like we're used of him a humble way and he doesn't try too hard to impress in his role which also leaves room for the other actors to shine and of course allows the story to be told best. Surprising to see that the movie also had actors in it that would later turn into big well known names such as Bernard Hill and Tom Wilkinson in some good roles. Also Om Puri gives a nice performance.A perfectly fun and simple adventurous action movie. This is high quality entertainment.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

There's only one scene where there's a mechanical or fake lion like the shark in Jaws in the movie and that was about the most ineffective scene in which the killer cats attacked in the entire film. The lions are seen mostly in close up when they do most of their damage attacking and killing the rail workers.

This forced them to go for humans as prey since human beings were the only source of food with all their normal prey dying out left open to them. A far more interesting clue in later checking out their skeletal remains to the maneating Tasvo Lions turning to prey on humans has to do with them having abscesses and infections in their teeth and gums.

They turned to hunt kill and eat human beings only because their skin or hides weren't as tough and thus easier to penetrate and not cause the Tasvo Lions any terrible pains in doing so.".

Kilmer's performance is quiet almost understated but one of the best I've seen him give he's fully convincing especially as he fights the belief that the lions are in fact out to get him personally. They are just lions he says halfway through the movie and you can hear how much he wants to believe it. John Kani also gives a good performance contained mostly in small moments that are so true they almost hurt. The cinematography is beautiful especially the of the lion attacks and their passages through the grass. Again no cgi effects could convey so much beauty and lurking menace.

Seems these lions are exhibiting behavior not seen in lions before i.e. they appear to be hunting for sport 'the Ghost' and 'the Darkness' are the names given to the 2 lions by the native workers. Douglas plays a famous renegade American hunter a tragically scarred Civil War veteran hired by the railroad to kill the lions.Good adventure wellpaced with stunning photography of the African countryside.

	schema:reviewBody "The Ghost and the Darkness is based on an episode from the jungles of 1896 East Africa.  Various European countries are engaged in the process of establishing colonies in the wealthy lands of East Africa and chief among those is Great Britain.Val Kilmer has been given a taskto build a bridge over a river in one of the British colonial ventures in East Africa.  When he arrives at the site he learns that the task has been brought to a total halt by the presence of two maneating lions the natives refer to as The Ghost and The Darkness. These lions hunt as a team and seem to have no fear of any outside force. What's more efforts to hunt them down have all ended in failure.

Various European countries are engaged in the process of establishing colonies in the wealthy lands of East Africa and chief among those is Great Britain.Val Kilmer has been given a taskto build a bridge over a river in one of the British colonial ventures in East Africa.  When he arrives at the site he learns that the task has been brought to a total halt by the presence of two maneating lions the natives refer to as The Ghost and The Darkness. These lions hunt as a team and seem to have no fear of any outside force. What's more efforts to hunt them down have all ended in failure.

I'll give the most credit to the animal trainers because these lions give great performances. I wouldn't call it a scary movie but it certainly has its grizzly parts which might shake you up some.

	schema:reviewBody "Thrilling as well as handsome adventure story set in 1896  dealing with of two maneating lions  hunting together for sport rather than food  as they killed 130 people and nearly derailed the building of the East African Railway . These Lions of Tsavo prophetically means place of slaughter were maneless perhaps due to environmental variables although maneless lions are not unique to Tsavo. Their taste for man may have been due to an outbreak of Rinderpest at the time which may have depleted their normal prey. Engineer John Patterson Val Kilmer is sent by his chief Tom Wilkinson to build a bridge over the Tsavo river . Then the workers become convinced the lions  nicknamed The Ghost and the Darkness are actually demons carrying out a cruel carnage . John sets in pursuit the beasts but he has little luck killing the lions  though he gets to survive on a mixture of cunning and bravura . As the beasts contemptuously evade all traps set for them . After losing dozens of workers to the lions the company brought in Remington an American  to hunt them but even his reputation for being the best could not prevent yet more massacre . There is eventually formed a team between the brave engineer and a famous white hunter Michael Douglas despite having top billing he doesn't appear on screen until 45 minutes into the movie but the legendary lions survive to kill and kill again  as they still seem to have advantage until a frenziedly breathtaking last reel . This nailbiting film packs thrills  chills  grisly events  slurping blood  quick cut edition is used to depict the lions' attacks and terror elements . Based on a true story well screenwritten by the notorious writer William Goldman  he took the actual experiences by real Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson published a book about his adventures  titled The ManEaters of Tsavo  however  Michael Douglas' character Remington as a 'great white hunter' is fictionalized  while Val Kilmer's character John Patterson killed both lions . Lt. Col. Patterson owned the skins and skulls of the two Tsavo maneaters. After the lions were killed their skins were used as rugs by Patterson. They were later sold In 1924 Patterson sold them to the Field Museum in Chicago for 5000 . Because they were originally used as rugs with resulting deterioration of the hides the lions are much smaller than they originally were . There is only one scene involving an animatronic lion  all the other shots were used using two real life lions named Bongo and Caeser  the same lions also appeared in the film George of the jungle 1997. Very good acting from main cast  and nice support casting . As Val Kilmer is magnificent as an engineer in charge of building a bridge and turned into a relentless hunter . Michael Douglas is topnotch as a twofisted as well as legendary game hunter with his complex mixture of bravado  toughness and calm . Impressive production design and art design from Stuart Wurtzel and Giles Masters  including wonderful outdoors and a lot of extras . The location where the bridge was built is now called ManEater's Junction after the two lions. It is in Tsavo East National Park Kenya about 200 miles southeast of Nairobi . Support actors are frankly engaging such as Tom Wilkinson as Robert Beaumont  John Kani as Samuel  Bernard Hill as Dr. David Hawthorne  Brian McCardie as Angus Starling  Om Puri as Abdullah and Emily Mortimer as wife . Rousing as well as exciting musical score by maestro Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was compellingly filmed by Director Stephen Hopkins Lost in space  Predator 2  Under suspicion  Blown away  he wanted his longtime collaborator Peter Levy to be the film's cinematographer but he was overruled by the studio who wanted to hire Vilmos Zsigmond who carries out a splendid and colorful cinematography . Rating  Above average . Well worth watching .".

There is eventually formed a team between the brave engineer and a famous white hunter Michael Douglas despite having top billing he doesn't appear on screen until 45 minutes into the movie but the legendary lions survive to kill and kill again  as they still seem to have advantage until a frenziedly breathtaking last reel . This nailbiting film packs thrills  chills  grisly events  slurping blood  quick cut edition is used to depict the lions' attacks and terror elements . Based on a true story well screenwritten by the notorious writer William Goldman  he took the actual experiences by real Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson published a book about his adventures  titled The ManEaters of Tsavo  however  Michael Douglas' character Remington as a 'great white hunter' is fictionalized  while Val Kilmer's character John Patterson killed both lions . Lt. Col. Patterson owned the skins and skulls of the two Tsavo maneaters. After the lions were killed their skins were used as rugs by Patterson. They were later sold In 1924 Patterson sold them to the Field Museum in Chicago for 5000 . Because they were originally used as rugs with resulting deterioration of the hides the lions are much smaller than they originally were . There is only one scene involving an animatronic lion  all the other shots were used using two real life lions named Bongo and Caeser  the same lions also appeared in the film George of the jungle 1997. Very good acting from main cast  and nice support casting . As Val Kilmer is magnificent as an engineer in charge of building a bridge and turned into a relentless hunter . Michael Douglas is topnotch as a twofisted as well as legendary game hunter with his complex mixture of bravado  toughness and calm . Impressive production design and art design from Stuart Wurtzel and Giles Masters  including wonderful outdoors and a lot of extras . The location where the bridge was built is now called ManEater's Junction after the two lions. It is in Tsavo East National Park Kenya about 200 miles southeast of Nairobi . Support actors are frankly engaging such as Tom Wilkinson as Robert Beaumont  John Kani as Samuel  Bernard Hill as Dr. David Hawthorne  Brian McCardie as Angus Starling  Om Puri as Abdullah and Emily Mortimer as wife . Rousing as well as exciting musical score by maestro Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was compellingly filmed by Director Stephen Hopkins Lost in space  Predator 2  Under suspicion  Blown away  he wanted his longtime collaborator Peter Levy to be the film's cinematographer but he was overruled by the studio who wanted to hire Vilmos Zsigmond who carries out a splendid and colorful cinematography . Rating  Above average . Well worth watching .";

	schema:reviewBody "Director Stephen Hopkins' safari saga The Ghost and the Darkness is based on a true incident. Two bloodthirsty lions feasted on 130 native railroad laborers in Africa in the late 1890s. But it's an adventure tale with more growl than grandeur. Val Kilmer bares a pearly smile in his starring role as idealistic bridge builder Lieutenant Colonel John Patterson. As Patterson he is assigned by his racist British tycoon boss Robert Beaumont Tom Wilkinson to bridge Africa's Tsavo River within five months. As we learn the Swahili word for Tsavo translates as a place of slaughter. When Patterson arrives in Africa his loyal African guide Samuel John Kani warns him that nothing works in Tsavo. No sooner has work started than the lions strike. Patterson guns down one maneater but two more lions replace it. The natives call these savage cats The Ghost and the Darkness. Michael Douglas costars as savvy lion killer Charles Remington. He arrives on the scene to help save the day but he doesn't make his appearance until nearly halfway into the action. William Goldman's script errs in not bringing Douglas into the fray much earlier. Although confined to a role that is little more than an overlong cameo Douglas dominates The Ghost and the Darkness. Douglas' charismatic Remington easily upstages Kilmer's ponderous spit and polish Patterson. Compared to the elegant Patterson Douglas resembles a shaggy villain from a 1970s era Italian western. Nevertheless what distinguishes The Ghost and the Darkness are its cagey lions. These lions constantly elude and outwit our pair of heroes. If you saw the Robin Williams movie Jumanji the special effects here are just as incredible. Director Stephen Hopkins deploys these fantastic digital effects to stage a truly realistic lion attack on a crowd. Many closeup shots of gaping jaws and dark hypnotic eyes bolster the suspense.An exciting confrontation that sends Kilmer scrambling up a tree with a lion nipping at his heels should get the adrenalin singing in your veins. Altogether The Ghost and the Darkness succeeds more as a horror movie. The action never strays far from the bridge site so the movie seems rather claustrophobic. When Ghost isn't frightening it creeps along with one too many campfire scenes. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid scenarist William Goldman literate script sticks closely to the events of this truelife tragedy. Nevertheless you wonder how they made the mistakes that they made. Patterson for example swaps rifles the night before the big hunt. When he confronts a lion his gun misfires. The death of one character occurs offscreen forcing you to fill in the gap and deprive both the audience and the characters with a memorable death scene.You can almost guess which character will be chomped because the filmmakers cast a halo around the person's head. Meanwhile Hopkins and Goldman devise one genuinely shocking scene but cannot sustain this kind of momentum when the lions are onscreen. Hopkins deserves credit for making these lion attacks fully vicious without emphasizing the blood and gore.".

	schema:headline " A story of two demonic lions";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one absolutely awesome movie. It is about two man eating lions that plague a construction site of a bridge in Africa. These lions are no ordinary lions they are vicious man eaters that do not conform to what lions are like. The natives call them demons and as this is claimed to be a true story this is biblically possible. But before I go into the theology of this I wish to look at the movie first.This move is set in Africa at the turn of the century. There is a race with the other European countries namely Germany to colonise Africa. A bridge must be built so that the British can move further inland. When Val Kilmer's character first looks at the river he is amazed. He says that the wonder of building bridges is to put land over water. The bridge is also seen as a chain or a manacle for the river. An unbridged river is an obstacle but a bridge makes this obstacle no more. The bridge tames the land for the river can no longer block the progress of man. But here the land seems to fight back.Right at the beginning the first lion attacks and is killed with one bullet. Thus Val Kilmer comes out as a hero. Soon after the two lions the Ghost and the Darkness come and cause havoc in the campsite. No matter what they do they cannot stop these lions. A great hunter Remington Michael Douglas comes along to help get rid of these lions. He believes them to be simple lions but when his tribe leaves he suddenly realises what he is up against. There is a very interesting scene but to tell you about it would give something away.These lions are considered demons by the natives and in my mind this is possible. If we look in the Gospels of Matthew Mark and Luke there is the story of the man possessed by the demon legion he is called legion because he is many. The demon pleads with Christ not to send them back to hell so Christ sends them into a herd of swine. This shows us that demons can manifest themselves in animals as well as in humans. With this in mind the animal kingdom is not as weak as we make it out to be. These lions were intelligent and would torment their enemies and then turn and indiscriminately kill. If you watch the hospital scene you will note that they kill everybody but do not take anybody away to eat. As Remington says they do it for the pleasure of it. Even though they are demons they are still lions as the swine were still swine. Just because they were possessed did not mean they were unkillable. The soul cannot be destroyed but the body can. The swine ran into the lake and were drowned the lions were also vulnerable in the same way.This movie comes out as a horror movie but it is far more than that. There is not ghosts or demons running about just two lions. The natives call them evil and that they are but the movie is real or so it claims. This really happened and thus can happen to us. A horror movie comes across as being unreal. We can leave a horror movie at the end and be comforted that it is not real. This was. The only comfort we have is that the lions are dead.".

	schema:headline " bad kitties with an attitude and on a rampage";
	schema:reviewBody "Cats have very distinctive nature. Every kind of cat has predatory instinct. When you are up against some one big as a lion the odds are very against you. In the late 1800 its a story based on actual event regarding 2 man eaters of tsavo in Africa who made a havoc but a great terrifying ordeal among the hearts of African and Indian slaves working under the command of imperial British empire in there. This story reveals when they were constructing a railway line out there 2 adult grown male lions stalked and killed so many of them. The surprising part of the events is that its not only the hunger which drives them berserk. They are doing it for fun and sport. They have a passion for killing humans and than castrating and smashing their corpses. Moreover they knew what traps are awaiting them. Also they know which men are at their trail. They know how to avoid them and what time to openly go head on head with them. Val kilmer starred as Col Jhon Patterson the British officer and engineer in charge of railway line and Michael Douglas Starred as Remington  an adventurer hitch hiker and professional hunter. I believe it was an excellent combination both actors. Both of them are my favorites. Along with them the other combination was of the lions Bongo and Cesar  i really acknowledge their work as a team and cooperation for making of this film. I heard a quote from a movie  When a man and a beast taste each others blood they both become the same thing. Maybe it was the case of lion because the way they were so brutal  no beast can go to that extant. If you watch this film you see in the early minutes of the film that they were not the lions killing people around there. Before them there was a single one killed by col Patterson but he was not that much clever and aggressive  while the most strongest black man was killed by the lions the doctor in charge of the autopsy at 1st couldn't believe that it was a lion's job he had experience of such fatalities before but not like this one. When Val kilmer and Micheal Douglas joined hands to end their killing spree  the lions changed their strategy of hunting. There fear was so much powerful nobody could even breath properly in that environment. The most terrifying parts are in the movie when they attack the camp in day light killing and half devouring a man also killing the British deputy of Patterson in self defense  than dodging both men and attacking the hospital where patients were being treated. If you watch the movie don't let yourself being hateful towards the big cats. As a matter of fact they have never threatened us so much as we have massacred them and destructed their habitats. Man has proved a far more greatest Nemesis to beasts and even its own kind. I always love and admire the cats of all kinds. I believe they must be protected and conserved as its their right. Well if the film is concerned its going to be classic. A real but wonderful wild life epic.".

Along with them the other combination was of the lions Bongo and Cesar  i really acknowledge their work as a team and cooperation for making of this film. I heard a quote from a movie  When a man and a beast taste each others blood they both become the same thing. Maybe it was the case of lion because the way they were so brutal  no beast can go to that extant. If you watch this film you see in the early minutes of the film that they were not the lions killing people around there. Before them there was a single one killed by col Patterson but he was not that much clever and aggressive  while the most strongest black man was killed by the lions the doctor in charge of the autopsy at 1st couldn't believe that it was a lion's job he had experience of such fatalities before but not like this one. When Val kilmer and Micheal Douglas joined hands to end their killing spree  the lions changed their strategy of hunting. There fear was so much powerful nobody could even breath properly in that environment. The most terrifying parts are in the movie when they attack the camp in day light killing and half devouring a man also killing the British deputy of Patterson in self defense  than dodging both men and attacking the hospital where patients were being treated. If you watch the movie don't let yourself being hateful towards the big cats. As a matter of fact they have never threatened us so much as we have massacred them and destructed their habitats. Man has proved a far more greatest Nemesis to beasts and even its own kind. I always love and admire the cats of all kinds. I believe they must be protected and conserved as its their right. Well if the film is concerned its going to be classic. A real but wonderful wild life epic.";

	schema:headline " Unique Dutch serial killer effort";
	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen Dick Maas' previous horror outing  THE LIFT  then you pretty much know what to expect with this kooky crime thriller mixing police investigation with slasher overtones. There's a certain basic artistry in some of the more outlandish scenes  probably the most memorable scene comes when a tour boat full of gossiping passengers and unruly children runs into a corpse swinging from the bridge typically this would be a brief shock scene quickly cutting away to an autopsy or something. But not here  instead Maas follows the boat through the tunnel as the corpse slides along the glass roof leaving a trail of blood and gristle behind it. It's an audacious inventive and highly imaginative moment in what otherwise amounts to a fairly typical thriller.The ingredients here are ordinary and the film has something for everyone  sex and gore tame romance action stunts and a lone hero a rogue cop whose obscure methods find him at odds with his superiors. The cop in question is played by Maas' favourite leading man Huub Stapel after he did so well in THE LIFT. Stapel fits into the role of maverick cop pretty well here and looks the part with his unshaven face and tired leather jacket. As for the supporting actors and actresses... well nobody really shines in their role but nobody is wooden either. The dialogue is a little difficult to comprehend sometimes due to the culture gap and the heavy accents on display but all round it's a good effort on everybody's behalf.Fans would be wise to check this film out as it's a unique contribution which really draws out the best scenery in Holland. Basically it's just so different what with the setting and different lifestyles that watching becomes a way of learning about the Dutch. Personally I myself find the long canals of Amsterdam very interesting to look out and the film really makes use of them in some tense chase moments. The best part of the film is a prolonged speedboat chase which packs in a ton of stunts and could easy fit into a James Bond film without looking out of place  it's that polished.You're kept guessing as to the identity of the killer throughout and there are plenty of clues and red herrings to chew on. The only thing I think let this film down was the ending which makes you feel sorry for the killer and gives him a personality  realistic yes and a good twist but not that exciting. Basically if the idea of a killer stalking the canals of Amsterdam in the wetsuit being chased by policemen who follows his bubbles sounds like your sort of thing then get this film as that's exactly what it's about and it doesn't disappoint  it may not be a brilliant film but I thoroughly enjoyed it and was kept interested all the way until the end anyway. Oh yes and clever title too.".

But not here  instead Maas follows the boat through the tunnel as the corpse slides along the glass roof leaving a trail of blood and gristle behind it. It's an audacious inventive and highly imaginative moment in what otherwise amounts to a fairly typical thriller.The ingredients here are ordinary and the film has something for everyone  sex and gore tame romance action stunts and a lone hero a rogue cop whose obscure methods find him at odds with his superiors. The cop in question is played by Maas' favourite leading man Huub Stapel after he did so well in THE LIFT. Stapel fits into the role of maverick cop pretty well here and looks the part with his unshaven face and tired leather jacket. As for the supporting actors and actresses... well nobody really shines in their role but nobody is wooden either. The dialogue is a little difficult to comprehend sometimes due to the culture gap and the heavy accents on display but all round it's a good effort on everybody's behalf.Fans would be wise to check this film out as it's a unique contribution which really draws out the best scenery in Holland. Basically it's just so different what with the setting and different lifestyles that watching becomes a way of learning about the Dutch. Personally I myself find the long canals of Amsterdam very interesting to look out and the film really makes use of them in some tense chase moments. The best part of the film is a prolonged speedboat chase which packs in a ton of stunts and could easy fit into a James Bond film without looking out of place  it's that polished.You're kept guessing as to the identity of the killer throughout and there are plenty of clues and red herrings to chew on. The only thing I think let this film down was the ending which makes you feel sorry for the killer and gives him a personality  realistic yes and a good twist but not that exciting. Basically if the idea of a killer stalking the canals of Amsterdam in the wetsuit being chased by policemen who follows his bubbles sounds like your sort of thing then get this film as that's exactly what it's about and it doesn't disappoint  it may not be a brilliant film but I thoroughly enjoyed it and was kept interested all the way until the end anyway. Oh yes and clever title too.";

	schema:reviewBody "Dutch director Dick Maas clearly has a flair for entertainment. This serial killer film is lifted above the norm by a series of fantastic sequences from creepy murder scenes to a hilariously over the top speed boat chase through the canals of Amsterdam Amsterdamned is a delight to watch from start to finish. It goes without saying that this film takes place in Amsterdam and it would appear that the film is something of a love letter to the great Dutch city. Amsterdam's streets make for an excellent horror location while the canal shots are what really give the film its originality. Maas also gives us sequences in which the reputation of the city is discussed. Personally I love the location shots of this film having visited Amsterdam a couple of times myself it's nice to recognise where the film is taking place. The plot is basically your run of the mill serial killer yarn but it's lifted above the norm because of the fact that the murderer himself is waterbased. Amsterdam's canals make for his home as the murderous diver drags anyone who comes too close to the river to their doom. We follow the trail of murders and the police investigation into the crimes.The film runs at around 105 minutes a running time that would usually lead to me saying is too long for this sort of film. However despite the fact that the film plays from what is a very basic plot it never becomes boring. Dick Maas bombards the audience with stunning location shots deliriously entertaining sequences and some very sinister moments of horror to ensure that Amsterdamned never becomes trite or dull  and besides every time there's a danger of the film going downhill our competent director is on hand with another grisly murder sequence! For a film that runs so freely it's surprising that it's actually not all that messy. Maas blends several different styles together but the plot always stays on course. The atmosphere is always foreboding as it is made clear that the murderer could strike at any time. I've got to say that I was a little disappointed by the end however. After a brilliant 100 minutes Maas sees fit to tack on an ending that feels very trite and overly used. However the build up to this let down is fantastic and by the time it comes to the ending it doesn't really matter how it ends because you've just witnessed what is one of the finest films ever to come out of the Netherlands. Personally I loved every minute of this great film and really can't recommend it highly enough!".

Huub Stapel is again the best choice for the leading character Eric Visser charming tenacious and this time single.  The comic relieves are numerous in this movie but the best to me are the scenes where Stapel's daughter Anneke and her friend Willy try to find the killer through telepathy. And luckily Dick Maas doesn't resort to an old Hollywood trick and let them solve the whole thing. Unfortunately the whole industry in Europe is only interested in making interesting and challenging movies. Movie making in Europe should be about the art not about the money according to the critics. The result however is that most movies from Europe are either depressing to the point of throwing yourself from a tall building or completely incomprehensible or just boring. There are a few great exceptions to the rule and this is certainly one of them. For those who saw it in 1988 in a theater and happened to be in a theater that as is usual in Holland puts in a break half way through the movie so they can scam you out of your money selling over priced drinks okay different story you might remember one of the best finishing touches to a movie ever seen the hand that shoots out of the water holding a strawberry ice cream cone!

The severed heads the dangling body on the bridge to name but a few instances made an enormous impact on me.Now when you think I am going to praise this movie alround you are wrong. See I was twelve and was not in any way educated in film arts. Nowadays my knowledge in the film department has quite significantly improved and when I now watch this movie it certainly lacks a lot.As is normal in Dutch movies it seems in particular the sound editing is dreadful. I do not know where this constant deficiency comes from but it is omnipresent in just about every movie that is released from Holland. The acting is not all that great but given the material that the cast and crew were presented with it is still a pretty nice job. Production values are absolutely highstandard for a small country like Holland. The fact that some scenes in the boat chase were filmed in Utrecht is something that is absolutely unforgivable but sometimes a director has to make sacrifices towards this sort of thing to make the story work. The chase scenes were absolutely riveting to say the least. Regrettably the makeup on the villain was a little crappy when I look at it now.Storywise this was pretty decent. The tension was kept on a good level in the highoctane speed of situations that followed each other. Some of the photography was better than average the stalking POV was awesome. Some scenes really stood out above the rest for instance the girl who is resting in her little rubber boat and subsequently being sliced and diced in the middle of the Amsterdam canal this is timeless stuff. I love it.Overall this was a decent movie not to be viewed by the smallest among the family. The pace in the story will keep you tied to your seat. Look past its flaws and just watch this movie unprejudiced. At least it's a hell of a lot better than Maas' clunker of 1999 Do Not Disturb.710".

But when I'm not at home in Spain you can usually find me enjoying the company and astonishing beauty of Polish women in Krakow or relaxing somewhere in the Netherlands. I love everything about Amsterdam. From its rich and tranquil canal based landscapes to its friendly and welcoming inhabitants that's not mentioning its wealth of world class soccer stars you truly haven't lived until you've been there. That's why I was infinitely excited when I learnt that Holland had created its own addition to my favourite cinema subgenre  a Dutch slasher movie! You read it right Amsterdamned manages to mix the Bmovie bliss of a masked psychopath with the cultural trademarks of my summer break paradise. And the best thing about it is that it's actually an amsterdamned good movie Apologies for the pun It opens with a cool credit sequence that mixes some brilliant underwater photography with an eerie horror soundtrack that was provided by director Dick Maas. The shot pans along the riverbanks as a yet unidentified predator stalks its prey. It's almost like Jaws in a canal as we watch the camera emerge from the murky depths scan the area and then move on to another location. Next we cut to a prostitute flagging down a taxi later that same night. After an amusing bust up with the randy driver the hooker is left walking the back streets to find her way home. Before she even has a chance to begin her journey a dark figure raises out of the canal and repeatedly stabs her with a large blade. The killer leaving a streaming trail of blood behind him then drags her corpse into the river and disappears into a mass of bubbles. The following morning the woman is discovered hanging upside down from a bridge and dripping with blood by a boat that's filled with tourists. That scene launches a terrific flair for subtle pitch black humour from the director which continues throughout the movie.Next up we meet Detective Eric Visser Huub Stapel a hardboiled Dirty Harryalike who is immediately put on the case of the bizarre killings. After a vital clue is found at the scene of the second slaughter the Police seem convinced that the maniac is a diver and begin checking out all the local clubs and stores. Whilst following that lead Eric meets Laura Monique Van de Ven a beautiful artist who is keen to help him crack the case. Meanwhile the body count is rising and the town mayor wants this killer caught. Can Visser track down this maniacal madman? Or will the killer find him first?Amsterdamned is probably one of the best slasher movies to be released towards the end of the eighties. Boasting a superb script What does she mean a big black monster with huge claws? I don't know but your motherinlaw better have a good alibi! some stunning photography a great cast of characters and an extremely talented director this is truly a great advertisement for Dutch cinema. It's not really a teenslasher in the hackneyed Friday the 13th mould. Instead it's best described as a slashermurdermysterythriller which makes the most of being part of each category. The first thing I noticed was that Amsterdamned was extremely well financed even compared to its American brethrens. How many hack and slash flicks have you seen that have included a townwide motorcycle chase AND a colossal boat pursuit in the same feature? Dick Maas did an extremely good job of making his movie stand out from the mediocrity that had engulfed the cycle this late into its rein.Even though it is not famed for it's extreme gore there's enough gooey corpses floating about literally to keep the bloodhounds interested. It's also competently written which means that you won't have worked out the psychopath's identity when he is unmasked at the conclusion. The body count is fairly high and most of the murders are carried out creatively whilst trying to pack in as much suspense and intrigue as possible. My favourite would have to be the underwater battle between the killer and an unsuspecting Police diver. The whole scene is filmed aboard a submerged boat and the claustrophobic tension is superbly executed. Unfortunately Amsterdamned was yet another victim of poor dubbing for international broadcast which means that the voiceovers sound like a consignment of English speaking foreigners from everywhere else BUT Holland! It's impossible for me to rate the cast's performances because I own the dubbed version but I've heard that they're pretty poor from the supporting actors anyway.This is wholly recommended to slasher fans across the globe. It's extremely well financed boasts some snappy dialogue superb direction a cool killer costume and even a enjoyably cheesy theme tune how can you argue with that. The boat chase alone is worth the budget purchase price. I'll be keeping a close eye on the Dutch moviemarket to see if they bless the slasher genre once more with such credible output. Make sure you give this one a go".

But when I'm not at home in Spain you can usually find me enjoying the company and astonishing beauty of Polish women in Krakow or relaxing somewhere in the Netherlands. I love everything about Amsterdam. From its rich and tranquil canal based landscapes to its friendly and welcoming inhabitants that's not mentioning its wealth of world class soccer stars you truly haven't lived until you've been there. That's why I was infinitely excited when I learnt that Holland had created its own addition to my favourite cinema subgenre  a Dutch slasher movie! You read it right Amsterdamned manages to mix the Bmovie bliss of a masked psychopath with the cultural trademarks of my summer break paradise. And the best thing about it is that it's actually an amsterdamned good movie Apologies for the pun It opens with a cool credit sequence that mixes some brilliant underwater photography with an eerie horror soundtrack that was provided by director Dick Maas.

	schema:reviewBody "A mysterious serial killer is stalking the canals of Amsterdam. He wears a black wetsuit and diving mask and he kills with a harpoon. As the body count rises detective Eric Visser Stapel is assigned to catch him. It's not going to be easy as this particular baddie is extremely clever and crafty. Soon the full force of Amsterdam's police are chasing down the man terrifying their beloved city. Visser must not only catch the killer but also protect his young daughter Anneke Dagelet and her friend Willy Bakker not to mention girlfriend Laura van de Ven of Stunt Rock 1980 fame. Can he do it? Amsterdamned as you might be able to surmise from its great title is an extremely enjoyable movie with a dark sense of humor. It takes Dutch culture everything from its red light district to Rembrandt paintings to Amstel beer and of course its famous canals and architecture and injects a malevolent murdering presence into it. That and the idea that a killer can use the canals to kill and escape is excellent original and crowdpleasing. The whole venture has a great vibe and thus is a winner.Huub Stapel as Visser is your typical quirky unshaven cop who gets results. To our eyes he resembles a Dutch Jean Reno or perhaps a Dutch Cobra AKA Marion Cobretti. He also has a cool jacket and there are other wonderful 80's fashions on display as well. Writerdirector Dick Maas not only uses the city of Amsterdam to its full effect but he also loads the movie up with inventive moments and unique camera angles. This keeps the pace of the movie on track although at times it is hard to sustain the nearly two hour running time. And even though most of the characters dubbed their own voices if the movie had been trimmed of a bit of fat and subtitled instead of dubbed we'd be looking at an ultimate classic. As it stands it's merely great. So not a huge loss there.But we see why Maas decided to dub the movie he was clearly going for the international and especially the American market. And he had every right to be successful in it as the movie has some great chase scenes as well as its unique concept and location. So he was able to formulate a winner and Vestron must have agreed as they released it on VHS here.Featuring the wonderful endcredits title song by Lois Lane we strongly recommend Amsterdamned.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

He directed three selfpenned movies to Dutch box office success in the 80s all three fastpaced original stories permeated with a typical Dutch brand of humor. You could make a case that Maas is the Low Countries' equivalent to Luc Besson or Quentin Tarantino even if his work doesn't come close to a quarter of their production values  or their international recognition.With its fauxEnglish title touristy Amsterdam settings and serial killerhardboiled cop storyline Amsterdamned 1988 was made with an eye on international success. As always Maas' direction is instinctively entertaining doesn't waste time and doesn't mind sacrificing logic for pace and shock value. It results in trashy 80s fare. Personally? I love it. Don't expect Seven or The Silence of the Lambs but enjoy the lewd sex scenes speedboat chases and blood stains. Time will fly Maas and lead Huub Stapel know what they're doing.But does Amsterdamned work for an international audience? Only if you're prepared to appreciate the irreverent selfdeprecating sense of humor as part of the movie's charm. Maas' shtick as a writerdirector is so fundamentally Dutch that his international ambitions were probably doomed from the start. But let's give the man his due he wrote his own stuff put his own money on the line and drew big crowds to the theaters creating popular culture at a time when other Dutch directors were busy adapting 19thcentury novels.".

	schema:headline " The most authentic thriller for the Amsterdam canals";
	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion there aren't that many Dutch thrillers that couldn't be characterized as only be suitable for typical Dutch soil. Indeed the storyline of Amsterdam is perfectly aptly for the Amsterdam canal network of both its singular beauty and mystery. Indeed there's a contradiction between the attraction that these canals have on both numerous tourists and all the Amsterdam inhabitants. The canals are only worshiped by being navigated and watched from the wharfs and buildings. As far as I know Amsterdamned is the very first movie that unravels a fear that's felt by many Dutch water freaks who dive swim or sail in any Dutch lake shore swimming pool or ditch. They have fantasized about exploring the Amsterdam canals but feel too much fear of realizing it because of being scared off by the menacing nontransparent waterlines. The murderer of Amsterdamned must have occurred in anyone's nightmare before this movie was released. Therefore Amsterdamned is a kind of epochmaking story. Water crime is hardly ever published in media. Amsterdamned is a perfect paramount of the thin line between imaginable crimes from the canals that once could happen in reality and anyone's unspoken recurring fear of hidden malevolent divers. Although the main characters of Amsterdamned are just flat and a little shallow the tension is built up very well. Indeed it takes a lot of time before the real perpetrator is both found and arrested. His mutilated voice is only unveiled in the very end of the movie. So before this revealing scene the main question is what's the face behind the masquerade in the shape of a diving suit? Furthermore the diver's motives for his atrocious deeds in the canals is only told very lately by a psychotherapist who previously didn't appear to be an ambiguous person at all. Therefore Amsterdamned has enough surprising personal plots.".

With De Lift in 1983 Maas already proved that he was the only Dutch director of his generation capable of bringing unsettling and tense horror stories but Amsterdamned is an even better movie because the atmosphere feels more realistic and the story is a lot more involving. With all the abrupt plottwists and the extremely violent deathsequences you could almost describe Amsterdamned as the only Dutch GIALLO ever made and it's perfectly able to compete with some of the better Italian efforts in this lovely sub genre of horror. Even the chilling musical score composed by Dick Maas himself as well feels very giallolike. Of course the film isn't entirely flawless. Some action scenes like the grotesque speedboat chase are just a tad bit exaggerated and the one many red herrings eventually ruin the credibility. Still Amsterdamned unquestionably is one the best Dutchspoken thriller ever and even horror fanatics across the ocean should consider importing it if it were only for the nasty and downright shocking scene in which a severely mutilated corpse is dragged over a glasstopped tour boat filled with boy scouts.

I watched it first when I was 9 or 10 and it has kind of a nostalgical meaning from me. Anyway you may have a nice popcorn bag and a bottle of Coke embrace your girl and turn the lights off.

	schema:reviewBody "The speedboat chase in the Amsterdam canals in this film is actually being done before in the 1970 film 'Puppet on a Chain'. I always thought how original it was to have such an out of the ordinary yet in Amsterdam obvious chase but apparently it is less original as I thought. In the 18 year older 'Puppet on a Chain' the chase is as vivid and dynamic as in Maas' film although one detail in Amsterdamned should catch the viewer's attention. Just like in Puppet on a Chain the villain almost crashes his boat into an oncoming barge a thrilling moment. In 'Amsterdamned' this barge has a fanfare band conducted by 'actor' and Holland's famous Oscarwinning documentary director Bert Haanstra. It makes the already exhilarating scene more colourful and provides it with a light touch. This detail encapsulates an often noticeable and important difference between English and Dutch filmmaking if you ask me It seems that in Dutch films a doses of ridiculing of a serious action or scene is indispensable. Fact of the matter is that the 'original' film Puppet on a Chain is more believable because of its absence of this ridiculing. However Amsterdamned is entertaining mainly due to the over the top ridiculing of scenes. Take for example the typically Amsterdam scene of a police car crashing into a barrel organ upon which the owner with absolutely no respect for authority starts to swear and scold at the police officer calling him a Eikel dickhead! It is Amsterdam in a nutshell.".

Of course silliness is part of any scifi story we suspend our critical senses in that regard or we do not become scifi fans.I single out one performer among a fine cast. Julianne Moore has really established herself as the deadpan action queen. She was a better Agent Starling than Jody Foster was and she's a terrific dominant presence in this film. Kudos to her for propelling herself to the top of a tough genre. She makes films more interesting to watch by dint of her strong performances.I read Phillip K. Dick's The Golden Man many years ago and still remember a lot of it. When I first began hearing about this movie I immediately flashed to it and wondered if this was a movie of that intriguing story. The answers are yes and no. The Golden Man is a much more ordinary story but with resounding insights on the consequences of his existence. And his skin was a compellingly attractive rich golden hue which helped make him irresistible to women. None of that fits this new story and was properly omitted.What is translated so well from the written page to the screen is the government's intense interest in him although for different reasons its efforts to get him under official control and the exceeding difficulty of doing so. And of course the story ends in a wholly different way than the movie a very satisfying and inevitable conclusion that bolsters Mr. Dick's reputation for opening the future to us. OK ONE LITTLE SPOILER ALERT  READ NO FURTHER unless you don't mind I just have to add the flurry of action sequences which come like a staccato rendition of The Flight Of The Bumblebee during his escape from custody is thoroughly delectable and brought more than one involuntary Ha! from the audience I saw it with including from me. It's one of the tastiest treats in the film.And finally yes I too wish I knew who the heck these terrorists were and what the heck they were trying to accomplish with their nefarious plot. But I guess that's the brave new world we live in. We just don't get to hear the bad guys' dialogue their reasons for doing the things they do. In that way Next is giving us another insight not dropping us cold as others have complained. The only legitimate beef I agree with is the entirely unnecessary and just plain goofy Nicholas Cage business during the final pursuit. It looks like it must have been an idea of somebody too high up among the moguls to deny but it is a definite distraction causing Huh? What? moments when the action is at its most intense.All in all a feather in everybody's cap and a movie I fully recommend without reservation. Drama humor really fine action sequences twists great characters. As baseball great Yogi Berra once said  Don't miss it if you can.".

The movie also makes very good use of computer effects  there aren't many and the few that there are aren't awful looking like director Lee Tamahori's last feature XXX The State of the Union. Johnson's clairvoyance is shown in a clever way and the story takes several nice turns. There is the stock Hollywood romantic angle here but cheesiness is mercifully spared as it is not over done but actually played out humorously in certain scenes.Then the kicker is the ending which I dare not give away and it is a real breath of fresh air. It leaves you a lot to think about and that ultimately ends this film with not a bang which many people might expect from a bigbudget actionfest. No definitely not a bang but a hum.

	schema:reviewBody "Next is one of those films that requires a second viewing. There's a lot going on and the plot doubles back on itself multiple times. Granted there are some plot holes and some motivations are suspect but overall it tends to entertain and keep you going more often than not.Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson a man who can see two minutes into the future and predict what will happen. The problem is that the future constantly shifts and every action will change the next future. The fact that he can only see up to 2 minutes ahead also limits him somewhat. It does however help greatly in his magic career as a Las Vegas showman. It also helps when playing small time gambling. Unfortunately it has gotten the attention of the FBI who want Cris to help them stop a Russia nuclear bomb from being detonated on American soil.As I said there's a lot of backtracking in the story which may serve to confuse some but is really important to the storyline. Cage turns in a great performance as the slightly eccentric seeming Cris. Julianne Moore is fine as a hard nosed FBI agent and Jessica Biel does all she can with a somewhat thankless role as the love interest.Overall I really enjoyed Next. It's a fun scifi film that is the perfect start of the summer season.".

	onyx:emotionText "Next is one of those films that requires a second viewing. There's a lot going on and the plot doubles back on itself multiple times. Granted there are some plot holes and some motivations are suspect but overall it tends to entertain and keep you going more often than not.Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson a man who can see two minutes into the future and predict what will happen. The problem is that the future constantly shifts and every action will change the next future. The fact that he can only see up to 2 minutes ahead also limits him somewhat. It does however help greatly in his magic career as a Las Vegas showman. It also helps when playing small time gambling. Unfortunately it has gotten the attention of the FBI who want Cris to help them stop a Russia nuclear bomb from being detonated on American soil.As I said there's a lot of backtracking in the story which may serve to confuse some but is really important to the storyline. Cage turns in a great performance as the slightly eccentric seeming Cris. Julianne Moore is fine as a hard nosed FBI agent and Jessica Biel does all she can with a somewhat thankless role as the love interest.Overall I really enjoyed Next. It's a fun scifi film that is the perfect start of the summer season.";

The best part of all is that unlike most movies these days the previews don't give away every good scene. Given the previews give away almost all of the entire plot but we are talking about the same author who wrote Minority Report. So why not a 10? The only downside would have to be that some of the acting is not as good as you would hope. Jessica Biel is not unconvincing as a love interest but she's not entirely convincing. The plot is somewhat predictable but there are surprises. Don't forget this is an ACTION film. Not a romantic comedy not a love story. It serves its point as an action film and it serves it well. Very well indeed.".

Dick has been the resource of stories for some very exciting films Minority Report Total Recall Blade Runner but in NEXT his short story 'The Golden Man' as adapted by Gary Goldman and directed by Lee Tamahori the concept of precognition as a human feature in altering the future falls into a video game format that becomes more action film and less human interest tale.Cris Johnson AKA Frank Cadillac Nicholas Cage is a sloe eyed Las Vegas grungy magician who has found a way to hide the fact that he has the gift to see two minutes into his future a gift that rewards him at the gambling tables but draws attention from the FBI after a thwarted attempt on Cris' part to stop a robbery is captured on video tape. The FBI especially Agent Callie Ferris Julianne Moore knows that a nuclear device has entered the USA by terrorists headed by 'Mr. Smith' Thomas Kretschmann and that if the device cannot be traced a nuclear bomb threatens the lives of millions of citizens. Agent Callie observes Cris' talent and engages him to aid in the discovery of the site of the device. But Chris' powers lead him to a beautiful young woman Liz Jessica Biel with whom his powers to see into the future can be extended for more than the requisite 2 minutes. After a series of 'attempts' at introduction Cris and Liz bond allowing Cris' expanded powers to be of more help to the persistent Agent Callie. From that point on the film dissolves into yet another combustible crashing action flick with endless CG special effects all but erasing the character development. And the ending is as one might expect  not very Philip K. Dick in style.Cage and Biel do well Moore seems bored with her character and Kretschman yet again embodies the evil of terrorism and beyond. There are some rather extraneous scenes on an Indian reservation that add little except the beauty of the Grand Canyon to the story and there are some truly funny scenes of themes and variations on the chances we take in approaching a potential love source. But in the end all gets rather lost in the explosions ad infinitum that mark the film as a routine action flick. Grady Harp".

A slipshod work of Hollywood clich Next pretends to be an interesting psychological action film trying to leave us wondering about the whatif's the movie proposes when it actually only leaves us wondering how in heavens name any producer could expect us to believe that a middleaged Nic Cage with bad hair could land Jessica Biel. Without any heart or spirit this film relies on big bangs and a hot girl to bring the prepubescent boys out to spend their allowance at the box office. Nicolas Cage who has previously shown some signs of promise in films like Leaving in Las Vegas and Adaptation falls even further from his former place in our esteem with his latest in a succession of cruddy movies. Hey at least this latest entry into the club of dismal Cage doesn't ask us to believe that his head bursts into flame as he rides a motorcycle just that he can miraculously see the future and with this power duplicate himself dodge bullets avoid booby traps and save the day all while standing in one place looking more like he has a blockage in his bowels than a blockage in his clairvoyance. Actually come to think of it we might prefer the flaming skullhead. After this latest installment in his addiction to bad films we all have almost lost hope that he will go back to working on his acting rather than on his abs which were amply visible the couple times Cage took off his shirt. One must feel sorry for Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore as so very little is given to them in the comicstrip writing of their characters that we can hardly be surprised when the performances come out flat and clich. In fact it is worth pondering what in this movie is not clich? The nuclearchemicalbiological weapon that was stolen by terrorists and now must be found before 8 million people die? Nope The Sum of All Fears XXX and The Peacemaker are just a few of the bevy of postcold war movies focusing on what happens if the weapons from the build up land in the wrong hands. Maybe the hardass but essentially well meaning federal agent willing to do anything to for the greater good? The Bourne Identity and most CIA or FBI based films. So how about the clever crane shot of Las Vegas with blinding neon and the tune of Elvis Presley's A Little Less Conversation? Nope Ocean's Eleven for one beat them to that one. How about the neat bullet dodging effect? Nope The Matrix. That nifty little tool used to keep Nic Cage's eyelids open? No A Clockwork Orange did it first. How about the concept of a guy knowing the future and thus knowing exactly where to be at exactly the right time? Sorry that was Groundhog Day. The major dilemma of whether to sacrifice the individual for the common good? Um let's see nearly all superhero movies most notably Spiderman and Batman Begins. Then there's also Good Will Hunting and the list goes on. How about the potentially mindboggling ending that reveals it's all been a dream look into the future? There are too many to list. For the most part the film looks entirely Hollywood with whiffs of an attempt at pulpy arty shots in which Cage is in sharp focus surrounded by an intense blur supposedly to suggest that only Chris Johnson has a clear view of the world that to others is so blurry. But we're not fooled by the soft all too obvious attempts at cinematic metaphor because the emblematic Hollywood action sequences with the CGI SUV's and log trucks falling from the sky or in an odd greenly lit warehouse make it abundantly clear that what may appear to be artistic attempts albeit weak ones in the film were bastardized by their connection with the omnipresent Hollywood conventions. Therefore the shots that might be trying to have significance start to look like a director's obsession with sharp closeups. The music was overpowering and didactic. Every note gave away exactly what was to happen next if we didn't already know from seeing innumerable similar action plots prior to this one. The dialogue was strained often ludicrous and of course previously done I have seen every possible ending and none of them are good for you There's something I have to do and I can't put it off any longer. Not to mention the tragically botched punchline of the old Zen hot dog joke I'll have one with everything. For the edification of those of us who have not had the joy to hear the actual joke the Zen Buddhist says to the hot dog vendor Make me one with everything. With such uninspired writing we would love to ask did anyone bother to edit or did they expect this whorey slop to pass for actual discourse?There's something bitterly ironic that in a film entitled Next there is absolutely no original ideas or circumstances. However it does work in a way probably completely unintentionally we like Chris Johnson knew everything that was coming we just didn't have the happy ability to know we knew what was coming and avoid it. What else is there to say but next please.This review was written somewhat in reference to the style and voice of Pauline Kael".

	schema:reviewBody "I just went to see it this morning and a huge pot of macadamia nut brittle vanilla ice cream wasn't enough to soften the bitterness yes I am thus compelled to write my first ever movie review in order to try and keep people from giving their hardearned cash to whatever evil corporation struck this movie upon us.This movie is about Chris Johnson a guy who can see up to two minutes except when the plot suddenly decides it's three hours in the future. He uses this power in a cautious manner as to not attract too much attention on him and lead a peaceful life until he can finally meet True Love tm since he saw in a vision that a hot woman would one day enter his favorite restaurant at 809. So one day his dream finally comes true although it turns out the girl in question is a gigantic prick. Not to worry though Chris Johnson can see in the future WITH HIS MIND POWER and thus imagine every possible way to win the hot woman's heart since everybody knows the surefire way to long term relationships is to hide your personality and put up an act. Sure enough when night comes up they end up in the same bed and thus become lovers forever. Unfortunately this is the exact time European terrorists decide it's a good idea to bomb LA. At least I assume they are European sadly there only was the dubbed version of the movie at my local theater but I think I heard one of them speaking German and another had his lips perfectly in sync with his voice so he was probably French. Their motive is never explained. Thus begins a convoluted by which I mean SHITTY plot involving the two main characters making huge sacrifices for each other since they are True Loves and the bad guys being terribly retarded accompanied by some of the worst CGI I've seen in the last few years along with horrible acting although admittedly judgement is always clouded in dubbed movies. To top it all off the ending is OBVIOUS.Apart from Jessica Biel's beautiful body and the comic relief brought by Cage's haircut there is absolutely nothing remotely interesting in this movie it simply is a gigantic waste of time and money. Tamahori made Mullholand Falls Cage made hell he's acted great in tons of awesome movies so I can only assume Next was intentionally made in order to crush the very minds of its viewers then Tamahori can make a movie about it and get tonsa cash there I discovered the whole plan. I will never sleep again until I get my 6 euros back.".

	onyx:emotionText "I just went to see it this morning and a huge pot of macadamia nut brittle vanilla ice cream wasn't enough to soften the bitterness yes I am thus compelled to write my first ever movie review in order to try and keep people from giving their hardearned cash to whatever evil corporation struck this movie upon us.This movie is about Chris Johnson a guy who can see up to two minutes except when the plot suddenly decides it's three hours in the future. He uses this power in a cautious manner as to not attract too much attention on him and lead a peaceful life until he can finally meet True Love tm since he saw in a vision that a hot woman would one day enter his favorite restaurant at 809. So one day his dream finally comes true although it turns out the girl in question is a gigantic prick. Not to worry though Chris Johnson can see in the future WITH HIS MIND POWER and thus imagine every possible way to win the hot woman's heart since everybody knows the surefire way to long term relationships is to hide your personality and put up an act. Sure enough when night comes up they end up in the same bed and thus become lovers forever. Unfortunately this is the exact time European terrorists decide it's a good idea to bomb LA. At least I assume they are European sadly there only was the dubbed version of the movie at my local theater but I think I heard one of them speaking German and another had his lips perfectly in sync with his voice so he was probably French. Their motive is never explained. Thus begins a convoluted by which I mean SHITTY plot involving the two main characters making huge sacrifices for each other since they are True Loves and the bad guys being terribly retarded accompanied by some of the worst CGI I've seen in the last few years along with horrible acting although admittedly judgement is always clouded in dubbed movies. To top it all off the ending is OBVIOUS.Apart from Jessica Biel's beautiful body and the comic relief brought by Cage's haircut there is absolutely nothing remotely interesting in this movie it simply is a gigantic waste of time and money. Tamahori made Mullholand Falls Cage made hell he's acted great in tons of awesome movies so I can only assume Next was intentionally made in order to crush the very minds of its viewers then Tamahori can make a movie about it and get tonsa cash there I discovered the whole plan. I will never sleep again until I get my 6 euros back.";

Can't she get any better work? Oh and the 'twist' at the end. For a moment I thought they we're actually going to do something clever. No it just gets sillier as yet again they arbitrarily break with the rules they've created. No French terrorists waiting this time though there should be.Yes it's entertaining enough if that's all you want but disappointing in so many areas.It makes you wonder if Hollywood is such a dog eat dog world where only the most talented survive how it can turn out so many dogs of films like this.

But in reality they were thinking they were going to be seeing something much different maybe spiderman 3 or something who knows. At no point was this movie hailed as having 250 million dollar budget. The acting was fair come on can't have people acting legitimate in a science fiction movie. Most go wouldn't the Fed's go other routes this my friend is a movie made for entertainment purposes. Want the real raw deal go to the nonfiction section. The term fiction to me means not real. So get over that. The effects are good at all points till the barge which is not all that. The producers could have gone with another actress to play the love interest or given her more to go with. The movie did play her as desperate seeing how she slept with our star so quickly. But it is a 90 minute movie format so you can't draw it out. The chemistry between the two is also not in the best I've seen category. When together they didn't seem to mesh well and the scene did feel kinda not there. Okay now for this two minute nonsense I have been reading about. The rules never change they are the same. He can just manipulate his ability and maybe he just never pushed himself before to do all those cool tricks Plus not many endings can we say that we really have no idea how it ends got an idea but like he says at the end once you look at the future it changes thats not a spoiler thats fact. Instance of that is me telling you that the road is wet you will than slow down instead of speeding. That is how this film ends shows you one way it could completely void of the real ending. Its Nice. I would see it again. Not a lot of drama thank goodness good action about time. You want effects to go wow at wait till May 4th. The ending was kind of abruptjust thrown in your face. And when you are sitting there watching the credits run backwards you feel ripped off. Than you think if they did it all over again it would not be interesting based off all the stuff he did initially before his time jump back mentally you can gather that he will win at saving the girl and the state of New York because now his girlfriend is out of danger. The ending also leaves the movie open for a sequel or maybe a back door pilot deal for some network. Who knows. Anyway that's my deal. Hope it helps. Here is my closing when complaining about the reality of some science fiction movie and the how's and the why's and the that would never happen. Remember that its just a movie and is fake. People take movies so literal almost like the word of God. It is not and should never happen. When did going to a movie have to be so difficult. Most critics butcher all the good ones and appraise the horrible ones that is because if they didn't no one would see it. Simple as that. The most worst movies or boring movies always get the top prizes. Come on now. When wanting to see a movie don't look for someone else's take on it forget that don't take someone else's word for it yours is the only one that matters. Because its your 9.25 no one else's.

	schema:headline " This is a horrible movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me list the many reasons I hate this movie. Let's first start with the blatant rip offs. First the opening credits start with the same splices of the city of Las Vegas and even the same song as the TV show Las Vegas. This piece of slime flick also steals from the classic A Clock Work Orange by prying the heroes eyes open with similar eye prying gizmos to force him to watch news clips instead of porn and violence. These are light offenses that might have been foregiven if not for the ending. The ending of this movie was one of the most unforgivable endings ever presented to film. I cant help but believe that the original ending was so denounced and such a utter failure with their preview audiences that they felt the need to cut off the last twenty minutes of the film. If this hasn't scared you from seeing the film read no more. The surprise of whats to come might somehow impress you. Somehow I hope you feel the same as me. Now I could concentrate my criticisms of this horrible film to all of its ridiculous aspects like how Cage's character decides to send all the troops to investigate one location while he searches all the rest when he could have easily investigated them all and one of his troops ends up being killed. But I could have overlooking all of this films problems if not for the ending. I have never seen an ending that have caused more groans in an audience. This film didn't create just one ending groan but two. The first occurs because everything that has occurred for the last 30 minutes is going to be repeated. The second occurred because the audience was confronted with the fact that the film just ended. This film is the equivalent of watching Ground Hogs Day only the secquence to get thru the day is something like 30 minutes of real time and the file ends after he awakes realizing that it still Ground Hogs Day. This film sucks.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let me list the many reasons I hate this movie. Let's first start with the blatant rip offs. First the opening credits start with the same splices of the city of Las Vegas and even the same song as the TV show Las Vegas. This piece of slime flick also steals from the classic A Clock Work Orange by prying the heroes eyes open with similar eye prying gizmos to force him to watch news clips instead of porn and violence. These are light offenses that might have been foregiven if not for the ending. The ending of this movie was one of the most unforgivable endings ever presented to film. I cant help but believe that the original ending was so denounced and such a utter failure with their preview audiences that they felt the need to cut off the last twenty minutes of the film. If this hasn't scared you from seeing the film read no more. The surprise of whats to come might somehow impress you. Somehow I hope you feel the same as me. Now I could concentrate my criticisms of this horrible film to all of its ridiculous aspects like how Cage's character decides to send all the troops to investigate one location while he searches all the rest when he could have easily investigated them all and one of his troops ends up being killed. But I could have overlooking all of this films problems if not for the ending. I have never seen an ending that have caused more groans in an audience. This film didn't create just one ending groan but two. The first occurs because everything that has occurred for the last 30 minutes is going to be repeated. The second occurred because the audience was confronted with the fact that the film just ended. This film is the equivalent of watching Ground Hogs Day only the secquence to get thru the day is something like 30 minutes of real time and the file ends after he awakes realizing that it still Ground Hogs Day. This film sucks.";

If you're not the kind of person who agrees with point 5.IM  obviously not very  HO Next is a terribly well made picture. All central performances are good and the direction and editing are for the most spot on. It's a fairly daft piece of pure entertainment which retains some intelligence without ever loosing its light touch.It's the kind of mainstream Hollywood movie I wish there was more of and it's way better than most of the movies I've seen in 2008  so although it's really only an 8.6 I gave it a 9.If DejaVu put you off the time travel and scifi thing  Next is superior in every single way and even if you're not a Philp K Dick completist  anytime you want to spend a satisfying 96 minutes in a movie theatre or in front of your 50 Plasma  unless you've ticked one of the above boxes you could do much much worse.".

She was also a very disciplined actress who used her tightly controlled body to convey emotional depths and subtle nuances. Even in what for her was a rather minor film she is a marvel to watch beyond superlatives exhausting all adjectives. She is simply Garbo and that is enough.For sheer exoticism few Hollywood male stars of the period could compete with Garbo. Nils Asther was one of these. Although Scandinavian something about the bone structure of his face made him ideal for Asian roles. He had already enjoyed much success as a matinee idol by the time WILD ORCHIDS was filmed. A fine actor he seems loath to accede all of the viewers' attention to Garbo. Swedes both they must have had some interesting private conversations on the set. Asther makes his characterization of the Prince a compelling blend of charm  cowardice  a creature quite capable of seducing his sultry costar into marital infidelity. The onset of talkies would prove difficult for Asther his heavy accent making it hard for MGM to cast him effectively and he would eventually return to Sweden. However when given the right role as in Frank Capra's THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN 1933 Asther was able to exhibit the natural talent he was seldom called upon to use.Lewis Stone is the solid fulcrum over which his two extravagant costars teeter. While they exude passion  sensuality he revels in the simpler virtues  duty dignity and when he finally catches on to the Prince's depredations righteous wrath. He manages to infuse all this with a quiet sense of befuddled humor which only makes his character all the more human.The film's first rate production values make the heat  hedonism of Java come alive for the viewer. The Javanese dancing is of particular interest. The use of sound effects in this late silent film is of some significance  they perfectly illustrate where some film purists thought the cinema should remain with music and effects but definitely no dialogue.".

	schema:headline " Vintage Garbo in Predictable Silent Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "While Wild Orchids is not a major classic the film does illustrate the magic of the Silents at their peak. Within a few minutes director Sidney Franklin establishes the vulnerable relationship between Lewis Stone a businessman with an interest in commerce and hunting and Greta Garbo his younger and neglected wife. The couple embarks on a sea voyage to Java in search of tea plantations and competition for Garbo's affection soon appears in the guise of an exotic prince. Stone's apparent and puzzling preoccupation with business over his beautiful wife is hard to fathom. Garbo could be described as Stone's trophy wife and trophy she is. As garbed by Adrian and photographed by William H. Daniels Garbo would be a prized trophy for any man or woman anywhere any time.Once aboard ship with the same economy of style used to illustrate the marriage of Lillie and John Sterling Franklin quickly sketches the character of Nils Asther the Javanese prince. Garbo watches in horror as Asther whips a servant outside his cabin and his dark eyes and pencilthin mustache speak volumes. Although too pretty and occasionally fey to be totally convincing as a Lothario Asther works hard at befriending Stone and seducing his wife. Unfortunately Stone's indifference towards his wife only helps propel this film down a familiar road.The Danish Asther as the Javanese Prince De Gace is as Asian as the realm he rules which was conjured in the frenzied minds of MGM's art directors. The welcome banquet is reminiscent of the feast in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but without the snakes and eyeballs. At one point Garbo dons a local costume and although she fails to charm her husband she does presage her subsequent appearance opposite Stone once again as Mata Hari. Despite Asther's occasional lapses the performances of the three leads are naturalistic. Stone is always solid and dependable and Garbo well she is always captivating whenever on screen. While not among her greatest Wild Orchids is vintage Garbo representative of silent films at their best and worthy entertainment.".

	schema:headline " MGM gets its money's worth out of Garbo in 1929";
	schema:reviewBody "MGM had Greta Garbo quite busy making films during 1928 and 1929 as the studio saw the approach of sound film possibly destroying one of their top assets. Nobody knew what the outcome of Garbo's career would be at the time.Thus Greta Garbo made silents until 1930's Anna Christie. This silent film is not really silent at all. It has a very sophisticated score for its time including sound effects crowd noises and even singing during musical numbers with long shots of the singers so you can't see that there is no true synchronization with the singers themselves.The story is that of 50ish John Sterling Lewis Stone and his young wife Lillie Greta Garbo. The two are embarking on a cruise to Java so that John can mix business with pleasure. His business is to look over some plantations that he may buy. The pleasure is his desire to hunt and shoot a tiger while in Java. On the boat the couple meet Prince De Gace played by Nils Asther. John is by no means a neglectful husband but at age 50 he has largely left his romantic days behind him. This makes Lillie a likely target for the charming prince and his silver tongue. He makes a play for her right off the bat and continues his chase as the Sterlings remain guests in his home. Lillie is torn but tries her best to avoid the prince and his advances. One night during their stay after returning from a day of looking at plantations John sees the silhouettes of the prince and Lillie on the drawn shade of the house just after the prince has grabbed her for a quick kiss. What will John do about this situation? The acting in this film is quite well done. Asther comes across well as the slimy but attractive prince and Lewis Stone was a wonderful silent actor. His surprise when he first sees the couple in an embrace and his look of both great disdain and knowing when he later sees the prince flirting with a servant girl says it all. Yet like Garbo some of his best performances would come with talking pictures where he could both artfully play the cad in the MGM precodes as well as Judge Hardy of the Andy Hardy series fame.Existing prints of this film are quite well preserved and I highly recommend it for silent film enthusiasts.".

It returns her to familiar territory about a love triangle set in far away Java A land of magic beauty  cursed with heat  relentless heat. With Garbo pitted between two male costars Lewis Stone white hair dark mustache and Nils Asther dark exotic features and mustache who happen to be the only performers credited in the cast while others whether acting as chauffeur steward or Javanese servants their roles go without billing. Released minus spoken dialog from its principal players WILD ORCHIDS filmed in late silent film tradition contains some spoken words Goodbye from crowded extras during its opening scene at the dock Don't forget to write from another offscreen vocalizing to the theme song You Are Like Wild Orchids sound effects and grunting sounds of dancing natives and of course the roaring of the MGM lion on the logo during its fadein. As for the film itself this has the possibilities of a fine early talkie but as it stands Garbo was to remain silent for another year on screen.The photoplay centers upon a young woman named Lillie Greta Garbo who accompanies John Sterling Lewis Stone her middleaged businessminded husband on a ship bound for the Orients where he's assigned to inspect plantations in Java. As Lillie heads over towards the dock so she could have one last look at San Francisco down the hallway she witnesses the whipping by fellow passenger the exotic Prince De Gac Nils Asther on his unfortunate servant outside his cabin. Seeing his brutal measures witnessed by an attractive woman De Gace ceases as she passes him in disgust. Unable to get the woman out of his mind the prince gets through to her by becoming acquainted with her husband by discussing business that eventually has him inviting the Sterlings as his personal guests in his luxurious palace East of Java. In spite of her pleas not to go John agrees on the invitation so he and the Prince can go hunting tigers together. When John discovers the Prince is interested in making advances on wife he then has more than tiger hunting on his mind.While not up to Garbo's earlier successes namely FLESH AND THE DEVIL 1927 WILD ORCHIDS is at times satisfactory but suffers from over length of mediocre sequences such as the King and I type gathering at the palace dining room where the Sterlings are entertained by group of sword dancing natives though repetitious love scenes between Garbo and Asther with possibilities of getting caught in the act by the husband do add to some suspense. With the first half hour taking place on a luxury liner the duration of the story giving viewers an eyeful of its luxurious Java estate lavish sets large stairways and revealing fashions from Garbo's 1920s attire even letting her hair down looking as she did in her films of the 1930s to something more exotic to impress her husband who in turn tells her to take off that junk! Though the plot is slow going at times it picks up again following a promising opening to its near climax that parallels FLESH AND THE DEVIL as wife rushes out to prevent the possible fatal showdown between the men in her life.Considering WILD ORCHIDS is an unfamiliar Garbo film in itself or MGM's for that matter it did become Garbo's first film from the silent era to be distributed on tape enclosed in plastic clam shell and yellow cover in 1985 through MGMUA Home Video. The video print at 119 minutes is 20 minutes longer than the 100 minute presentation on Turner Classic Movies which might indicate correct silent film projection speed transferred on video or trimmed scenes or shorter reissue prints acquired on cable television. Overall a worthy rediscovery of a motion picture produced during the dawn of sound with actors doing their all by holding audience attention whether through illicit affairs or hunting tigers though none actually acquire any wild orchids in the moonlight.

	schema:reviewBody "Two 1929 Garbo features from the same source in both of which she is supported by Nils Asther are Wild Orchids and The Single Standard. The first is the better movie and the better print but both have their magical moments. It's difficult to make an engrossing plot with only three characters but Willis Goldbeck and company have succeeded where many another scenarist has failed even though only two of his people splendidly enacted here by Greta Garbo and Lewis Stone are what purists would call rounded characters. The third is straight from stock but Nils Asther gives his spoiledrotten Javanese price unexpected depth by playing the villainous seducer with a genuine smile a heartfelt shrug. One has the impression that he doesn't really care whether he seduces Garbo or not. It's just a game. The movie is stylishly directed by Sidney Franklin who takes full advantage of the many wonderful sets and beautifully photographed by William Daniels who is pleasingly no slave to consistency.

	onyx:emotionText "Two 1929 Garbo features from the same source in both of which she is supported by Nils Asther are Wild Orchids and The Single Standard. The first is the better movie and the better print but both have their magical moments. It's difficult to make an engrossing plot with only three characters but Willis Goldbeck and company have succeeded where many another scenarist has failed even though only two of his people splendidly enacted here by Greta Garbo and Lewis Stone are what purists would call rounded characters. The third is straight from stock but Nils Asther gives his spoiledrotten Javanese price unexpected depth by playing the villainous seducer with a genuine smile a heartfelt shrug. One has the impression that he doesn't really care whether he seduces Garbo or not. It's just a game. The movie is stylishly directed by Sidney Franklin who takes full advantage of the many wonderful sets and beautifully photographed by William Daniels who is pleasingly no slave to consistency. If he wants to vary his lighting in the same setup from shimmering on Miss Garbo to blackaspitch on Mr Asther he does so!";

	schema:reviewBody "Well this is an early Garbo so of course its historically significant. IMDb shows this as Lanaguage  English... although honestly its a SILENT with some sound effects and a prerecorded song added here and there They add in a track of the crowd yelling and waving goodbye as the cruise ship pulls away from the dock. and in several places they show the actors speaking lines but we are never shown the cards for what the actor has just said. Was it edited for length or something?? Garbo Lewis Stone and Nils Asther star in a silly little plot where the Prince tries to seduce the wife of his guest. If you do the math Lewis Stone was 25 years older than Garbo so the age difference probably explains why in the story the Prince is seen as extra attractive in spite of his cruelty which Lillie Garbo witnessed. Directed by Sidney Franklin who had a long prolific career directing and producing. It's important to see Garbo and Lewis Stone made some great films as well Grand Hotel ! Catch it on Turner Classics now and then. It's pretty good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wild Orchids casts Greta Garbo as the younger wife of Lewis Stone and they are bound for what was then called the Dutch East Indies. On the ship they meet a Javanese potentate Nils Asther a fellow Swede to Garbo who looks seductively at Garbo and that's all she wrote.There's a wonderful scene in Wild Orchids where Garbo encounters Asther giving a beating to one of his servants who did not move as quickly as he would like. Garbo may have had the best face for closeups in the history of cinema. Remember this is a silent film so no dialog but the looks Asther gives her and her closeups a mixture of horror at the barbarity but fascination with the man tells more than 50 pages of dialog or title cards.Asther invites her to Javanese palace and Garbo and Stone are loving it. But eventually Stone catches on and it all comes to a climax during a tiger hunt.Asther got to do another Asian portrayal in Frank Capra's The Bitter Tea Of General Yen. Some interesting roles for a Scandinavian yet another of his countryman Warner Oland also played a noted Oriental with Charlie Chan.Lewis Stone has the distinction of being the player who did the most appearances with Garbo. He comes over well as the concerned and most jealous husband.Definitely a must for Garbo fans and those wanting to get acquainted with her work.".

Of course Greta GarboLillie Sterling looked very sexy and rather young and having an old looking husband who was Lewis StoneJohn Sterling who loved and adored everything about Lillie. Things go smoothly for a while in the jungle but a two legged gigolo decides to have some fun with young and hot looking Lillie.

Nils Aster portrays a Javanese Prince who clearly has self control issues. He not only beats his servants but even attempts to seduce Greta Garbo when he realizes she is being neglected by her husband. His repugnant behavior towards her border on attempted rape. The Synchronized Score is pleasing. I especially like the theme song You Are Like Wild Orchids which is played and sung several times. The native Javanese song and dance sections however are quite strange and features unpleasant discordant melodies. The removal of that sequence from the film would have improved the picture tremendously.".
