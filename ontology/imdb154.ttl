	schema:reviewBody "Mike Myers can't seem to get enough of himself in The Love Guru. He's constantly giggling at his own jokes and mugging for the camera as if he thinks his latest comedy creation is the funniest thing he's invented. I had a very different reaction. Pitka was born in America and traveled to India to study under the crosseyed Guru Tugginmypudah Ben Kingsley who taught his students lessons by having them hit each other with urinesoaked mops. Pitka devotes his life and his teachings to helping other people out with their relationship troubles and hopes his words of wisdom will become so popular he'll wind up on Oprah.This is information we learn early on in the film after Pitka serenades us with a Bollywoodstyle musical number of Dolly Parton's Nine to Five during the opening credits and I pretty much knew right there that The Love Guru was going to be a very long 90 minutes. The movie makes a grave miscalculation with its lead character. Guru Pitka is not funny or likable. It's simply Myers talking in a funny accent and coming up with as many alternate ways for saying penis as he can without losing the film's PG13 rating. Pitka is not even a real character. Myers plays him more as an experiment as if he's still testing the character out and we the audience are the guinea pigs being subjected to the experiment. It's been widely reported that the reason why Myers hasn't done a live action film in five years is because he's been fine tuning his Guru Pitka at various comedy clubs until he felt he was ready. He was not ready and he probably should have spent another five years if the end result is any indication.Pitka is approached by Jane Bullard Jessica Alba the owner of the struggling Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Her star player Darren Roanoke Romany Malco hasn't been performing up to the best of his abilities ever since his wife Prudence Meagan Good left him for the goalie on the rival team  a French player named Jacques Le Coq Grande Justin Timberlake embarrassing himself here who is known for his oversized manhood as much as he's known for his talent in the game. The character exists simply so that Myers and coscreenwriter Graham Gordy can have the characters say cock a lot more than humanly necessary. The Maple Leafs have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup but not if Darren doesn't have his head in the game. The team's pintsized coach Verne Troyer doubts that Pitka can turn the situation around but the Guru is determined to help. He'll do this by finding a way to distract Darren from his problems By forcing him to watch two elephants having sex thereby taking his mind off of his problems with his wife. You figure it out. and help him confront his overbearing mother Telma Hopkins who has long cast a shadow over the star player.The Love Guru is not a comedy it is a cry of desperation on behalf of Myers and everyone involved. Comedy is funniest when it seems to come naturally out of the material but everything seems so forced and strained here. It's almost like if they can't think of something funny to do they'll throw in elephants humping each other or light a midget on fire. And if that doesn't work they'll throw in another couple references to male genitalia. If there's a bigger cry of comic desperation than limp innuendo humor then it has to be out of the blue musical numbers that are not funny in themselves the movie just expects us to laugh at the fact that the characters are suddenly singing for no reason. You know I think I'm going to have to take that last statement back. There's an even more desperate form of comedy and that would have to be building an entire scene around the fact that Guru Pitka has a different kind of food stuck in his beard each time we see him building up to a sight gag where his entire beard is cotton candy. This movie has so many scenes of just plain wrongheaded desperation you'd almost think it was intentional.While Myers cackles and mugs his face with glee pretending that he's having a great time the rest of the cast kind of look like they wish they were somewhere else. Jessica Alba looks uncomfortable and her scenes where she's supposed to be warming up to Pitka look more like she's hanging out with him out of pity more than anything else. It's not unusual in a comedy to have the supporting players stand in the background so the star can do his thing but the cast here seem just as confused as I was as to what we were supposed to be watching Myers doing. There is not a single laugh or moment of inspiration in The Love Guru. It's just a sad depressing slog through material that's not funny to start with taken by actors who seem to know it's not funny. It's bad enough when a comedy can't generate any laughs but it gets even worse when you start feeling sorry for everyone up on the screen. You want to ask them and their agents what they were thinking when they signed up. You want to remind Myers of just how funny he can be and why this material and character don't suit him. But most of all you want to be able to somehow turn back time to before you gave the ticket counter your money walk back out the door and figure out another way to spend 90 minutes.".

	schema:headline " Bad karma or just bad moviemaking? The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews I find that it is thrown around far too often especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say without a doubt in my mind that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2 The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by notalents. In comparison The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.With The Love Guru you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy the movie had a likable fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing we get the Guru Pitka a Charles Manson lookalike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson a notorious cult leader as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about life or talking about penises he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters where the Guru doesn't really have any character he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.Speaking of plot the storyline is almost as illconceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every clich ever known to cinemagoers but it is. The Guru has a selfrevelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course Blur's Song 2 plays during one of the hockey sequences which has become the most commonly used and groaninducing tune for any sportsrelated film.Even if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar such as Dick Pants or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of TM after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as MiniMe. Finally there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other the Guru wearing a chastity belt the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine the Guru sticking his head up his own ass which is actually far less funny than it sounds the Guru getting punched in the groin the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar one a rendition of Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 the other a earsplitting variation on Space Cowboy by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs.The other actors are fairly bad although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande although to be fair his character was a onenote joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.It really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy yes but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating so if anything this should be right up my alley. Instead it's the worst movie of the year for sure leaving Meet the Spartans way behind in its dust and has reached it's place for me at least as the worst movie ever created. It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud.".

I'm all in favor of offending PC sensibilities whenever possible but do it right cracks about Keebler elves show are just stupid and artistically lazy.More scenes of young Pitka might have explained better how he grew into the adult he became and Rajneesh could have been fleshed out a bit. I suspect that a lot of character development and back story were left on the cutting room floor. What should have been cut were the cameos that were either pointless or selfreferential without being truly funny.The plot wasn't exactly Citizen Kane quality but it could have worked with better writing. After all if anything cries out for satiric treatment it's the selfhelp and New Age movements. With such targetrich subject matter how did Myers manage to make such a dud? I think that it's a case of plain selfindulgence. Jim Carrey and Robin Williams are two other talented overthetop funny men who do some of their best work when they show restraint and don't play themselves. Someone should have reined in Myers on this one.For his penance I suggest that he lay off comedy for a while and do a few dramatic roles  including supporting ones  as he did quite well in 54. Williams and Carrey have shown other dimensions of themselves in dramatic roles and I'm sure Myers can too.".

For every joke that's funny which are few there is about dozen that are not. Then there's all the jokes we've seen in previous Myers films that aren't so funny the 4th time around when they appear in this flick. Many moments in this film will having you looking around the theater wondering if anyone else finds this movie as stupid as you do.That's really the bottom line. This movie is stupid. Take every fear you've had watching the trailer times it by 10 and you will get an idea of how bad this film is.By the way the hockey in this movie will leave any one who loves the game sick to there stomach. The hockey portrayal left me in tears. Its brutal ! The film is a HUGE slap in the face to hockey. Thanks Mike Myers ! On a positive note though Justin Timberlake and Stephen Colbert are hilarious. The only time i enjoyed the movie at all was when they were on screen. I never thought in a million years I would leave a movie saying  Thank God Justin Timberlake was is it.In short  this movie is terrible ! Don't believe me ?

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been told that if you have nothing good to say don't say anything at all. So I have to tell you all the best parts of the new Michael Myers vehicle The Love Guru. You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given. If Jacques le coq Grande had his own film I'd pay to see it. Being that he is included in one that relies on physical humor asinine wordplay sexual innuendo and Myers making a complete idiot of himself as he kills the funny out of every only slightly funny gag he does Timberlake becomes the only reason I can say it was worth going to a free preview. The Love Guru is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen and once I'm done writing this review I am going to crawl into bed and cry as I remember So I Married an Axe Murderer and the times when Myers could do no wrong thanks for the Wayne's World callback Mike you actually made me realize how inferior this film is more.There is truly no point in describing a plot because there isn't one. The film exists as a series of setpieces allowing Myers to act up his schtick and try to cause uproarious laughter in the audience. Besides some faint giggles at the fact that Myers himself smiles and winks at the camera telling us he just told a joke there is not too much to go on here. Sure there is a ton of uncomfortable laughter and gasps of awe at the wordplaycan't face said real fast to sound likeahemthat you are shocked to hear in a PG13 film but does that really make you think the this was a success? I mean the main focus is supposed to be the idea that Pitka has been hired to get the star player on the Toronto Maple Leafs back with his exgirlfriend so that his hockey skills will return and win his owner the second generation of a cursed family Stanley's Cup. You almost believe this thread has some merit until the resolution is glossed over quickly and rectified without the bat of an eye. The thing is held together by concert interludes of Myers singing in his way overthetop Indian accent for entire songs. Can you say filler? Although I will admit More Than Words was fantastic especially the visual nods to the actual Extreme video. I might be wrapping this review up quickly to rest. My neck has some pain from too much shaking out of embarrassment for those collecting their paychecks on the screen. You could literally see the caching dollar signs popping out of their eyeballs with every awkward moment. Some of the sight gags were funny the first time they were used. I enjoyed the motorized magic carpet the utter stupidity of Verne Troyer's office being half size and the Kelestrator of course I wonder why they didn't TM that one. Admittedly though this is not my kind of comedy. While I enjoy a good lowbrow laughfest like the next guy I still would rather have a somewhat decently constructed story something this tale lacks completely. Had the gags been separated and shown on a TV skit show I might be calling them genius however when you string them together with the only common denominator being that the same characters are used it gets old fast. Unfortunately this film will work for a good chuck of America but I just can't condone the spending of millions of dollars on something so trite and unenjoyable as this packaged and sold mess.Now I don't want to leave Timberlake as the only good thing here. That would be doing a disservice to Manu Narayan who played Myers' assistant. With spoton timing and perfect facial expressions it was good to see someone having fun playing off of the grotesque guru. A nice companion he actually makes Pitka better each time they are doing a skit together. I'm not really sure what to say about Myers himself. On one hand he totally commits to this character and must be given credit for that fact. The problem is though that the role itself is paperthin and very very tiresome. As for Romany Malco our second leadalthough he got the shaft of no topbillinghe does well for what he has been given. Come on man you were in the amazing 40Year Old Virgin and have a hit TV show Weeds for which you are a big part of its success. Please take the time to do some work that has merit. I mean wow who'd have thought I'd be saying Get Smart might be your best movie option this weekend.Oh and Ben Kingsleycan I have a word? I am going to have to take away your knighthood. Yes I know how much you like it and how hard you worked to achieve the title but I can't allow someone with as little self respect as you keep the Sir. Why oh why would you continue to do drivel like this? You are an Academy Award winning thespian. I can only hope The Wackness is as good as it seems so you may redeem a little bit of that respect in my eyes.".

It was about random things but DID have an over all plot. The love guru tried to restore a couple while trying to find out about his own love. Many people can relate to these jokes of religion and meditating and you may even learn a thing or too but again don't take all things 100. If you can carefully interpret what the movies motifs are then you will think it is a good move.Overall this is a movie of puns and if you like mike myers you will most probably enjoy this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "OF COURSE this movie was going to be silly comedy. Its mike myers!!!! I entered this movie having no idea what was going to come out and maybe thats why i loved it. It was about random things but DID have an over all plot. The love guru tried to restore a couple while trying to find out about his own love. Many people can relate to these jokes of religion and meditating and you may even learn a thing or too but again don't take all things 100. If you can carefully interpret what the movies motifs are then you will think it is a good move.Overall this is a movie of puns and if you like mike myers you will most probably enjoy this movie.";

Well Mike Myers I have no choice I really wanted to slap the heck out of him when I was watching this painful movie. Now I'm convinced that Mike must have some obsession with the penis because there are so many penis jokes in this movie it just becomes painfully unfunny. Now there was a decent audience in the movie theater like twenty something people I did not hear one laugh seriously I even kept sighing wondering when this movie was going to be over. Five people left early complaining I wished I had joined them but something inside me was just hoping that something would make me laugh I was really pulling for Mike but he has just made me so unhappy with this bad movie that was just his pathetic attempt of constantly reminding people of his good comedic days.Guru Pitka is a self help guru who is very successful but he is ranked as the number two self help guru of the world. The only way he feels like he can be successful is to be on Oprah. So he has to save a man Darran on a loosing hockey team in Canada to get him back with his ex girlfriend who is with this cocky winning goalie Jacques Grande. Guru also meets the owner of the team Jane who he just falls for so in order for him to get famous he has to get Darran back with his girl and the team will start winning.Yeah I'm serious that's the plot sad isn't it? I just seriously cannot believe how low Mike Myers has sunk the cast was bad and the story was just I don't think it was even existent. Now I hate it when people call movies racist without even thinking what the movie is supposed to be but you know what?! I was friggin' offended by this movie it was just plan sad Mike Myers has lost his game and cannot admit it. He should have just stuck to the animated voices because his characters now are just lame. There is nothing I could say more than please just stay away from this film I know I said this before but this is just a painful and unfunny movie. Good luck to Mike Myers he'll need it big time after more critics review this bad movie.110".

Going in with low expectations I actually found myself laughing VERY hard at certain parts of the film.Sure most of the humor is stolen straight out of the Austin Powers series but it's still funny. The performances by Mike Myers Justin Timberlake and Verne Troyer are hilarious. Mike Myers is great as always and Timberlake is surprisingly very funny. The interaction between Myers and Troyer stolen straight from AP is absolutely hilarious.If you're looking for a deep thoughtprovoking movie you're going to be sadly disappointed. But if you can't tell that from the preview then maybe you should get your head checked out. The movie is all about moments and plays out like a long SNL sketch. If you can leave your mind at the door and accept the toilet humor you might find yourself enjoying it.Most people reviewing the film 110 have probably not even bothered to see it. Others are coming on the board and marking high ratings as not useful and lower ratings as useful. I will bet money that many people find review not useful by just looking at the 7 stars I gave it. There are many people just destined to see this movie fail because they think it looks stupid. See the movie for yourself and don't allow others who haven't even SEEN the film tell you that it's awful.".

To go from playing Gandhi to this is just so so so sad.The presence of two gratuitous antigay jokes turned an otherwise innocuous movie into an unpleasant experience. Call me crazy but I don't go to the expense of going to a theatre in order to be insulted. Do Mike Meyers and this film's makers think that gay audience members LIKE to be insulted as we sit there watching their movies? which we PAID to see!! I thought the Guru Pitka schtick might be fun but it wasn't. The only bright spots were Justin Timberlake as a Lothario Quebecquer and the fairly fun Bollywoodstyle Indian dance number at the end of the movie.

There are lot of crude jokes but who cares we like a rude jokes time to time.

Even the character Your Holiness the Guru Pitka was unlikeable which is a first for a Mike Myers character. He was so full of himself so damn selfish no one cared if he succeeded. His gigglefits were too common to spark a slight giggle from the audience. And although the women in the film were pure eyecandy Jessica Alba Meagan Good even Mariska Hargitay and Jessica Simpson made cameos they became little more than that with such a flat script. Sorry Mike. Maybe next time. A fourth Austin Powers would be quite a way to get back in the game with your biggest fans".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm glad I wasn't in the UK's Celebrity Big Brother House this year. Not because I wouldn't have enjoyed meeting some of the others but because at one stage fellow house mate Verne Troyer might have asked me about the last film he did with his best friend and I wouldn't be comfortable lying to him and denying that I thought The Love Guru was a cinematic mutant mistakenly allowed to live and breathe rather than be put to a merciful sleep in the development stage.Hey I like Mike Myers. He has a measure of talent and charisma and likability and I applaud his deserved financial and critical success with the Wayne's World and Austin Powers films though he went one movie too far with Goldmember. Having said that Myers like his fellow SNL alumnus Will Ferrell is like a kid wandering about a shop eating food off the shelves and generally behaving like someone in desperate need of supervision and guidance. Let's be honest Ferrell's last decent leading role was in Anchorman 2004 and while he's been fine in supporting work like The Producers 2005 everything else that he's had a hand in has been a series of embarrassments of varying levels. And sadly Myers can too easily fall into the same degree of arrested development.People who know me know that I may go on about a lot of bad movies but more often than not I enjoyed watching them and perversely can watch them again. This one however I'm ashamed that I ever wasted bandwidth getting it let alone consider watching it again.Myers' characters have always been onenote with a limited appeal. But his latest Guru Pitka went too far when he thought of writing it down in comparison his Beatnik poet Charlie from So I Married An Axe Murderer 1993 was a character of multilayered nuance and more importantly one that people would much rather watch. The very concept should have been seen as potentially execrable and insulting to Hindus. Yes I know he tries to get around this in the movie by claiming that Pitka wasn't really a Hindu but an American raised by Hindus but like so much else in this movie that attempt fails miserably given what passes for humor.Hey I like Dumb Humor  when it's done right. Dodgeball Epic Movie Jay and Silent Bob. But the gags in The Love Guru come in three flavors racist gross and infantile and in various mixtures thereof. The racist names he came up with Harenmahkeester Satchabigknoba is the sort of thing an ignorant tenyearold kid would come up with to make the other ignorant tenyearold kids in the playground laugh. Yes isn't it hilarious that Indian people all have big long names? The rest of the atrocity is filled with other dodgy names like Coach Cherkov and Dick Pants as well as alleged jokes about snot balls and nose hairs humping elephants food prepared to look like genitals and buckets of urine  all of which probably would have sounded funny in 1988 in the writers' brainstorming sessions in the SNL offices at 3am when you're doped up on caffeine but I honestly can't believe that a 45yearold man wrote this crap down in 2008 and thought this would be funny in any other circumstances.And the execution of these socalled gags is almost consistently accompanied by Myers with the same sort of mugging grin to the camera that he perfected with Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers  the difference here being that those other characters had moments where they really were humorous but seeing Myers try it with Pitka is akin to watching an inept magician fail every trick but still take a rehearsed bow after each one oblivious to the negative reaction he's getting from his audience. And worse he drives the jokes so deep into the ground again and again you expect them to bump into Hilary Swank piloting her subterranean machine around the Earth's Core.And the storyline carrying these nongags like the sores on the back of a leper is just as awful a guru seeking fame and a spot on Oprah counsels a Canadian hockey player who wants to win back his wife from a rival Jacques Le Coq Grande who apparently is wellendowed Get it? Le Coq Grande?. Another lesson to learn Mike Sports Themes Aren't Funny. Canadian Sports Themes Aren't Funny Cubed. It may give you the chance to hang about with your heroes but it's a waste of time for the rest of us. Some have tried to point out the satire in Pitka's selfhelp philosophies but satire only works when it makes a point and doesn't just appear indistinguishable from the targets it's allegedly satirizing.In case I haven't made it clear this is a Bad Film. Not So Bad It's Good like The Oxford Murders 2008. This is embarrassing on levels I haven't seen in ages. Some bad movies have people in it who can rise above the mediocrity but this one is like quicksand sucking people down and suffocating them. And I'm not talking about the likes of Verne Troyer Jessica Alba and Justin Timberlake who were basically employees who probably needed the money or the cameos from Oprah and Val Kilmer. I'm talking about Ben Fking Kingsley.How does a respected Oscar winner go from playing Gandhi to playing Guru Tugginmypudha?".

	schema:headline " The Best East German Film Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "The Holocaust has been told in many different ways. We have seen the brutality of it in documentaries on cable as well as in a number of contemporary films. The visuals of Aryan supremacy in Leni Reifenstahl's Nazi propaganda films images of mountains of dead Jews and extremely inhumane conditions in death camps in Schindler's List serve not merely to drive the film narrative but stir our emotions as well. These images have conditioned us to read such films and documentaries using stereotypes of both the Jews and the Nazi  Jews are good and the Nazi evil. The film Jakob the Liar explores the holocaust in a new light presenting antiSemitism in a relatively subtle way without compromising its substance as well as the film's power to move human emotion.The music is monotonous suggesting the monotony of the protagonists' lives in the ghetto. Shots are limited to medium shots and lots of closeups making one feel claustrophobic enveloped and asphyxiated even. This immensely adds to an atmosphere of hopelessness and despair. Closeups also give specific information about the character their feelings the way they live the things they've gone thought and their relationships with each other. The personal information provided us makes us develop a sense of closeness with the characters. Midway in the film we already have a bond with the characters we already know their real feelings despite the lightness surrealistic and oftentimes humorous treatment of the scenes. It is also quite extraordinary to depict the Nazi they way this film did considering that this is a holocaust film and one of the first East German film to tackle the subject. Unlike in other film where the Nazis are portrayed as unreasonably evil and sadistic here we are given a glimpse of their humanity. In the introductory scene where a tower guard tells Jakob to report to Gestapo headquarters for not complying with the curfew we saw instances where Jakob would have surely been severely punished or even killed but the officers were surprisingly reasonable and just. One officer caught him eavesdropping but lets him go Jakob then wakes up a sleeping head officer to report his misdemeanor yet even with being irritated for being roused awake he lets Jakob go without a scratch. The towerguard proved wrong lets Jakob go as well. We also saw guards who are not necessarily the perfect Aryan depicted in Riefenstahl films. There was one guard who walks with a limp and another having the runs. There was also a scene where one guard beats up a Jew Kowalski then later returns and drops two sticks of cigarettes for Kowalski  an unspoken apology for having beaten up the Jew. A Nazi apologizing to a Jew in a holocaust film! Is that something or what? But then the film doesn't make us hate the Nazi guards or to view them as the villains in the film. Instead we are made to understand the situation and the circumstance is the real enemy here. This is not a movie pitting the Jews against their Nazi guards like the director's own Naked among Wolves this is a film about a people's struggle to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the hardships they have suffered.The film started with glimpses of the ghetto and Jakob checking out his sick niece all these visuals already gives us an idea of the life of the protagonist and the place he lives in. Then in a very short verbal exchange with one of the ghetto's denizen Jakob gives us a background of his situation that a guard took his watch from him. The guy he was talking to on the other hand warns him about the curfew to which he answers that without his watch has no way to tell time. This sequence tells us that first the guards can take and do take from the Jews anything they want and second that the people are in constant fear of the guards and dare not disobey any rules lest one wants to be severely punished or killed. It also tells us that in the event that Jakob gets killed he will be leaving his young and sick niece to care for herself. The character's actions and mood also imply of a prevailing state of constant fear  whether that of being killed or seeing someone close to you die a meaningless death.The Jews in the film were waiting for an inevitable annihilation a fate they have long accepted until Jakob gave them an alternate view of the future because of his news of a possible liberation by the Russians.Through out the film we are still constantly given pieces of Jewish life before the ghetto. Through flashbacks and what the characters say we are presented concrete glimpses of how their lives of the films protagonists were before the ghetto. We also shown that in the ghetto former actors lawyers businessmen and even people from the church lose their former identities. In the ghetto they are made to wear the star and made to work and follow rules like everybody else albeit their former position or affiliation. Everybody suffers everyone is subjected to the harshness of ghetto life everyday there's no distinction in class social status age andor sex. We see old people doing hard labor children getting sick and eating mere crumbs or pieces of vegetables. We see the protagonists picking flies out of their soup and making a feast out of minced onion and a slice of bread. Frank Bayer told the story and made us feel what the characters felt using visuals  and very powerful visuals at that.".

The personal information provided us makes us develop a sense of closeness with the characters. Midway in the film we already have a bond with the characters we already know their real feelings despite the lightness surrealistic and oftentimes humorous treatment of the scenes. It is also quite extraordinary to depict the Nazi they way this film did considering that this is a holocaust film and one of the first East German film to tackle the subject. Unlike in other film where the Nazis are portrayed as unreasonably evil and sadistic here we are given a glimpse of their humanity. In the introductory scene where a tower guard tells Jakob to report to Gestapo headquarters for not complying with the curfew we saw instances where Jakob would have surely been severely punished or even killed but the officers were surprisingly reasonable and just. One officer caught him eavesdropping but lets him go Jakob then wakes up a sleeping head officer to report his misdemeanor yet even with being irritated for being roused awake he lets Jakob go without a scratch. The towerguard proved wrong lets Jakob go as well. We also saw guards who are not necessarily the perfect Aryan depicted in Riefenstahl films. There was one guard who walks with a limp and another having the runs. There was also a scene where one guard beats up a Jew Kowalski then later returns and drops two sticks of cigarettes for Kowalski  an unspoken apology for having beaten up the Jew. A Nazi apologizing to a Jew in a holocaust film! Is that something or what? But then the film doesn't make us hate the Nazi guards or to view them as the villains in the film. Instead we are made to understand the situation and the circumstance is the real enemy here. This is not a movie pitting the Jews against their Nazi guards like the director's own Naked among Wolves this is a film about a people's struggle to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the hardships they have suffered.The film started with glimpses of the ghetto and Jakob checking out his sick niece all these visuals already gives us an idea of the life of the protagonist and the place he lives in. Then in a very short verbal exchange with one of the ghetto's denizen Jakob gives us a background of his situation that a guard took his watch from him. The guy he was talking to on the other hand warns him about the curfew to which he answers that without his watch has no way to tell time. This sequence tells us that first the guards can take and do take from the Jews anything they want and second that the people are in constant fear of the guards and dare not disobey any rules lest one wants to be severely punished or killed. It also tells us that in the event that Jakob gets killed he will be leaving his young and sick niece to care for herself. The character's actions and mood also imply of a prevailing state of constant fear  whether that of being killed or seeing someone close to you die a meaningless death.The Jews in the film were waiting for an inevitable annihilation a fate they have long accepted until Jakob gave them an alternate view of the future because of his news of a possible liberation by the Russians.Through out the film we are still constantly given pieces of Jewish life before the ghetto. Through flashbacks and what the characters say we are presented concrete glimpses of how their lives of the films protagonists were before the ghetto. We also shown that in the ghetto former actors lawyers businessmen and even people from the church lose their former identities. In the ghetto they are made to wear the star and made to work and follow rules like everybody else albeit their former position or affiliation. Everybody suffers everyone is subjected to the harshness of ghetto life everyday there's no distinction in class social status age andor sex. We see old people doing hard labor children getting sick and eating mere crumbs or pieces of vegetables. We see the protagonists picking flies out of their soup and making a feast out of minced onion and a slice of bread. Frank Bayer told the story and made us feel what the characters felt using visuals  and very powerful visuals at that.";

Jakob is released by the German but overhears a radio broadcasting that the Russians are advancing towards their town. On the next morning his comrade Mischa Henry Hbchen wants to risk his life to steal a couple of potatoes in a German store Jakob tells that the Russians are coming and confides that he has a radio.

Jakob der Lgner is a dramatic film with a beautiful and heartbreaking story of hope and survival in one of the saddest and darkest moments of the contemporary history. The analogy between Jakob's radio that gives hope to his comrades and the cotton balls that helps his niece to live a fairytale is the summit of this tale and the open conclusion where the viewer does not know what he will tell to Lina are amazing.

In any case the original is also good though disappointing if you enjoyed the recent JACOB... The film does offer us the opportunity to see the famous Czech actor V. Brodsky still very active in Czech film and TV. We also see a young late 30s Armin MuellerStahl prior to his defection from Communist East Germany. Interestingly he also starred in the recent remake as the sixtyish doctor in the film. The young romantic played by L.

	schema:reviewBody "Only a very few films have succeeded in treating the plight of the Jews under the Nazis with a sense of humor but this is one of them. Sort of an earlier variation on 'Life is Beautiful' but this is far less saccharine and the humor here is dry and sad not slapstick and wacky. In a Jewish ghetto in 1944 Jacob is brought to the police station for curfew violation. There he hears news on the radio that the Russians are advancing nearer. He uses this hopeful news to stop a fellow ghetto resident from committing sure suicide by trying to steal extra food. But in a moment of foolishness Jacob claims he heard the news on his own secret radio. Soon the entire town is hounding him for positive news and the shy quiet Jacob has become an unwanted celebrity and bringer of hope forcing him into a moral quandary and more lies. The power of this simple fable is enhanced by some very touching flashbacks where we see these now beaten down characters as their lives were just a few years before  full of love laughter food to eat nice homes. Vlastimil Brodsky is great as Jacob even if he's unfortunately dubbed into German. He avoids the traps of sentimentality or selfpity. Right to the end this is an honest and moving tale of trying to retain one's humanity in the face of ever more overwhelming odds. The hardto find DVD could have a better image but the print was apparently in bad shape from ill storage in East Germany. This was the only East German film ever nominated for an Oscar".

Right to the end this is an honest and moving tale of trying to retain one's humanity in the face of ever more overwhelming odds. The hardto find DVD could have a better image but the print was apparently in bad shape from ill storage in East Germany. This was the only East German film ever nominated for an Oscar";

	schema:reviewBody "As you can see in the film different kinds of aesthetics were used to create this kind of environment that the director wants us to experience. By using closeup shots we could see and feel the character's feelings and emotions first hand as if we are right in front of them every detail of it and we can really relate to that kind of scene and that makes the film more personal and upclose to the viewers. Another thing is the claustrophobic environment which depicts the kind of life in the polish ghetto and makes us feel and experience that we are also in that environment. Another interesting shots in these film is the long shot used in the somewhat castle like structure and the clouds in the end part. You could not usually see that in a Frank Beyer film specially that most of his films shows closeup and midranged shots. Another intriguing fact here that's the first ever German Film that I had watched in colored and so does Frank Beyer's first time to use modern technology to enhance his film. The blending of colors as I may say is good and it really enhances the scenes and the character's emotion. You could see that much livelier and lighter colors appears when Jacob and his niece were in a dream sequence so does when people gets hope from the news Jacob brings their faces lightup and so does the surrounding. When it come to the storyline and background of the film you could easily see that the film really focuses on people's reactions emotions and their life as a whole in the ghetto rather than really opposing and getting into the antifascist theme that Beyer usually does in his films. Natzis here portrays a different side of the story as they are somewhat humanized or rather has shown the soft side of the Natzis as rationale beings and considerable ones if I may add. I have also seen the remake of this film the one starred by Robin Williams. I really never thought that this film is much better than the remake. Nothing beats the original.To sum it all up I think it's really one of the best movies Frank Beyer has ever done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jakob der Lgner or Jacob the Liar is an East German 100minute movie from 1974 so this one is already over 40 years old. And unlike many other films from the GDR this one is in color. Then again by the mid1970s this is almost to be taken for granted already. The special aspect about this film is that it is the only GDR film that managed to score an Academy Award nomination a huge success for director Frank Beyer and his cowriter Jurek Becker who also wrote the novel that this film is based on. Went his film came out World War II had been over for 30 years approximately so this is also the gap in time between what we see and when this was made. A bit strange to see now that the gap between today and this film is already over a decade more. It may have been the subject that appealed to the Academy as it plays in the Jewish ghetto in the final years of Nazi Germany. And it is the story of one man the title character a careerdefining performance by Czech actor Vlastimil Brodsk. He is not really known today anymore which is sad because his portrayal here got me curious about other works from him. Other than him most of the cast is German however. Most German cinema fans will have heard of Erwin Geschonneck Armin MuellerStahl and the very young Henry Hbchen. They all add their fair share to make this film a success. I would not call it great or one of the very best I have seen from the year 1974 but it was still a pretty good watch mostly thanks to Brodsk. Go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts with a violin and scenes of the Jewish ghetto. Jakob is one of many Jews in a Germancontrolled Polish ghetto. While walking home one night he is sent by a guard to headquarters. There he hears a brief broadcast that Russian troops are doing well against the Germans. The next day in a desperate attempt to save his friend from committing a rash act and stealing potatoes he tells him of the Russian advance. He twists the story and it soon is believed that he possess a radio. In order to protect his exaggeration he continues to tell more and more lies by pretending he hears them on the radio. His lies have a huge impact on camp but he eventually needs to tell the truth to his friend Kowalski who kills himself out of despair for living another day in the ghetto. The Jakob's lie remains largely undiscovered his street is eventually deported to their presumed death.At the beginning of watching the movie I was quite sick of seeing another German movie about WW2. However this movie was amazing. I like how it toys with the perception of truth. Plenty of truths are told that are harmful and lies are told that are good. Furthermore truth is merely the acceptance of truth and is useful in so far as it accomplishes an act. Though Jakob may never had possessed a radio his initial statements were disbelieved. The same way a cloud is out of water though it is really out of tiny drops of frozen water. Though the obvious interpretation is that life in the ghetto was terrible and that Jakob's lives were pure hearted it's also a statement on underlying scientific notions that we cannot legitimately achieve through personal work what we can do together. That notion is very clear for an East German movie. I enjoyed the way the film cut to flashbacks to explain who characters were. It's a short concise and brilliant method of exposition. The relationships were very welldeveloped. Rosa and Mischa's courtship was handled well. Although it's obviously sincere no reasonable parent would approve of such a love in the ghetto. Though abuses are shown such as when Herschel Schtamm is killed after investigating a boxcar. Much of the movie focuses on the psychological damage forced by isolation poverty and a general racism. The movie knows that abuses are known it's the stories of relationships that aren't as things like letters and radio were banned. For example Uncle Jakob's care for his niece and the niece herself show a compassion. The explanation of his lamp helps to put emphasis on the love of families that was destroyed frankly by any organized government and especially that of the 3rd Reich.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about Indo the Indische Nederlander they are European Asian groups who were born in the colonial era when Dutch ruled Dutch East Indies now IndonesiaThey were legally classified as European but in practice they received discrimination from the fullblooded Dutch. The inability of the Dutch language is one of the cause and not all Indo could enroll the Dutch schools. It's not entirely correct to classify Indo as European because most closer to local culture than European culture. They may be more familiar with Javanese culture than European culture.In the year 1945 social revolution erupted in the Dutch East Indies. Postindependence a revolution carried out by the ultranationalists they launched yells Bersiap and drove the colonizers from the country. Indonesian history books never wrote about Bersiap and what happened afterward. At the violent period there was murder and attacks on Indo residents or who anyone who have European look. Most of Dutch Indonesians silent about this period and many didn't know about the atrocity. In the year 19501964 there was a massive wave of migration to the Dutch. The Indo were expelled from Indonesia. Arriving in the Netherlands they found the climate in the Netherlands were not suited to them not to mention the additional problem the Dutch just recovered from World War II and they received unwelcomed guests and must compete for job. The Dutch government once again open immigration programs and this time the dutch were migrated to America.At present California is one area in America that has considerable amount of third generation descendants of the Dutch Indonesian people. There are also few Indo who currently live in Indonesia Australia England. But most of the Indo these days are abundant in Netherlands or America.Ver van Familie is a movie directed by Marien Bloem tells the story of Barbie an IndoDutch who returned to Holland to find her family in the Netherlands.Family theme and multicultural atmosphere coloured the entire film. Indonesian audiences might be amused when hearing Indonesian words appeared twothreefour times in this film or when the traditional music such as Solo River and Rasa Sayange played in the background.It was shown that Barbie's Indo family in Netherland still practicing their Indo culture. Barbie felt alienated because she grew in America she was more individualist not used to the warmth of her family in the Netherlands.Ver van Familie means Far from the Family this film portraited that Barbie far from her family because the considerable cultural difference even though she was in presence of her extended family. She did not fit with Indonesian food or how she looked completely alienated during her welcome ceremony 'syukuran'. She was alone in the corner and wanted to know where her oma was.Her family kept Barbie distracted to meet her oma because she was dying. Her named Emma Koenig was a GermanJavanese descent. As Barbie's father died she stopped contact with her granddaughter on her deathbed she regretted the decision. In the middle of a large family who visited her in hospital she kept thinking where was Barbie?Koenig's family was having reunion and exhibition of their family tree. Oma Emma as the oldest and most respected figures of the family also attended the exhibition. She was constantly looking for Barbie during the exhibition and despair because her granddaughter wasn't aroundeventually she had to return to the hospital not too long after Barbie arrived.At the last moment Barbie finally met her oma was walking from her patient. Barbie hugged her. Oma Emma with her last voice teaching a song that she must pass it to her future child. Slowly the grandmother's voice slowed down until oma died in Barbie's arms.At first I was confused why this movie was not aired in Indonesia movies or at least Jakarta Filn Festival because there are a lot of Indonesian atmosphere and I'm sure Indonesian could relate the Indo in the movie culturally.I thought it was a simple family movie. But I guess it's not entirely true. This film contains adult contents which might deter this movie being aired in Indonesia because of the strict censor. Kissing scene is considered inapporopriate by the censorship authority and I wouldn't be surprised if it will be very long before we could see this movie is aired because there are too much moral polices here.I noticed presence of foul words smoking homoerotica nudity and transvestite issues which make this film probably more suitable for 15 years old people or older.Barbie for instance was smoking almost all the time in the film and repeatedly using F in the beginning of the movies when she phoned her boyfriend who dumped her after sleeping with her.Two of Barbie's family were pictured as homosexual. There was a homoerotic scene between two naked guys massaging each other.Later we were told that Barbie's father Buddy Koenig was portraited as a transgender and seems worked as a hostess.These unusual plot twists were probably inserted to show the freedom in the Netherlands however it made this film is not really suitable for all ages.However the theme is unique. You couldn't find much film about Dutch Indonesians. The adult contents were the only elements I complained from this movie. I wish the movie maker toned them down so this film is suitable for all ages.".

There is the always good Michael Biehn as the husband and the two young actors Manny Jacobs and John Taylor are standouts. Even Demi Moore an actress I normally find irritating comes off well here. She played a pregnant woman and was pregnant herself which certainly added a dimension to the nervous Abby. But it is Jurgen Prochnow who truly makes an impression his eyes his face his voice are so expressive of the character.

Although The Seventh Sign has heavy undertones I can't help but love it for being a really well crafted atmospheric thriller that let's it's fantastic cast go to some truly tough emotional places that would still be captivating in a film without religious roots. Demi Moore who I've always loved a lot plays Abbey Quinn a tortured girl whose pregnancy only brings forth dark memories from her past and troubles her more. As ominous biblical signs intrude on her benign everyday life a charismatic intense stranger Jurgen Prochnow rents a room from her and right away we know he ties into the phenomena somehow. Prochnow rarely gets a chance to play outside of the Soviet terrorist psychopath prototype but here he brings sincerity depth and a warm heart to a role that isn't easy to play without lookin like a preachy moron. Michael Biehn give a fiercely touching turn as Abbey's husband a realist who finds himself out of his element with the supernatural elements that begin to creep into his life. Biehn has a scene at the end that he just nails and is a highlight of his career. All religious paraphernalia aside though the themes presented about sacrifice love and finding the one tiny ray of hope in a world cluttered with scum and degenerates are concepts that can be universally applied to any story be it Christian or not. It's a moody exciting heartfelt film that's well worth checking out.".

In fact it was far better than most movies of this genre and not only was I gripped by the clever weaving together of the various complex threads of the plot I was also very moved particularly by the ending.

	schema:headline " Could have been better";
	schema:reviewBody "The first scene in the film is a super one. In the middle of a small Haitian village through the impenetrable crowds of people walks a man who is clearly out of place with everything else. He walks toward the sea and stops before a beach. In his hands he holds a scroll and a seal. He breaks the seal drops it on the surf and walks away leaving a small boy to watch as the sea begins to boil and the fish wash up on the shore. It is clear what is happening the first sign of the apocalypse.Thus begins The Seventh Sign a supernatural thriller that only partially works and should be better than it is. Demi Moore is a pregnant woman who begins to believe that the boarder in the apartment next door may have some bizarre endoftheworld plans for her baby. The boarder is the aforementioned stranger with the seal as played menacingly by Jurgen Prochnow. The strength of this film is the sense of impending doom that pervades throughout. The film is stylish and very effective in managing an apocalyptic tone.The main flaw of the movie however is that the supporting characters are so much more interesting than the featured couple. Prochnow's boarder is very creepy and we realize that this man means business although his role and his motives are never really made clear. The Father Lucci character is a fascinating one and when we hear of his true identity we are further gripped although at the end he is made into a routine maniacal villain and his fate is never told. This movie might have worked better if the Moore character were not so bland. She is put forth as a woman destined to save the world yet she comes across as a talking head who is endlessly impressed by Prochnow's cryptic stories. She never really comes across as anything interesting. Her husband is the typical disbelieving clod who refuses to accept what his wife is saying even when all hell is breaking loose around their ears.Despite the flaws I enjoyed The Seventh Sign and would willingly watch it again. There are several powerful moments and other scenes that are memorable like the opening shot. I would recommend it but I'm not sure if I'd do so as a serious movie or as silly weekend fare.".

This is a movie that has a thoroughly disturbing tone the same level of pervading dread that made The Exorcist The Omen and the underrated Roman Polanski film The Ninth Gate so successful. The acting and writing are solid there are good performances from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn. Peter Friedman is excellent as a tortured priest.

While this has what is an interesting plot it is done in a way that leaves a lot of holes  the main one being is why Demi Moore's character of Abby is chosen to be one of the signs in what could be the end of the world.Moore gives a decent performance in this but it isn't enough to really make this film remarkable or very engaging perhaps because the suspense is a bit lacking though the visual effects were pretty good and the scenes of destruction really created that mood of a world coming down on itself. However the plot sort of goes into territory that makes it seem a bit too surreal for its own benefit and not enough backstory is really given into the biblical references in my opinion to make it really connect strongly enough to it.I think the film forgets that sometimes more quiet scenes or a lead up to the climax is often where you pull the punches emotionally with a film and I could sort of see the ending coming in a way with how it turned out. But the message of the film  if they are trying to give one didn't sink in as strongly as it could have  perhaps because it relies on the frailty and flaws of humanity  it isn't properly explored as it could have been.".

In California the housewife Abby Quinn Demi Moore is pregnant and the delivery is scheduled to February 29 in a leap year.

She learns also that David Bannon is Jesus that has returned Father Lucci is the Pilate's porter Cartaphilus that was doomed to wander on Earth for the eternity and she is a woman that tried to help Jesus. Further she is the Seventh Sign and the Apocalypse will happen when her baby is stillborn. What can she do to save her unborn son and mankind?The Seventh Sign is an original film about Apocalypse with a complex story. There are flaws that should have been explained such as Abby let a stranger in her house when she was alone but it seems that she has already discussed with him the rental. Invinting him for dinner is part of etiquette and politeness with the tenant. Curiosity killed the cat and explains her behavior snooping around his apartment.

The Seventh Sign is bound to be compared to those two masterpieces often and it will lose out every time. This Demi Moore vehicle isn't essentially a bad film but it doesn't have a lot going for it and serves as merely just another addition to already overpopulated horror subgenre. This film sets its scope broader than the likes of The Exorcist and rather than making a personal battle the centre of the piece we follow the fate of the entire world. The Seventh Sign takes its plot from the idea of the seven signs of the apocalypse from the book of Revelations. As strange events begin to happen around the globe the church is acting very strangely by trying to pass them off with scientific reasons. For one woman however the signs are very real as the seventh sign will be the birth of her child. As the world draws nearer to oblivion only a heavily pregnant Demi Moore and some dorky kid with huge glasses can save the day...The plot isn't a bad base for a horror film despite being unoriginal but the way that the film is set out really lets it down. There isn't much suspense in The Seventh Sign and as the plot is spoonfed to the audience it's easy to know what's going on all the time...which makes watching it a bit pointless. I could have pretty much guessed the ending before seeing the film. The way that it takes in ideas from the bible is good however as it gives the plot some kind of credibility and the way that it veers away from demons and black magic ensures this further. But then again the fact that it tries to keep the plot grounded in reality makes the film more boring than it should have been...and going out on a limb more often may have ultimately helped Carl Schultz's film. Demi Moore takes the lead role and it's easy to believe that this film was made just for her. Not because she fits the role so well or anything just because the entire piece feels like an excuse to have her on screen. Michael Biehn stars opposite and gives one of his trademark forgettable performances in a movie that I won't be remembering for long. The Seventh Sign does have its moments...just not many. Only see this if you have literally seen everything else.".

Though this film has some interesting philosophical ideas about spiritual matters it's a shame it comes in such an otherwise uninspired and obvious thriller which is too familiar with superior films like Rosemary's Baby or even The Omen to succeed. A shame.";

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1988 The Seventh Sign is a creative take on the Bible's endoftheworld prophecies Apocalyptic judgments seem to be occurring all over the world as an unbelieving California couple Demi Moore and Michael Biehn are preparing for their first child. A mysterious stranger rents an apartment from them and Demi slowly discovers that she and her baby are the focal point of the end or possibly humanity's second chance.Jesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet not that it's too hard to figure out. I just wish they gave JC more screen time and dialogue since he's so intriguing it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.I enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.One reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice faith hope and love plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.If you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.I'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no lowbudget fare.People seem to have trouble categorizing The Seventh Sign because it's so unique. I would say it's a mysteryhorror film but not horror in the sense of a slasher flick Seventh Sign is more classy than that. Although there are loads of dead bodies  blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.As far as Biblical eschatology goes the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith hope  love.Unfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again they should have given JC more screen time and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 510 or C if I was in a better mood I'd give it a 610 Stars or B. In other words although The Seventh Sign has some undeniably great elements overall it's neither great nor horrible it's somewhere in between. Regardless it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.GRADE C".

	schema:headline " This is a bad sign! The Seventh Sign started out interesting but dies off like the Apocalypse.";
	schema:reviewBody "The end of the world has come and it's in the form of the Seventh Sign. Directed by Carl Schultz the movie reference to the seven seals described in the Book of Revelation the final book of the New Testament of the Bible. Sadly I wish I was watching Ingmar Bergman 1957's Seventh Seal 1976's Omen or 1968's Rosemary Baby instead of this. This movie didn't had the large budget or the eerie presence in its script to pull off the Day of Reckoning vibe. The seven seals in this film seem weak for the most part as you as the audience see only small bits of its power from small earthquake that only the camera can feel. To the oddly cut the scene of one river turning red but other rivers nearby are alright to drink. To how oddly the seal boiled the ocean around Haiti to the point it kills the fishes but not human beings feet or knee deep in the tide. It's not creepy at all. Where is the scary fire and brimstone!? It's disappointing because the movie has no mention of the opening of the first four seals which calls for the Four Horsemen each with their own specific mission to attack the world. Where are they in the movie? How come they weren't mention? The movie takes too much in creative license in the Seven Seals that it no way felt accurate or solid. The movie kinda drop the plot line half way through the film as the letters from stop being open and things just happen to happen. Anyways none of those events really matter to the main plot only serving as background to the real meat of the story. Doing the opposite of what Demi Moore's similar character in 1996's 'If this walls could talk' does a pregnant wife Abby Quinn Demi Moore pursuits to save her unborn child from being abortion by God's plans. Yes the seventh sign is really about the morals of abortion. The movie really felt like they the producers were trying so hard to fit two different type of movies into one. How in the dogma hell did you get that from the interpretation of the bible's Seventh Seal? I don't see seven angelic trumpeters who in turn cue the seven bowl judgments as a metaphor to abortion. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away from this movie as it doesn't make lick of any sense. Honestly this movie doesn't know the different between the Seventh Seal and that of the Guf. If the movie was call the 'Guf' based off Jewish mythology. This abortion plot would make more sense because in the film and in the myth The Guf is the Chamber of souls where souls of the tree of life fall into. When heaven ran out of souls the world starts to die as there is bodies in which has no souls to put into. The movie makes it even more confusing as Abby is haunted by the memories of not saving for Jesus during the Crucifixion. Yes Abby is doom to have miscarriages throughout her life because she didn't die for Jesus. Awful jarred preachy message there. How does one giving one's life to Jesus save the world anyways? You're still going to run out of souls  people are still going to die. Somehow it did in this movie. In the end she doesn't really give in to Jesus anyways but God and Jesus is like let's put this apocalypse on hold because the mother was willing to trade deaths with her unborn child. If the movie is saying that then the whole Guf running out plot doesn't make sense. Honestly how do you run out of souls if reincarnation can happen in this world? It would seem like abortion would be more welcome if reincarnation tend to give souls bodies after bodies time after time. It's not like she give away her soul to somebody who didn't had a soul anyways because a soul is what makes you you. She just put her soul in a new body. To be truthful the whole idea of God's judgment day ending the world is dumb in the first place since God giving human free will is an illusion joke. Needed to say the cheesy fauxapocalyptic is too pad out to make sense. The movie pacing is awful. Lots of oddly place drawn out boring exposition scenes like the meteorologist scene or the young Jew that Abbey befriend chatting with a Christian priest scene. It would be cut out. Then there is the nudity that wasn't needed to the point because it made no sense. If she wanted to save her child why was she going to kill herself? Without spoiling too much of it there is a few semigood twist and turns here involving both Demi Moore's Abby Quinn's character and that of Jrgen Prochnow's David Bannon. Surprising most of the acting in this movie is pretty good but deeply limited. The one actor that stood out is Jrgen Prochnow who can play mysterious roles very well. His performance is brilliant. The thing that stop the acting from being great was the exposition. The delivery of those lines are just out of place. The score music by Jack Nitzsche was alright. Nothing too worth noting. It did combines some orchestral themes with the sounds of Gregorian monks like chanting. It makes certain scenes watchable. Sadly the production suck. Depending if you're watching this on VCR or DVD its color saturation in this transfer is muted and drab. This reflection both how dated of the film is and the seemingly independent low budget televisionoriented production it had. Overall It plays out like a Lifetime TV lecture drama about the power of faith than a thriller. If they kept it closer to a horror movie than a preachy movie. It might be more entertaining.".

Surprising most of the acting in this movie is pretty good but deeply limited. The one actor that stood out is Jrgen Prochnow who can play mysterious roles very well. His performance is brilliant. The thing that stop the acting from being great was the exposition. The delivery of those lines are just out of place. The score music by Jack Nitzsche was alright. Nothing too worth noting. It did combines some orchestral themes with the sounds of Gregorian monks like chanting. It makes certain scenes watchable. Sadly the production suck. Depending if you're watching this on VCR or DVD its color saturation in this transfer is muted and drab. This reflection both how dated of the film is and the seemingly independent low budget televisionoriented production it had. Overall It plays out like a Lifetime TV lecture drama about the power of faith than a thriller. If they kept it closer to a horror movie than a preachy movie. It might be more entertaining.";

The first two stories were kind of sleazy. Fedora is really the best one.I remember this did not get good reviews at the time. Billy Wilder had no end of problems with it. It did not get a full release internationally or nationally it was not publicized and it was so badly cut that audiences laughed in all the wrong places when it was shown initially. It's pathetic to me that a great talent like Billy Wilder was treated so badly by modern Hollywood but I'm not surprised.I think this is an interesting story and if Wilder had been allowed to do what he wanted it would have been a marvelous film. One of the things that brought it down for me was the abominable performance of Marthe Keller. This role brought an end to her brief Hollywood career.What really bothered me was all the dubbing. Neither Knef's nor Keller's voices were used and it's obvious. The actresses just sound dubbed with very little effort at performances. I may be overly sensitive that dubbing sound is a big turnoff for me but maybe not for others.I think this plays better on television than it probably did in the theaters and it's definitely worth seeing for Holden at least who is Joe Gillis had he lived.A series of unfortunate events spoiled what this film could have been but it's still Billy Wilder it's still William Holden and you can't go too wrong.".

This was directorscenarist Billy Wilder's late '70s return to Sunset Boulevard territory reuniting him with William Holden in a role not at all dissimilar to that which had skyrocketed the actor's career in the 1950 classic.In this film he plays an aging independent Hollywood producer desperate for a success who travels to a Greek island with the hope of luring a reclusive Garboesque film queen out of retirement with a screenplay based on Anna Karenina. The star remarkably well preserved with a bizarre collection of hangers on surrounding her or are they imprisoning her? is erratic to say the least once Holden finally succeeds in meeting her.Wilder fans may be intrigued with the film's premise for a while based on a story by Thomas Tryon but this film largely told in flashback after beginning with the film star's Anna Kareninalike suicide in front of a train lacks the wit and sardonic black humor that had so distinguished Sunset Boulevard. In fact this suitably bizarre tale has no leveling humor at all and it is sorely missed.The cast is adequate nothing more. Holden his character so integral to Sunset Boulevard is largely reduced to the role of observer here and Marthe Keller as the mysterious Fedora lacks any sense of depth or fascination as the aging Hollywood queen whose youthful appearance is eerily similar to that of a female Dorian Gray. Hildegarde Knef as an embittered Countess who lives with her and Jose Ferrer as her doctor fill out the cast. There are also brief appearances by Michael York and Henry Fonda.While ultimately the film must be judged a disappointment considering the impressive pedigree of those involved fans of Wilder will still want to see it  at least once.

	schema:headline " Good story but treatment past its due date";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy the kind of outlandish stories like the one found in FEDORA. The whole story is so much larger than life that seeing the sorta mediocre result is disappointing because this story needed grandeur big budget big cast big everything to elevate the overthetop story to its sublime glory. Oddly enough and unfortunately for us Billy Wilder's movie mimics the film's story to a tee. The story is about a famous but reclusive film star obviously patterned after Greta Garbo who lives on an isolated Greek island. A producerwriter played by a too old William Holden wants to meet with Fedora and have her come out of retirement so she can star in his new film. Fedora had already retired before but experienced a comeback a few years ago before disappearing from the silver screen this time for good. When Holden meets Fedora the woman seems totally crazy. The story that unfolds afterwards is preposterous soapy twisted quasioperatic and yet fitting for a story about Hollywood.The funny thing about FEDORA is how Wilder critiques old Hollywood and the then current Hollywood of the 1970s and proceeds to shoot himself in the foot. The convoluted story of a Hollywood legend unable to live up to her famous past is exactly what happened to Wilder when he decided to direct this film Wilder was too old to direct this film. FEDORA the film itself is a pale example of what the director could do when compared to his films of the past like SUNSET BOULEVARD and SOME LIKE IT HOT. Not only that but Wilder also samples his older films' glory to drive his point in FEDORA which in turns renders the whole thing even more pathetic than it needed to be.FEDORA the film is not really about the fictional story about a legendary actress but more about Billy Wilder the director a bitter old man trying to prove a point by showing to the world how overthehill he was.The casting in FEDORA can only be described as disastrous. Hiring Holden was a very bad idea. His presence kept reminding me of SUNSET BOULEVARD which even if that film was made in the good old days of the 1950s was more sharp more ironic more iconic more modern in its understanding of how image can distort reality than anything seen in FEDORA which was made in 1978. Showing Marthe's breasts does not equate to anything than a pathetic attempt to be with the times. Casting Marthe Keller and Hildegard Knef was also a very bad idea. The voices for both actresses were dubbed throughout the entire film which was needlessly distracting and watered down whatever attempt at acting those two tried to achieve. And Jose Ferrer looks bored out of his mind. In fact the whole film looks bored sounds bored moves boringly. THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE which share the same kind of improbable storyline is even as bad as it is more fun and enjoyable to watch than this dreary thing.The film's bite would have been more convincing if FEDORA had more punch to it more life more style more irony. As it is FEDORA is just sad and pathetic. It's a shame because like I said I love these kind of stories and it annoys the heck out of me that Wilder was more concern in trying to voice a tired opinion than actually trying to create a great film first. A proper remake with grand production values and a bit more class the film creates a sorta repellent image of Garbo and hopefully without Michael York should be done one of these days. The improbable overthetop almost operatic story definitely deserves it.".

With such films as Sunset Boulevard Stalag 17 and Sabrina to their credit who wouldn't consider that lucky? Fedora doesn't quite belong in the same category as those others from the golden years of Wilder and Holden. Still it's an interesting film to watch and you can never make a visually bad film in the Grecian Isles.Holden plays Barry Detweiler an interesting older variation on Joe Gillis from Sunset Boulevard. Imagine if Gillis had avoided Norma Desmond's bullets and had gone on to a great film career and you have Barry Detweiler.But the digs that Norma Desmond had in Sunset Boulevard compare badly to the splendor of the regal exile that movie legend Fedora has on the Grecian isle of Korfu. It's been a mystery how Fedora has managed to appear eternally young. Back in the day Holden had a fling with Fedora and he's played here as a young man by Stephen Collins. Hoping to cash in on a quick roll on the beach from the Fifties Holden has a script for a new version of Anna Karenina. After much scheming he does get into see Fedora played by young Marte Keller. Unfortunately some intriguing things keep bringing Holden back and in the end he does uncover the secret of Fedora's eternal youth. Let's say it was something not available to Norma Desmond.Best performance in the film for me is Jose Ferrer a quack plastic surgeon who has attached himself to Fedora as part of her entourage. Ferrer steals every scene he's in that man was never bad in anything he did.Maybe Fedora would have been a classic if Marlene Dietrich had come back to play the part of the old countess that Hildegard Knef did and Faye Dunaway had played Fedora. Personally I think the part of the countess was too close to home for Dietrich but Wilder definitely wanted her.What a film that would have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder is celebrated for a streak of movies that starts with the groundbreaking filmnoir Double Indemnity and Lost Weekend and ends with the comedy classics Some Like it Hot and The Apartment. In between you have such titles as Sunset Blvd. Stalag 17 Sabrina and Witness for the Prosecution I guess if any movie lover was asked about the 10 greatest movies from the Golden Age a fistful of Billy Wilder films would be mentioned.This is just to say that this is the kind of legacy a foreign director who escaped from the Nazis and never got rid of his German accent can be damn proud of he literally owned American cinema and defined many genres. After the sixties he still had a share of enjoyable movies but they never reached the same iconic status. And when the New Hollywood was built on the ruins of the studio system Billy Wilder became the incarnation of old school conventional cinema big names big stars and big stories. Wilder's motto was thou shall not bore the audience but then came a time where moviegoers mostly grownup baby boomers were enthralled by the spectacle of Bonnie and Clyde's machineguns the French Connection' chase Scorsese's mean streets and the intimacy of the Corleone family. Wilder became the bore audiencewise.Those kids with beards are running things laments the hasbeen Larry Detweiller aka Dutch played remarkably by William Holden and his words couldn't have echoed more Billy Wilder's resentment toward the new ways of Hollywood or what was left of it. In the midst of the raging bulls and easy riders' era the merit of Fedora is to provide the interesting insight from a director of the old generation. When the time of Ford Minnelli or Hitchcock was over Wilder was still here and made one deliberately conventional and classic move or movie so against the current it was meant to fail. But now after four decades Fedora has aged surprisingly well. It's not a masterpiece but the story is likely to content the movie lovers we are.In fact it illustrates this quote from JeanLuc Godard the best way to criticize a film is to make one. And Billy Wilder adapting the novel 'Crowned Heads' paid a tribute to the Golden Age through the portrayal of Fedora a star who used to be big but then saw her stardom fade only to resurrect a few years after. When asked if there was any similarity between Fedora and Sunset Blvd. Wilder naively said no but even though it wasn't intentional one can't have a cinemathemed Billy Wilder's film featuring William Holden much more in the narrator's role and not have Sunset Blvd. in mind. If anything the film comes full circle with the classic noir in the 70's the Golden Age was the silent era they didn't need blazing guns and naked breasts only dialogues and faces.Fedora was the biggest of her time mentioning reallife stars and fictional movies as if the film was set in a parallel universe yet close to the reality just like Norma Desmond interacting with Cecil B. De Mille as to emphasize the dreamlike aura of Hollywood. Then she abruptly ended her career and lived in in remote locations on the Riviera and started to make movies again after a few years of absence this is where Dutch comes trying to approach her to star in an adaptation of Anna Karenina He notices some strange happenings Fedora seems imprisoned by a group of people as colorful as intimidating an old Countess with a husky voice Hildegard Knef a mysterious plastic surgeon played by Jose Ferrer and a sinister watchdog played by Frances Sternhagen she was the sheriff's wisecracking wife in Misery.The Sunset Blvd. dj vu deepens and Dutch' investigation leads to the ultimate revelation about the story of Fedora. And it is intriguing and haunting within its own limitation with a fascinating mix of real actors like Henry Fonda and Michael York in the intrigue. The main problem with the film is that the peripheral characters actually work better than the central one Holden is perfect but like many critics pointed out there had to be an actress of Marlene Dietrich' caliber to play the faded star because the flashbacks don't leave us with the conviction of a Golden Age aura on Fedora. There had to be a Katharine or Audrey Hepburn Ingrid Bergman but I guess the film was victim of its era Wilder didn't have the same touch and only his old buddy William Holden was here to close the loop with Sunset Blvd..But I love the way the film feels like a swan song of the old school and close the curtain on Wilder's fivedecade contribution to Cinema as if he was paying a final tribute to his art. He would later make a film with Lemmon and Matthau a remake of a French classic farce but the film was of such abysmal quality it was dismissed as part of Wilder's canon and Fedora is a worthy ending to his prolific career. I didn't necessarily enjoy the film I would say I watched it with mere curiosity able to appreciate its intent more than its result but the making of the film is very fascinating seeing the old Wilder wrestling with the new system to get his film made along with I.A.L Diamond is a great lesson of humility and determination.After knowing the truth about Fedora which is a selfreferential cased of Naked Empress Dutch says it would make a better story than the one he had in mind I guess the same goes with the making of 'Fedora'".

It's not a masterpiece but the story is likely to content the movie lovers we are.In fact it illustrates this quote from JeanLuc Godard the best way to criticize a film is to make one. And Billy Wilder adapting the novel 'Crowned Heads' paid a tribute to the Golden Age through the portrayal of Fedora a star who used to be big but then saw her stardom fade only to resurrect a few years after. When asked if there was any similarity between Fedora and Sunset Blvd. Wilder naively said no but even though it wasn't intentional one can't have a cinemathemed Billy Wilder's film featuring William Holden much more in the narrator's role and not have Sunset Blvd. in mind. If anything the film comes full circle with the classic noir in the 70's the Golden Age was the silent era they didn't need blazing guns and naked breasts only dialogues and faces.Fedora was the biggest of her time mentioning reallife stars and fictional movies as if the film was set in a parallel universe yet close to the reality just like Norma Desmond interacting with Cecil B. De Mille as to emphasize the dreamlike aura of Hollywood. Then she abruptly ended her career and lived in in remote locations on the Riviera and started to make movies again after a few years of absence this is where Dutch comes trying to approach her to star in an adaptation of Anna Karenina He notices some strange happenings Fedora seems imprisoned by a group of people as colorful as intimidating an old Countess with a husky voice Hildegard Knef a mysterious plastic surgeon played by Jose Ferrer and a sinister watchdog played by Frances Sternhagen she was the sheriff's wisecracking wife in Misery.The Sunset Blvd. dj vu deepens and Dutch' investigation leads to the ultimate revelation about the story of Fedora. And it is intriguing and haunting within its own limitation with a fascinating mix of real actors like Henry Fonda and Michael York in the intrigue. The main problem with the film is that the peripheral characters actually work better than the central one Holden is perfect but like many critics pointed out there had to be an actress of Marlene Dietrich' caliber to play the faded star because the flashbacks don't leave us with the conviction of a Golden Age aura on Fedora. There had to be a Katharine or Audrey Hepburn Ingrid Bergman but I guess the film was victim of its era Wilder didn't have the same touch and only his old buddy William Holden was here to close the loop with Sunset Blvd..But I love the way the film feels like a swan song of the old school and close the curtain on Wilder's fivedecade contribution to Cinema as if he was paying a final tribute to his art. He would later make a film with Lemmon and Matthau a remake of a French classic farce but the film was of such abysmal quality it was dismissed as part of Wilder's canon and Fedora is a worthy ending to his prolific career. I didn't necessarily enjoy the film I would say I watched it with mere curiosity able to appreciate its intent more than its result but the making of the film is very fascinating seeing the old Wilder wrestling with the new system to get his film made along with I.A.L Diamond is a great lesson of humility and determination.After knowing the truth about Fedora which is a selfreferential cased of Naked Empress Dutch says it would make a better story than the one he had in mind I guess the same goes with the making of 'Fedora'";

At points I'm almost laughing at the movie's plot twist yet the more bizarre and highly improbable the movie became the more I found myself getting engaged in the story waiting in eager anticipation to find out what will happen next with those oh so joyous I did not see that coming moments. The film's highly implausible plot manages to draw the thin line between being completely absurd but never feeling like a parody.The character of Fedora herself is a reclusive movie star who goes to extreme lengths in order to stay on top and retain her eternal youth to the point which even Norma Desmond would consider crazy. Early during the film I suspected Greta Garbo to be the likely source of inspiration for the character of Fedora whom Wilder always had great admiration for but as the plot progressed I thought to myself ok even Garbo was never this nuts.One of Fedora's other intriguing aspects is the film's critique of New Hollywood and how times have changed since Hollywood's golden era came to pass. Fedora is the only film I've seen which displays a harsh attitude towards New Hollywood with lines referring to Hollywood being taken over by kids with beards who don't need a script just a handheld camera with a zoom lens as well as the demise of glamorous movie stars of the past. This is one of several aspects of Fedora which makes it similar to what you could call its spiritual cousin Sunset Boulevard which itself commented upon what was lost when the silent era came to an end. I could go on making comparisons between the two films from William Holden playing a Hollywood hack in both films to Michael York's role the in film being similar to the role Cecil B. Millie played in Sunset Boulevard.I imagined by 1978 Wilder was far past his directing prime not to mention after the 1950's he seemed to become content with only directing comedies thus I'm surprised to consider Fedora as one of his greatest films and a return to the roots of his earlier work as a director. As soon as William Holden's narration begins you can instantly tell this is classic oldschool Billy Wilder.".

True the mystery side of the plot is not exactly its strongest point.

It's essential that we always remain sympathetic towards the hero no matter how crass his actions and this we certainly are as Holden brilliantly takes us through a replay of his role in Wilder's Sunset Boulevard. In what turns out to be the Swanson role Hildegard Knef is also most compelling and although Wilder was not happy with her performance I thought Marthe Keller handled the title part with exactly the right edge of neurotic tension.

	schema:reviewBody ".. when he called SPL the pinnacle of his martial arts choreography. It rocks. HARD. Not only are the fights are brutal fast and complex but Donnie may have achieved the impossible He made Brazillian jujitsu look exciting on film. Donnie's character repeatedly goes for takedowns armbars chokes and all the moves that you might see in a UFC or Pride match with Sammo countering attacks exactly how the big fighters do it in a real bout while seamlessly combining them with the incredibly fast complex punching and kicking exchanges you'd expect in a Hong Kong flick. Did I mention that the fights are bonecrunchingly brutal? There is a real nastiness to the punchups that should yield a great reaction from enthusiastic audiences. And then there is the spectacular Wu Jing vs Donnie Yen fight. It starts off very very fast and complex then at a certain point the tempo changes and you suddenly realize that it's because they're just making it up ON THE SPOT and the damn thing becomes even more impressive. The long unbroken takes should please fight purists too.The film itself also holds up. Director Wilson Yip really shows off his passion and skill in this film. It's an intense crime drama that doesn't have to pander to any teeny boppers so he is free to finally let loose. The story is solid and Yip takes the opportunity to devise some great sequences. There's a scene that cuts between Donnie looking at photos of the policemen he's about to lead and footage of the same cops intensely doing their business that is pure cinema.. a scene that could have been plain on paper but is made exciting purely through the director's vision  the way it's cut and scored and staged. In other words there is a lot of obvious effort put into the drama. It isn't just some thrown together filler btwn fight scenes. This is a real film. Oh and one comment about the audio It's amazing. The music is superb and the sound effects are everything you could hope for in a kung fu film ie they accentuate every move and hit as you'd want them to. I hope the DVD has a great DD5.1 track and that you have the system to play it 'cause it'll make a big difference.Complaints? I have only one The fights should have been a little longer but that's okay because they burn twice as bright as most.".

	schema:headline " Resets the standard for modern day martial arts films";
	schema:reviewBody "When I found the film was having its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival I made it first priority to go see it. I saw it with a friend at an Industry screening in rush line. Donnie versus Sammo can it get any better than that? The story of the film to make it simple Simon Yam is the retiring determined badgood cop Donnie is the new goodgood cop replacing him and Sammo is the mob boss. The film takes place during father's day and every character in the film is either a son or a father. Everyone is dealing with some form of father and son relationship Sammo's character is expecting a child Simon Yam has an adopted daughter of whose real parents were killed by men sent from Sammo Donnie's character defies his father's wishes to become a policeman and so forth. The theme serves to add a emotional element that connects all the characters in the film. None of the characters are extreme good or extreme evil everybody is shades of grey on different levels. There seems to be a very heavy Infernal Affairs influence here coupled with the bleak colours and dark settings. However the film does not take itself as seriously as the IA trilogy. There are many moments of humor and it works well to break the tension of the film in the beginning to middle. The humor leaves at the middle to the finale at the end when things start to get serious which helps engage the audience and assures them the film does not take itself any more seriously but to engage you for the duration of the movie to entertain you.The film is shot very stylishly. Combined with the duration of the film the film clocks in to about 97 minutes I can imagine the meanest western critic would say this film is pretentious trading too much style for not enough storytelling in such a short time. Yes I already see that coming aren't I pretty? I would d say that would be the wrong way to look at it because he would be forgetting the fact that this a modern day kung fu film which has always been a very hard genre to do. In the modern day setting it basically means you're more grounded and limited by the realms of reality which means no obvious wirework and more realistic choreography which you need expert talent to pull off. When you're in ancient times you can get away with stuff not in modern day. The story lines for modern day martial arts films have not been very impressive either in the past. It's it's own ballgame in my opinion. Only recent one I can think of is Danny the DogUnleashed an old example being Jackie Chan's Police Story series and I don't count the unevenly New Police Story.And now the thing you've been waiting for.... the action! Donnie Yen commented that this was the pinnacle of his career with SPL. When you see the film you can see what he's talking about. You know that thing when you hear reading about kung fu movies sometimes when Bruce Lee moves too fast for the camera and they ask him to slow down so people can see what's going on? I don't think much of that was going on here in SPL. The fights were lightning fast and brutal. Every move was checkmate and everyone's going for the throat. The fights are not many but they are cruelly intense. The fight with Wu Jing and Donnie Yen in the alleyway was spectacular I think they were rolling camera and just going at it full speed. I guess it seemed natural to do a weapon fight baton vs. a short Japanese knife because Wu Jing has a more graceful swift strength as to Donnie's hard and solid's. The finale with Sammo and Donnie was my favorite. Sammo is a fiftyyear old two hundred pound fat man and he moves like he never aged at all. He keeps up every second with Donnie. No one had to slow anything down for him nor nothing was undercranked or wired. Wrestling seemed to be a very natural choice for this fight given the circumstances Donnie and Sammo are hard solid strength types and it added a new visual element compared to Donnie's In The Line of Duty and Tiger Cage days. This fight was so intense it made me forget what the plot of the story was about I forgot why Donnie was fighting Sammo plotwise and just purely experienced the cinematics of the fight. You'll see what I mean when you see the film.Yes SPL succeeds in what it does. With more martial arts films coming out internationally such as Ong Bak as Donnie has been quoted as saying repetitively Hong Kong has deteriorated in its quality of kung fu film despite the fact that Hong Kong choreography has now become international. SPL sets the standard again and reminds the world that we still have a few things up our sleeves and that this is the Hong Kong brand of action choreography. So yes martial arts fans you'll definitely dig it. It's on your mustsee list for sure.".

But no matter how hard they press  and they press HARD  Sammo presses back harder and usually after he walks free when it becomes apparent Simon and his boys have violated every police procedure and human right imaginable in an effort to secure an apprehension.When a mentally deficient AV geek arrives at the station with a video showing Sammo teeing off on the head of Simon's undercover operative and one of his henchman finalizing the deal with a bullet to the head Simon and his crew first beat the henchman to within an inch of his life sending him flying off a highrise rooftop and then hatch a plan to edit the tape and make Sammo appear to be the killer. Of course there's always a backup tape and the vicious crime kingpin again walks free this time with a master plan to wipe out Simon's unit for good.Into this raging carnival of payback is transferred Simon's replacement Donnie a notquite bythebook hot shot whose initial protestations to the group's dark pragmatism and exclusionary procedures are rescinded after he helplessly watches one of them get slit up a treat by Sammo's snickering psychotic bladeforhire Jacky Wu Jing who's hardly the newcomer he's being touted as by both the opening credits and the internet gossip cycle. That these two will later settle up accounts in a ferocious bout of handtohand combat in the alley leading to Sammo's club is a foregone conclusion that the fight is one of the most beautifully constructed relentlessly exhilarating setpieces of martial arts choreography in the history of Hong Kong cinema one that practically INVENTS new ways of kicking ass comes as a breath of minty freshness in this era of assembly line romances and computerassisted Jackie Chan in silly helmets.The sequence is rivaled in short order when Donnie finally takes on the Big Man himself virtually trashing Sammo's opulent nightclub in the process just moments after Simon's abortive last attempt to kill his archenemy buys him a series of gaping stab wounds and a Great Big Knife through his hand.But the film isn't just about combat phenomenal though it is it's about consequences and the dark decisions of the soul that in Hong Kong movies at least routinely resulted in cataclysm in film after film of the golden era of the 80's and 90's. The kind of movie that used to be worthy of the title Heroic Bloodshed and a textbook exercise in escalating nihilism. No one escapes fate in SPL not that they try very hard combatants on both sides of the battle have tunnel vision and live only to see the other side pushing up the daisies their own deaths often appearing as surprising to them as they are to us.SPL feels like the movie its director Wilson Yip wanted to make in the mid1990's back when folks like Danny Lee knew the value of a hammer and a phone book in extracting confessions so it doesn't surprise that the film is set in 1997 a fact seemingly lost on the majority of the audience at the Toronto Film Festival where this debuted how else to justify the shootfirstfthequestions cocaine bust flashbacked as newly arrived Donnie quietly acquaints himself with the vacant desks of his new charges or the sight of weary veteran Liu Kaichi slapping around a mental retardate and trashing the poor boy's pad?Not that the film is all bleakness. With the exception of Jacky's smirky nutjob assassin all the primary leads are given small vignettes that show they're firing on more than one cylinder Simon becomes godfather to a little girl whose parents witnesses to Sammo's dirty dealings were killed by Jacky. Liu Kaichi discovers the fate of his estranged father just moments before fate points his way Donnie secretly plays video games with a mentally challenged exthief he clocked a little too hard and Sammo interrupts several tense moments AND his climactic Donniebrook to take calls from his wife who after several failed pregnancies has finally given him a child albeit one who will figure prominently in one of the most brutal twist endings of all time. There's more authentic characterization on display here than in any five Hong Kong action thrillers of the past few years barring the gorgeously grim procedural of Johnny To  not for nothing is the film set on Father's Day  a fact not lost on the likes of Yip and Yen who must have known respective talents such as theirs coupled with an Asian cinephile's dream cast could only result in something truly memorable.With little argument this is Yip's most refined tightlywound effort to date a lean dark unsparing bastard of a movie that melds the satiny luster of 2002 with which it shares art director Jeff Mak with the sinewy strippeddown plotting of BIOZOMBIE minus the comedy of course. Easily one of the best if not THE best Hong Kong picture of 2005 so far and I doubt the rest of the year will produce anything its equal.".

Liu Kaichi discovers the fate of his estranged father just moments before fate points his way Donnie secretly plays video games with a mentally challenged exthief he clocked a little too hard and Sammo interrupts several tense moments AND his climactic Donniebrook to take calls from his wife who after several failed pregnancies has finally given him a child albeit one who will figure prominently in one of the most brutal twist endings of all time. There's more authentic characterization on display here than in any five Hong Kong action thrillers of the past few years barring the gorgeously grim procedural of Johnny To  not for nothing is the film set on Father's Day  a fact not lost on the likes of Yip and Yen who must have known respective talents such as theirs coupled with an Asian cinephile's dream cast could only result in something truly memorable.With little argument this is Yip's most refined tightlywound effort to date a lean dark unsparing bastard of a movie that melds the satiny luster of 2002 with which it shares art director Jeff Mak with the sinewy strippeddown plotting of BIOZOMBIE minus the comedy of course. Easily one of the best if not THE best Hong Kong picture of 2005 so far and I doubt the rest of the year will produce anything its equal.";

I thought the direction was was quite nice although it seemed inconsistent sometimes wandering into art film territory. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I don't know that it worked 100. Overall I thought the movie was 'alright'. The plot was seriously stretched thin you don't really get into the characters or care much for them Audience members laughed at scenes that were supposed to be touching or sad but every criticism I could lay at the movies feet is fairly much washed away by the fight scenes.Donnie yen did a spectacular job with the choreography and MMA fans will be glad to know there is an energetic mix of all types of fighting styles including Jiu Jitsu complete with take downs and armbars. One of the main fight sequences is the most spectacular upon first viewing and then moreso on reflection as you find out that Donnie Yen and Wu Jing had no rehearsal and no direction simply they were told to go for it. To this point the baton that yen wields in this fight scene was replaced three times as it was broken on Wu Jing's head while filming.Sammo is fantastic and I still marvel at how he moves at his age. I've always been a fan of Donnie Yen and this is definitely a great fighting film for him. Wu Jing is a relative unknown but trained in the same opera company as Jacky Chan and Sammo Hungbeing taught by Wo Ping. during the QA Wu Jing said his next film will likely be a prequel to Sha Po Lang.I took a photo of the stage assembly and thought I would include it here if anyone wants to see it.

Donnie Yen leads a cast that also includes Sammo Hung Simon Yam and Wu Jing. I loved everything about this movie. I thought all the actors were great. I thought the story was good. The action was just brilliant! Donnie Yen's fight choreography is some of the best work he's ever done check out the alley fight scene against Wu Jing. He mixes traditional kung fu with a little UFC grappling which I thought was pretty cool. Seeing Donnie and Sammo face off for the very first time was quite astonishing. Some of you may agree some might not but I think Donnie Yen is the most underrated action actors of them all. I love Jackie Chan and Jet Li but they're like Van Damme and Seagal. They play the same character in every film. Donnie on the other hand is a much more versatile actor who's willing to play supporting roles or even villainous roles. It's really a shame that he can't get the Hollywood leading roles that often go to Jackie or Jet. But that could change soon. In the mean time check this movie out! You'll love it.".

The action was so exciting the entire crowd I was with in the theater were howling with delight. Sadly it is so rare nowadays to see a martial arts film where real martial artists are fighting instead of pop stars on wires and it makes such a huge difference because Donnie Sammo and Jacky Wu were simply incredible. My only complaint with the action was that there was not enough of it. Donnie Yen has finally joined the ranks of great fight choreographers with S.P.L.As good as the action was though the story fell flat for me and put the film into the Very Good category when it could have been Great. They tried for an Infernal Affairs style police thriller and didn't nearly hit the mark. While Simon Yam and Sammo Hung were both great in their parts the other acting was just functional and the story had way too much overdone melodramatic content that seemed very forced. The emotional arc of the picture was pretty much set up right at the beginning and would have been sufficient but they had to keep laying on the unrealistic drama and it did slightly take away from my enjoyment of the film. Another criticism with the story was that it seemed like parts may have been cut from the film because some pieces of the story that earlier had seemed pretty insignificant became a big deal towards the end of the film and it felt like it came out of nowhere like we weren't told everything.Having said that though my negative criticism about the story should not stop you at all from seeing this film. I didn't go into S.P.L. expecting The Godfather I just wanted to see some incredible martial arts action and I got it. I cannot wait to see what Donnie will do next.".

In some ways Yen is even better because Li is at times too cool. Yen on the other hand has that fierce intensity in his eyes that none can match. Coming up fast is Wu Jing Jet Li's see dai younger brother in the martial art school who came to the cinematic martial art world through the same route by winning the national competition. Sammo Hung is a veteran martial art actor but had his training through the Peking Opera acrobatic style school 9AS jackie Chan rather than the real thing as Yen Li and Wu did. Still he can hold his own in front of a camera against these true experts.If there were only one reason to see this martial art movie it would be the duel between Yen and Wu. Observe the complete lack of camera movement during a good part of this sequence. Nor is there any of the usual choreography you see and many Hollywood and Hong Kong action movies. The two simply combine their talent and years of training and show the audience what they are capable of under the ruthless scrutiny of a stationery camera. Martial arts filming does not get better than this.By comparison the grand finale bout between Yen and Hung while the climax in terms of the story line is a bit of an anticlimax in terms of martial art excellence although it is still quite watchable. To add more for the enjoyment of the audience Yen brings in Jujitsu for this sequence the Japanese martial art style that many consider to be the predecessor of Judo.A mustsee for lovers of the martial art genre SPL has been given a Categoty III violence rating locally not without reasons.".

	schema:reviewBody "The concept of joss should be familiar to many followers of Hong Kong's antics. Used profusely in James Clavell novels Tai Pan Noble House et al joss relates notions of life's fickle randomness as events remain at the mercy of capricious gods. Whatever those will happens. Joss. Looking for a reason may be nothing more than a solid waste of time.Although no longer in vogue as a word joss still holds sway over things HK. To wit this spat of topshelf action flicks that came out of nowhere following months and perhaps years of utter dreariness.As if Dragon Squad wasn't good enough a couple weeks back here comes SPL or Saat Po Lang which literally should if this reviewer's language skills are any good mean kill the bent wolf. That particular translation does make sense in light of the film's plot as does the Film Board's decision to waltz with danger and place a category III rating on another movie not far behind Election on the release schedule. This dalliance has us totally in thrall for HK's censors have historically proved themselves to be timid scaredycats with the utmost adverse reaction to anything remotely good. And while SPL may not be the next Natural Born Killers or Bad Lieutenant it does earn its three I's with more aplomb than a few lesser projects and contains more than enough gratuitous bloodshed to sate action pundits.Just like Dragon Squad so doesn't SPL shy away from all the things that have traditionally made HK an excellent source of frenetic action nutrients. However while DS put itself in a somewhatcomedic hyperrealistic version of the city SPL takes place firmly in a Gothamite rendition of HK brooding and awash with menace. Wilson Yip Bullets Over Summer White Dragon and his posse provide just the right quotients of each ingredient resulting in an atmosphere perfectly adjusted to its purpose. You can't avoid liking the HK seen here with its Streets of FireYoung and Dangerouslike roaming gangs dark desolate cityscapes and hapless police force.What the cops are so prostate before is Wong Po master criminal and ruthless sadist cum family man done by a delectable Sammo Hung. Sammo's always been good as a villain and this Kingpinesquire meanie's no exception. Wong Po combines the usual crazed bad guy with a loving husband and of course possesses relentless martial arts skills. These are deployed against the movie's main protagonists the goodbutshadowy police types everybody loves so much. They're headed by Chung Simon Yam AGAIN who's got it in for Wong Po after a family of witnesses under his protection got wasted on the criminal's bequest.But Chung's naturally about to retire in order to care for his goddaughter sole survivor of said family so the stage is set for new captain Inspector Ma another fighting machine in the form of everlikable Donnie Yen Iron Monkey Hero Seven Swords to come in and join the fray. Others include abrasive skeptic cop Ah Wah Liu Kai Chi pretty much in every HK movie over the last few years and a nameless lunatic killer employed by Wong Po martial arts expert Wu Jing.Save for a few minor pseudosurprises SPL follows a normative mold as far as story goes but succeeds mostly in terms of its superb pace and impressive moodsetting elements. The comic book characters fit their respective personalities can take a whole lot of damage and have this knack for seeming serious like they're in a real crime story rather than fiction. Gunplay hack 'n' slash and fighting have all found a spot for themselves herein and none overpowers the other so that's all good too.Likewise Yip managed to add quizzical surrealism to the mix by telling us the movie takes place 19941997. Sure the old colonial flag of HK is seen briefly and cop badges read Royal Police but beyond that it's obviously the now not ten years ago. Cars clothes and buildings are all contemporary. To some this may be ridiculous. To others it's a useful storytelling conceit in synch with the story's overall fairy tale fantasy mindset.Additional assets in SPL's collection number generally strong supporting characters Chung's crew and Wong Po's insaneclown head minion a gorgeous soundtrack and this perturbing ability to fuse components from action epics like Cobra and The Punisher with gangland hysteria a la Goodfellas or Scarface just listen to the violins as they play in the background.Perhaps nostalgia and time won't be as kind to SPL as they were to the films that inspired it but one can't hide from acknowledging we have before us another substantial action entry in a year that for ten months out of twelve was nigh on arid in the adrenaline department and that's not even mentioning the years preceding.Archetypal tormented cops obsessive villains a city teeming with unrestrained violence and props so destructible they must have cost more than hiring Simon Yam and Sammo who have been so prolific recently we have to wonder when they get any time off.In short and acronyms aside go watch it.Rating    ".

	onyx:emotionText "The concept of joss should be familiar to many followers of Hong Kong's antics. Used profusely in James Clavell novels Tai Pan Noble House et al joss relates notions of life's fickle randomness as events remain at the mercy of capricious gods. Whatever those will happens. Joss. Looking for a reason may be nothing more than a solid waste of time.Although no longer in vogue as a word joss still holds sway over things HK. To wit this spat of topshelf action flicks that came out of nowhere following months and perhaps years of utter dreariness.As if Dragon Squad wasn't good enough a couple weeks back here comes SPL or Saat Po Lang which literally should if this reviewer's language skills are any good mean kill the bent wolf. That particular translation does make sense in light of the film's plot as does the Film Board's decision to waltz with danger and place a category III rating on another movie not far behind Election on the release schedule. This dalliance has us totally in thrall for HK's censors have historically proved themselves to be timid scaredycats with the utmost adverse reaction to anything remotely good. And while SPL may not be the next Natural Born Killers or Bad Lieutenant it does earn its three I's with more aplomb than a few lesser projects and contains more than enough gratuitous bloodshed to sate action pundits.Just like Dragon Squad so doesn't SPL shy away from all the things that have traditionally made HK an excellent source of frenetic action nutrients. However while DS put itself in a somewhatcomedic hyperrealistic version of the city SPL takes place firmly in a Gothamite rendition of HK brooding and awash with menace. Wilson Yip Bullets Over Summer White Dragon and his posse provide just the right quotients of each ingredient resulting in an atmosphere perfectly adjusted to its purpose. You can't avoid liking the HK seen here with its Streets of FireYoung and Dangerouslike roaming gangs dark desolate cityscapes and hapless police force.What the cops are so prostate before is Wong Po master criminal and ruthless sadist cum family man done by a delectable Sammo Hung. Sammo's always been good as a villain and this Kingpinesquire meanie's no exception. Wong Po combines the usual crazed bad guy with a loving husband and of course possesses relentless martial arts skills. These are deployed against the movie's main protagonists the goodbutshadowy police types everybody loves so much. They're headed by Chung Simon Yam AGAIN who's got it in for Wong Po after a family of witnesses under his protection got wasted on the criminal's bequest.But Chung's naturally about to retire in order to care for his goddaughter sole survivor of said family so the stage is set for new captain Inspector Ma another fighting machine in the form of everlikable Donnie Yen Iron Monkey Hero Seven Swords to come in and join the fray. Others include abrasive skeptic cop Ah Wah Liu Kai Chi pretty much in every HK movie over the last few years and a nameless lunatic killer employed by Wong Po martial arts expert Wu Jing.Save for a few minor pseudosurprises SPL follows a normative mold as far as story goes but succeeds mostly in terms of its superb pace and impressive moodsetting elements. The comic book characters fit their respective personalities can take a whole lot of damage and have this knack for seeming serious like they're in a real crime story rather than fiction. Gunplay hack 'n' slash and fighting have all found a spot for themselves herein and none overpowers the other so that's all good too.Likewise Yip managed to add quizzical surrealism to the mix by telling us the movie takes place 19941997. Sure the old colonial flag of HK is seen briefly and cop badges read Royal Police but beyond that it's obviously the now not ten years ago. Cars clothes and buildings are all contemporary. To some this may be ridiculous. To others it's a useful storytelling conceit in synch with the story's overall fairy tale fantasy mindset.Additional assets in SPL's collection number generally strong supporting characters Chung's crew and Wong Po's insaneclown head minion a gorgeous soundtrack and this perturbing ability to fuse components from action epics like Cobra and The Punisher with gangland hysteria a la Goodfellas or Scarface just listen to the violins as they play in the background.Perhaps nostalgia and time won't be as kind to SPL as they were to the films that inspired it but one can't hide from acknowledging we have before us another substantial action entry in a year that for ten months out of twelve was nigh on arid in the adrenaline department and that's not even mentioning the years preceding.Archetypal tormented cops obsessive villains a city teeming with unrestrained violence and props so destructible they must have cost more than hiring Simon Yam and Sammo who have been so prolific recently we have to wonder when they get any time off.In short and acronyms aside go watch it.Rating    ";

	schema:headline " OK action poor dialog nice concept until I realized...";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps something was lost in the English translation but the dialog for the movie was terrible. Character developments were weak at best. The beginning of the movie attempts to produce too much of a background too quickly. Either this movie should have been longer or stuff should have been left out. The scenes regarding Simon's cancer looked forced. Then you jump from the hospital to a cop ramming the back of a gangsters car? Are you serious? There's gotta be a better way to show animosity and hatred between the two characters than to just all of a sudden jumping to one guy ramming the other. Also when Simon yanks his goddaughter away from Sammo in the hospital it was with force. She was silent. Seeing kids yanked like that before especially girls there'd be some kind of noise. The concept for the movie was interesting at first until I realized it looked similar to Training Day and The Corrupter which were both made earlier. The action is probably slightly better than I've seen in some recent martial arts movies. It was amusing to see Donnie attempt to look like he was an eskrimador with the baton. It's been a long time since I've seen Sammo in a movie. Definitely a different roll for him from what I've seen of him. Although I haven't seen him in a movie in at least 20 years.".

Sammo movies always had endearing characters that grew on you. Sad to say I barely got to know these characters. There were too many clichs that didn't work for me either. Funny I was rooting for Sammo and his assassin the whole time. I guess I just didn't like the police characters in this film. They just didn't make me believe their cause. The little girl and a brain tumor were just too trite. Too much is taken for granted from the viewer as if the lines are clearly drawn without taking the time to let it sink in.

Not only do the twists kick you in the gut but the action sequences will knock you out of your seat that's for damn sure!!! I'll give credit to Donnie Yen for directing the fight scenes as they were brutal shot with long takes and very little cutting just like the old Hong Kong fight flicks. The big surprise however was the legend himself Sammo Hung playing a lead villain. At 53 years of age this man can still move punch for punch kick for kick with Donnie Yen...folks when this is released in theatres for those who have the privilege Anywhere but North America make sure to check it out. Also look out for a new cat who can kick serious ass in this flick the name is Wu Jing remember it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Being of a British born Chinese decent I was brought up on a staple diet of Hong Kong action movies mostly action. Yes I knew Jackie Chan before he went and made the International action film See Police Story then watch Medallion and then see Police Story. It was also before the advent of teeny bop stars taking over the movie scene making way for Japanese and especially Korean films to become the new movie darlings of the Far East. I watched these films before Hollywood hired Yuen Woo Ping and other HK choreographers repeating wire work scenes that I had seen earlier in other films and this kind of wire work made way for the antidote of the non wire work in the shape the excellent Ong Bak.I also watched the antics of Jet LiSammo Hung and Donnie Yen growing up. Two of the aforementioned feature in this rather superior crime thriller from Hong Kong. It doesn't have the depth of Infernal Affairs or the close brotherhood of male bonding characters that you see in a John Woo thriller but it does have the best action from a Hong Kong movie since Drunken Master 2. However rather being a straight edged action movie it does attempt a story of that being Detective Chan Simon Yam leads a posse to take down PoSammo Hung. However every move he makes on Po is thwarted and due to a terminal illness Chan is soon to retire to be replaced by tough man cop Detective Ma Donnie Yen. However a shade of grey comes into Chan and his posse when they attempt to frame Po and that's were everything literally explodes.SPL is primary built on the finale between action Gods Sammo and Yen. No these guys are not Hollywood actors training hard for three months only to make an action sequence look so stiff you think your watching stop motion animation these are actors who have been training most of their lives who can also actis that too hard to find?. What make's SPL interesting is the little fights in between that build you up for Donnie Yen's inevitable awesome confrontations with not only Sammo but his evil dagger wielding psycho henchman played by Wu Jing Drunken Monkey who is probably the best secondary bad guy since Bobba Fett. It also should be noted that the scenes when the heroes and villains don't actually fight are pretty intense. The stylistic approach by director Wilson Yip is fresh and displaying that Johnnie To is not the only one who can do serious thrillers in Hong Kong...but I'm digressing lets talk about the action.Donnie Yen choreographed the fights and has it spot on no wire work here just pure raw fight scenes bloody and brutal but the most entertaining elements are the incorporation of Brazillian Jiu Jitsu moves simply amazing. The way the action is shot is superb penetrating close ups and eye level action and brilliantly edited. The acting is superb by Yam and especially Sammo Hung hamming it up as the bad guy with such glee Yen's character is perhaps the least developed although his motives become true to the end of the film but thats only a small hiccup. The supporting cast of Chan's posse though all have little star turns and yes the cast contains NO POP STARS. Let's hope Hong Kong carries on making these kinds of rocking Martial Art movies and not go backwards. It's this kind of film that finally tells all other countries that Hong Kong action is back.".

If not a little better or worst in other people's opinion. Well... like any given nights roam the gangs who is controlled by Sammo Hung KamBo aka.PO in the movie. He's the man that runs the entire town. Now going to be soon retire cop Simon Yam aka.Detective Chan have a grudge against PO and they go way back in the days when both of them were a lot younger. Before retiring Chan wants to end this once and for all by arresting PO again and putting him behind bars which leads to an all out brawl between the cops and the gangsters. The fight scene is very realistic but at the same time almost impossible to do in real life lol. Nevertheless this movie is very very good. If you're a movie fan that loves fighting scene. Well... this movie offer 2 of them. Throughout the 2 hours I was watching this movie I was never bored and couldn't think of a better way to make this movie better. This is one of those movie that deserve an Emmy award nomination and wins it. Final grades A Story Line A Actors A actions cinematography ects.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2003 martial arts fans were treated with the deadly art of Thai martial arts in Ong Bak. A year later Banlieue 13 gave us a glimpse of an urban freestyle sport that originated from France. In what appears to be in some respects an appropriation of Hong Kong action in many of today's films one may ask Is Hong Kong action cinema no longer at the forefront of boneshattering goodness? Any such fears are given the smackdown courtesy of Wilson Yip's SHA PO LANG SPL an utterly brutal take on the 'good cop versus bad gangster' premise starring Donnie Yen Sammo Hung and Jing Wu all of whom credit legendary Yuen Woo Ping for a lot of what they know. Simon Yam rounds out the principal cast members.SPL is a dark unforgiving action thriller that begins with detective Chan Yam recovering from a deadly strike ordered by crime boss Po Hung. Frustrated at the number of failed attempts to capture Po over the years Chan eventually gives up and looks forward to retirement. Tension is introduced to the ranks when his replacement Ma Yen a highly disciplined but violent martial arts expert joins the already troubled precinct. Truth and justice is given a twist when one of Po's henchmen kills Chan's undercover operative.SPL continues to unfold in a series of bloody confrontations as each member of Chan's team is brutally murdered by Po's righthand man Jack Wu. SPL is highlighted by some of most intense action sequences ever put to film in recent years. Wilson Yip wisely gave Donnie Yen free reign to choreograph all of the martial arts sequences of SPL. Without ever resorting to excessive edits the brawl between Donnie Yen and Jing Wu was incredible and downright ferocious! The speed at which these guys were hammering each other with their mad fighting skills had the audience whooping and hollering from the beginning and up until the disemboweling end. Remember kiddies a 40 centimeter knife is not a toy and neither is a metal baton! And no one will ever forget that it was SPL who gave us the first ever on screen showdown between Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung this was an absolute blast! We're talking about pure Hong Kong action from the late 1970s early 1980s! Sammo Hung is fat and 53 years old but he can still beat the crap out of anyone! And remember that knife I mentioned? Well consider this ... one throw one deflection one take no CG no wires just pure Sammo!After the screening director Wilson Yip and stars Sammo Hung and Jing Wu addressed the audience for a 20 minute QA session. Sammo was his jovial self as always and quite enjoyed his moment in the spotlight. Sammo provided insightful and often funny answers. And unlike Jackie Chan Sammo confirmed that he will in fact continue in the martial arts genre of film for many years to come.Okay people remember the name JING WU. He's primed and ready to become next in line after Jet Li Donnie Yen Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan as the premiere Hong Kong action cinema star. You folks will be hearing a lot more about JING WU for many years to come.So if you want to see Hong Kong cinema reaffirm its domination in the realm of combat cinema crank up your Dolby 5.1 audio system to 11 and go check out SHA PO LANG SPL.".

	schema:headline " Great climax and ending but not much else";
	schema:reviewBody "Copsandgangster movies like this are a dime a dozen and this one doesn't really bring anything original to the concept. What distinguishes this movie is that it has three martial arts masters in it the third besides Donnie Yen and Samo Hung being Jing Jacky Wu whom I just absolutely love  if only he would do more movies dammit! who ensure an extremely cool series of climactic fights at the end. Unfortunately there's hardly any fighting in the rest of the movie making it quite boring. But I like the ending even when we disregard the fights because Samo Hung's kingpin character is reminded of the true price of his lifestyle. With his loved ones dead his final triumph is meaningless. But hey after he's thrown onto a big glass shelf smashing it how come his clothes are hardly even ripped when he gets up?!Anyway  the Great Big Cool Thing about this movie for me was the fight between Donnie Yen and Jacky Wu and yeah Samo Hung did pretty damn well for himself too!. I just can't get over Jacky Wu's moves. That guy is so bloody good he could get bigger that both Jackie Chan and Jet Li. And I hope he eventually does. I sat and waited for him to come on screen seeing it from a mile away when he finally did and cheering like crazy!The few fights in this movie are extremely fast think Bruce Lee and look very real i.e. no extrafast camera work. Beautiful. If anybody thought Donnie Yen was past his prime they should see this movie.Still  if Jacky Wu and Donnie had to fight for real I very seriously doubt that Donnie would have any chance at all. In this movie Donnie wins because he's the senior actor and the good guy whereas Jacky Wu is still really just starting out. But damn his few scenes in this movie really makes the whole thing worthwhile.Storywise this couldn't rise above a 5 or 6 rating but because of the fights the good ending and the presence of Jacky Wu yaaay!!! I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Some memorable scenes but not a really great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was full of hope for this movie mainly because of its stellar cast of Simon Yam Samo Hung and Donnie Yen and the hype up confrontation cum battle between the latter two on screen. With their martial arts background action fans will be in for a treat. Also with the string of disappointments so far with Mob Sister and Election the edited version shown here I'd thought that this one would've lived up to its potential no coincidence that Yam was in the other 2 films mentioned.While I enjoyed the movie and its build up I felt particularly let down by the ending. The beginning of the movie with its explanation of the background of the Chinese Astrology the film identifies itself with hence the acronym SPL would have set the expectation but perhaps its the execution that I couldn't come to terms with. Then again it provided one of the better special effects  stunt shots. It could and I am speculating here the ending was such cos I'm the bigger star here.But I'm digressing. It's a copsandrobbers story that has set its main focus simply at cops going all out to nab the robber. Simon Yam and his team of maverick cops share their common hatred for Samo Hung the same way that Kevin Costner's Elliot Ness and his Untouchables do with Robert De Niro's Al Pacino. They try to nail the mobster but each time he goes scot free. Things get interesting when opportunity presents itself as morality gets questioned and highlights the goodbadugly blackwhitegray situations that cops sometimes find themselves in with that universal question  Do the means matter to justify the end? Thrown into the fray is hotshotultracool demeanour cop Donnie Yen who is supposed to take over from Yam as the latter is set to retire over the Father's Day weekend. He too has his loyalties challenged when he learns of the plot that Yam and team pulls. What appeals is the way these characters get sucked into a chain of events that neither can pull out from  does fatedestinythe stars all determine the chain of events that follow? The subplots get in the way sometimes as the pace for the events that follow that weekend gets broken up for sentimentality  Yam's taking care of a little girl smells like Mob Sister's a cop buddy's love for his estranged daughter bears some resemblance to The Rock's Sean Connery and Samo Hung's love for his wife and newborn child interrupts tense moments with its dreamy mobile phone ring tone. I was also wondering whether Simon Yam found it dejavu to be driving Yen around in a car showing their jurisdiction  seemed too familiar with a similar scene in Election where he was driving Tony Leung around to show him their territory.Though you might expect to see punches fly between Yen and Hung and with its M18 rating you really don't get to see punches until at least 30 minutes into the movie. While the fight between the two upstages Daredevil's hero versus oversized Kingpin I'm still amazed by Samo's agility at his age it's really the battle between Yen and newcomer Jing Wu an uberviolent knife wielding villain that is the highlight and makes this movie worth the price of admission. It's fast slick violent and beautifully choreographed you'd just wish it could've been longer. Violent it is and uncensored but it doesn't get too gratuitous with blood. The fight sequences stand out for its stark brutality and perhaps also for its realism.You must forgive the acting at times though as there's nothing to shout about really. Simon Yam is the nononsense but willing to bend the rules cop Donnie Yen with his overconfident attitude and Hung just hams it up as the cigar chomping Kingpin of Crime. But perhaps I would like to shout about the introduction of Yam's team to the audience when Yen visited their empty office  it's very retro with the characters given the spotlight after undergoing a short action sequence in a police raid.On the whole the movie works up till the supposed ending which put me off and where the final hurrah brings it down a little. It has many stylized moments accompanied with an upbeat soundtrack but it's substance over style that matters sometimes. I'd recommend it for the stylomylo moments the alleyway fight and the suggestion that not everything can be categorized into black and white.".

Well I can safely say that the cinema has climbed out of the grave and with it some good things. But like any zombie clawing its way out of the ground it brought back some bad with it too. And I'm not talking about a thirst for brains.What can certainly be praised in this film is the cinematography and the action direction. The entire film is shot in such a way that almost every shot is framed memorably. Almost every picture is beautiful. That's pretty amazing. And then there's the action. There are not many sequences and the film's action doesn't really pick up until the last third of the film but when the action sequences show up they are exhilarating and impressive. Certainly some of the most wonderfully choreographed and shot fighting sequences I've seen in almost any picture recently.And unfortunately the string that ties those two praiseworthy elements together is a poorly shaped story and an element of the old HK pictures that should've stayed dead repeated overblown melodrama. First of all the story has to do with cops trying to take down robbers. That's fine in itself. It worked amazingly well in the Hong Kong crime drama Infernal Affairs. In Sha Po Lang it doesn't work.One of the primary problems is that the film doesn't seem to be sure what kind of film it wants to be. It's story is too complicated to make for a good action film evidenced by its lack of action for the majority of the film's running time. The characters are all too simple to make for a good drama onenote characterizations are what differentiate the different cops. And so instead of melting two worlds together effectively the film just throws melodrama at us to convince us that the story is worthwhile and the characters are worth caring about.It's fine that the onenote characters all have their little issues but since the film doesn't care enough about the characters to spend any more time on them when dramatic conflict strikes the melodramatic direction the film has at those moments seems overthetop. What's worse is that these overblown moments happen over and over to major and minor character alike so when I got to the end melodramatic moments I was completely desensitized to it and was annoyed that every minor and major character got treated with the same ridiculousness overthetop direction. I say if a minor character bites the dust or has something else bad happen to them don't dwell on it too longthe director needs to focus on the primary characters and the story! This is further taken to the realm of madness by the hyperdramatic score which has to swell up with its strings every few minutes yes that's the frequency of dramatic events in this filmit's exhausting. This is another aspect of old school HK cinema that couldn't been learned from. Just because the music is overly dramatic doesn't make the situation or the story any more dramatic. Music shouldn't lead the audience it should support the moment in the film! Argh!All this lead up to one of the most frustrating viewings I've had recently. There was enough good about the film that I wished that the rest was a whole lot better. But waffling back and forth between things done really well and things done really poorly just frustrated me. I was very satisfied by the kinetic action sequences and nearly driven to madness by the poorly realized drama. So I can't give this film a high score or a low score. In the end I have to say that this film has some merit but it would need a whole lot of work to be good. If you do watch it don't feel too bad for fast forwarding 23 of the movie to get to the action. You aren't missing a whole lot. 610.".

Just did not buy the Donnie Yen character heading in the direction he did. Not a classic not a great action film but if you are fan I guess track it down on DVD.There was zero introductions Sammo was in town the night before but failed to show up on this day. There were some folks asking for pictures at the end of the screening so I suspect some of the actorsproduction people showed up late. For me didn't recognize a single soul.".

Not a classic not a great action film but if you are fan I guess track it down on DVD.There was zero introductions Sammo was in town the night before but failed to show up on this day. There were some folks asking for pictures at the end of the screening so I suspect some of the actorsproduction people showed up late. For me didn't recognize a single soul.";

In fact there have been better cop films than SPL released in more recent times in the territory Infernal Affairs and Running Out of Time to name just two. What SPL does do successfully is tap into the style and tone of the type of films that made Hong Kong action film popular with western audiences during the 80s and 90s. In SPL the line between right and wrong good guys and bad guys is blurred to the point of it almost becoming invisible often a feature in John Woo's output. The fact that the film's most likable? character is a brutal mobster shows how there is no black and white in the world of Sha Po Lang just differing shades of grey. It's Sammo Hung's excellent performance as gangster Po committed family man yet also a ruthless violent crime boss that is at the heart of the film. Against him all the traditionally good cop characters seem to have to sacrifice their innate sense of right in order to achieve what they see as justice being done resulting in them becoming more like the man they're trying to bring down. It all leads to regret violence death and a shocking finale that should live long in viewers memories. As for the action sequences they are well executed if a little too brief but none of them would make it into a ten or twenty! best HK fight scenes list. Simply put Sha Po Lang is a well put together police thriller with decent action and a satisfyingly bleak film noiresquire tone. It's well worth seeing and if it kickstarts a return to the classic action style of Hong Kong cinema even better!".

	schema:reviewBody "When dealing with mangatomovie adaptations or any adaptation for that matter the director and his staff have to be very careful with the material that they have at their disposal. When all is said and done and the film is released the reaction to it can lead numerous paths. For instance the film could be a disservice to the original fan base displeasing hardcore fans alike. On the flip side the film could also follow the route of being a faithful adaptation that could win over new fans as well as please the existing fans. Love Com is the rare case where the film is neither considered a fan service or fan disservice at least when I viewed it.The film's storyline is the reiteration of the manga Lovely Comlex. The main quirk of the manga is its two protagonists Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Otani who although with their considerable height differences begin to fall for one another. In the film version Risa is played by model Ema Fujisawa while Atsushi is played by singer and drama star Teppei Koike. The casting was a highlight for the film with each of the lead roles as well as the supporting cast providing an accurate outwardly depiction of the manga cast. The use of vibrant colors throughout the film as well as the creative costume designs were also highlights of the film. Where the film falters though is the incredibly overreacting acting from the cast. Each character is so widely animated it gets to be a little irritating after awhile. I understand the use of facial expressions in order to express to the viewer what the character is going through but the over abundant use just wears out over time. Combine this with a plot that is so thin you can guess what happens next and you got yourself a ticket to cinema clichville.Speaking of the clich nature of the film the film starts out promising enough but then soon drivels into absurdity. For a film that harps so much on the height difference of its protagonists it soon drops all that in favor for your standard trivial boy and girl don't like each other at first but then slowly begin to fall for one another plot. In the end the movie felt like one long Japanese television drama episode which isn't a bad thing but they could've done a lot more.This is a quirky film and you will probably have to be in the right mood to watch it. Not a film I would recommend to newcomers just stick to reading the manga first then watch but it's a film that should please some fans but I imagine not all. Not entirely bad Love Com does what it needs to do and that is provide the laughs which is one thing it does right.Visit cinemarepose.com for more Asian movie reviews.".

The director tried to give the film the feel of an anime but what may work with drawn characters just looks plain silly with real people the tone the attitude the gestures all were exaggerated very cartoonish and utterly unconvincing. It didn't look like a romantic comedy  which isn't a bad thing per se  but like a sitcom with a colorful but lackluster production design and cinematography. For a film shot in 35mm meant to be released in theatres that's totally off the mark.The actors who were in their early twenties played their characters not as the teenagers they were supposed to be but as children. Otani for instance the male character wore a pink cap askew long shirts and gestured like an adult impersonating a small child. That was passably ridiculous. The female lead Ema Fujisawa wasn't particularly impressive either she made a lot of useless silly faces stupid motions giving the same impression as Otani that of a small child in an adult's body. I haven't seen the anime but just from browsing pictures it seems obvious they gave an immaturity to their characters that wasn't there in the first place in an attempt to create some light happy atmosphere.Ema Fujiwasa was cute in spite of her big ears she had a nice face and her acting skill was superior to that of her male partner she did cry well. In spite of my different grips against the film it's mostly thanks to her that the film is watchable until the end. Another reason is that it gradually gets a bit better perhaps because Otani character is a bit less childish than at the beginning perhaps because we get used to the overacting. Some of the humorous side characters the teacher and Kunimi Maitake were on the better side of things too. However I could not shake off the feeling I was watching a Japanese sitcom and not a motion picture.It's a pity because the main idea was good it was about human prejudices the embarrassment and obstacles both sex may have to overcome if a man is dating a taller woman perhaps felt even stronger in a rigorous society like Japan. That may seem a trivial theme but there was definitely something worthwhile to explore there I'm sure however the manga and the anime did it better. One thing though that I must give credit to the film was to make use of the excellent song from Puffy Ai no Shirushi been listening to it when writing this. Too bad the song wasn't more inspirational to the film crew !".

He has a wonderful person who has confessed her love for him in no uncertain terms he has all of his friends saying that this girl who he is great friends with loves him. Inspite of all this he brush her off and he refuses her for most of the series and while being idiotic can be alright at times there is definitely a limit to how stupid you should be. At some point it turns from being stupid to being downright cruel. This is all that I saw with the main male protagonist. He has no redeeming qualities as a human being in this series. I can only stand seeing him mistreat a female as much as he did in the span that I watched. Let me conclude by saying that I loved the girl in this and all the friends but the guy turned me off the series completely.

I can only stand seeing him mistreat a female as much as he did in the span that I watched. Let me conclude by saying that I loved the girl in this and all the friends but the guy turned me off the series completely. I won't ever recognize this series as a good one simply because of the main character.";

Still from what I've seen this is a very good film about Lot who led  the Hebrew people to a fertile land on the border of the cities of  Sodom and Gomorroah. Anouk Aimee does a great job portraying the queen  of the cities and Stewart Granger  plays a great Lot. The supporting actors and actresses contribute quite  a bit of talent as well but what really struck me was the costumes.  For a 1962 biblical film some of the outfits that the actresses wore  were a bit racy but that is intentional as it shows the sinful ways of  the citydwellers as opposed to the practical costumes of the  hardworking free Hebrews in fact Lot has a discussion with a slave  girl who is struggling to adapt to the ways of field work and field  dress after living a captive life as a wellkept palace servant.  The fight scenes are particularly well done employing a cast of  thousands as opposing armies and refugees. The scene where the Hebrews  defend themselves by first lighting a pit of oil and then breaking a  dam to flood a valley are well done. Even though the story may not  follow the tale as told in the Bible there's enough of it there that  the viewer comes away with the overall concept of the story. But  I  feel that this movie could be redone to stick a bit closer to the  original tale. While the queen and her brother may have been evil  there just wasn't enough evil in the cities limited by 1962 values I  suppose to warrant their destruction.  A good film for the whole family. No nudity no harsh language.".

The best ones are the last  Spartacus Ben Hur and this one. Perhaps there were too much films of that kind in that era and the public don't seem to like it anymore. Perhaps that's why this movie don't have the public success it deserves. I'm very nostalgic of these biblic Greek and Romans films. I would like to see someone for today make a film like this with the new techniques of the day. Perhaps Spielberg? I would also like to see a Roman Empre film with the historical perspective of the Romans not in the version of Christian faith. We all know that Romans were a very great civilisation.

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Aldrich has directed an entertaining though far from serious retelling of the Old Testament saga. The story starts out sticking close to the original. Lot  Stewart Granger decides to split with his Uncle Abraham and take his group of Hebrews on a different route as they make their nomadic way across the desert. Of course they come upon the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The characters they meet there are bigger than life. The Queen of Sodom is wickedly played by the wonderful Anouk Aimee. She rules the twin cities of the Plain with her leering brother portrayed by Stanley Baker. They both have a ball chewing the scenery and seducing whomever strikes their fancy. The Queen has the eye for young female beauties. Her brother has an eye for both of Lot's daughters. These fun plot additions are distinct divergences from the Old Testament tale. Lot himself falls for the slave girl Pier Angeli. Royal intrigues and political betrayals run rampant. There are also some good action sequences. One in particular has the Hebrews protecting the cities from invading intruders by destroying a dam they have built inundating their enemies as Moses would do centuries later. Of course the spectacular finale is the destruction of the cities followed by the Pillar of Salt transformation of Lot's wife. The script writers have left out the tidbit about Lot's own daughters getting him drunk and taking him to bed because they think they are the last people on earth. I guess that was a bit too racy for the audiences in 1962. Sodom  Gomorrah came at the tail end of the cycle of biblical spectacles. It certainly wasn't the worst. Its entertainment value includes a superb score by Miklos Rozsa which raises all of the fighting and heavy breathing to a higher level than one would expect.".

The citizens of Sodom long since accustomed to their lifestyles are intrigued by these hard working morally upright people who call themselves sons and daughters of a desert God. Sodom's ruler sees these people as an opportunity for wealth while her brother the King of Sodom sees the potential for military strength. Either way the Hebrews are in more danger than they realize especially when after an attack by a desert clan the Hebrews lose everything and must move inside Sodom for protection.From there it is a downward spiral until the people themselves become like the Sodomites knowing good but doing evil. And Lot too becomes ensconced with this new life of sin and power until he is brought down by the very ones he obeyed.It is a powerful movie of redemption and righteous judgment and it is a wonderful movie to see. I highly recommend Sodom  Gomorrah. For those of us who love the Biblical epics it's hard to top.John".

SODOM AND GOMORRAH is neither a good nor entertainingly bad film. It's just plain bad. The production values though sorta grand are awful. Everything looks grubby. The actors are totally miscast. The characters are not memorable or even interesting at any level whatsoever. The acting is awful. The action scenes are overdone and do not seem to gel with the rest of the leaden drama. The movie is all around sloppy and it's filled with many technical goofs like visible tire tracks in the desert. No one and I mean no one's heart was into this project. And it shows on screen.The mesmerizing Anouk Aime is totally miscast as the evil Queen. Playing a lesbian she wasn't believable on any level as a Queen or someone evil or as a lesbian. Stewart Granger was blah certainly compared to his excellent turn as Apollodorus in CAESAR  CLEOPATRA. I suspect Aldrich hated either the character or Granger the actor because Lot came across as someone virtuous and yet totally stupid. Like some sort of Dudley Do Wrong.Aldrich's penchant for things crude and quasitrashy are in evidence throughout the movie. He certainly loves showcasing evil lesbians in his films LYLAH CLARE KILLING OF SISTER GEORGE etc and changing the actual ruler of Sodom from a King to a Queen in order to indulge in his fetish pointed to me that the director wasn't interested in anything to do with facts or creating a compelling dramatic story. Because of this this grand epic looks no grander than your average Sword  Sandal film. In fact Peplums are more fun than this because they rarely take themselves as seriously as this misguided project. There are some moment of great unintentional cheesecamp here but the film is way too long and tedious to make it worthwhile. Skip it.".

The action sequences are really outstanding and the performances of Stanley Baker and the fabulous Anouk Aimee as the twisted wicked brother and sister are mesmerising. It is also very racy for 1962  indeed it was an X certificate upon release in the UK. In the biography of Pier Angeli it is revealed that she and Stewart Granger were not on speaking terms and during filming they spoke to each other only when they were working together. Pier also make a point of making Granger aware he was the only one of the film's leading actors that she had not slept with while on location! If you get the chance do watch this film. It's nowhere near the disaster you might be expecting ... and by the way none of those campy lines people have quoted Do not bend to the Sodomites etc are actually contained in the film!".

Pier also make a point of making Granger aware he was the only one of the film's leading actors that she had not slept with while on location! If you get the chance do watch this film. It's nowhere near the disaster you might be expecting ... and by the way none of those campy lines people have quoted Do not bend to the Sodomites etc are actually contained in the film!";

	schema:reviewBody "I just completed watching the original 154minute version of this film.Aside from the fact that it features a character named Lot along with his wife who is ultimately transformed into a pillar of salt Lot's two daughters the brief appearance of what we assume to be two Angels and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah there is very little in the storyline which adheres to or resembles the account which we find in Genesis 18161938 in the Bible. In short 99.9 of this movie is pure fiction.Let me give you a few examples.In the Scriptures it is the Patriarch Abraham who has a conversation with the Lord and two of His Angels and who begs the Lord to spare the two wicked cities if even ten righteous men can be found in them. However in this movie it is Lot who has this conversation. Furthermore while Abraham is briefly mentioned once or twice he is nowhere to be seen whatsoever.In the Bible Lot's two daughters are both already married when it comes time to flee from Sodom. Furthermore when Lot warns their husbands to leave Sodom they both mock him. As a result only Lot his wife and his two daughters flee from Sodom escorted by the two Angels. In contrast in this movie Lot leads a whole band of obedient Hebrews out of Sodom just prior to the city's destruction and the two Angels are nowhere in sight.While the Bible makes clear that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexuality  for example see Genesis 1948 where the word know implies engaging in sex  this is not made evident in the movie. There is some evidence in the film which suggests sexual immorality. For example in the opening frames we see people  male and female  laying all over the place suggesting that they have just engaged in an orgy. Later on it is also implied that the queen of Sodom has engaged in a lesbian relationship with one of her dancers. Finally we are given to understand that the queen's brother has sexually abused both of Lot's daughters. Nevertheless there is no outright hint that the people of Sodom engaged in homosexuality.There are other problems with the plot in regards to the Scriptures but I will leave it at that.Aside from the fact that most of the movie is pure fiction  including the longdrawnout battle seen  another problem I had is that I simply did not connect with any of the characters. I felt no empathy for any of them. As a result because I had no emotional investment in any of them even when Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt it really didn't affect me in the least.Regarding the actors' performances I didn't find any of it outstanding not even Stewart Granger's or Pier Angeli's.In conclusion if you view this film with a low expectation that it will adhere closely to the Bible you may possibly enjoy it. However if you are like me and Biblical accuracy is important to you you may watch it once out of curiosity but then never watch it again.".

	schema:headline " Sodom without the Sodomy";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Biblical epics were popular in the fifties and sixties the tale originally told in the nineteenth chapter of Genesis of the patriarch Lot and his sojourn in Sodom and Gomorrah does not seem a prime candidate for such treatment. After all the one thing every schoolboy knows about the Sodomites is that they gave the word sodomy to the English language and in the days of the Production Code homosexuality was the Abominable Vice not to be referred to by filmmakers. And wasn't there all that unpleasant business about Lot sleeping with his daughters while drunk? Well this film tells the story of Sodom and Gomorrah without ever mentioning the sin of Sodom. Or for that matter the sin of incest. Whenever the word Sodomite is used it is as description of a geographical origin not of sexual orientation. There is plenty of heterosexual monkey business and it is vaguely implied that the Queen of Sodom whose friendships with attractive young slavegirls can be suspiciously close may have lesbian tendencies but of male homosexuality there is never a mention. Unless possibly unintentional doubles entendres like Do not allow yourselves to bend to the Sodomites count as such.In this version of the story Lot is the leader of a wandering Hebrew tribe who settle on land by the Jordan granted to them by Bera Queen of Sodom. For a tribe of pastoral nomads the Hebrews show a remarkably advanced knowledge of civil engineering building a dam to water their land and for a people who claim to be devoted to peace they have an equally welldeveloped grasp of military strategy helping the Sodomites defeat their Edomite enemies. As a result Lot becomes the Queen's trusted adviser. There are also a number of subplots Lot a widower falls in love with and marries the slavegirl Ildith one of Bera's discarded favourites. Astaroth Bera's brother who is plotting to overthrow his sister becomes unknown to her father the lover of Lot's attractive daughter Shuah although the Bible says of Lot's daughters that they have not known man.At the centre of the film is a potentially interesting moral dilemma. In the film the major vice of the Sodomites is not sodomy but slavery their economy is based upon the export of salt which is mined by slaves. In this version of history the Hebrews have a fundamental moral objection to slavery and offer sanctuary to slaves escaping from the city. In this respect the film deviates from the version of history contained in the Bible according to which the ancient Hebrews themselves kept slaves Lot's uncle Abraham is said to have fathered a child by his female slave Hagar. When Lot becomes the Queen's adviser he hopes that he and his people will be able to use their influence to convert the Sodomites to the worship of the one true God and to persuade them to abandon slavery. The film therefore could have been an exploration of the dilemma brilliantly explored in Roland Joffe's The Mission of whether the virtuous should collaborate with evildoers in the hope that one can thereby mitigate their evil or actively oppose them with the risk that this might provoke them to commit even more wicked acts.The makers of Sodom and Gomorrah intended essentially to come to the same conclusion as did Joffe and his scriptwriter Robert Bolt in The Mission namely that one should resist evil rather than temporise with it. Lot realises too late that his collaboration with the Queen has not persuaded the Sodomites to become more humane but has rather led to his own people becoming less so and to their becoming corrupted by the sexual temptations on offer.Yet the film does not work as a moral fable because it takes the ethical values of the Old Testament story at face value. The controversial author Philip Pullman recently described the God of the Old Testament as a psychotic tyrant. This is a huge oversimplification some parts of the Old Testament have a far more elevated conception of the Deity but as far as the God of Genesis 19 goes it seems pretty much on the mark. Smiting four whole cities according to the Bible God smote not only Sodom and Gomorrah but also Admah and Zeboim with fire and brimstone because of the sexual proclivities of their inhabitants must count as a massive overreaction and the story does not become any more morally edifying if as here God is motivated by a dislike of slavery rather than of homosexuality especially as the slaves perish along with their masters. As for the bizarre episode in which Lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt for the crime of looking behind her that seems to reveal God as a tyrant with the soul of a rules are rules bureaucrat.The film was an AmericanFrenchItalian coproduction which accounts for some of the odd accents some of the cast appear not to have spoken English with any fluency. Among them is the Italian actress Pier Angeli as Ildith who by chance also appeared in the last religious epic I saw The Silver Chalice. Pier also appears to have had difficulties in picking the right film because both films are among the weakest epics ever made pretentious bombastic and with an overinflated sense of their own significance. Of the two Sodom and Gomorrah is slightly the better it provides more genuine spectacle and Stewart Granger despite some frequently ridiculous dialogue does at least have the presence and gravitas to portray a Biblical patriarch whereas Paul Newman playing the hero of The Silver Chalice looks horribly wooden and outofplace. By comparison however with any of the classics of the epic genre such as The Ten Commandments or Spartacus Sodom and Gomorrah looks very thirdrate material indeed. 510".

	schema:headline " This movie is without merit. No bible based fact other than the name of the movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was awful. It is one of the worst movies by far that I have seen. The actors are great no doubt. But the storyline is way off basis.Lot never had to lead any people especially the Hebrews. Lot settled with his wife and 2 daughters because the land was enriched well watered region that was like the garden of Jehovah. It must have been the perfect place to settle his family since lot chose the whole district of Jordan. But the people was deceptive. Once Lot settled in he then realized that the 2 cities was not god fearing. They openly practiced homosexuality and any possible sin under the sun. The bible states that the men were bad and gross sinners against GOD. gen 13713 gen 1917 2326 30 Lot and his family feared and loved their God Jehovah. Because of their love for GOD and GOD's love for them he sent 2 angels to save Lot and his family. But before the destruction of these 2 cities Lot tried to reason with GOD to save the cities if he could find just 1 just man in either of the 2 cities. Lot could not find 1. Lot no doubt was well off and enjoyed living in modern homes of that time with running water instead of tents he once inhabited.Once GODs angels led Lot and HIS FAMILY Lot his wife and 2 daughters to the safety of the mountainous region thats when the destruction took place. Lot eventually with his daughters were reduced to living in a cave after the destruction.This movie does not stick to the historical biblical facts. At the end of the movie there shows a multitude of people leaving Sodom and Gomorrah heading to as the narrator says promised land. There was only 3 people who survived that destruction. Lot's wife looked back longing for the life left behind in those cities causing her to become a pillar of salt. Both cities were destroyed and not 1 soul survived! Moses is the only servant of the True GOD Jehovah to lead the Hebrews from Egyptian bondage to the promised land.I was really disappointed in this movie because it did not stick to biblical facts. The movie is OK and good to have in a collection but keep in mind that it does not portray actual events. The bible does not speak of a Queen and odds with her brother and it certainly does not tell of any pact that Lot made with any queen to protect the cities from invading nations.If it was not for the off based facts then this movie would rank with movies like Ben Hur Spartacus and 10 Commandments I would not recommend this movie simply because it is not bible based and the facts are off based.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was awful. It is one of the worst movies by far that I have seen. The actors are great no doubt. But the storyline is way off basis.Lot never had to lead any people especially the Hebrews. Lot settled with his wife and 2 daughters because the land was enriched well watered region that was like the garden of Jehovah. It must have been the perfect place to settle his family since lot chose the whole district of Jordan. But the people was deceptive. Once Lot settled in he then realized that the 2 cities was not god fearing. They openly practiced homosexuality and any possible sin under the sun. The bible states that the men were bad and gross sinners against GOD. gen 13713 gen 1917 2326 30 Lot and his family feared and loved their God Jehovah. Because of their love for GOD and GOD's love for them he sent 2 angels to save Lot and his family. But before the destruction of these 2 cities Lot tried to reason with GOD to save the cities if he could find just 1 just man in either of the 2 cities. Lot could not find 1. Lot no doubt was well off and enjoyed living in modern homes of that time with running water instead of tents he once inhabited.Once GODs angels led Lot and HIS FAMILY Lot his wife and 2 daughters to the safety of the mountainous region thats when the destruction took place. Lot eventually with his daughters were reduced to living in a cave after the destruction.This movie does not stick to the historical biblical facts. At the end of the movie there shows a multitude of people leaving Sodom and Gomorrah heading to as the narrator says promised land. There was only 3 people who survived that destruction. Lot's wife looked back longing for the life left behind in those cities causing her to become a pillar of salt. Both cities were destroyed and not 1 soul survived! Moses is the only servant of the True GOD Jehovah to lead the Hebrews from Egyptian bondage to the promised land.I was really disappointed in this movie because it did not stick to biblical facts. The movie is OK and good to have in a collection but keep in mind that it does not portray actual events. The bible does not speak of a Queen and odds with her brother and it certainly does not tell of any pact that Lot made with any queen to protect the cities from invading nations.If it was not for the off based facts then this movie would rank with movies like Ben Hur Spartacus and 10 Commandments I would not recommend this movie simply because it is not bible based and the facts are off based.";

Soon enough it's a topselling American dessert product known as The Stuff and everyone just can't seem to get enough of it. Industrial saboteur Moe Rutherford is hired by some rival companies to dig up information on The Stuff and he learns that it strangely got by FDA tests with those who passed it disappearing. Moe with the help of Nicole the advertising designer for 'The Stuff ' and a young boy Jason whose family became obsessed with the deadly substance. Discover that the addictive dessert is actually alive and taking over the body of whoever eats it.Yummy! For those looking for some tasty schlock that's low in calories and is a complete throwback to 1950's SciFi horror. Larry Cohen's The Stuff definitely leaves a sweet taste in your mouth. Despite it's familiarity with the likes of The Blob and The Invasion of the Body Snatchers the neat premise still manages to feel fresh sharp and ambitious because of the unpretentious fun that's generated. All of this shows up in Cohen's enthusiastically accomplished direction and ace timing where his offtherocker style shines immensely. Like most of his films the playfully witty script digs deep into a social commentary and the flavour of the month happened to be consumerism and it's grip on society. The irony suggested ending paints it perfectly. Not all of it is light and goofball in tone as there are some dark moody and gooey inclusions to the fold. There's a heavy cartoonlike atmosphere cooked up within a few striking images of creepiness and the deliciously campy special effects are well staged for such a lowbudget production. Pacing is judge accordingly to pull you in. Cinematographer Paul Gickleman fluidly shot the film and the lively music score by Dwight Dixon ticks along fittingly. Cohen also pens the colourful story which is terribly fractured with vagueness and continuity problems but it's quirky maniac humour zany developments with a surprise or two and satire frame of mind goes a long way to covering that problem up. The fruity performances are acceptably apt to what's happening on screen. The always interesting performer Michael Moriarty is wickedly good as the smarting downbeat industrial spy Moe Rutherford. Paul Sorvino provides some amusing comic relief as an high strung offtheboil rightwing Colonel. Andrea Marcovicci Garrett Morris Danny O'Neal Patrick O'Neal Scott Bloom and Cohen regular James Dixon give splendid support too.Even with some lapses within the story due to probably the editing and it being one of his lesser features it's hard not to be infatuated by Cohen's outrageously delightful and creative treat for the taste buds.".

What's more is that the special effects which in my book are about 80 of a horror film were much to my surprise pretty damned good. In fact I was actually surprised by the whole thing really and actually came to enjoy it.If you enjoy The Stuff perhaps you'll enjoy a 1994 Australian horror film of a similar nature entitled 'Body Melt.'

	schema:headline " Lot's of fun to be had with Cohen's The Stuff!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Stuff is another delightful horror film from the hand of Larry Cohen and plays out something like a meeting between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Blob. After seeing films like It's Alive and Q The Winged Serpent the style and way that this film plays out doesn't come as a surprise. Larry Cohen is a master of schlock horror and I definitely rate The Stuff as one of his best films! The film is definitively eighties the whole feel of The Stuff is very much reminiscent of the trash decade and things such as the 'flash' advertisements for the product at the centre of the film as well as the music help to ensure this. The story takes in ideas of greed and more importantly consumerism as we follow a couple of miners who discover a viscous white liquid emanating from the ground. The chances of me tasting something that I'd just seen bubble out of the Earth are nil but these guys do and discover that it's actually very tasty! One successful marketing campaign later and everyone is tucking into the tasty new desert...but there's more to what people are calling 'The Stuff'...Given that this is a silly horror film its commentaries and themes are actually put across rather well. The audience is never allowed to take it completely seriously but the way that the film builds up the scenario and sees everyone purchasing what the media has told them to buy is strangely haunting all on its own. Besides that even themes in a film that can't really put them across appropriately is better than no themes at all which shows Larry Cohen's talent for creative scriptwriting. The film is lead by Michael Moriarty who worked with Cohen in Q and the third instalment of the It's Alive series and does a great job in this one. While his acting isn't very good he's constantly amusing and actually has really good screen presence I often found myself wanting to see him back on screen during the scenes he wasn't in. The special effects are typically silly but far better and more believable than most CGI rubbish. The scenes that see people breaking apart are oddly frightening and I've got to say that I loved the 'Blob' style scenes where The Stuff itself was on the rampage. On the whole The Stuff might not do much for those who don't like schlock horror but if you ask me it's a great fun ride and I highly recommend it!".

	onyx:emotionText "The Stuff is another delightful horror film from the hand of Larry Cohen and plays out something like a meeting between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Blob. After seeing films like It's Alive and Q The Winged Serpent the style and way that this film plays out doesn't come as a surprise. Larry Cohen is a master of schlock horror and I definitely rate The Stuff as one of his best films! The film is definitively eighties the whole feel of The Stuff is very much reminiscent of the trash decade and things such as the 'flash' advertisements for the product at the centre of the film as well as the music help to ensure this. The story takes in ideas of greed and more importantly consumerism as we follow a couple of miners who discover a viscous white liquid emanating from the ground. The chances of me tasting something that I'd just seen bubble out of the Earth are nil but these guys do and discover that it's actually very tasty!

I always loved the cover when I was younger but I was always very hesitant about the horror section mainly because every movie in there seemed too old. Years later I'm accepting the cheese like it's a brother and tell you what I'm so glad I waited to see this. The Stuff is the sh!t.The story starts with a couple guys finding this white creamy ooze coming out of the ground. The one dude who initially discovered it actually tastes it! And low and behold the Stuff actually tastes great! Not long later this creamy ooze is now a nation wide dessert hit and has been named The Stuff. A oddball trio of sorts private investigator little boy who has great intuition for alien desserts and a campaign organizer band together to stop people from eating The Stuff and get down to figure out exactly what it is. What follows is in my opinion easily one of the best horrorcomedies that came out of the 80s. It's got a great lead with Michael Moriarty who delivers his lines like a recent famous president and an entertaining supporting cast which includes Danny Aiello and Garrett Morris classic SNL.One thing I don't understand about this flick though. Why on Earth is it Rated R? I suppose there's a couple scenes of gore but damn this felt very lighthearted and comical. I suppose I just didn't pick up on the swears. Also if anyone reading this is a fan of Futurama I couldn't help but think of the Slurm episode...realizing the famous product originates from a hideous source. Nevertheless The Stuff has all the ingredients for a fun night and if you've been looking for a classic 80's horror flick to watch look no further.".

	schema:reviewBody "Our beloved horror friend Larry Cohen is in great shape again as the writer and director of this delightful tongueincheek tale of madness named The Stuff. With some imagination the best way to describe this film is as a demented version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers since it equally focuses on an alien? life force attempting to take over by eating humans from the inside. Only in Cohen's wicked fantasy it is the dumb humans themselves who allow this to happen easily! When a strange kind of yummy liquid seemly producing itself straight from the ground is discovered in a remote industrial zone it quickly becomes a popular and addictive dessert thanks to slick marketing campaigns and naive consumers. This tasty snack however has a mind of its own and the people who consume it undergo bizarre mental and physical transformations. The only form of revolt comes from a young kid and an unscrupulous exFBI agent turned industrial spy. With his lightheaded and extremely entertaining scenario Cohen simultaneously grabs the opportunity to criticize some typically American issues like the Cold War the consumer society and the dangerous influence of clever marketing boys. Personally I think you can't but love Larry Cohen's work for the horror genre! You have to admit that the evil in his films aren't exactly your ordinary kind of monsters It's Alive featured a murderous baby Q the Winged Serpent was a giant lizard living on rooftops etc and his unsubtle chaotic sense of humor is just marvelous. It might be acquired taste but I thought the right wing army led by a brilliant Paul Sorvino was a hilarious finding for this type of black comedy. The gore and special effects unfortunately weren't as outrageous as I thought they would be but there still definitely are a few great sequences for gorehounds to enjoy like for example stretching mouths and exploding eyeballs. Michael Moriarty is splendid in the leadrole and some of his lines perfectly portray the tone of the film no one is as dumb as I appear. The Stuff is a hugely enjoyable 80's quickie that'll certainly appeal to the numerous fans of undemanding horror. Along with Frank Hennenlotter Larry Cohen might be considered the most creative horror director ever. I would pay big money to see a project of them two together!".

Then all of a sudden the director and actors remembered they were making a silly BMovie and acted accordingly. But even with the worst BMovies there is always a level of consistency such as the similar 'The Blob.' The original 'Blob' showed us a creature mass that consumed victims and grew bigger. The horrid 1988 remake showed us a now pink blob and gave a more realistic reasoning behind why it consumed humans. Pink? 'Stuff' shows us some yogurt that pumps from the ground sometimes moves on its own sometimes doesn't. Sometimes it leaves its host and returns sometimes it leaves killing the host. Sometimes it's allergic to fire a cheap reverse rip off of the freezing cold enemy of the Blob sometimes it rolls in it. Sometimes it needs to be refrigerated sometimes it's fine warm. There was no consistency. I am aware it is a campy BMovie but like I said in the beginning there was hope here for a decent scifi thriller  so remake it with a better script. It was if the creators had special effects to spare and screamed 'Look at what I can do!' Said in best Stuart voice from MadTV reruns. Believe it or not the main character not that boy  oh God I hope this was his firstlast film 'Mo' Rutherford Michael Moriarty was actually funny enough to get through to the end. I first watched this film when I was 8 or 9 and it freaked me out beyond terror.

	schema:reviewBody "I have been trying to find this movie for over the last 20yrs. Back in 1985 I saw the trailer for it on T.V. and it started out with an ice cream truck driving down the street. Some kids and adults gathered around the truck while the announcers stated that The Stuff was here. It's creamy yummy and you can't get enough of it. Then it showed a man who had eaten about half his ice cream cone and the announcer changed his tone and said It will take you over eat you and kill you. and the camera zooms up on the guys mouth and you can see the creamy white Stuff eating away the inside of his mouth. Bleah!! It was pretty gross and freaked me out back then. Something like this would have 410yrs old running from their T.V. sets. Talk about setting up kids for nightmares.I tried googling parasite eating ice cream to no avail until one day on IMDb I was looking up info on an old Snuff film from the 70's and saw The Stuff come up. Immediately I knew this was the film. So I ran to the video store and was able to rent it.Not only was this movie not scary but the acting and the comedic nature were even worse. To make a long story short here is the premise. Two guys working at a petroleum factory stumble across a pool of white creamy stuff in the ground. One of the guys sticks his finger in it and tastes it. Now I don't know about you buy any normal person would never taste anything coming out of the ground unless it was water from a Spring pool. Anyway the guy who tastes it says it taste real good. So good in fact that they decide to market it as a new kind of ice cream treat even though it's not ice cream. Before you know it it's the best thing since the hot dog and everyone is eaten the stuff in gallons. People who try it can't stop eating it. This causes other tasty treats on the market to lose profits. Several snack food manufacturers come together and hire an investigator to find out where and how this Stuff is made. In comes David 'Mo' Rutherford the private detective who will investigate this tasty treat's mystery. He soon finds out that The Stuff is causing people to become uncontrollable zombies. The Stuff takes over their bodies and when it's done using them it eats their insides and leaves through their mouths. It's alive. He also eventually finds out where this stuff is being stored.The special effects of this stuff is average at best. The movie The Blob Steve McQueen did a better job and that came out many years before this. The acting is pretty back. Only Michael Moriarty seems to be enjoying himself. Paul Sorvino and Danny Aiello are completely wasted in this film. Garrett Morris makes a short appearance but he was actually better in Car Wash then in this campy horror flick. Actually his scene is the only scary part in the film. You'll see.The whole movie is pretty far fetched and if this stuff was at retailers everywhere wouldn't there be other investigators and even FBI agents investigating this problem? I think Larry Cohen was basically trying to send a message to consumers who constantly eat and drink the same bad foods day after day Starbucks coffee donuts burgers french fries and of course ice cream. He's saying don't eat this crap as it can eventually kill you just like The Stuff. We get it but it still doesn't make the movie any better.I also think some of the scenes were removed from the film as well. Besides the ice cream truck scene in the trailer I thought the poster scene with Jason's family in the kitchen on the floor being eaten by the Stuff was in the movie as well. It didn't show up on the DVD so either it was cut or it never existed and I'm imagining things. A sequel to this movie could be interested if done right. The story of how the stuff is discovered would need to be changed of course but an adequate sequel could be accomplished. Similar to how The Blobl was remade.This movie is not really worth a look. If you must see it just rent it. It's not even a horror cult classic like The Cube Phantasm The Howling or Donnie Darko. I gave it a 410 and that was probably being generous. If you're going to made a comical horror film watch Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 and take lots of notes. The Stuff isn't funny or scary. It's mostly a waste of time.".

If it's a comedy it's not funny. If it's scifi there's no actual description of what The Stuff is. It's one great big WTF from the beginning. The Stuff with no warning or catalyst bubbles up out of the ground and some dumbass decides to eat it. That's the basis of your movie? Perhaps if you can suspend your disbelief that there are people who'll eat off the ground in the middle of a mine you can enjoy this. I can't. Bbut it controls your thoughts so... Fine. Why hadn't it done so already? What's the catalyst? Where's the back story? Or where's the explicit acknowledgment that this whole thing is one big goof?From here on out you're at the mercy of some of the dumbest plotting I've seen. Mo just walks into the middle of commercial shoot and shuts it down and no one really complains. Nicole plausibly wants to do a background check on Mo but even though there's plenty of time never gets the result. Instead she implicitly bangs Mo within five minutes of meeting him. Jason's family are sociopaths and the worst parents ever. Apparently it's the only way the scriptwriters could show the mind control aspect of The Stuff. Mo casually tells Nicole that he's an industrial spy and she just accepts that with no sense of betrayal disappointment or any emotion at all. Don't get me started on continuity. What turns this into a tragedy is that the actors all seem to be enjoying themselves. Moriarty does the hick bit perfectly. Marcovicci stunningly beautiful lifts her writeoff character above the onedimensional script. Sorvino rocks it as always. Sadly the script direction and editing conspire against their good intentions to turn this into something that MST3K would pass on.".

I was raised on horror films from the 80's and 90's and am a gore hound at heart. The stuff was listed as one of the top body horror films of the 80's and it intrigued me.But it wasn't anything that I expected. For a body horror film the stuff is incredibly nonviolent. There are a few scenes that may be slightly disturbing but it's few and far between. Further the film suffers from terrible writing and characters that making completely stupid decisions. Scenes jump all over the place the overall plot hardly makes any sense. A great example is when the main character Moe is trying to expose the stuff as a dangerous substance so while trespassing on private property instead of taking photos for evidence he decides he has to steal one of their trucks as evidence. I mean what?Or how about how the film makes it look like that the entire population is in love with The Stuff only to broadcast a radio show that says it's bad and suddenly they manage to just make it all go away?

	schema:reviewBody "I go to a lot of horror conventions and have seen Larry Cohen the director around at a few. Being in the online horror communities I see a lot of indie horror fans praising the work of Cohen. Until now the only of his films I have seen is IT'S ALIVE which is good but in no way mindblowing. I've heard that this might be his best movie but if that is the case then I don't think I need to see anymore.This movie is almost a joke. It's as bad as any movie that is mocked on MST3K and worse than the typical Syfy garbage that's pumped out each week on a low budget. Anyone giving this crapfest 10 stars on this site has clearly lost their mind. Are you telling me this is as good as the classics of horror? I don't even know where to begin with tearing this piece of Stuff apart. Forget low budget and bad effects. I actually low bad special effects especially 80s cheese. I have seen more than my share of bad 80s horror so it's not the budget or the amateur acting that's skewing my view of this in any way.We begin with a man who finds some ooze bubbling out of the earth and decides hell I might as well eat it because that's what we all think when we find white goo coming up from the ground in an industrial factory right? Fast forward and it's the next big dessert sensation so big in fact that the ice cream industry needs to bring it down so they hire the most annoying industrial spy ever. Michael Moriarty develops this character into something that I'm not sure is supposed to be satire but is more than ridiculous as a main hero. Along we way we meet a child played by the worst young actor you'll ever see. He realizes that The Stuff is evil and after not being able to convince his family goes on a rampage destroying a store that seems to have this stuff stocked in every aisle possible eventually being brought down by 3 grown men who need all their strength to hold down a 12 year old boy. We enter a fashion shoot with the worst 80s theme song you'll ever hear and the ugliest fashion models you'll ever see. Moriarty our spy barges in and tells everyone to shut it down. For no reason that makes any sense they listen to him. He develops a relationship with the marketing director who doesn't mind that he just shut down her job has a change of heart in minutes and they fall in love after about a ten minute relationship.The movie now brings us to a town where this stuff was first tested and we meet Chocolate Chip Charlie or something like that played by Garrett Morris one of the forgotten SNL alum who is just as strange as any other character in this movie. He's the former owner of some dessert emporium that was brought down by The Stuff so naturally he's taking things into his own hands by carrying out his own investigation. He's also some sort of karate expert though it's never clear whether this is meant to be serious or some joke that falls flat.What Cohen could have developed is the movie that starts to play out a movie about an American public consumed by consumption and blinded by corporate marketing. This could have been a decent movie about our obsession with product but that's not enough. Instead we find that the stuffies who are addicted to this stuff have to stop our heroes from ending their addictive substance so we get zombies who attack by throwing up a stream of the stuff at people before falling apart. The spew is completely unnecessary though. The movie has already established that the ooze can move on its' own like an obvious ripoff of THE BLOB so there is no need for it to be consumed first or for people to vomit it at out heroes. The movie can't even stick to its' own logic.Eventually we get to Paul Sorvino as some sort of Donald Trump in a military suit bent on stopping commies a man with his own private castle and militia along with a radio network for spouting his propaganda. He comes along for the ride to help our gang of heroes put a stop to The Stuff once and for all.This may have some allure for people who might have seen it as a kid though I think even 8 year old me would have thought this movie stunk. If you are a fan of schlock like BAD TASTE then it also might hold some draw for you. I don't think this movie was done with any sort of wink and a nod though and that makes it far worse. I think that Cohen actually tried to create a good movie here and what's left is some bad joke full of bad acting bad effects and a bad plot. Honestly PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is a better film than this.".

	schema:headline " Larry Cohen Delivers a Scathing Satire of Business and Consumerism";
	schema:reviewBody "A delicious mysterious goo that oozes from the earth is marketed as the newest dessert sensation. But the tasty treat rots more than teeth when zombielike snackers who only want to consume more of the strange substance at any cost begin infesting the world.Writer and director Larry Cohen does what he does best... we are brought a story of reallife American values twisted into horror to tell us what we may already know but simply do not realize. Consumers will buy anything that is popular regardless of how awful it is. And big business will sell anything for a profit even if it is harmful... and pretty much no one will stop it. Even without the horror aspects which borrow very heavily from The Blob or the social commentary the story itself is pretty good and Michael Moriarty multiple award winner is the same guy we have come to love from It's Alive III and Q.Actually Moriarty's presence in Cohen's films is always something of a mystery for me. Moriarty as many know is also a very conservative commentator sometimes even bordering on racism with his critique of the Muslim and Arab world. He seems to be on the opposite pole as Cohen if I am interpreting his films correctly. Kim Newman apparently sees this too as he describes their relationship as thorny. But maybe this is the proof of just how great Moriarty's acting really is.

	onyx:emotionText "A delicious mysterious goo that oozes from the earth is marketed as the newest dessert sensation. But the tasty treat rots more than teeth when zombielike snackers who only want to consume more of the strange substance at any cost begin infesting the world.Writer and director Larry Cohen does what he does best... we are brought a story of reallife American values twisted into horror to tell us what we may already know but simply do not realize. Consumers will buy anything that is popular regardless of how awful it is. And big business will sell anything for a profit even if it is harmful... and pretty much no one will stop it. Even without the horror aspects which borrow very heavily from The Blob or the social commentary the story itself is pretty good and Michael Moriarty multiple award winner is the same guy we have come to love from It's Alive III and Q.Actually Moriarty's presence in Cohen's films is always something of a mystery for me. Moriarty as many know is also a very conservative commentator sometimes even bordering on racism with his critique of the Muslim and Arab world. He seems to be on the opposite pole as Cohen if I am interpreting his films correctly. Kim Newman apparently sees this too as he describes their relationship as thorny. But maybe this is the proof of just how great Moriarty's acting really is.

Anyway like The Stuff itself The Stuff is fun to consume but leaves one wanting still more. It has an intriguing plot and its satire on this country's rampant consumerism does work but at the same time there aren't enough exciting set pieces and the film's joking tone fritters away any real sense of suspense. This movie might have worked a lot better if it had been more serious and less tongue in Stuffstuffed cheek. It doesn't quite hold together somehowpossibly the fault of the script or the editingand though the film looks fine with nice Bloblike Stuff FX it still feels slapdash somehow.

It's sweet and addictive and quickly gets sold like ice cream. It's all natural with no calories and incredibly filling so it helps people lose weight. Of course sales go through the roof and destroy the ice cream industry. Along with junk food mogul Charles W. Chocolate Chip Charley Hobbs these purveyors of sugar hire David Mo Rutherford Michael Moriarty who also appears in Cohen's Q to get to the bottom of The Stuff and then destroy it.The more he learns about the product the more horrified he becomes. The Stuff is actually a parasite that takes over whoever eats it taking over their brain and gradually transforming them into zombies as it consumes them from the inside out  the very inverse of how people consume products.A young boy named Jason is learning the same lesson the hard way. It's ruined his family so he destroys a supermarket display.David also meets Nicole the ad exec who learns that the campaign that she created for The Stuff has only led to death and destruction. As someone who has worked in the ad industry for over twenty years the battle between craft and commerce has never been so beautifully illustrated than it is here. The film is packed with fake commercials of celebrities hawking The Stuff including Wendy's pitchwoman Clara Where's the beef? Peller who yells Where's The Stuff? to Abe Vigoda.Everyone that consumes The Stuff eventually turns into a gooey white substance and those under its grip do everything they can to kill our heroes Nicole and David become lovers they rescue Jason just as the police arrest him. The corporation that makes The Stuff claims they are trying to rid the world of hunger but the possibly extraterrestrial substances is really being created to take over the world.They work together with retired United States Army Col. Malcolm Grommett Spears a perfectly cast Paul Sorvino Goodfellas to destroy the zombies and a lake of The Stuff before sending a civil defense message to the country  the only way to destroy The Stuff is to burn it with fire.David then visits the leader of The Stuff Company Mr. Fletcher who reveals that they haven't destroyed all of the ways they can get the product. Now they're working with the ice cream industry including Mr. Vickers who originally hired David  to make The Taste a product that is 88 ice cream and 12 The Stuff. They believe that it will be much safer and still as addictive. However David brings in Jason and the two force the CEOs to eat The Stuff at gunpoint. David asks Are you eating it or is it eating you? as the cops arrive to arrest the corporate con men.You know how you should never leave the credits during a Marvel movie? Cohen was again ahead of his time here as the final crawl also has moments showing smugglers selling The Stuff on the black market and a woman in a bathrobe saying Enough is never enough while holding a container of The Stuff.From its inventive gore and special effects to its wry social commentary The Stuff is sheer delight. It moves fast it's packed with action and it has plenty to make you laugh too. It may make you avoid ice cream for awhile too.".

Even though it has been over 15 years since I first saw this film I still really enjoyed it. I was very surprised to see so many negative comments here on IMDb. All in all the film is a little dated but it still contains some very striking visuals and original ideas. The sets used for this film were extremely well detailed and thought out as were the costumes and props. Hector is perhaps one of the coolest looking cyborgrobot characters ever conceived. The scene where he is first booted up and filled with cyberblood is just vivid and stunning. After watching this film it was also quite obvious that this movie influenced some of the more modern science fiction masterpieces like Robocop the 1st Matrix and James Cameron's Aliens. Several of the reviews harshly criticized the acting and the story but I however found no problems in this department. Nowadays we seldom see good films with a small cast and a simple story. Not every movie has to be as advanced and as complex as films like Minority Report. And I am sorry but Mark Hamill and Keanu Reeves can't hold a candle to Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel when it comes to acting. I think people are trying to compare this film to all the super budget modern scifi movies. Or perhaps this movie is regarded as crap by many because they think Star Wars is the end all be all scifi movie of all time which in my opinion Star Wars is MUCH more cheesy and way too lighthearted to take seriously. If you like serious dark scifi flicks be sure to check this one out. Don't listen to all those Star Wars nerds who crap on this film. Judge it for yourself. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "There's no point whining about what 'Saturn 3' COULD have been with a script by Martin Amis direction by Stanley Donen 'Bedazzled' and the star power of Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel. It is what it is and that is despite the impressive production values basically a throw back to a fifties bgrade monster movie. Hector is still one of the scariest movie robots of all time even if the idea of a sexcrazed machine is a trifle ludicrous and reminiscent of all those horny BEMs on pulp magazine covers and silly flicks like 'The Brain From Planet Arous'. Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas 'Spartacus' must have been in his early 60s when this was made but still exudes charisma and virility. 1970s sex symbol Farrah Fawcett 'Logan's Run' is less convincing as his love interest and is let's face it little more than eye candy. Keitel must have been wondering just how he ended up in this silliness so soon after his excellent work in 'Blue Collar' and 'Fingers' but he is creepy enough though apparently dubbed. I also got a kick out of the very brief cameo by Ed Bishop star of 1970s cult classic SF series 'UFO'. All in all an unambitious but generally effective thriller which has a few dull spots but enough scares to make it some cheesy fun. Just don't expect too much and you will enjoy it all the more.".

	schema:headline " Harmless Space Hokum";
	schema:reviewBody "Right. Saturn 3 is one of those films that always seems to divide reviewers into the two old and trustworthy camps what a great picture and who the heck let this pile of manure be made? And then it has the ability to have a solid middle ground the nyah...not bad... crowd. I have to say that I fall into this latter group. I first saw Saturn 3 when I was a teenager and was gripped by it. I remember thinking how cool Hector looked and the fact that he was also downright creepy. In the years before seeing The Terminator Hector for me was the archetypal maniac machine that will stop at nothing to kill you in a probably gruesome way. Okay the film's saving graces the overall design of the sets and costumes. Ignoring the rather bleak look of the corridors the Saturn 3 station has that feeling of being futuristic but also familiar in a Holiday Innsort of way and the launching area at the film's beginning with that great big flaming hole image effectively acting as a rather cool backdrop. Benson's and also James' space suits are very nicely done. They give off the distinct air of practicality like a hypermodern air force pressure suit and also a sense of impersonality about them which becomes menacing with the addition of the dark face plated helmets. Adam and Alex's workout gear however is very dated and it's also quite excruciating to watch their exercise routine. The ships aren't Star Wars Star Destroyers but then they're not meant to be. The way I look at it they were designed to look slightly other worldly and also practical. Benson's pod that he flies to Saturn 3 looks entirely functional and although it appears rather clunky and distinctly unaerodynamic it's worth remembering that in space there isn't any wind resistance so sleek lines aren't necessary. Unfortunately because this was a fullsized prop for the actors to interact with the other ships do look like the models they are. Hector is a piece of design excellence. For a start the actual costume is made from metal instantly rendering the appearance of a real robot. The actual laboured gait and measured way of moving employed by the actor playing Hector probably due to the considerable weight of the suit is instrumental in convincing the viewer of his cybernetic credentials. What helps is that we see Hector being constructed and that can block out any ideas of the man in a suit mold particularly in regards to the insertion of the brain tissue into effectively the torso of the costume. Finally Harvey Keitel. His performance in this film is derided by many as being too over the top and hammy but I think that he actually saw the script for what it really was  eightyodd minutes of comicbook fun. He had a ball with the Benson character and it's quite obvious that he knew he wasn't asked to do Shakespeare and play it straight. Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett are a let down to be sure. It's evident that Kirk's entering his dotage and the idea of him being an action hero and hot stud when he's the same age as most of the audience's grandfathers is frankly ludicrous. And showing your sagging butt Kirk? Should've kept those training suit bottoms on. Farrah does play Alex well when she's there to look good but any semblance of the idea that she's a research scientist just doesn't compute. The film in itself is a bit of a hit and miss affair. It aims to be a sophisticated scifi thriller like Alien but the casting of Douglas and Fawcett certainly taint any idea of it being classed as a thriller. The music what there is of it is original the direction soso and the overall concept is there but it fails to it the target spot on. An enjoyable piece of hokum to pass the time would be a fair review.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this in the theater on the day it was released in 1980. This was a Grindhouse movie shown in little theatres not in huge complexes. I went to see it not expecting muchNot expecting but got This film had the coolest robot I had ever seen in my life. Back then I was not familiar with Harvey Keitel I did not know that Roy Dotrice had overdubbed his voice all I knew is this creepy guy opens an airlock on a space station and lets his Captain fall through shattering him into a million pieces of gore and that was disturbing and it was shown within the first 5 minutes of this film  And Keitel who at the time was hidden by a black space helmet giggling about killing this guy in that horrible way what kind of film is this with a beginning like that.Not the best Stanley Donen film but Donen clearly had a talent for doing the best he could with very low budgets it could have used a few more dollars in the effects budget. It is highly Likely that John Barry directed a lot of this and his design handiwork is evident.After seeing Space done so beautifully and economically by Ridley Scott in Aliens this film for me was a return to my roots of Low Budget Science Fiction which I grew up on so I enjoyed the cheesy view of Saturn's Rings I even loved the 2D effect of the space station and Donen's directing of the initial scene where you think is this going to be a musical in space? But there were some good effects despite the Apparent lack of dollars to make them really good. And I first saw this in the theater and things always look better on that huge screen until you see it on TV and it looks Cheap.So now 32 years after I sat in that theater and was creeped out by Harvey Keitel and his robot Hector  I found a fairly good transfer of that film online and got it  And I watched it last night for the first time in 3 decades. And I still liked it the interactions between Kirk Douglass Farah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel were subtle and the dialog was understandable although a future slang was being used we can get the gist of the conversations... No Taction Contact! IE Do Not Touch!  Kirk Douglas was far from being a decrepit old man in this film he plays the lead role in his usual way although toned down from his gritting teeth roles like Spartacus. In fact this was the first film I had seen Douglas in where he was very subdued in manner but held his authority when usually he acts with a lot more force behind his words and actions. I think this was probably the biggest Movie role for Farah  not counting several made for TV movies like The Burning Bed.The Saturn 3 set is convincing as a space habitat except of course the gravity would be less than earth's there is no mention of artificial gravity so we have to take all that for granted in the film.The Hector concept was the first time I had seen in a movie that a robot had to be programmed from a human brain and if that brain has problems I'm not malfunctioning You are as Hector tells Benson So this film makes clear that a guy who giggles over murdering his captain in cold blood if this guy is the template for Hector's Programming then watch out  The film made this concept very clear. This was also the first time in a movie where we see a socket at the base of a man's skull this has been used in Science Fiction movies up to The Matrix.The design of some of the spaceships came from earlier science fiction movies and we can blame veteran effects man Wally Veevers for some of the opticals in this film... The threewinged craft that comes to check on Saturn 3 is very familiar I like that this was done that way it connected this film which was at the time a modern science fiction film to its predecessors from the late 50's and early 60's. Most of the spaceships look like they came from the covers of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction or Analog Science Fiction or Galaxy or any number of those pulps where these stories came from...And of course the writer of this story was Martin Amis the son of author Kingsley Amis who wrote several science fiction stories with slants like used in this film.So basically this was a B Movie that got some attention because of the then use of Kirk Douglas and Farah Fawcett it could have been a great film but as it is it is not horrible the science is believable the effects typical but not great the resolution not perfect but satisfying. The story could have been fleshed out a bit more but as it is the robot Hector I remembered that Robot when I saw Terminator I thought of Hector when I saw Aliens I thought of Hector there were a lot of possibilities for that character this was not just an Evil Robot but a robot that became evil because of the way it was taught  Much like people in that respect. And that cylinder that held Hectors Brain  was creepy any brain that is 4 times the size of a human brain well you just have to say Why is that a BAD IDEA?".

	schema:headline " Chaotic misunderstood scifi cult flick that deserves better treatment.";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1980 Saturn 3 was released. Since then it's been mocked laughed at even rippedoff by socalled Classic Some actually deserved it though.. Although it's rough on the edges and suffers from some editing problems effects and a low budget Saturn 3 is lightyears better than any of the scifi crap that's churned out today Not counting Revenge Of The Sith which was good. along with another underrated scifi cult hit Galaxy Of Terror. Unlike Galaxy Saturn 3 was directed by producer And best known for Singing In The Rain Stanley Donen who took over from original director And special effectsset designer specialist John Barry. His directing is fine but along with him are Kirk Douglas Who's often criticized for being too old to be stripped down in wearing nothing in some parts of the film but this was made before he ACTUALLY became a decrepit feeble old man no offense Kirk. Harvey Keitel Who was unfairly dubbed by a stereotypical British dude i'm not familiar with and Farrah Fawcet Who's the weakest link of this film.It opens with Keitel Dressed in a awesome space suit taking the job to take Hector The key robot of the film. to Saturn 3 a sanctionary of sorts to keep Earth plenished with food. Of course he kills the real men meant for the job and goes in the spaceship unnoticed. The opening is full of surreal trippy but awesome details and gives us viewers some view of possible space life in the future.

Alex says Benson is weird and Adam outright distrusts him. Alex has also never been to Earth. We then see Benson construct Hector a big robot with the tinniest head in the world.

Then it leads Adam to sacrifice his life to save Alex.Saturn 3 contains some great designs an interesting concept a welldone execution and some flaws. The flaws come from different places mainly the casting of Fawcet. Some say this was vehicle for her showing off her skin but due to the film's long history Dating back to the early 70s before Star Wars it ain't. She makes her character a tad annoying and seems to have not much to do except being fluff. She adds nothing only causing a distraction from the real stars of the film Keitel Douglas Hector and the set design. Douglas  Keitel Despite the awful decision to dub Keitel are excellent Hector is a creation of mystery to behold the sets are great and the score Although brief is cool and unforgettable. The effects work well except for some really awful ones Notably the one scene where Hector extends his arms after Adam tosses a crate at him the riding through the rocks scenes and ugh that one effect where Hector looks like a automated reject from Disneyworld's Epcot Center after getting pushed into the trap Adam and Alex made although he was smart enough to avoid it first.. Despite these flaws Saturn 3 is a great forgotten scifi flick that needs to be seen and treated better especially in the days of dreadful crap like You Got Served Hustle  Flow Waist Deep Stargate The Series The Matrix Revolutions and Cars Which I haven't seen nor I want to see it due to my fear that it will be inferior to the CGI Animated masterpiece The Incredibles. See it respect the effects Which are still better than CGI and don't laugh you'll understand me better.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1980 Saturn 3 was released. Since then it's been mocked laughed at even rippedoff by socalled Classic Some actually deserved it though.. Although it's rough on the edges and suffers from some editing problems effects and a low budget Saturn 3 is lightyears better than any of the scifi crap that's churned out today Not counting Revenge Of The Sith which was good. along with another underrated scifi cult hit Galaxy Of Terror. Unlike Galaxy Saturn 3 was directed by producer And best known for Singing In The Rain Stanley Donen who took over from original director And special effectsset designer specialist John Barry. His directing is fine but along with him are Kirk Douglas Who's often criticized for being too old to be stripped down in wearing nothing in some parts of the film but this was made before he ACTUALLY became a decrepit feeble old man no offense Kirk. Harvey Keitel Who was unfairly dubbed by a stereotypical British dude i'm not familiar with and Farrah Fawcet Who's the weakest link of this film.It opens with Keitel Dressed in a awesome space suit taking the job to take Hector The key robot of the film. to Saturn 3 a sanctionary of sorts to keep Earth plenished with food. Of course he kills the real men meant for the job and goes in the spaceship unnoticed. The opening is full of surreal trippy but awesome details and gives us viewers some view of possible space life in the future.

Their idyllic existence gets ripped asunder by the intrusive presence of the depraved and unhinged Captain Benson Harvey Keitel in fine menacing form and his equally dangerous robot helper Hector.Director Stanley Donen offers a chilling vision of a cold grim and hedonistic future relates the dark and compelling story at a steady pace and generates some real nervewracking tension in the harrowing last third. The intelligent script by Martin Amis addresses such pertinent issues as overpopulation depletion of precious resources invasion of privacy and the dehumanizing impact of advanced technology on mankind's soul in a thoughtful and provocative manner. Moreover this film makes a valid point that technology is only as good or bad as the purpose it's put to use for. The lavish set design and snazzy special effects are pretty impressive the towering Hector in particular comes across as genuinely imposing and frightening. The fact that Keitel's trademark New York accent was dubbed by Roy Dotrice with a more continental voice adds to the character of Benson's overall creepiness. Elmer Bernstein's spare pulsating score hits the moody spot. The glossy cinematography by Billy Williams provides a pleasing polished look. A neat and unjustly maligned movie.".

	schema:headline " Martin Amis Gives SciFi a Try";
	schema:reviewBody "All right  first off I'm going to recommend that you see this even if just to satisfy your own curiosity which I'm presuming on your behalf I suppose. My own curiosity stems from the fact that Martin Amis was the screenwriter here. For those who don't know Amis is the gold standard for modern literary fiction although more recently he has been offform c.f. the horrendous Yellow Dog. His narrative prose is too often described as Mandarin that is erudite rife with classical allusion and thoroughgoing familiarity with the major English writers and poets particularly and most importantly Milton whose Paradise Lost he basically cannibalizes for the plot and much of the language of his The Information and also P.G. Wodehouse whose prose style his is most akin to. Amis the son of novelist Kingsley Amis claims to have read nothing but comic books as a boy. There's nothing overtly Amisian about the dialogue itself  one or two stillborn jokes about Saturn being the place where they would insert the tube if the solar system needed an enema which sounds like the astrophysics stuff from The Info or London Fields where sodomy is talked about in terms of black holes and Nicola herself is a black hole of sex right?. There are erudite elements like classical references to the Roman god Saturn at least in the title itself and not really developed in the screenplay and naming of the robot Hector of the Demigod III series one of the characters constantly reminds us of Hector's bad treatment at the hands of Achilles to wit Hector's body was dragged around the walls of Troy by Achilles. The acting by Douglas and Fawcett is just unbelievably bad. No way to get around it. As I think back on it the screenplay may have been pretty good actually but their delivery was ruining it every time. Douglas's big hammy face and shoulders filling up the screen and stepping all over what may have been witty little bits here and there. He was badly badly miscast in this one  it should've been someone like Jack Lemmon or Kevin Spacey. Farrah Fawcett earning her paycheck as a set decoration basically was perfectly cast in light of the fact that this is basically an Adam and Eve In Space story. Amis's females c.f. Other People or Success tend to take Milton's Eve as their model. Now if the execution in terms of acting or staging whathaveyou didn't come off the overall structure of the thing was anagogically sound. There's no question that Amis's novelist's sense of architecture was at its high ebb at this part of his career the contemporaneous book would be Success Amis's most cleanly and cleverly plotted. As I said it's basically Adam and Eve in space and the ending as with our first parents is not a happy one. Harvey Keitel is the intruder on Douglas's and Fawcett's Eden. And what's interesting is that his character is a forebear of the Devil character in Amis's later novel The Information Scozzy. Keitel's character is like Scozzy a sort of cyborg a series of pixellated surfaces motivated only by desire for Fawcett. By the end of the movie his person merges with the robot Hector. The movie's coda was surprisingly strong actually almost unwarrantedly powerful given the crappiness of what had led up to it. Overall you'd have to give Amis credit for trying to bring depth to a pretty shallow genre references to Homer Virgil and Genesis in a 90 minute scifi horror flick and for knowing when to get out of the way for the visual aspect of the action.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine a more peculiar choice of director for this scifi thriller than Stanley Donen. Donen made some great films in the 50s and 60s Singin' In The Rain Seven Brides For Seven Brothers Charade but here he's in disappointing form. Partly that may be due to the fact that the project was originally to be directed by John Barry but Donen inherited the responsibility when Barry quit due to ill health. However Donen should not be made to shoulder all the blame. The script by Martin Amis leaves the actors to contend with some bad lines and situations. Elmer Bernstein contributes a forgettable music score which is well below his usual standard. And even the actors  all of them talented  seem indifferent to the project. Kirk Douglas for example seems to have accepted the role simply to enjoy some saucy nude scenes with sexy costar Farrah Fawcett.Essentially the story is a threehanded thriller or fourhanded if you count Hector the droid. Saturn 3 is Titan the third moon of Saturn hence the name and it is here that scientists Adam and Alex Douglas and Fawcett live in blissful isolation developing food supplies for people on Earth. Adam and Alex not only work together  they sleep and shower together too which is a pretty enviable arrangement for Adam who is about 30 years older than his sexy assistant. Into this perfect space oasis comes psychopathic Benson Harvey Keitel another scientist who has recently murdered a shuttle captain. Benson has brought with him a droid named Hector supposedly to speed up the workload. However Hector turns out to be a particularly unstable droid particularly when the randy robot develops a liking toward Alex. Eventually it becomes clear that neither Adam nor Benson can control the droid and with Hector determined to kill anyone who stands in the way of himself and Alex that becomes something of a problem.......If Saturn 3 is a story of jealousy and desire then it needs more than a sexstarved droid to generate credibility. If it is a scifi actioner then it needs more action. If it was conceived as a scifi thriller then it most assuredly needs more thrills. The film emerges as a rather muddled and unappealing mess with flashes of eroticism and very sporadic flashes of action. It marks a low point in Donen's directorial career and is too forgettable to be remembered as a significant scifi work. Most of the folks associated with this one probably don't give it pride of place on their CVs.".

I grew up as a rabid SciFi fan who salivated at the prospect of ANY movie set in space and back when Saturn 3 was made you took what you could get. I found redeeming qualities in nearly every SciFi flick that came down the pike so I was not what you'd call picky. Silent Running Outland Logan's Run you name it I managed to convince myself that it was good. But Saturn 3? What a turkey! It was pedestrian it was dull the story was hackneyed and pointless and it was annoying. And remember this was Farah Fawcett BEFORE she won acclaim in The Burning Bed. Oh and the special effects were not very special at all. The person who praised this movie and registered disdain at all the negative reviews should go back into the archives and look up what every single film critic said about the movie when it premiered. It was panned by everyone in the industry and for very good reason. It stunk. So please unless you have a clinical fascination with dreadful movies don't waste your time. And don't listen to delusional apologists for the film who first saw it when they were 12 years old.".

I grew up as a rabid SciFi fan who salivated at the prospect of ANY movie set in space and back when Saturn 3 was made you took what you could get. I found redeeming qualities in nearly every SciFi flick that came down the pike so I was not what you'd call picky. Silent Running Outland Logan's Run you name it I managed to convince myself that it was good. But Saturn 3? What a turkey! It was pedestrian it was dull the story was hackneyed and pointless and it was annoying. And remember this was Farah Fawcett BEFORE she won acclaim in The Burning Bed. Oh and the special effects were not very special at all. The person who praised this movie and registered disdain at all the negative reviews should go back into the archives and look up what every single film critic said about the movie when it premiered. It was panned by everyone in the industry and for very good reason. It stunk. So please unless you have a clinical fascination with dreadful movies don't waste your time. And don't listen to delusional apologists for the film who first saw it when they were 12 years old.";

One of those films that just fails in every aspect possible acting effects script sets.  And the coup de grace in my book the pointless killing of a dog.  And it's a shame because the dog was the only decent actor in the flick.  I truly believed that it WAS a dog.  Unlike scientist Farrah Fawcett or whatever the hell Keitel was supposed to be.  At first with his wooden portrayal and monotone I thought HE was the robot and maybe Douglas would be the madman. Also none of the actors seemed to be working together it was almost as if each person was shot separately reading their insipid lines and then with the magic of 1980s Parent Trap technology spliced together for the finished product.  I bet they never even met each other in person.  The high point was Fawcett's nude scenes but the movie wouldn't even let us have that without showing Kirk Douglas's old man butt.  They give with one hand and punch us in the jimmy with the other. The shoddy acting is enhanced that is to say made shoddier by a script so threadbare they let Fawcett wear it in one of the bedroom scenes shudder.  The words were just there to fill space between the actors who were talking to themselves.  This was by no stretch of the imagination a cerebral pick...it pretty much was madman and robot chase couple in space. In a time where you had films like the Black Hole or even 2001 you kinda wanted more from a scifi and Saturn 3 offered nothing but intense stomach cramps and volatile flatulence. We know it is the future and space due to the presence of brightly colored tubes framing all the sets.  What is it about tubes that imparts that feeling of future advancement to crappy set designers?  My guess cheapass to procure.  The remainder of the sets were just black soundstages with the occasional pipe and metal grid floor.  I mean when even the sets anger you you know it's gonna be a bad movie. And let's not forget effects.  The robot Hector...i mean come on..ABS?? Why would a robot need abs?  And the head is just one of those robot arms with two christmas lights for eyes...why sculpt the abs and then give it no head?  It's pretty obviously a dude in a suit with a robot arm on his head. And when I say madman and robot chase I think pursue is a better word as there's little fast movement where this robot is concerned.  Again costumes and spaceship models anger me in such a nonspecific way that I believe it's my hatred for this movie spreading like a cancer through all areas of production...worst gaffing i've ever seen and the catering was pretentious and tasteless...cough...All in all a very bad movie...good for whatever bad movies are good for.

Unfortunately it wasn't bad enough to be featured on SNL but definitely not good enough to be remembered. Somewhere in the remote future a Human inhabited spacecraft Saturn 3 is occupied by the stunning AlexFarrah Fawcett and her pre geriatric lover Major Adam Kirk Douglas. They are visited by an anal technocrat from Earth The Captain played by Harvey Kietel. He is proposing to construct a high tech robot for research and to serve as an assistant for his new home. Unfortunately things don't go as planned. The Captian is taken by Alex's ethereal beauty. He wishes to severe the tie she has with the aging Kirk Douglas to have her for his own. His method? To live vicariously through the robot Hector in order to overtake Adam's position as lover. Now I know the appeal of beautiful woman can be a plot driven device if used tastefully and if it doesn't dominate the overall theme. But this seems to be the only thing going on here beside the development and fine tuning of the poorly constructed robot. Now I thought the robot was pretty cool looking and reminded me of a more fragile version of The Terminator. But Hector albeit striking in appearance is poorly designed with all of its loosely fitted wires exposed valves and hollow frame. He could have used a more sturdy core to withstand blows. Modern SciFi movies take the attractive woman's beauty as incidental and give the poor gals a bit more brains substance authority and toughness. But Farrah was just being used for eye candy while she titillated us with her sexy pouts lilting voice gorgeous figure and dazzling eyes. Harvey Keitel is wasted in this role where he plays against type. Here he chooses to use an uptight voice and speech pattern which sounds more robotic than military. And Kirk Douglas? Okay I don't really have anything personal against the guy but watching him cast with a woman thirty years his junior is both disheartening and fairly grotesque. Much like his son he was the kind of actor I felt I had to put up with when watching a movie rather than ever truly enjoying or liking him. Saturn 3 is a snooze fest. But that's not to say that I completely hate it. It boasts some pretty cool production qualities and some admirably constructed set designs. This movie could have done better if they made a porno where Farrah gets accosted by some Technocrat or alien. It's that bad".

All it is now is an at times entertaining SF romp with a good cast and a couple of really nice gimmicks but those hoping for another cool genre milestone will be sorely disappointed. Saturn 3 stars Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett as a pretty much carefree space couple stationed in a control base on one of Saturn's Moons. Their jolly lifestyle is about to end abruptly when the grumpy Capt. Benson Harvey Keitel comes to build an allknowing Meccanorobot. In one of the most ludicrous plottwists ever the robot basically made from pipes and wires!! becomes obsessed with Fawcett's ravishing body. Not that we can blame anybody for wanting to jump Farah Fawcett she's ultrahot again! but this premise is a little too stupid to build a complete supposedly 'adult' science fiction screenplay 'round. Trained genre fans can play a game spotting all the other and more successful titles that heavily influenced the story. The list is rather impressive with Star Wars 2001  A Space Odyssey Alien Zardoz and Dark Star as the most obvious ones. Some of the dialogues Kirk Douglas has to produce are terribly cheesy and for some incomprehensible reason Harvey Keitel seems to talk with a dubbed voice.

I quite liked Saturn 3 it isn't brilliant but it wasted an hour and twenty minutes painlessly enough. The script by Martin Amis is not without it's problems for most of the film there are only three human characters in it. Saturn 3 could have done with a few more disposable cast members for Hector to kill. Benson's motives are almost totally ignored why kill Captain James  go to Saturn 3 anyway? About two thirds of the way through Hector kills him before he says anything to suggest why is is there some of Benson's other actions throughout the film were also a bit of a mystery to me. How could Benson pass himself off as Captain James so easily? I was also confused about Hector's motives what were his eventual plans for Saturn 3 Adam Alex  why? Some of the dialogue is a little silly as well. The taking of drugs is mentioned but not tackled in a serious way as is the pollution of Earth. The 'Trivia' section on the IMDb states that Saturn 3 only has music during the opening  closing credits well I can tell you now that I watched it mere hours ago  although the music is used sparingly in Saturn 3 it is scored throughout by Elmer Bernstein. I would also like to mention the sound effects at this point as they really got on my nerves every time something happened there was an annoying exaggerated electrical sound like when Hector walks or does something when a door opens or shuts or just operating a computer. The part of Saturn 3 which stands out is the production design  sets which are very impressive Saturn 3 obviously had a fair amount of money spent on it's overall look. The deranged robot Hector looks quite good even if it's head is rather stupid in appearance  it's obviously just a poor actor encased in a robotic suit. It's just a shame he didn't get to do more preferably killing people. Some of the spacecraft in Saturn 3 look extremely silly impractical  are obviously just plastic models. The special optical effects are OK they're not great but they are just about acceptable without becoming too distracting. The acting isn't that great Douglas looks a little bit old for the role the best thing I can say about Fawcett is that she's pretty to look at  Keitel complete with ponytail is dubbed throughout so his original performance is lost. There is a brief nude scene with Fawcett forget about any gore or violence as all we get a severed hand a dead dog  a novel use of a decapitated head. Saturn 3 is generally well made  has a reasonable polish to it nothing stands out as being particularly brilliant but at the same time nothing stands out as being particularly bad. Overall I found Saturn 3 to be an OK way to spend 85 odd minutes with a bit more thought in the script it could have been really good. As it is it's average at best watch it if there's nothing else to do.".

It's interesting and the whole point of the movie but the reason this is such a good movie is because of the character not the plot. The better scenes include Serpico's personal life and struggles. There's one great part where he explains to his girlfriend why he's always wanted to be a cop. It's scenes like those that make you sympathetic for him.Sidney Lumet and Pacino made a great team for this movie and proved to be a great team for Dog Day Afternoon a few years later. But as good as a director Lumet is as good as everyone involved with this movie is this is Pacino's movie. It's an essential viewing for his fans.My rating 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Serpico begins his career with the NYPD as an idealistic rookie who believes in the moral value of policing.  He has a simple and oldfashioned ethical code an outlook which used to be known as honesty. What he finds is a moral sewer five boroughs wide in which almost every cop is on the take.  The police are just another gang of hoodlums but with more guns than the bad guys.  Even basically decent cops go along with the kickback culture because a lockerroom psychology prevails in which values have become perverted.  Squad loyalty is now a criminal conspiracy of silence.  Detectives do not hesitate to shakedown hoods who are slow to pay.  To Frank Serpico this is simply wrong.  He wants no part of it.  And so his long agony begins.     Both responding to and helping to shape the mood of its time a weary cynicism towards authority Serpico arrived on the screen just as Watergate built to its climax.  Americans could no longer regard their institutions as gleaming examples to mankind of optimism and good government.  The film begins gloomily with Serpico badly wounded having been shot in the face.  We hear police and ambulance sirens fading symbolically representing the lifeforce ebbing from Frank and the withering of American dreams.     This firstclass film is a triumph and one that could easily have misfired.  Had the crooked cops been depicted as mere thugs then Serpico himself would have been an archetype just another twodimensional crusader. What gives the film its psychological richness is the realisation that the dishonest cops are NICE.  These are affable reasonable men who want to like Serpico and want to welcome him onto the team.  The camaraderie is seductive and it's difficult for Frank to hold out against it.  He is besieged by selfdoubt wondering if he is just a oneman awkward squad or worse  a prima donna sacrificing personal relationships on the altar of his own ego.     Again the easy but disastrous course would have been to give Frank some big heroic speeches allowing him to inveigh against corruption.  The film chooses instead to go for psychological truth and this is what makes the project outstanding.  Appalled afraid and despairing of ever changing anything Frank withdraws into himself.  He becomes the spectre at the feast the silent rebuke the muted but everpresent conscience of his colleagues.     Though Frank rejects the golden shield which is eventually offered we feel that the system still means something.  There are still some honest cops and even after all these vicissitudes the United States is still a nation of laws.  Lumet's profoundly liberal and optimistic view of America ultimately shines through but the final mood is one of quiet resignation rather than triumphalism.  Right can prevail over wrong but a price has to be paid.  Serpico wins his titanic struggle but he is diminished and saddened as a man.       The film contains some marvellous technical things.  In the opening minutes the action cuts between Frank as he is now wounded broken and alone and as he started out the cleancut idealistic rookie.  These transitions are seamless and the narrative logic is smooth and natural.  We see Frank's first moment of disenchantment in a cafeteria when it dawns on him that cops get free handouts of food but they have to take whatever comes.  This first bewilderment develops until we see the gulf open up between Frank and the dishonest cops the ones who take the money but also take the selfloathing.     The terrible stress to which Frank is subjected is depicted with skill. The police department has a huge institutional inclination to protect its own and this vast weight is brought to bear on Serpico.  Equally the pressure is relieved cleverly at appropriate points in the narrative. Frank's 'collar' of Rudi Casaro reaches an explosive climax as this all too human guy reaches breakingpoint.  On the other hand the romantic storytelling interlude with Laurie and Serpico's undercover cameo as an orthodox rabbi break the tension and vary the pace beautifully.     The secondunit work is of a uniformly high standard.  We are shown atmospheric New York streetscapes with grubby brownstones and the massive overbearing masonry of the Brooklyn Bridge in knowing homage to the films noirs of twenty years earlier.  The symbols are powerful.  This city and this police department are too colossal for one man to stand against them. Practice sessions in the police firing gallery intelligently reinforce the film's undercurrent of foreboding.  Paper targets obscure the gunmen's faces suggesting a monolithic force united against Frank then come hurtling towards him on pulleys signifying the fate which is rushing to meet him.     Mikis Zorba the Greek Theodorakis has provided a classy score.  I particularly liked the jazzy minorkey horn passage.     Pacino puts in another of the towering performances which have distinguished him as the profoundest acting talent of his era.  He is simply wonderful.  Barbara EdaYoung gives topnotch support as Laurie the genuinely loving partner who is destroyed by her man's seeming eagerness for martyrdom in rejection of domestic happiness.  If ever an actor exuded confidence it's Tony Roberts and he is ideally cast as Bob Blair Serpico's wellconnected ally.  Though he can open City Hall doors he can't actually help Frank at all.  Nobody can.  Christlike Frank understands that it is ordained  he must go to the hill alone.".

	onyx:emotionText "Frank Serpico begins his career with the NYPD as an idealistic rookie who believes in the moral value of policing.  He has a simple and oldfashioned ethical code an outlook which used to be known as honesty. What he finds is a moral sewer five boroughs wide in which almost every cop is on the take.  The police are just another gang of hoodlums but with more guns than the bad guys.  Even basically decent cops go along with the kickback culture because a lockerroom psychology prevails in which values have become perverted.  Squad loyalty is now a criminal conspiracy of silence.  Detectives do not hesitate to shakedown hoods who are slow to pay.  To Frank Serpico this is simply wrong.  He wants no part of it.  And so his long agony begins.     Both responding to and helping to shape the mood of its time a weary cynicism towards authority Serpico arrived on the screen just as Watergate built to its climax.  Americans could no longer regard their institutions as gleaming examples to mankind of optimism and good government.

In 'Serpico' he uses an excellent script to tell the story of an unorthodox character in Frank Serpico a hippie in a time when most cops were square as a doorway but whose honesty when faced with police corruption marks him out as a man of remarkable character. Unflinching in its depiction of Serpico the film portrays warts and all over the period in which he refuses to take money and shows his extraordinary political vindication at an official investigation into NYPD corruption. The story of civic corruption is cogent in any time one only has to look at great empires like Rome to understand how much corruption plays a part in the shaping of so called civilizations where the very foundation stones have bodies so to speak buried under them or even within them. This film is both informative and honest in much the way 'All the Presidents Men' would be in the following year. Winning Al Pacino a deserved Oscar nomination in the years between the Godfather's Part I and II it demonstrates the range of an actor who would go on to portray a character in Michael Corleone soon afterwards who is the very nemisis of the character in Serpico. In Serpico there is a dramadocumentary that calls to mind Shakespeares history plays in its depiction of a classical situation of a man ostracized and driven by noble sentiments to embody something of the civic value one expects of servants of the public trust. Brilliant film. 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd been wanting to see SERPICO for some time this reallife crime drama based on Peter Maas' nonfiction bestseller about an honest cop fighting corruption in the NYPD was one of the few grimandgritty New York crime dramas that my older brother didn't take me to see when I was a kid!  I should explain that my brother 9 years my senior used to take me to the kind of movies he wanted to see  films like TAXI DRIVER REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER etc. Fortunately I developed a taste for them as well though our mother didn't think they were really appropriate for a girl as young as I was then.  No wonder this film helped young Al Pacino's thenrising star he was fresh off THE GODFATHER when he began filming SERPICO to soar to the stratosphere complete with an Oscar nomination. Pacino's earnest intensity fuses Frank Serpico's disparate qualities into a spellbinding performance. The guy is a bundle of contradictions the kind of man who could charm you move you and drive you crazy at the same time a nice Catholic boy who can't commit to any of the devoted women in his life an honest downright rigid moralist who's also a free spirit known as Paco to his friends and lovers and an undercover cop with detective aspirations whose hippielike appearance rankled his superiors and fellow officers even as it helped him blend in on assignments. Pacino's riveting performance carries the film with fine support by John Randolph Tony Roberts M. Emmet Walsh Barbara edaYoung and Cornelia Sharpe not to mention memorable uncredited turns by F. Murray Abraham Judd Hirsch Kenneth McMillan and Tony LoBianco among others. Sidney Lumet's taut direction of the script by Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler does Maas' source material proud as well as taking advantage of evocative NYC locations just try getting this kind of atmosphere in Canada I dare you! . The sparing use of simple yet haunting music by Mikis Theodorakis sets the tone well. The end result one of the best films of the 1970s and beyond. Rent the DVD to see some fascinating extras about the making of the film and the filmmakers' experiences with Frank Serpico himself including interviews with Lumet and producer Martin Bregman no Pacino alas.".

	schema:headline " Realistic movie with a gripping and gritty story.";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie tells the true story of Frank 'Paco' Serpico who was about the only honest cop of the entire New York police department at his time. The movie provides a realistic view in the corrupt and tough world of the New York police and tells the story of Serpico in an intriguing and realistic perhaps maybe even documentary like way.Serpico is a movie with a typical fantastic '70's atmosphere and it's a movie that still holds up today. This is mainly thanks to the fantastic story of the movie and the way it is told. Yep they really don't make movies like this anymore. I think Serpico may already be regarded as a 'classic'.Actually the story itself or concept isn't that terribly original compared to many other movies from the same period. Still this movie distinct itself from most of those movies thanks to the perfect directing from Sidney Lumet. Also Pacino's acting and the fact that his movie is based on a true story makes this movie better than most others. Lumet and Pacino continued working together and later made the even better Dog Day Afternoon together.But fair is fair even though Pacino is fantastic this is far from his best role. The 'explosion' he later used for his characters in movies is still missing here and it seems like he's holding back. I also think that his Oscar nomination he deserved for this movie was also a bit too much credit for him. Pacino was just a young beginning actor at the time He had just done his first big role and movie The Godfather. and he obviously had still a lot of learning to do.The rest of the cast consists out of unknown actors with the exception of apparently Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham in one of his first small movie roles to be honest I didn't even noticed him. but for a movie like this a cast with unknown actors work really well. It keeps the focus on the movie's its intriguing story better. Apparently there is a lot of hate for it but I really liked the musical score by Mikis Theodorakis. It was really fitting with the movie its atmosphere. All in all this is a already 'classic' typical '70's cop flick in the style of for instance The French Connection and is an absolute must see.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Unquestionably one of the major films of the 70's dealing with a big theme police corruption and with some major talents at close to the top of their game throughout. Sydney Lumet spares us little in this gritty urban drama using almost flyonthewall documentary technique to involve the viewer in the action and stand us directly alongside Pacino as crusading streetwise cop Frank Serpico. Serpico's naive idealism is at first bruised by what at first seems casual freeloading by almost everyone of his new colleagues on the force but which turns to literally a battering as he comes to appreciate just how endemic the inside corruption actually is. Lumet plants us firmly on location in contemporary downtown NY with its rundown apartment blocks graffitistrewn streets and lowlife criminal element and that's just the police! As for Serpico we feel his frustration as he cracks under the pressure his relationship with his girlfriend poisoned as he fails to make the powersthatbe sit up and address what to all intents and purposes is standard behaviour. It takes a great acting performance to carry the viewer all the way through this lonely journey even when the character himself becomes at times obnoxious and unfeeling to his few supporters thankfully Pacino gives a performance the reallife Serpico deserved. Only very occasionally lapsing into the hooha overacting style that reached its nadir in Scent Of A Woman Pacino plays it cool and tight throughout always wary always looking over his shoulder playing it for real. If one is slightly sceptical if not critical of his sometimes ridiculouslooking Harry Hippy persona I think it can be forgiven as being of its time. The ensemble support acting is topdrawer too everyone is believable as indeed they need to be to make this film work but particular praise should go to Barbara EdaYoung as his putupon girlfriend and Tony Roberts free of Woody Allen for once as his main ally. It's not hard to see the prototypes here for the new generation cuttingegde TV shows which were soon to follow such as Kojak and particularly Hill Street Blues but that's the least of this film's achievements. In summary then this excellent film is proof that it's possible for Hollywood to address a potentially unpopular certainly uncomfortable serious subject make its point and still entertain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Serpico will always be one of the more compelling biographies ever made because its main character even in the face of an unfair and corrupt world clings to the virtue of honesty and comes out all right. Stories like that of Frank Serpico a NYC cop in the late '60s  early '70s who bravely testified against police corruption fascinate us because they make us wonder what we would do in that character's shoes and feel glad that at the end of the day we don't have to answer that question. Al Pacino stars as the man with these trivial choices Frank Serpico who was asked to be the snitch for the NYPD in the Bronx in terms of identifying officers taking bribes from criminals a role that subjected him to harassment and threats from his fellow officers and caused him extreme amounts of trauma affecting his job and his personal life.Well all come to believe that a police officer's first duty is to the people  to do the right thing. So does Serpico so as he has the startling revelation that there's almost no one clean in the police department we experience the same thing. Our perceptions change as dramatically as Pacino's acting. Initially Serpico comes off as this mousy dogood character a good fit for Pacino's 5'7 frame. When things get bad the dramatic styles of Pacino that we've come to know over the years really pour out. No one can yell as effectively on screen as Pacino but he also knows when to step back and command the screen without the use of dialogue. Teaming him with director Sidney Lumet who always knows how to pick out a script's most dramatic moment is essentially perfect. Serpico is sandwiched between both major Godfather films and it offers definite proof of Pacino's leading talents.The script written partially by Waldo Salt Midnight Cowboy is adequate enough to give us a taste of Serpico's moral dilemma. Most of the effective parts are the melodramatic scenes that allow Pacino to use those famous pipes. Everyone in the supporting cast is pretty much forgettable too  they're all actors prescribed to Hollywood's older school of supporting acting roles just speak with authority in your voice. It's fine since the film would rather us just identify the as the collective powers of corruption.Serpico is not Lumet's best work but it has its moments of great visual strength as all his films generally have. He's probably one of the best ever up there with Hitchcock in terms of picking his closeups. This is really Pacino's chance to shine anyway.What's respectable about the overall tone of the film is that it doesn't preach morals or make empty promises that the good will always be rewarded in the end and the bad punished  instead it says that hard honest work counts for something. Serpico takes a bullet to the face for all his grief and leaves the force and the country not long after. Not exactly a happy ending but a different way of inspiring us in the sense that at least the corruption didn't win.".

	schema:reviewBody "One can't know what the director Sidney Lumet was aiming for  a commercial success probably  but he achieved more than that. Frank Serpico wasn't a hippy. He disapproved of marijuana because it was illegal. And his face was pockmarked and he wasn't as handsome as Al Pacino. But he was in his way equally saintly.First of all what a picture of New York City in all its grime and without any splendor. You could walk a dozen blocks and never be out of a crime scene. There's the Williamsberg Bridge I think and not much else in the way of landmarks. Nobody eats at Lutece. The whole place is thoroughly louche.The acting with the exception of Tony Roberts is superior.And  maybe this hit me differently  it seems to be a movie about police corruption and of course it is but it's more than that.

He disapproved of marijuana because it was illegal. And his face was pockmarked and he wasn't as handsome as Al Pacino. But he was in his way equally saintly.First of all what a picture of New York City in all its grime and without any splendor. You could walk a dozen blocks and never be out of a crime scene. There's the Williamsberg Bridge I think and not much else in the way of landmarks. Nobody eats at Lutece. The whole place is thoroughly louche.The acting with the exception of Tony Roberts is superior.And  maybe this hit me differently  it seems to be a movie about police corruption and of course it is but it's more than that.

	schema:reviewBody "1973 was a very strong year for movies. I say it's the best year in movies produced in the modern Hollywood system up to 1973. It's not the best year of the decade 1976 is just fabulous for excellent movies but with the likes of American Graffiti The Sting and this movie Serpico it's hard not to get excited about the year of film in 1973. I'll say off the bat that Serpico is an excellent movie. I can hardly call that a surprise given the amount of talent behind the film. The story based off reallife events is very engaging and its brutally honest. Just like Mean Streets showed living in New York City was not exactly all that safe. While Mean Streets covered everyday life in a New York community this film covers the police and more specifically police corruption. The film shows that pretty much every cop in the NYPD were corrupt to some degree whether it's racketeering or paid murder but one man decided to show honesty and integrity.and nearly pays with his life. This is a very powerful theme and it shows why the movie can be labeled as inspiring. It's just one of the few things that make this movie a mustsee.This picture takes place in New York City in the late 1960'searly 1970's. Frank Serpico's Al Pacino profession is a NYPD officer and his motto is to become a good cop. The problem is that no one else wants to be a good cop. He refuses to extort money from the local criminals unlike his colleagues. Because of that he is alienated from everyone else on the workforce. He is constantly put in lifethreatening scenarios and nothing seems to get done when he goes to the highest authorities. He refuses to be like everyone despite all the danger in hopes that one day corruption will end.This movie relies upon some heavy acting by Al Pacino and he certainly rose to the task. This movie also proved that Pacino was capable of becoming a powerful leading man. He impressed everyone in The Godfather but Pacino proves he is no fluke with his incredibly powerful believable role as Frank Serpico. I really thought Pacino was Frank every time he appeared on screen. I love how Pacino can make himself disappear in roles so easily and that's why he is one of the greatest actor's of alltime. I also loved the physical transformation Pacino takes throughout the film. He gradually grows lots of hair and a beard and it's a very noticeable transformation. I thought that was really cool to point out.This film was directed by the great Sidney Lumet. He directed the 1957 classic 12 Angry Men and that movie kept him on the map. He once again brought his master direction techniques to this film. He was able to get the best out of Pacino and was able to give the film more of a personality. He definitely tackled the issue of police corruption very well. Police officers actually said what happened in this film was an accurate description of what really went on during the police force and that's still a very scary thought.I also liked the location authenticity of the movie. This movie was filmed in actual locations of the city and it felt like I was in 1973 New York. It's interesting to see how these movies featuring New York in the 70's proves how much the city changed with compared to 2016. That being said I always love being in New York past and present. The film was filmed in every neighborhood except for Staten Island.Overall I really really liked Serpico. I would rank this film as my favorite film of 1973. I cannot think of a complaint to give the film. It feature solid fluid direction by Sidney Lumet. The acting led by the legendary Al Pacino is perfect. I loved the story and the way the tricky issues were handled. It was shocking to see how bad police corruption got. So bad that they were willing to kill Frank Serpico just to keep his silence. That scene where there was a drug bust and his fellow detectives put him into the line of fire was very saddening and powerful to watch. I also liked the music which was composed by Mikis Theodorakis. This movie is a classic and I can easily recommend it to those who love good movies. If you want to know why Al Pacino is such a big movie star just check out Serpico.My Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Serpico is an easy film to appreciate given its attention to detail and gripping narrative. Films based around people's lives usually follow the same formula in that we see the protagonist grow and gradually change given the conflict they are forced to face. Serpico is no different but its understanding of its protagonist and excellent attempts to capture the subtle corruption of the New York police are what sets it apart. Serpico himself is the ideal main character for this film. His only crime is his refusal to take bribes and for that he is viewed by his colleagues as worse that the criminals they bring in. He puts his neck on the line in order to come forward and call out the corruption in the force when he could easily have sunk into the background.Frank Serpico is the type of role that Pacino was born to play. A man with strong moral values who is pushed to his very limits by the task at hand. By placing himself in harm's way for what he believes in he becomes an easy figure to route for and his plight is all the more gripping for that. Pacino always brought an intensity and believability to his early roles and here his fits of rage or expressions of disbelief feel genuine. This was during Pacino's superb run in the 1970's which included The Godfather Part 1  2 Scarecrow Dog Day Afternoon and And Justice For All where he was giving Oscar worthy performances every time and it's no different here as he really does inhabit the role. He is aptly backed by a fine supporting cast filled with actors who bring realism and weight to their characters.The film covers 12 years in Serpico's life and it transitions perfectly. There are no big effects or title cards we just see Serpico with more of a beard and looking slightly more dishevelled. It's a very effective approach and adds to the subtle realism that the film is aiming for. We also see his relationships fall apart which can often feel like pieces of forced melodrama in Biopics and simply added to broaden the film. Yet they are fantastically portrayed with his ever increasing anxiety and obsession with his job destroying any chance he had at building a family. There is an excellent scene at a party where he asks his girlfriend Cornelia Sharpe not to tell anyone he's a cop given people's reactions perhaps sowing the seeds that he needs to help change the police force.We are given a deep look a seedy and uncertain New York filled with criminals who can bribe their way free and cops who are a happy to turn a blind eye as long as they get a cut. Once Frank becomes known for speaking out on corruption the film masterfully crafts a sense of unease whenever he is beside his colleagues. Pacino's standout scene is when he arrests a criminal and his fellow cops are willing to let him go instead he flies into a fit of rage and almost assaults the crook in front of his equals. You can truly feel Frank's rage and protectiveness given the circumstance. The dialogue cracks throughout whether Frank is discussing his job with his girlfriend or trying to find a way to speak out without becoming a figurehead. The film also has an intelligent sense of humour with many of the exasperated lines drawing a laugh simply for the way in which they are delivered.Until its ending Serpico succeeds in creating a distinct sense of tension and unease. Every officer is untrustworthy every line spoken has to been keenly considered and every raid could mean death. The stakes in the film are high. We want Frank to succeed because we know he's a good man and all he wants is the ability to be an honest cop without fearing the repercussions. Sidney Lumet is an incredibly underrated director as it's his deliberately basic and wellpaced direction that acts as one of the films strongest points. He knows what the film needs and when. Above all this is a film about a person and it is Pacino who comes out on top he crafts a performance with such honesty and gravitas that it comfortably holds up in comparison with his other great work from the same period.".

	schema:headline " A Disappointment from Two Cinema Greats";
	schema:reviewBody "Any film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino should be great but Serpico is mediocre at best. Chronicling the truelife story of Frank Serpico a police officer who exposed corruption in the NYPD the film comes from that exquisite golden age of cinema lasting from the late '60s through the late '70s when paranoia infected the country and our most trusted and honored institutions were becoming suspect. It's got the grainy neorealistic feel that so many of the films from that time period had and as many of Lumet's own films had yet it never really works. Lumet's pacing is poor no scene lasts longer than a minute or two. While one would think this would make for a film with some narrative drive to it just the opposite happens. It's as if in the editing room all of the important parts of each scene got left out and what we've been given as a final product is an outline of Serpico's story. No characters beyond Pacino's is really developed and even he struggles to make something substantial out of his role. This came directly on the heels of The Godfather from the year before the film that put Pacino on the map. Serpico gives testament to Pacino's abilities and range as an actor his performance is quite different from that of Michael Corleone. But for me it's not until his mesmerizing performance in Dog Day Afternoon from 1975 that Pacino really flexes his acting muscles and shows what a true cinematic treasure he is. 26 years later Pacino was to star in The Insider another thriller where he played a character who helps to expose corruption this time in the world of corporate America. My advice is to see Serpico for the place it holds in Pacino's career but then see The Insider for a suspenseful terrific movie.Grade C".

In the 1950's he hit us with at least one classic 12 Angry Men before spending the next 5 years filming TV shows stage plays and the occasional theatre production.He then made three films in quick succession Stage Struck That Kind of Woman and The Fugitive Kind the last two with Sophia Loren and Marlon Brando.

Here he begins to reveal himself as a bit of a socially conscious artist. These films are all tragic morality plays focusing on homosexuality alcoholism the holocaust and nuclear annihilation respectively.Lumet then spent the next decade trying to branch out. The Hill was a gruff overtly masculine picture filled with a cast of strong sweaty men. The Group in contrast was about as feminine as you could get featuring a cast of lesbians girls and women. He then did The Deadly Affair a once influential but now dated spy thriller followed by Bye Bye Braverman an absurd comedy in the vein of Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud. With The Sea Gull he tried his hand at Chekov and with the surreal The Appointment he dabbled at Fellini.In the 1970s Lumet did some of his best work. The Anderson Tapes may be flawed but we can see Lumet playing with space and architecture here designing his heist story to show off his sets and clever camera work. He then follows this up with 2 great cop films The Offence with Sean Connery and Serpico with Al Pacino. The greater of the two is of course Serpico with its iconic lead performances and superbly claustrophobic aesthetic. It's another one of those man against the system pictures but Lumet's camera captures well the grit of lowrent New York and the paranoia of being an undercover officer. Pacino  bearded Christlike and with a procession of hilarious outfits  is even better.Lumet would then have hits with Network Dog Day Afternoon and Murder on the Oriet Express 3 films which show him trying to break away from his theatrical roots. He tried his hands at comedy and musicals along the way Just Tell Me What You Want and The Wiz but these films haven't aged well.Then came Prince of the City arguably his most ambitious picture. Vast in scope Lumet juggles this mammoth crime picture with confidence. Sadly not many people have seen this film.The rest of Lumet's career has been pretty hit and miss. The best of his later films are arguably The Verdict an excellent courtroom drama with Paul Newman and Running on Empty a sensitive underrated film starring River Phoenix and Judd Hirsch. 910  Masterpiece.".

And there is something comfortable about the familiar especially if it is done slightly different.Matthew Goode surprised me in his role and there the originality is quite refreshing. I hadn't realized exactly how limited of roles I am used to seeing the typical romcom male fit into until he kept breaking my expectations. And I like how real Amy Adams is no harsh looking clavicle bones sticking out minimal makeup and her face hasn't been pinched and pulled into a tight canvas.The Irish scenes are gorgeous and the accents entertaining. And I don't know if there was anyone else who was pleased but I was ecstatic at this proof of a great romantic comedy kept within a PG rating. No embarrassing scenes to make mixed company awkward no offensive profanity. It IS PG of course so don't expect Little Mermaid standards but it was still incredibly clean for the genre. I have little brothers aged 7 and 9 who I'm very protective of and I would not have felt embarrassed to allow them to watch this.Overall a great show for the genre. The best I've seen in a long time. Not perfect but if you're in it for entertainment and a feelgood story rather than as a movie critic I think you'll really enjoy it.".

She decides to travel in a supply vessel but she is forced to disembark in Dingle due to a storm. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn of the area and she hires the cynical and sarcastic owner Declan Matthew Goode to drive her to Dublin. Declan accepts to drive her since he needs money to quit his debts and along their journey they have many incidents. But they fall in love for each other but when they finally arrive in Dublin Jeremy proposes Anna. Leap Year is a delightful and innocent romantic comedy. The sweet and gorgeous Amy Adams shines in every scene and Matthew Goode shows a perfect chemistry with her. The plot is predictable but I laughed a lot with the funny situations along the journey of Anna to arrive in Dublin. I know that there are bitter viewers that do not enjoy this type of film that will never be nominated to any award. But I loved Leap Year with the lovely Amy Adams and the awesome landscapes of Ireland. My suggestion invite your wife fiance or girlfriend enjoy this adorable film and always kiss her like it was the first time and the last time. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Casa Comigo? Marry Me?".

She got on the airplane looking very polished at the end of the journey she had rolled with all the punches never lost her sense of humor and still looked lovely. Our Dekko was coolheaded kind patient and forgiving. He seemed to take her for who she is and find things to like about her. He rolled with the punches too. My favorite scene was when they were cooking. They cooked together. He wasn't telling her how to do things he wasn't expecting her to wait on him. They were a team. Pretty much that's how they got to Dublin. On the way they found out about each others values and deepest hurts. Both showed compassion for each other. It doesn't take four years to know that you love each other and are for each other maybe it just takes preparing dinner together as a team and throw in a road trip for a bonus!".

She lights up the screen in every scene whether in a drama such as Doubt or a lighter story as in Julie  Julia. Her character Anna is sweet and vulnerable but selfreliant when she has to be. The male actors support Ms Adams admirably and the pace never lags thanks to competent direction of Anand Tucker. The Irish countryside is spectacular. The story is a variation on an old theme but it is retold in movies because it is a good one. This is a fine date movie but enjoyable as well for those of us who fondly remember the sometimes funny sometimes painful quest for a mate.".

However rather than to surprise her boyfriend force unforeseen circumstances it comes in a small town in Ireland and here in a restaurant is introduced to Declan its opposite  cold and rough young men in the interpretation of the English actor Matthew Goody. So the adventure can begin ... Full of comical scenes original dialogue and great acting the film looks really full attention. As for the music theme give special charm to the story. Particularly interesting is the appearance of actor John Lithgow whom we know from a TVseries of Third rock from the sun. All events of course difficult to actually do happen but it is not important?

Weather forces her to be diverted first to Wales and then to the west coast of Ireland she has to be driven to Dublin by and disgruntled bitter local.But while the story is straightahead the movie is extremely charming due to the terrific chemistry in between Amy Adams and Matthew Good. Whereas other romantic comedies pander to the lowest common denominator with base humor this one feels much more like 4 Weddings and a Funeral or Local Hero. The characters seem simple at first but we see the depth beyond them as the movie goes on. The comedy is always sharp and special kudos to the actors who play the superstitious friends of Matthew Good but this movie never forces in the pratfalls and dumb jokes that we see in your typical romantic comedy movie. And when there a bigger laughs a scene at a wedding is particularly funny the movie delivers. There are a couple of slow spots especially at the very beginning but the last 20 minutes are funny touching and real. I think it is a very good movie for our times right now with a message that rebukes control and superficiality and all the trappings of what most of feel makes for a successful life. And our audience was with it throughout and applauded at the end.".

On the flip side the actors are great dramatic actors and the dialogue isn't over the top silly so the performances and moments between the two main characters bring it down to earth.Now keep in mind that the premise of this story is about a woman who dashes off to Ireland to propose marriage to her boyfriend Leap Day because according to Irish tradition a man who receives a marriage proposal on a leap day must accept it. Bright idea right? So therefore you've been warned before you even turn this movie on that it is time to suspend some disbelief and enter the world of light fun romance. I watch a fair number of romantic comedies and to me this is one of the better ones because it is funny but it has a lot of heart. Amy Adams is luminous as always and Matthew Goode is really hilarious when he needs to be and soulful when it calls for it. The big bonus to this movie is the atmosphere scenery and locations! It will make you want to travel to Ireland.".

Here however she can at best be described as a flower growing on a dungheap.There is no plotwhat plot there is is pure runofthemill tripe. The image it portrays of Ireland is actually kind of racist. Yes I'm Irish but an ardent nationalist I am not. But the characters in this movie are a mix between what Americans thought Irish people were 100 years ago save the antiBritish republicanism and what the stupider Irish heros were in bad Irish folklore a la Darby of Gill. A hairdryer a contraption so modern and so powerful that the Irish electrical grid cannot handle it manages to cause a blackout in the town of Dingle which seems to only consist of one pubhotel and four cottages. It takes the protagonists days to drive from Kerry to Dublin a feat which takes about 4 hours. 5 max. The men are superstitious fools obsessed with black cats and omens attached to different days of the week while others are thieves and brigands. Matthew Goode's accent is possibly the worst attempt at an Irish accent since Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly. Strike that. It's definitely worse. Oh also there is no public transport in Ireland so to speak.The little pickles that they get into along the way are idiotic. The dialogue is cringeworthy. And I love a good chickflick. As long as its good. Give me Notting Hill any day of the week.Amy Adams shame on you please don't let me down again. The only way this film could be described as being in any way good is if it was so bad it was good. But I think it gets there and then it becomes a case of its so bad its good for a minute but then it gets so bad that its just plain bad. Avoid unless planning to play some form a drinking game with it whereby a drink is taken every time some inaccurate stereotype associated with Irishness is propounded.Wait. Did I just propound an inaccurate stereotype associated with Irishness by suggesting you use the movie as the basis for a drinking game? Well maybe they're not that inaccurate........".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a guy who has grown up on action animation and romantic movies. So I love them even though they are predictable like hell. And Amy Adams is one of my favorite actress her smile is wonderful which would make this a pretty good watch for me. This movie though a romantic comedy is low on laugh out loud sequences and filled with moments which brings a small smile. Amy Adams brings about the necessary charm which her character needs while Matthew Goode brings his brooding good looks to the table. The movie is slow at times and those who like 27 Dresses type of movies probably will like this. And the English accent is hard to understand sometimes so the subtitles come in handy. The chemistry between the two lead actors is good but Matthew Goode doesn't give the feeling that he is too involved with the story.Anna Brady Amy Adama from Boston is a planner who stages apartments for Realtors. Anna has been dating cardiologist Jeremy Adam Scott for four years and they are buying a high standard apartment in Davenport together. Anna expects Jeremy to propose to her on a dinner date but he gives her a gift instead after which he travels to Dublin for his work. Anna thinks he is the one for her and decides to take matters into her own hands. Anna decides to meet him in Dublin on the February 29th and propose to him in accordance with an old Irish folklore tradition from the Fifth Century of leapyear proposals by women where the man has no other choice but to accept the woman's proposal. However her airplane is forced to land in Wales due to bad weather and she is not able to find a connection since the Dublin airport is closed. She decides to travel on a small boat but is forced to disembark in Dingle due to a storm. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn and hires the unfriendly owner Declan Matthew Goode to drive her to Dublin. Declan agrees to drive her as he needs the money to pay off his debts and save his inn. They go on an adventure together which will make a lasting impression on both of them.After Declan's car was jeopardized by Anna he had no reason to go along with her but the director makes him follow Anna wherever she goes. That was just stupid we know he doesn't have any feelings for her other than contempt. He could have taken the money for the car and just left which wouldn't make much of a story to begin with. See that is the problem with this movie it doesn't have a good enough story to move forward. The director tries too hard to move the plot forward and Amy Adams is a good actor but she is wasted here. She didn't have to do this movie as it won't propel her career forward. But we now know that Amy Adams is not afraid to get down and dirty she is very good in the movie. Declan's character is a guy who doesn't like women so he behaves like a jerk towards Anna. The problem is Matthew Goode is too laid back right till the end and isn't very likable unlike Amy Adams' Anna. As always in romantic movies the ending is too predictable and everyone can guess who Anna will be with in the end. The scenic locations excellent camerawork and background score make this quite a good watch.610".

Anna has been dating cardiologist Jeremy Adam Scott for four years and they are buying a high standard apartment in Davenport together. Anna expects Jeremy to propose to her on a dinner date but he gives her a gift instead after which he travels to Dublin for his work. Anna thinks he is the one for her and decides to take matters into her own hands. Anna decides to meet him in Dublin on the February 29th and propose to him in accordance with an old Irish folklore tradition from the Fifth Century of leapyear proposals by women where the man has no other choice but to accept the woman's proposal. However her airplane is forced to land in Wales due to bad weather and she is not able to find a connection since the Dublin airport is closed. She decides to travel on a small boat but is forced to disembark in Dingle due to a storm. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn and hires the unfriendly owner Declan Matthew Goode to drive her to Dublin. Declan agrees to drive her as he needs the money to pay off his debts and save his inn. They go on an adventure together which will make a lasting impression on both of them.After Declan's car was jeopardized by Anna he had no reason to go along with her but the director makes him follow Anna wherever she goes. That was just stupid we know he doesn't have any feelings for her other than contempt. He could have taken the money for the car and just left which wouldn't make much of a story to begin with. See that is the problem with this movie it doesn't have a good enough story to move forward. The director tries too hard to move the plot forward and Amy Adams is a good actor but she is wasted here. She didn't have to do this movie as it won't propel her career forward. But we now know that Amy Adams is not afraid to get down and dirty she is very good in the movie. Declan's character is a guy who doesn't like women so he behaves like a jerk towards Anna. The problem is Matthew Goode is too laid back right till the end and isn't very likable unlike Amy Adams' Anna. As always in romantic movies the ending is too predictable and everyone can guess who Anna will be with in the end. The scenic locations excellent camerawork and background score make this quite a good watch.610";

This is not a bmovie a cheesy remake or even a remake.  It is my understanding that this movie is loosely based on the Dickens' book but that it does follow the themes just not the exact story. This is a great movie it is a modern classic. The acting is excellent.  Ethan Hawk is amazing he really is a top notch actor. He's not just a young sexy leading man type who gets by on looks and a touch of acting as I had previously thought since he looks like the typical Matt Dillion or a Lowe type.   Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely stunning and plays her role perfectly.  De Niro has a nice powerful role and duh he's awesome in this movie.  Anne Bancroft was hauntingly superb in this movie you'll see what i mean.  Hank Azaria and Chris Cooper play great supporting roles.  I think this movie was probably Chris Cooper's breakthrough role and he was great.      The movie was breathtakingly shot.  The cinematography was better then even the recent crouching tiger hidden dragon.  The movie gives you a feeling of awe and mystery because of it's settings.   It's a work of art. The writing...based on a classic Dickens novel..come on it is superb. No cheesy lines yes there are heartfelt beautiful lines but none cheesy or overemotional or over the top dialogue.  The writing and actors clicked perfectly. Need I say the story was both interesting and intriguing based on Dickens' Great Expectations.  It may be loosely based or not but it was GREAT.      The directing pulled everything together and added some nice tricks to make this movie a Modern classic.  And the way music was used to intensify this movie and when and where it was used was absolutely brilliant and i suppose this is the director's job WELL DONE.      The music was almost as important as the acting in this movie.  The musical score for this movie is one of the best I have ever encountered.  It makes this movie move you.  And just as good are the music songs the movie uses how and when they are used.  This is one of the few movies that thrives on sound music to help create it's mood power and emotion and it is done masterfully.      This movie is a masterpiece.  Beautiful on the eyes ears heart and mind. I feel sorry for you if you don't ever get to experience this movie it is a MUST see.".

	schema:reviewBody "For beginning Alfonso Cuarn is one of my favourite directors and this work of him puts together a great cast of actors Gwyneth Paltrow Ethan Hawke Robert De Niro Chris Cooper and Anne Bancroft. British novelist Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations is the resource for this successful adaptation. I have read the novel and it's an autobiographical drama and humour. I also saw the 1946 silverscreen adaptation which was boring and indifferent than this novel and I think it was indifferent on its own as well. On the other hand Alfonso Cuarn's Great Expectations is a transformation of a dramacomedy work of art into a romance. Besides Alfonso Cuarn used his materials perfectly through matching the relations of these materials between each other 1 Ms.Dinsmoor and her oath of revenge against mankind that composes feminism 2 Estella and her enchanting beauty falling the trap of pride 3 Finn and his pure emotions falling the trap of loving an insensitive beauty 4 The mysterious benefactor of Finn who bears compunction of his past actions in his life and thus is laying down all of his possessions to Finn whom he knows as a goodhearted little kidThe screenplay is so powerful that solidifies the plot with new original features including surrealist drawings of Finn that turns the movie a real work of art. Estella is the inspiration of Finn of his love of his work of his success of his life ultimately of himself that he finds and pursues the love of his life all the time. In addition he stays loyal to Estella. There is the one great qualification of this movie that lovers always stay loyal to each other. Although Estella has dated with rich businessmen and even married with them she have always known that Finn was there waiting for her with complete determination and faith. They soon to come together to live happily ever after like all the wholeheartedly love endings or nonendings. Read my synopsis for this movie if you haven't got any chance yet to see it.".

This film symbolizes just that. Standing on its own this film was magnificent in its visual images and music and very many other areas. Do not be caught in that trap of comparing this film to the book. Dickens should never be compared to any screenwriter in the first place.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood and the movie industry have made many bold moves over the past decade in bringing to life old classics.  None however have been done more boldly than the remoulding of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Charles Dicken's Great Expectations.  Both are daring attempts to rebirth a storyline from the distant past as a tale told in our modern times.  I say attempt because in both cases as good a job the cast and crew did there was something lacking in these new renditions.  Great Expectations the movie lacks many qualities that make the novel a success.  It cannot be said to be a total loss the basic elements are intact it is only the embellishments Charles Dickens developed in the novel to make the story more realistic that are missing.One success I must admit that I observed while watching the film was the rich visual setting.  Although not taking presented in the same place or era Great Expectations the movie is a feast for the eyes.  It captivates the mind with beautiful shots of the rural Florida coast life and yet still retains the jumbled rundown atmosphere that is described of Pip's small birthplace in a small English town.  These qualities of squalor are evident in the impoverished coastal fishing village of the movie.  The best achievement in cinematography is the indepth views of Pardiso Perduto a sister mansion to the decaying Satis house of the novel.  Even the scenes of New York the city of expectations for our youthful protagonist Finn has contrasting aspects of rich beauty and unsightly slums that the London of the nineteen century demonstrated.  This is the most major achievement for the film to capture on film a most ingenious modern equivalent of Charles Dicken's astute descriptions.Unlike some attempts to revamp literary successes the movie at least retains some of the dignity of Dicken's work.  The core of his novel is intact within the screenplay.  Also many ingenious ideas were used in some plot changes and cinematography.  Overall it is not a bad representation of the novel.".

	schema:headline " My Great Expectations were Disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "Great Expectations is based around the odd conceit of taking the plot of Dickens's novel and updating it to late 20th century America. Apart from Joe and Estella all the names of the characters have been changed. Pip becomes Finn Bell Miss Havisham Miss Dinsmoor and Magwitch Arthur Lustig. Mrs Joe is Maggie Bentley Drummle Walter and Jaggers Ragno. The plot follows the same basic outlines as in the novel. Finn is an orphan cared for by his older sister and her boyfriend Joe a fisherman on Florida's Gulf Coast. As in the book Finn helps an escaped convict. As in the book he becomes friendly with Estella the adopted daughter of a wealthy reclusive lady. As in the book he receives a financial windfall from a lawyer acting on behalf of a mysterious benefactor who later turns out to be the convict. And as in the book he falls helplessly in love with Estella now a beautiful but icy young woman.The trouble with the film's central conceit which is why I described it as odd is that Great Expectations resists being translated into the modern age. Like most great nineteenthcentury novels it is firmly rooted in a particular time and place in this case London and SouthEast England in the early 19th century. Shakespeare's plays which do not have the same attachment to a specific time and place are generally easier to transfer to a modern setting. Even when it was written it was something of a period piece being set not during the 1860s when Dickens wrote it but rather during his own childhood in the 1810s and 1820s. Dickens is therefore describing social structures and institutions many of them essential to his plot which were forty years in the past even at the time of writing and which have no equivalents in modern society.When the filmmakers try and find such equivalents they end up doing violence to Dickens's plot. The most significant changes are those made to the characters of FinnPip and LustigMagwitch which is unfortunate as the PipMagwitch relationship is perhaps the most important in the novel. In the novel Pip's great ambition which he realises through Magwitch's generosity is to become a gentleman. This is a word with many shades of meaning but Pip uses it to mean little more than a rich layabout someone who has no need to work for a living and so can spend his life drinking gambling and hanging out with other young men of a similar outlook. Once Pip has realised this ambition he becomes an odious snob ashamed of his lowly origins of his adoptive father Joe who has always treated him with great kindness and even of his benefactor when he discovers who that person is. Finn on the other hand has a much more elevated and laudable ambition dreaming of becoming an artist and Lustig's benefaction enables him to set up in a New York studio.Magwitch an unsuccessful petty thief was a failure as a criminal who acquired his wealth honestly in Australia. Lustig however is not a reformed character but a gangster on the run whose sources of income are still dishonest ones. This has implications for the way in which we view the relationship between Lustig and Finn. Pip whose good fortune is based upon nothing more than a stroke of luck he helps Magwitch our of fear not out of compassion snobbishly looks down upon the man who has made that fortune possible by working hard and honestly. Finn however seems strangely unmoved by the fact that his good fortune is based upon sources of wealth tainted by criminality. This moral dilemma might have made for an interesting theme albeit one not found in Dickens but the filmmakers largely ignore it. Unfortunately they also ignore the moral concerns which were at the heart of Dickens's novel.No film based upon a literary text can ever be 100 faithful to its source especially one taken from Dickens whose novels were known for their complex plots and for casts of literally hundreds of characters. David Lean's great version of Great Expectations although considerably more faithful to the text than this one simplifies the plot considerably for example it omits the Orlick subplot altogether. The important point however is that Lean fully understood what Dickens was trying to achieve and remained faithful to the spirit of his work. There is no sign of such understanding or fidelity in Alfonso Cuaron's film.There were some good things about the film. It was attractively shot particularly the scenes set in Miss Dinsmoor's crumbling mansion Paradiso Perduto. As a number of reviewers have pointed out Cuaron seems to have a particular liking for the colour green. There were effective cameos from Robert de Niro as Lustig and Anne Bancroft as Miss Dinsmoor. The main parts however were less well played. Ethan Hawke played Finn as a sort of lovesick puppy I could never conceive of him as a talented artist. Gwyneth Paltrow was well able to convey Estella's haughty glacially beautiful exterior but there is no sense as there was with Valerie Hobson's performance in Lean's film that this is a mask she has been forced to put on by her adoptive mother and which hides an insecure vulnerable person inside.I have never seen any of Cuaron's Spanishlanguage films but I was very impressed by his Englishlanguage A Little Princess. That film also involved transposing a classic English novel to America although it kept the book's period setting. His Great Expectations was however not in the same class. It departs from Dickens's novel too radically to succeed as a cinematic version of a literary text. On the other hand it sticks too closely to his plot to succeed on any other level. My great expectations of it were disappointed. 410".

Finn is an orphan cared for by his older sister and her boyfriend Joe a fisherman on Florida's Gulf Coast. As in the book Finn helps an escaped convict. As in the book he becomes friendly with Estella the adopted daughter of a wealthy reclusive lady. As in the book he receives a financial windfall from a lawyer acting on behalf of a mysterious benefactor who later turns out to be the convict. And as in the book he falls helplessly in love with Estella now a beautiful but icy young woman.The trouble with the film's central conceit which is why I described it as odd is that Great Expectations resists being translated into the modern age. Like most great nineteenthcentury novels it is firmly rooted in a particular time and place in this case London and SouthEast England in the early 19th century. Shakespeare's plays which do not have the same attachment to a specific time and place are generally easier to transfer to a modern setting. Even when it was written it was something of a period piece being set not during the 1860s when Dickens wrote it but rather during his own childhood in the 1810s and 1820s. Dickens is therefore describing social structures and institutions many of them essential to his plot which were forty years in the past even at the time of writing and which have no equivalents in modern society.When the filmmakers try and find such equivalents they end up doing violence to Dickens's plot. The most significant changes are those made to the characters of FinnPip and LustigMagwitch which is unfortunate as the PipMagwitch relationship is perhaps the most important in the novel. In the novel Pip's great ambition which he realises through Magwitch's generosity is to become a gentleman. This is a word with many shades of meaning but Pip uses it to mean little more than a rich layabout someone who has no need to work for a living and so can spend his life drinking gambling and hanging out with other young men of a similar outlook. Once Pip has realised this ambition he becomes an odious snob ashamed of his lowly origins of his adoptive father Joe who has always treated him with great kindness and even of his benefactor when he discovers who that person is. Finn on the other hand has a much more elevated and laudable ambition dreaming of becoming an artist and Lustig's benefaction enables him to set up in a New York studio.Magwitch an unsuccessful petty thief was a failure as a criminal who acquired his wealth honestly in Australia. Lustig however is not a reformed character but a gangster on the run whose sources of income are still dishonest ones. This has implications for the way in which we view the relationship between Lustig and Finn. Pip whose good fortune is based upon nothing more than a stroke of luck he helps Magwitch our of fear not out of compassion snobbishly looks down upon the man who has made that fortune possible by working hard and honestly. Finn however seems strangely unmoved by the fact that his good fortune is based upon sources of wealth tainted by criminality. This moral dilemma might have made for an interesting theme albeit one not found in Dickens but the filmmakers largely ignore it. Unfortunately they also ignore the moral concerns which were at the heart of Dickens's novel.No film based upon a literary text can ever be 100 faithful to its source especially one taken from Dickens whose novels were known for their complex plots and for casts of literally hundreds of characters. David Lean's great version of Great Expectations although considerably more faithful to the text than this one simplifies the plot considerably for example it omits the Orlick subplot altogether. The important point however is that Lean fully understood what Dickens was trying to achieve and remained faithful to the spirit of his work. There is no sign of such understanding or fidelity in Alfonso Cuaron's film.There were some good things about the film. It was attractively shot particularly the scenes set in Miss Dinsmoor's crumbling mansion Paradiso Perduto. As a number of reviewers have pointed out Cuaron seems to have a particular liking for the colour green. There were effective cameos from Robert de Niro as Lustig and Anne Bancroft as Miss Dinsmoor. The main parts however were less well played. Ethan Hawke played Finn as a sort of lovesick puppy I could never conceive of him as a talented artist. Gwyneth Paltrow was well able to convey Estella's haughty glacially beautiful exterior but there is no sense as there was with Valerie Hobson's performance in Lean's film that this is a mask she has been forced to put on by her adoptive mother and which hides an insecure vulnerable person inside.I have never seen any of Cuaron's Spanishlanguage films but I was very impressed by his Englishlanguage A Little Princess. That film also involved transposing a classic English novel to America although it kept the book's period setting. His Great Expectations was however not in the same class. It departs from Dickens's novel too radically to succeed as a cinematic version of a literary text. On the other hand it sticks too closely to his plot to succeed on any other level. My great expectations of it were disappointed. 410";

	schema:reviewBody "Tenyearold Finn a poor but artistic boy in a small Florida fishing village does a kindness for an escaping convict who looks just like Robert DeNiro. Finn is then hired as well a kind of playmate for tenyearold Estella in the rotting old mansion of dotty old Mrs. Dinsmoor Anne Bancroft. The years go by and Estelle Gwyneth Paltrow comes on to the now masculine and fully glandular Finn Ethan Hawke then turns away and leaves him flat.Out of nowhere a lawyer shows up with a good deal of money for Finn to go to New York and establish his bona fides as an artist. In New York he encounters the nubile Estella again but after a strenuous turn in the sack she leaves him again for another man.The bitter Finn cuts a social swath through the New York art world and a financial one too. His first gallery showing sells out. I don't personally begrudge Finn his success although his sketches look like slightly offangled portraits that would be thoroughly at home in a New Yorker advertisement for a commercial brokerage firm. When he sketches the scrunchible Paltrow nude his socalled portrait is all scarlet nipples and black pudendum. Not that there's any real nudity alas. No I don't begrudge him. Not even though my own work was easily as good as his. It's true. Ask anybody. Ask my mother.Where was I? A little divagation there. Anyway Finn turns into a snob finds out who his benefactor is grows into a Mensch and goes home to that cozy dump in Floriday where his unpretentious and honest brotherinlaw Chris Cooper greets him warmly and invites him in for a croaker dinner. Guess who also returns to the little village chastened by her experiences in high society.The movie wants to be an erotic and atmospheric romance and to hell with Charles Dickens. The novel is no more than a peg to hang the story on. Goodbye any pretense of social comment. And farewell to typical British names. All Brits have names like Percy Vetch and Doris Buckle. Yanks have good strong forthright names like Hiram Y. Bomboost and Choo Choo La Fevre. Come to think of it British sandwiches are too thin. You can NOT get a decent pizza at four in the morning in John o' Groats. And they whisper over dinner instead of screaming and throwing the canolli at one another like civilized people. I have no idea why Miss Haversham of the novel became Ms. Dinsmoor in this movie or why her character has been changed from that of a bitter old maid to a colorful gay eccentric. The closest we get to Dickens is a scene in the New York gallery that is invaded by the loud hearty gauche Chris Cooper newly flown in from Florida to witness Finn's success. The scene is one of the best in the movie even if overdrawn  Chris Cooper as earthy life force versus the effete aesthetes. Another fine scene involves a visit Finn's benefactor makes in New York. Very nicely done by the actors and a good shot by the director  during a tense moment on the subway an empty booze bottle rolls across the floor towards the camera. That the same shot is repeated a moment later is evidence of excess.I should mention the photography production design and set dressing too. They're all magnificent. Miss Dinsmoor's mansion is one of those highceilinged monstrosities the interiors of which are festooned with Spanish moss and vines that look as old as the mansion itself. Even Finn's home which he describes as poor is colorful spacious and decorous. There are shots  about four in succession  of Finn and Estella walking across the bridges of Central Park on a fine autumn day just as pretty as picture postcards though not suggestive of any reality you or I are likely to experience.I couldn't get with the score. Dramatic moments in Florida  including a neat one of Estella silently inviting Finn to slip his hand up her thigh  are backed by loud electronic guitars and a singer going OOOO OOOO. Not authentic Smithkicker music but obviously something composed for the film. Dramatic moments in New York offer operatic singers and fulsome orchestration. Under the closing credits I was certain the theme had been lifted from Emanuelle. Gwyneth Paltrow illustrates her range as an actress. The snooty femme fatale is a little over her head. She was very impressive as the winsome uncertain victim in Seven. Two old pros  Robert DeNiro and the late Anne Bancroft  turn in the best performances. Happily they were able to overcome or slough off the corny dialog We are what we are. And It's as if the past had never been. And I saw the light in her eyes. I'll tell it to you not as it was but as I remember it. One scene towards the end is emblematic of the whole. Finn crowned with success is trying to find his brotherinlaw on the streets of the city. He runs through a drenching downpour erratically aiming nowhere. It's a scene that means to be full of impact but it means nothing. Just a guy running through a heavy rain. If somebody has to do it give me Gene Kelly. I don't mean that there's anything offensive about the movie. It doesn't carry enough weight to be offensive. Everything is so pretty.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tenyearold Finn a poor but artistic boy in a small Florida fishing village does a kindness for an escaping convict who looks just like Robert DeNiro. Finn is then hired as well a kind of playmate for tenyearold Estella in the rotting old mansion of dotty old Mrs. Dinsmoor Anne Bancroft. The years go by and Estelle Gwyneth Paltrow comes on to the now masculine and fully glandular Finn Ethan Hawke then turns away and leaves him flat.Out of nowhere a lawyer shows up with a good deal of money for Finn to go to New York and establish his bona fides as an artist. In New York he encounters the nubile Estella again but after a strenuous turn in the sack she leaves him again for another man.The bitter Finn cuts a social swath through the New York art world and a financial one too. His first gallery showing sells out. I don't personally begrudge Finn his success although his sketches look like slightly offangled portraits that would be thoroughly at home in a New Yorker advertisement for a commercial brokerage firm. When he sketches the scrunchible Paltrow nude his socalled portrait is all scarlet nipples and black pudendum. Not that there's any real nudity alas. No I don't begrudge him. Not even though my own work was easily as good as his. It's true. Ask anybody. Ask my mother.Where was I? A little divagation there. Anyway Finn turns into a snob finds out who his benefactor is grows into a Mensch and goes home to that cozy dump in Floriday where his unpretentious and honest brotherinlaw Chris Cooper greets him warmly and invites him in for a croaker dinner. Guess who also returns to the little village chastened by her experiences in high society.The movie wants to be an erotic and atmospheric romance and to hell with Charles Dickens. The novel is no more than a peg to hang the story on. Goodbye any pretense of social comment. And farewell to typical British names. All Brits have names like Percy Vetch and Doris Buckle. Yanks have good strong forthright names like Hiram Y. Bomboost and Choo Choo La Fevre. Come to think of it British sandwiches are too thin. You can NOT get a decent pizza at four in the morning in John o' Groats. And they whisper over dinner instead of screaming and throwing the canolli at one another like civilized people. I have no idea why Miss Haversham of the novel became Ms. Dinsmoor in this movie or why her character has been changed from that of a bitter old maid to a colorful gay eccentric. The closest we get to Dickens is a scene in the New York gallery that is invaded by the loud hearty gauche Chris Cooper newly flown in from Florida to witness Finn's success. The scene is one of the best in the movie even if overdrawn  Chris Cooper as earthy life force versus the effete aesthetes. Another fine scene involves a visit Finn's benefactor makes in New York. Very nicely done by the actors and a good shot by the director  during a tense moment on the subway an empty booze bottle rolls across the floor towards the camera. That the same shot is repeated a moment later is evidence of excess.I should mention the photography production design and set dressing too. They're all magnificent. Miss Dinsmoor's mansion is one of those highceilinged monstrosities the interiors of which are festooned with Spanish moss and vines that look as old as the mansion itself. Even Finn's home which he describes as poor is colorful spacious and decorous. There are shots  about four in succession  of Finn and Estella walking across the bridges of Central Park on a fine autumn day just as pretty as picture postcards though not suggestive of any reality you or I are likely to experience.I couldn't get with the score. Dramatic moments in Florida  including a neat one of Estella silently inviting Finn to slip his hand up her thigh  are backed by loud electronic guitars and a singer going OOOO OOOO. Not authentic Smithkicker music but obviously something composed for the film. Dramatic moments in New York offer operatic singers and fulsome orchestration.

	schema:reviewBody "La Buena Estrella is possibly one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. It tells the tale of Rafael Antonio Resines a lonely butcher whose life changes when he saves Marina Maribel Verdu from a brutal attack and falls in love with her. Rafael learns that Marina is a prostitute and is pregnant to her pimp Daniel Jordi Molla who was the guy attacking her. Rafael marries Marina and with their daughter attempt to live life as a normal loving family. Tragically however their dreams are shattered when Daniel comes out of prison and comes in search of help.....I went into this film not really knowing a thing about it other than that it had been notorious for press screenings during which even the normally hardhearted film critics had been seen coming out crying. I thought I would be immune to this. I was wrong. I was fine for about the first 3 minutes of the film spent the rest of the film with a lump in my throat and the occasional runaway tear and then sobbed uncontrollably for the last 1015 minutes. At this point I turned round to see if any of the 100150 in the hall were staring at me only to see that they were as bad. When I left the cinema I asked the usher if audiences always reacted like that. Every time came the reply. I went on to see it 7 times at the cinema.I can't really explain why it is so sad without giving anything away but the film is superb. Antonio Resines a renowned comic actor in Spain gives a marvellously subtle performance as a profoundly decent human being who just wants to make everyone happy and suffers the consequences Maribel Verdu succeeds in making you care for her character even though what she does would probably make her the villain in any other film whereas Jordi Molla who lost out on the Goya Spain's Oscar to Resines gives possibly the most complex performance I have ever seen. The way he veers from terrifying you making you love him and breaking your heart is breathtaking. Also the music of Eva Gancedo very reminiscent of that from Cinema Paradiso is fragile and poignant complementing the film perfectly. The film is marvellously directed by Ricardo Franco who went on to win the Goya that year but tragically died shortly after. If you have a heart and you want its strings to be tugged it is IMPERATIVE that you see this film.".

When Daniel is hitting Marina there appears a goodhearted butcher called Rafael Antonio Resines  who rescues her from the violent druggie . Later on  both of whom stay together as a couple and marry themselves  but a baby not Rafael's for he lost his testicles in an accident is born . Rafael looks forward to raising the child as his own if Marina will consent . Then there again appears Daniel and the couple accepts to care her old friend with unpredictable consequences . Events go wrong when Daniel reappears back from his dangerous life  now as a beggar and unfortunate man . As Marina protects him  in spite of Rafael's objections  and they take Daniel into their luxurious house . Marina wants to heal Daniel through force of will . This interesting as well as intimate story is a passionate retelling and a touching melodrama  including strong sex scenes and usual nudism by the beautiful Maribel Verdu . Ricardo Franco also writes the sad script along with Pedro Costa and ngeles Gonzlez Sinde and taken from some facts based on actual events happened in city of Madrid . Being filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship  without leaving a trace the thoughtprovoking issues  in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . This picture bears remarkable to Intruso 1993 by Vicente Aranda starred by Imanol Arias  Victoria Abril  Antonio Valero in similar roles  holding a similar plot and also produced by Pedro Costa and Enrique Cerezo . The main problem has to face La Buena Estrella or Lucky Star beyond not being able to avoid falling into a claustrophobic drama is precisely derived from the coldness of its staging which eventually become monotonous and heartbreaking over ninety minutes and some of footage . Good acting by trio protagonist such as Jordi Molla as Daniel  a man now broke and ill who has physical problems of his own  splendid Antonio Resines the bitter  resentful as well as deceived husband and Maribel Verdu who wants to be in love with both  she overcome with sentimentality and takes Daniel under her protection . They are supported by a magnificent secondary cast such as Elvira Mnguez  Clara Sanchis and Ramn Barea as a good priest . Spotless pictorial though dark cinematography by Tote Trenas  being mostly shot at interior . Tote Trenas is deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameraman with a long and prestigious artistic career . Furthermore  a willingness  almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence every space . Sensitive and rousing musical score by Eva Gancedo  including an enjoyable leitmotif . The picture won several Goya Awards 1998  the followings  Goya Best Director Ricardo Franco  Best Actor Antonio Resines  Best Screenplay Original Ricardo Franco ngeles Gonzlez Sinde  Best Original Score Eva Gancedo and Best Film . Furthermore  won Jos Mara Forqu Awards for best film  Mar del Plata Film Festival  Best actor and director  Ondas Awards  San Diego International Film Festival Awards  Spanish Actors Union  Turia Awards  among others The motion picture was rightly produced by two great producers Pedro Costa and Enrique Cerezo  being professionally directed in his particular style by Ricardo Franco . This is a Spanish director writer and lyricist  he was a member of Madrid's independent Cinema making films about the underprivileged . Ricardo directed a series of awardwinning movies firmly establishing him as one of the best Spanish filmmakers  in spite of his early death  as he died on May 20 1998 in Madrid at 48 years old . He was a director and writer  an expert on literary adaptations and especially known for dramas as Lgrimas Negras 1998  Berln Blues 1988  Desastre Annual  El Sueo De Tanger who also starred Maribel Verdu and this La Buena Estrella 1997  though he also made some comedy as Gringo Mojado and Oh Cielos .

The dances are wellchoreographed and the lighting is bright lending to the cheerful air and reflecting the lightness and joy of Viennese dance music.Utilising Maximilian the Second of Bavaria as a major character was a wise choice as by all accounts he was in relative terms one of the more benign German leaders and a person of real culture in stark contrast to the leaders of the Third Reich.An idealised world of benign authority figures fairytale weddings a kind aristocracy and wondrous balls as presented here may well have been what the German populace needed in a divided country a mere ten years after experiencing the horrors of the military dictatorship and the War but today the film is so lacking in substance so forgettable and so stiffly acted and so unadventurous it only really serves to show how the Nazis had ruined the film industry and how so afraid of daring and innovation the Germans had become. Thankfully as they rebuilt their country and reinvented themselves as a modern pacifist democratic society the magic would soon return to German cinema but in the interim weak material like this would stand as a reflection of the loss of German selfconfidence.".

Even when they are no actors at all as Mikhail Gorbachyov who appears in a scene. Many things make this movie special. In it five languages are being spoken. Nevertheless it doesn't really matter. The protagonists can understand what is being said as though language difference  is not that relevant for humans to understand each other. The pictures are the usual great Wim Wenders pictures. Black and white pictures indicate the coolness of the world of angels while colors indicate how colorful the world could be for humans if they can see it!. It is an analysis of the relationship of man with the world around. Humans think that they are controlling the world but the world is controlling their lives in fact. It shows how blind we can be in contemplating the beauty of the world around us. In this matter one could mention the movie called The awakenings 1990 although the two movies are in most aspects different. It is a movie about an angel who wants to become human in order to be able to understand humans and how he gets into a complicated life. It helps a lot to see The wings of desire where the story between angels and humans started. Some things are hard to understand when you don't know the first movie. This movie is also an analysis of time. Emit Flesti read backward Time itself is a very interesting character that can communicate with both angels and humans and who speaks about almost always about time and its meaning. For me he was also a mix of Lucifer and the death angel as well. The background of the whole story is Berlin after the fall of the wall whereas The wings of desire took place before the end of the cold war.This movie makes a genius use of fantasy to analyze our lives. Its main message is  We the angels are not the message. We are the messengers and the message is love.".

Here Wim Wenders has made something different than in Wings of Desire what I consider a comedy of a misfit exangel to counter the desire of an angel to become human in the other film.Near the end of the other movie we saw one of the angels Damiel become human for the love of a beautiful trapeze artist.  In this film we see the other angel Cassiel become human by accident as he wanted to help people.  As much as he wanted to fit in with our world the more he tried to do good the worse trouble actually made of things.  He often quotes the Lou Reed song he heard Why can't I be good make something of this life?There is a cameo appearance of a world leader when Mikhail Gorbachev filmed the summer after resigning as Soviet president ponders the ageold question about the meaning and purpose of life or two leaders if counting that the guard dog's name is Khadafy.  There are jokes about getting lost between East and West since the Wall no longer was there as a landmark.  But there is the serious side at the beginning of the war and the Nazi past which is a little hard to follow.  I almost forgot about it as I got caught up in the humor of the fallen angel but even that had the darker side of an evil angel who was leading him astray.  Yet the ending tied everything together nicely.65279Like Wings of Desire there are nice transitions between black and white which is how the angels see the world and color for how humans see things.  There is also a poem started at the beginning about humans being everything to the angels when Cassiel looks down from the statue to you whom we love.  The angels are just the messengers who bring light to those in darkness.  The poem is repeated at the ending adding that the message is love.The angels lament that humans can only believe what they can see and touch. The Wall fell the tangible symbol of the division between East and West yet still one driver whose thoughts we heard couldn't see what the difference was between the two areas freedom can't be seen or touched. Love the angels message can be neither seen nor touched yet that and not blood and steel as said the Russian poet and diplomat that Gorbachev quotes is what is needed for there to be peace.".

Some moments are wonderful especially Cassiel's elegiac bedtimestory biography spoken to an old man who is losing his memory and who knows that Cassiel has been along for the ride. The acting is also terrific except oddly for Willem Dafoe's bizarre inexplicable character  the movie grinds to a halt literally at one point whenever he appears.I have to admit that the last twenty minutes made no sense to me. Spoilers follow. Wasn't Cassiel's entire mission to stop the mobster from seeing his sister and niece and if so why? Bad influence? And how exactly did that acrobatic stunt save the day? The badguys just gave up after that apparently for undisclosed reasons  maybe they felt bad. Also after a presumed eternity of watching humanity and reading our minds Cassiel's plot is to use a poorlyconcocted stunt? He should've spent some more time watching heist movies.Anyway all that aside this movie is still worth seeing it's just not in the same class as Wings of Desire.

	schema:reviewBody "Faraway So Close! is a very confusing movie if one has either not seen its predecessor Wings of Desire or knows something about that movie. I was in that state when I first viewed Faraway So Close! and could only think that I was watching an artsy movie.  Fortunately the movie is now available on DVD in a widescreen anamorphic version with the director's commentary of Wim Wenders.  The movie began in black and white and seemed to morph every now and then into color that had me wondering whether or not I had a defective DVD.  Eventually I figured out as the movie was running that this was intentional with the black and white sequences depicting the angels observing humans. In the meantime I managed to miss much of the subtlties of the movie that were only revealed from the lips of Wim Wenders in his running audio commentary. With a backdrop of Berlin the movie was filmed in German.  Fortunately there are English subtitles and it is sometimes odd when the dialog actually breaks into English.  As Wenders points out this was his third movie with Nastassja Kinski that began with her very first movie in 1975 The Wrong Movement and was followed by the 1984 Paris Texas.  Spaced approximately 10 years apart and with Faraway So Close in 1993 Wenders mentioned that it is now time to do a fourth picture with Nastassja.  One can only hope that it materializes.The basic story has to do with the protagonist as Cassiel the actor Otto Sander taking human form from his previous angelic state in which he can only observe and sympathize.  An event propels his wishful transformation into the human dilemma.  Wim Wenders said that this film was a continuation of Wings of Desire and not a sequel.  It is probably splitting hairs because I do not readily understand the difference if any.  Nastassja Kinski has the major supporting role of Raphaela and is always shown  in black and white.  Raphaela becomes Cassiel's always present angel.  It is a very difficult role to pull off because Nastassja only has her voice in German her facial expressions her hands and her body movements to bring her character to life.   Her on screen presence appears natural and effortless.  It is nothing less than a superb performance of a first rate actress. But it is up to Otto Sander to carry the movie.  The supporting cast is first rate.My third viewing of the film was an experience.  146 minutes passes relatively quickly.  The film is dripping with intensity and is larger than life.  Wim Wenders' vision and its execution is astonishing and will reverberate through time because it captures the essence of life and death. It is a movie director's awesome tour de force.".

	schema:reviewBody "Both this and 'Until the End of the World' have a slightly maligned reputation mainly because they are not 'Paris Texas' or 'Wings of Desire'. 'Until...' is brilliant though the Six hour 'Trilogy' version  is said to make more sense...'Faraway' didn't appear in many cinemas here its existence on a par with Cassiel and Rapheala in relation to the humans...This film seems to have been overlooked which is strange considering the transcedental beauty within and the sublime U2 song...'Wings of Desire' is almost a scared text in the film world I could not put it out of my mind when I watched this film and so had a low esteem of 'Faraway so Close!'. A few years later and I've definitely overwatched 'Wings of Desire'. And also that film ends with 'To Be Continued...''Faraway...' is possibly more sublime than 'Wings...' Nastassia Kinski daughter of a German icon and twat Klaus Kinski is perfect as Raphaella. Even greater than her role in 'Paris Texas'. The cameos are good the return of Peter Falk Mikhail Gorbachev thinking about love in poetry rather than the blood  steel of revolution and Lou Reed who appears three times reinterpreting his song 'Berlin' for after the wall playing 'Why Can't I Be Good?' in a concert scene not as great as the one Nick Cave did in 'Wings of Desire' and giving CassielKarl some money when he has fallen to earth as a human. Willem Defoe is as dependeable and beaugly as ever his name 'time itself'. Bruno Ganz and Solveig Dommartin reprise their roles as Dammiel and Marion and now have a daughter who along with Hanna's daughter represent the recurrent child theme prevalent in 'Paris Texas' 'Alice in the Cities' 'The Lisbon Story' 'Until the End of the World'. Some of the shots of Berlin and particularly Raphaella have a quality close to a Cocteau Twins record or a Rilke poem we are falling fast?. Parts of the film remind me of Kryztof Kieslowski the black economy after the end of communism and themes of new capitalism are present in 'Three Colours Red' and the theme of World War II and the past recalls one of the 'Dekalog's. Cassiel sees a newspaper floating in the river stating the death of Willy Brandt who was West German chancellor from 19691976 the peak period of New German Cinema. This has as much resonance as Fassbinder's use of the photos of postwar chancellors at the end of 'The Marriage of Maria Braun'. Proof that Wenders thinks of the past and isn't completely postGerman...The film does feel European the steam boat surely a reference to Jean Vigo's 'L'atalante'? Though the fusion of nationalties is as ever international to the point of solely human the myriad of languages English German French compound this. The music is particularly fine not that I've been able to locate a soundtrack album unlike the great soundtrack's for 'The Million Dollar Hotel'  'Until the End of the World'! If Cassiel as an angel represented EastGermany and as a human represents the new unified Germany Wenders portrays the perversion of freedom by a consumerist lifestyle and a perverted capitalism prevalent in exploitative practices justified by the 'free market'. The reduction of meaning and significance to money is seen in the gangsters or the taxi driver who no sense of the past when Peter Falk wants to visit a part of East Berlin very droll  very 'Columbo'. The film ends with the Barry AdamsonNick Cave song 'Cassiel's Song' which is as great as their later collaboration 'The Sweetest Embrace' and they were both present on 'From Her to Eternity' used in 'Wings of Desire'. The characters are still on a journey the constant road of Wenders' films locating the home that you can never go home to again to paraphrase Thomas Wolfe. Would be nice if we got a third film focusing on Raphaella but that would only be an excuse to roll around the floor in ecstasy at the sight of the divine Ms Kinski!!...'Faraway So Close!' is one of Wenders's great films of the 1990's along with 'The Beuna Vista Social Club' 'The Lisbon Story' and 'Until the End of the World' I was a bit nonplussed by 'The End of Violence'  'The Million Dollar Hotel' though I might change my mind next time I see them! 'Beyond the Clouds' is mostly not very good though I'm not sure how much Wenders is present after reading 'My Time with Antonioni' the nudity was very 'dirty old man' which is great if you're making softporn in the Paul Verhoeven mode and not so great if you made 'L'aventura' and 'Blow Up'. Forget 'Wings of Desire' and watch this film on its own merits then again I thought 'City of Angels' was almost interesting as Hollywood adaptations go so what do I know?".

Bruno Ganz and Solveig Dommartin reprise their roles as Dammiel and Marion and now have a daughter who along with Hanna's daughter represent the recurrent child theme prevalent in 'Paris Texas' 'Alice in the Cities' 'The Lisbon Story' 'Until the End of the World'. Some of the shots of Berlin and particularly Raphaella have a quality close to a Cocteau Twins record or a Rilke poem we are falling fast?. Parts of the film remind me of Kryztof Kieslowski the black economy after the end of communism and themes of new capitalism are present in 'Three Colours Red' and the theme of World War II and the past recalls one of the 'Dekalog's. Cassiel sees a newspaper floating in the river stating the death of Willy Brandt who was West German chancellor from 19691976 the peak period of New German Cinema. This has as much resonance as Fassbinder's use of the photos of postwar chancellors at the end of 'The Marriage of Maria Braun'. Proof that Wenders thinks of the past and isn't completely postGerman...The film does feel European the steam boat surely a reference to Jean Vigo's 'L'atalante'? Though the fusion of nationalties is as ever international to the point of solely human the myriad of languages English German French compound this. The music is particularly fine not that I've been able to locate a soundtrack album unlike the great soundtrack's for 'The Million Dollar Hotel'  'Until the End of the World'! If Cassiel as an angel represented EastGermany and as a human represents the new unified Germany Wenders portrays the perversion of freedom by a consumerist lifestyle and a perverted capitalism prevalent in exploitative practices justified by the 'free market'. The reduction of meaning and significance to money is seen in the gangsters or the taxi driver who no sense of the past when Peter Falk wants to visit a part of East Berlin very droll  very 'Columbo'. The film ends with the Barry AdamsonNick Cave song 'Cassiel's Song' which is as great as their later collaboration 'The Sweetest Embrace' and they were both present on 'From Her to Eternity' used in 'Wings of Desire'. The characters are still on a journey the constant road of Wenders' films locating the home that you can never go home to again to paraphrase Thomas Wolfe. Would be nice if we got a third film focusing on Raphaella but that would only be an excuse to roll around the floor in ecstasy at the sight of the divine Ms Kinski!!...'Faraway So Close!' is one of Wenders's great films of the 1990's along with 'The Beuna Vista Social Club' 'The Lisbon Story' and 'Until the End of the World' I was a bit nonplussed by 'The End of Violence'  'The Million Dollar Hotel' though I might change my mind next time I see them! 'Beyond the Clouds' is mostly not very good though I'm not sure how much Wenders is present after reading 'My Time with Antonioni' the nudity was very 'dirty old man' which is great if you're making softporn in the Paul Verhoeven mode and not so great if you made 'L'aventura' and 'Blow Up'. Forget 'Wings of Desire' and watch this film on its own merits then again I thought 'City of Angels' was almost interesting as Hollywood adaptations go so what do I know?";

Sadly everybody from this quartet has a significantly smaller role except the recently deceased Sander who plays the lead character this time but is my least favorite of them. Instead they added rising star Nastassja Kinski daughter to Klaus Willem Dafoe who plays a mysterious character as usual that you cannot summarize with either good or bad Mikhail Gorbachev in small cameo and German acting legend Heinz Rhmann already over 90 in his final role.There are some similarities compared to the film. A big part of it is in black and white again and it changes to color after Sander's character becomes human. Sadly the strength of the first film the whole poetic approach to life and atmosphere was sacrificed here a bit for stories on homelessness alcoholism and a major crimerelated plot. At least Peter Falk brought some comedic delight again when he pretends to check a location for an upcoming Columbo movie. For me a major reason why I rated this film lower than its prequel is because I also prefer Ganz a lot over Sander. Apart from that the ending was slightly confusing and I felt they could have cut out at least 1520 minutes and not hurt the film. The German Film Festival Cannes Palme d'Or and Golden Globe Awards probably disagree as they gave this movie some recognition.All in all I would say this is still a fairly good movie on its own even if it hardly never reached the greatness from the first. Fans of Wenders' Alice in den Stdten could also give this a go.".

Ordinary? Yes but safe as the red brick built poky flat they dwell in. We are not asked to take sides here to chastise or judge Thompson and his superb cast merely ask us to delve into their world to understand it the psychological humdrum of 50s Britain the starkness of marriage does mean growing old together but that nobody ever said it was going to be easy.Looking at it now it can be viewed as a very important film in the trajectory of British cinema Mitchell's character is the fulcrum making the film a must see as regards the evolution of how women have been represented in Brit cinema through the years.

As a previous commenter noted it's the first of the kitchen sink drama's which became so fashionable in the 1960's and it's the best.The story is unremarkable clerk Anthony Quayle is having an affair with his firm's secretary Sylvia Sims. His wife Yvonne Mitchell devoted but suffering from a clinical depression which leads her to be alternatively hysterical and morose knows nothing believing her husband to be equally devoted so when Quayle breaks the news that he plans to divorce her she goes to pieces. This unpromising situation is electrified by several elements Yvonne Mitchell's searing performance a spare script and some very claustrophobic settings. Mitchell owns this film her character is so helpless so selfeffacing that Quayleand Sims offer her the best kind of support  they let her do her own thing. Long sequences find Mitchell alone  at the cooker at the kitchen table at the window  and each of these scenes is a masterpiece of momentum worthy of any noir. But isn't kitchen sink drama the most casual noir and therefore the most terrifying? Really one would have to see Mitchell in action  her habitual burning of family breakfasts her abortive trip uptown to dolly up and win back her man most of all her only companion  a faded dressing gown which acts as comfort blanket to the woman. She is stunning and deservedly won many plaudits for her performance.Credit must also go to Anthony Quayle who underplays his natural strengths as an actor. His perplexity at finding himself an object of desire is played out beautifully and logically to the conclusion. Sylvia Sims also impresses as the other woman a slip of a thing whose scenes are fragile but safe because we know she is in no danger from herself.The script is taken from a television play by Ted Willis which was broadcast in the early days of ITV. I have no idea whether it still exists probably not given British television's habit of treating archives as ephemera  there is nothing ephemeral about Woman In A Dressing Gown. It is blindingly and viscerally memorable. Neither do I have any idea who currently owns the rights to this film but I must say they ought to be ashamed of themselves  it needs to be restored and issued on DVD before it's completely forgotten.All in all a lovely and unsung classic for connoisseurs of everything vital.".

Woman in a Dressing Gown has been described by film historian Jeffrey Richards as a Brief Encounter of the council flats taking the scenario of a extramarital affair and relocating to a less middleclass setting. However writer Ted Willis described it more simply as a film about  good honest fumbling people caught up in tiny tragedies. As its femalefocused title suggests the film spends a lot of time on Amy the wife whose devastated when her husband asks for a divorce. She gives it the works as the drudge who fights to rekindle the affection of her husband. There's a great bit when her new hairdo gets ruined by the rain but it's heavy weather throughout. Amy is anything but the model '50s housewife she burns food never finishes the housework always has the radio on too loud and rarely has time to get dressed properly. But the film allows us to see reasons why she might have become that way grieflonelinessboredom rather than simply demonising her. Do not watch this film if your at a low and feeling depressed as it will definitely not help. Yvonne Mitchells bravura performance won her the Berlin Film Festival's Silver Bear award for best actress".

	schema:reviewBody "Behind this unassuming title is a simple premise. It is the story of a man who having become weary of his domestic life after twenty years of marriage is tempted to walk out and begin a new relationship with his beautiful young secretary whom he has fallen in love with.Such a scenario is a familiar one now having been played out in many a television soap opera but back in the 1950s when this film was made extramarital affairs and divorce carried much more of a stigma than is the case nowadays and so one might think that this production carries little impact. That is far from the case however as this film relies not on sensational plot twists but instead concentrates on the effects that the situation has on the main protagonists. And in doing that it succeeds superbly in conveying the raw emotions of each character.Anthony Quayle is the man torn between his status as a family man and the promise of an exciting and passionate new life with a beautiful woman who loves him. Quayle could play tough villains well but here he is exemplary playing the weak man an individual swept along by circumstances rather than by having the drive to make him master of his own destiny. The two different lives he must choose between are personified by the different names each woman calls him to his longstanding wife he is 'Jimbo' to his secretary he is 'Preston' his surname. Yet Jim is never presented as a sly scheming womaniser only as a good man without the inner strength to be something better.Sylvia Syms who would become one of Quayle's costars in Ice Cold In Alex the following year is 'the other woman' the secretary Georgie. The character's background is largely unexplored but we learn enough of her to know that her love for Jim is sincere and that she is not vindictive or manipulative.But stealing the show is Yvonne Mitchell in a superlative performance as eponymous Amy Jim's wife. Even after twenty years of marriage Amy is loving and devoted but she is hapless disorganised and a little overbearing. Her blind devotion means that she hasn't noticed her husband growing bored with their life except perhaps on a subconscious level for when the bombshell is dropped she immediately guesses the reason behind it. The reactions of Amy are varied not always expected but wholly convincing and touching. Much of the credit for that must also go to Ted Willis who wrote the screenplay crafting rich dialogue that skillfully avoids all the hackneyed old cliches that this subject matter often serves up.J Lee Thompson's direction is considered. He generally keeps the piece tight and close up to maximise the conveyance of feeling the shots are well composed and occasionally imaginative and scenes are lit most effectively.So does Jim leave Amy or end up staying with her? I won't spoil the outcome here although the real joy is the getting there and in following a conflict where all three participants are good hearted and evoke sympathy. To pull that off so well is no mean feat.".

It unyieldingly shows the gruesome truth of this business. Yes it draws tears as many flowed down my own face during these few hours of watching. But I must say that the truth and the tears stirred up within me a desire for change. A desire for justice. Is that not what true film is meant to be about? To bring forth revelation of self discovery desires dreams. To cause the viewer to step away from the film a changed person. This is exactly what Trade did for me. I read multiple reviews about the movie Trade last night after viewing the film for myself. I discovered comments like hard to find it entertaining and playing up the terrorizing of the women detracted from the film. Trade is not a film to entertain. The emotion evoked from this film was designed to have a purpose. The purpose was the change the viewer's perspective out of our cookie cutter American world view into the grisly truth of sex trafficking that occurs around the world as well as on our doorstep.The viewer is invited by this disturbing film to not to be satisfied with ignorance but to light the fire within them to want to make a difference.".

	schema:headline " Powerful message with entertainment value and it works";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended a screening of Trade at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. All week films had been relatively disappointing. And then this powerful work came along.It probably is sufficient to say that its subject is child trafficking in this case from Mexico to the US. Audiences will recognize Kevin Kline. The other leads are a 13 yearold girl Paulina Gaitan and her 17 yearold brother Cesar Ramos. The film rests largely on the shoulders of these two innocents and it's on the basis of their performances even more than the subject matter that I consider this a mustsee film.Check out this pedigree. Trade was written by Jose Rivera who wrote The Motorcycle Diaries. It is based on a New York Times Magazine article. It was originally supposed to be directed by Roland Emmerich who wrote directed and produced The Day After Tomorrow. But Emmerich had a conflict so he ended up producing it along with Rosilyn Heller who produced American Heart a favorite of mine starring Jeff Bridges and Edward Furlong. In turn Marco Kreutzpaintner was hired to direct a German filmmaker who had a connection to Emmerich through another producer. It was a fortuitous set of circumstances. It's a 12 million indie backed by German funds Emmerich's own pockets and Lions Gate who will be distributing it.This is quite a moving film and although it's easy to argue the case it does not exploit the kids itself in its effort to expose the horrors of child exploitation. While it has some Hollywood moments thrown in for commercial appeal it's still as compelling as any film I've seen recently. The acting is frighteningly real. A good part of the film is a bit of a road movie where Kline and the boy bond  he needs a male role model Kline's life on the road is a lonely existence you know the drill. Kline's relationship with the boy reminded me of his pairing with Hayden Christensen in Life as a House. He's good at it and it's a casting coup that helps put the icing on the cake. The other part of the film focuses on the harsh reality of child trafficking and follows several victims through their ordeals. But Kreutzpaintner's narrative never loses sight of its heartbreaking subject matter.Director Kreutzpaintner and producer Heller were there for a QA. I asked about the casting. He said the boy and girl were found during auditions in Mexico City. He was just the second one they saw. They kept looking but eventually came back to him. He had never acted before. The girl had done a bit before but not much. What an auspicious debut. These are two to watch.There are many oh my God moments. It ultimately is a message film in that it exposes the horrors of child trafficking but it's also made for commercial appeal and should resonate with the larger audience. It's hard to pull off this kind of film and make it work. How does one entertain without hitting the viewer with a sledgehammer? It's a delicate balance and this one weighs in perfectly.".

A good part of the film is a bit of a road movie where Kline and the boy bond  he needs a male role model Kline's life on the road is a lonely existence you know the drill. Kline's relationship with the boy reminded me of his pairing with Hayden Christensen in Life as a House. He's good at it and it's a casting coup that helps put the icing on the cake. The other part of the film focuses on the harsh reality of child trafficking and follows several victims through their ordeals. But Kreutzpaintner's narrative never loses sight of its heartbreaking subject matter.Director Kreutzpaintner and producer Heller were there for a QA. I asked about the casting. He said the boy and girl were found during auditions in Mexico City. He was just the second one they saw. They kept looking but eventually came back to him. He had never acted before. The girl had done a bit before but not much. What an auspicious debut. These are two to watch.There are many oh my God moments. It ultimately is a message film in that it exposes the horrors of child trafficking but it's also made for commercial appeal and should resonate with the larger audience. It's hard to pull off this kind of film and make it work. How does one entertain without hitting the viewer with a sledgehammer? It's a delicate balance and this one weighs in perfectly.";

Together they use what resources Ray has to save Adriana from inevitable slavery and hopefully put an end to whatever system was being run out of the United States.This is not a movie for young children or even older ones at that. Rape and child molestation is rampant. If you are queasy from watching that kind of human waste then consider yourself normal and you may not want to watch this. I felt the need to watch it it truly opened my eyes in a way that earlier releases on Juarez Mexico and other Mexican border towns just didn't.

Her brother Jorge Cesar Ramos ridden with guilt since it was his birthday present that got her into trouble decides to rescue his sister which entails travelling all the way to New Jersey via stolen cars illegal border crossing and finally hitching up with Ray Sheridan Kevin Kline a Texas police officer searching for his outofmarriage daughter.Adriana meanwhile undergoes the process of objectification becoming a commodity for sale to the highest bidder. During her ordeals she befriends a young Polish mother Veronika Alicja Bachleda who was conned into coming to Mexico after which she was kidnapped raped and prepped for prostitution.A tough subject matter which requires finesse to sufficiently sell the problem to the watching public. Only several films have essentially succeeded into presenting the problem with the most brilliant movie being the heartwrenching Lilya 4ever by Lucas Moodyson. A totally different take on the movie was presented in the crisp and innovative action flick Taken. Trade tries to meet the two above movies somewhere midway earnestly portraying a inyourface reality of sex trafficking whilst giving it a element of the chase but with much action albeit with a hefty chunk of roadbuddy movie to go with it. Nonetheless Marco Krezupaintner decides on a by the numbers approach where he basically presents how sex trade functions in an almost documentary style fashion which probably would have worked better for the movie. In between this he has hits and misses whilst trying to portray the main characters and their ordeals. All Mexicans especially Gaitan do a terrific job in keeping the movie honest although all the wisecracking Ramos did whilst trying to save his baby sister from forced sex labour seemed extremely out of place. On the other hand Kevin Kline came out extremely bland and uninspiring ergo he basically functioned as a script tool to somehow get the character of Jorge to New Jersey. Also Veronika played by Hollywood hopeful Alicja Bachleda showed an acting range from downright awful to acceptable  surprisingly the more destroyed she was as a women the better she acted. The least said about the Russian actor the better...Apart from some great opening credits overhead scenes of Mexico City finished off with a plane flying over the slums area the movie mostly features lowkey cinematography probably an attempt to keep the movie as grounded as possible. Hence the camera ventures with the action and its heroes hardly trying to hide the monstrosities going on in front of it. Subtleties are not to be expected in this movie. The plot however goes in a relatively obvious direction and although it does get its act together somewhere midway the initial kidnappings and rapes seemed way to clichd to be believable.On an end note I whole have liked to have seen better closure for the movie. Irrespective of the multiple happy endings the final scene where Jorge issues some well deserved revenged was poorly done while the loose end of the fate of Veronika's child is a let down andor missed opportunity.".

	schema:headline " Review Trade";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a possibility that filmmaker made a research for this film through reading various articles in the newspaper. Trade is uninspired melodrama that seems too afraid to be what it really meant to be. Sex trade industry is an interesting and controversial subject to discuss about but what we've here is only halfbaked incredibly shallow unfinished project.Three different stories have interwoven into one film. But the plot begins in Mexico City. Adriana Paulina Gaitan is 13yearsold girl who lived in the ghetto with her mother and her brother Jorge Cesar Ramos. One day she was kidnapped while she rode a bicycle. In the meantime Veronika Alicja BachledaCurus is a polish girl who searching for an opportunity in America. But she was tricked by travel agency and landing in Mexico instead of America. Not soon after landed she's also kidnapped by the same group of people. Adriana and Veronika are two of a bunch young girls and boys who have to across the border led by Manuelo Marco Prez in order to be sold in America.After his younger sister is missing Jorge decided to chase a truck that seemed to carry them across the border. Once they reach a city border he finds Ray Sheridan Kevin Kline a policeman who came to Mexico with a personal mission. Jorge decided to hide in Ray's car trunk. Once Ray found out about it they're already across the border. Jorge explained his reason to Ray and somehow Ray seemed to believe him. So they head to New Jersey where the bidding of Jorge's sister will take place and by that they have to do any mean necessary to stop it.At social commentary pointofview Trade is right on target. It's right thing to explore and condemn the world of sex trade industry. But at the story pointofview it's complete failure. There's not a single one of three stories that will left you stunned. The main story about two young siblings is pretty weak and bythenumber melodrama. The major problem is an actor who plays Jorge his inexperienced acting method sometime cause unintentional funny scenes.

But somehow it really didn't matter at all because the filmmaker decided to ignore his story altogether and by that makes our journey with this character seemed unnecessary.The fate of this film fell upon the first paragraph. Trade appears to be a great article in the newspaper. But as a film Trade is depressingly joyless drama. It's like every angle of this film suck the life out of the story a little by a little.

	onyx:emotionText "There's a possibility that filmmaker made a research for this film through reading various articles in the newspaper. Trade is uninspired melodrama that seems too afraid to be what it really meant to be. Sex trade industry is an interesting and controversial subject to discuss about but what we've here is only halfbaked incredibly shallow unfinished project.Three different stories have interwoven into one film. But the plot begins in Mexico City. Adriana Paulina Gaitan is 13yearsold girl who lived in the ghetto with her mother and her brother Jorge Cesar Ramos. One day she was kidnapped while she rode a bicycle. In the meantime Veronika Alicja BachledaCurus is a polish girl who searching for an opportunity in America. But she was tricked by travel agency and landing in Mexico instead of America. Not soon after landed she's also kidnapped by the same group of people. Adriana and Veronika are two of a bunch young girls and boys who have to across the border led by Manuelo Marco Prez in order to be sold in America.After his younger sister is missing Jorge decided to chase a truck that seemed to carry them across the border. Once they reach a city border he finds Ray Sheridan Kevin Kline a policeman who came to Mexico with a personal mission. Jorge decided to hide in Ray's car trunk. Once Ray found out about it they're already across the border. Jorge explained his reason to Ray and somehow Ray seemed to believe him. So they head to New Jersey where the bidding of Jorge's sister will take place and by that they have to do any mean necessary to stop it.At social commentary pointofview Trade is right on target. It's right thing to explore and condemn the world of sex trade industry. But at the story pointofview it's complete failure. There's not a single one of three stories that will left you stunned. The main story about two young siblings is pretty weak and bythenumber melodrama. The major problem is an actor who plays Jorge his inexperienced acting method sometime cause unintentional funny scenes. Ray's story also rather disappointing once we've found out the reason he travels all the way to Mexico it's not strong enough to make us care for his issue. And we can see that the filmmaker tried his best to link the sibling's situation to Ray's personal issue. But in the end the execution is pretty awkward and feels forced.

	schema:reviewBody "In the slums of Mexico City the small time teenager thief Jorge Cesar Ramos gives a bike to his beloved sister Adriana Paulina Gaitan on her thirteenth anniversary under the protest of their mother. While riding early in the morning Adriana is kidnapped by members of an international network of sex traffickers. Meanwhile the gorgeous Polish single mother Veronika Alicia Bachleda arrives in Mexico City with a friend lured with the promise of a work in USA in a model agency by the same criminal gang. While transported to New Jersey the two girls become friends and Veronika protects Adriana as much as she can. Meanwhile Jorge desperately seeks his sister in the red light zone of Mexico. He witnesses children and the women being loaded as cargo in a truck and he tracks them trying to save his sister. When he arrives in Juarez he sees the Texan investigator Ray Sheridan Kevin Kline who is chasing a missing daughter in the house where his sister was lodged. He hides himself in the trunk of Ray's car and once in USA Ray finds him and is convinced to help the boy in his quest.Human trafficking is a sad reality of the contemporary days and together with drugs and weapons they form the three greatest illegal worldwide trades. The societies need to give more attention to this profitable slavery of the TwentiethFirst Century and consequent use of the victims in sexual tourism and other types of sexual exploitation creating laws investigating and punishing these sick and mean criminals. The way the children and the girls are treated like cattle used and abused by perverts and sent from one man to another is disgusting. The children and girls are abducted through different means but in common they become victims of a powerful international network of sex traffickers. Trade is the fourth great movie that I have watched about this sad reality. Lilja 4ever and Anjos do Sol are extremely pessimist and realistic but focused in the life of only one character. Human Trafficking gives a big picture how these gangs operate following the drama of three lead characters. Trade is less crude and more Holywoodian but it is still a very good film. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Desaparecidos Missing".

In the City's chaos he loses sight of the truck transporting his sister stops for a drink looks out the window of the store and there it is again. Jorge later hops in the trunk of a car which by chance is the car of a cop also looking for a missing child so he has a ride and an expert in his chase.

The film obviously exposes the tragedy of sex trafficking in helpless minors and some scenes like the one where the sister is rented to a pervert in a field are compelling but the plot did not have to rely so heavily on coincidence and contrivance.".

The last two in recent memory that I've watch are Your Name is Justine and Lilya4ever both which put the spotlight specifically on the characters created highlighting the abuse they receive and exposing some of the tricks that the conmen exploit in order to target and thereafter control their prey. Given that the viewpoint of the entire unfortunate ordeal from the perspective of the victims have been portrayed and is easy and turning the same wheel if done again Trade takes on a more macroscopic look while still maintaining a finger in a more personalized tale in order to ramp up the human drama and emotions.While the other two movies mentioned take place primarily in Europe Trade highlights a more international network involved in the supply chain where increasing amounts of money get exchanged for women and children to feed the demand by perverts and paedophiles. While having its premise for the demand set in USA it goes to show that the unfortunate victims come from all over the world and suggests the use of Mexico as the proxy to get into the USA illegally no doubt with the help of corrupted authorities. From then on it's an established hushhush protocol of transfers and transactions that take place in the most unseeming of places and naturally technology comes to play in anonymous bidding on the internet.Primarily this story is a race against time following a young Mexican boy Jorge Cesar Raoms in his chase to rescue his sister Adriana Paulina Gaitan as she gets abducted randomly off the streets  being a young child she is set to obtain record prices should she be auctioned off to be deflowered. While Adriana gets to enter USA through already established methods by the syndicate Jorge has to rely on his street smarts and unwittingly gets hooked up with US cop Ray Sheridan played by Kevin Kline who assists in Jorge's quest under moral circumstances rather than deporting Jorge straightaway for being a stray.Like a buddy cop movie Trade also looks at the unlikely partnership between street delinquent and tough nose cop with the heart of gold as they try and penetrate the system while leaving room for some clash of cultures and slightly comedic instances. The unfortunate circumstance of the victims are again getting a shiner in order to be subdued and of course the weapon of choice rape. And the movie results in you silently cursing the worst for those involved in the trade and never sympathizing an iota with them when they receive their dues.Technical wise someone should tell the filmmakers that password fields are always asterisk never in clear text even the dumbest website programmer won't make that mistake. One of my other peeves here was the decision not to mount the camera on a tripod. While it's not the extreme kind of shaky cam like Cloverfield's it did bring on some queasiness given the very minor movements all of the time. I don't see the need for this and wondered if it's because it might look cool and edgy with the fast cuts and all that the tripod was junked wrongly.Based on a New York Times Magazine article published on 25 Jan 2004 written by Peter Landesman Trade offers to strike a balance between painting a picture of sympathy for the victims and disgust for the perpetrators. Unlike the other movies which has come before Trade managed to spin a somewhat refreshing look at the worldwide sex slavery problem.".

You should watch out for Kreuzpainter's new film Krabat where he's getting in to the same trap from the other direction. He's trying to prevent suspense to be more authentic and that doesn't work either... I am afraid that Kreuzpaintner's talent is getting corrupted by his unfitting companions and the pressure of budgets that are too high for a guy who did just a bunch of 34 films. He should stick to his roots grow strong and try again. if you're interested in good films that can be compared to Trade you should watch out for Lilya 4 ever concerning the topics and Dr. Alemn concerning the storytelling.".

And of course the emotions shown when a child is kidnapped and when returned are very realistic.Spoiler Alert Some of the unrealistic and often near impossible things in the movie involving selling children and young girls are as follows 1. A young woman forced into a car just outside the Airport in Mexico in view of hundreds both standing walking and in cars. 2. A 13 year old girl in Mexico riding a bicycle being chased midday through five blocks of with houses and buildings on both sides of the roads and no one else is outside. 3. The kidnapped victims hiding from the police when crossing the border instead of screaming to be rescued. 4. Two teenage kidnapped girls escaping and running through a parade in the USA and then being kidnapped again in view of hundreds of people including the police and no attempt the stop the kidnappers. 5. Contacting lawenforcement in the USA about an internet auction of children and the authorities doing nothing. 6. After placing the winning bid on the internet and meeting at a parking lot to exchange money for the child inside the USA when the buyer and seller are strangers and have not met. No seller would take that risk since the buyer might be the police. 7. Also then getting into a car with the thug appearing seller to be taken to an unknown place to exchange the money for the girl knowing that the thug is a kidnapper. I cannot imagine a buyer taking that risk and perhaps being robbed of 32000 in cash and maybe being killed. 8.

A powerful story with Kline and Ramos making an interesting duo. The conflict seems to always be easy to overcome with the two leads never loosing the tail of the kidnappers no matter what the obstacle is. The tragic irony at the end is an eyeroller. The hunt begins to feel farfetched as the film progresses and Kline is as dull as usual. The Mexico City setting alone is a plus to this rollercoaster of thrills and yawns. out of four".

The conflict seems to always be easy to overcome with the two leads never loosing the tail of the kidnappers no matter what the obstacle is. The tragic irony at the end is an eyeroller. The hunt begins to feel farfetched as the film progresses and Kline is as dull as usual. The Mexico City setting alone is a plus to this rollercoaster of thrills and yawns. out of four";

This movie has great actors who made the movie very believable. Jorge  Cesar Ramos plays as a young boy who is looking for his sister in Mexico was kidnapped by human traffickers. Ray Sheridan Kevin Kline plays as a protective cop that is also looking for someone close in Mexico then stumbles on Ramos and they both gang up to find the young boy's sister. They travel all over the place in Mexico and in America to try to find the young girl named Adriana  Paulina Gaitn. They found a lot of clues that helped them with their mission of finding the people who kidnapped the young boy's Cesar Ramos sister Adriana so they can bring her back home. This movie turns out to be an eye opener into the human trafficking trade. The things I didn't like about the movie was the language. I don't mind the language because of the young kids they may watch this. The part about this movie that I didn't understand was why didn't the detective Ray Sheridan finish looking for what he was looking for at the beginning of the movie? Overall that's the two things I didn't like or understand about this movie. The rest of the movie was great. This was probably not one of the best movies I've seen in awhile.".

	schema:headline " A neonoir patchwork that dissolves to reveal a great study on obsession";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a private detective who keeps an old bw photo with him. It shows a class of little girls and one of them is his daughter but he doesn't know which one so they're all his daughter. There's a mysterious girl beautiful and a little sad she goes around changing names and wigs and killing rich men but not for their money the money only the means by which she can sustain herself until she can kill again and she tells outrageous madeup stories about a father she probably never met. The movie sets itself up as something potentially quirky a noir patchwork where the dialogue is witty a corpse is dumped in a lake and the private dick tails the mysterious woman from murder to murder.It's around that point when the movie must decide the course when the crime mystery begins to dissolve into something irrelevant because the private dick is not trying to catch her any more in fact he starts erasing her traces and lying to his boss and he calls her Marie the name of his long lost daughter so that we're not asking whys anymore but rather staring obsession straight in the eye. This newfound surrogate daughter becomes a compulsion but it only starts there. It gets confusing almost surreal like characters can foresee things but it's an interesting confusion for me because the latenight atmosphere is right and something intuitive is suggested between the two protagonists. It's like we're in the cavelike gloom of a hotel staircase and the plot is used like an oil lamp that serves to increase that gloom and mystery for us and we can't tell at once what is going on on the top floor until we're halfway up there.At one point there's a TV showing FW Murnau's The Last Laugh and the girl begins fashioning another madeup tale about her father tailored this time after Emil Janning's hotel porter character in Murnau's movie the tale is outrageous and weepy like bad melodrama but it's the telling that makes it poignant like the magnitude of the lie suggests the depth of what is broken. Michel Serrault's private detective is one of the most fascinating movie characters of the 80's he's methodical in his work but also a little detached from everything around him like Elliot Gould's Phillip Marlow in The Long Goodbye and the only thing that keeps him going is the pursuit of obsession. Right down to the amazingly sad ending Mortelle Randonnee is a forgotten gem a little flawed around the edges and the details sometimes go out of focus like we're in a car and the view from the window is blurred but we stop at places and bizarre things happen there often at gunpoint and then we're on the move again and it's that neon lit blur of something sad and desperate that makes it fascinating.".

You unfortunately have to understand french to fully appreciate Michel Audiard's brilliant darkly humorous dialogs and especially Serreault's monologues. Claude Miller's direction is at once classy and precise very similar to his work on L'Accompagnatrice while Pierre Lhomme's cinematography is lush when needed gritty when necessary mainly during the last third. I read a few bad reviews here and there and I must add and I know I'm not the first that the States version not only the recent DVD but also the TV version and the old VHS well has always been the truncated 95 min. cut. Now the movie showed everywhere else in the world runs 120 min. sharp. Think about it it doesn't only mean that almost quarter of the movie is absent it also means that the editing fatally is different so is the rhythm the feel the movie altogether. I saw the DVD and frankly while the transfer's OK it doesn't make much of an impression but then again think that almost half an hour's gone. I never understood that thing with American distributors and foreign films as if American moviegoers needed shorter tighter movies so it won't be too much of a shock. That's ridiculous. Any moviegoer American or whatever that goes to the theater and buys a ticket for an AdjaniSerreault movie is obviously not looking for The Rock or Paul Walker. Well that's what I think anyway. The rating of course applies to the official 120 min. version. If you have a chance to see it don't miss it. A real gem.".

	schema:headline " A Tragic Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "Although the DVD version of this which I saw recently had 24 minutes cut out of it this film even in its truncated form still stands as a masterly work. Director Claude Miller the French say 'Millaire' is a Grand Old Man of the French cinema and this is one of his early films when he was already making masterpieces. Two years later he made the unforgettable IMPUDENT GIRL with the teenaged Charlotte Gainsbourg. More recently he has made the equally unforgettable UN SECRET 2007 see my review. Any Miller film is always going to be interesting gripping and disturbing and this one is all of that and more. It is based on a novel by the American writer who settled in France Marc Behm. The leading character is a real Mr. Anonymous a loser detective played brilliantly by Michel Serrault who is so ordinarylooking that nobody ever notices him. As he himself says in the film 'I look like everybody.' His life was shattered twenty years earlier when his little girl died. His wife had left him four years before taking the child away. He is haunted and obsessed by this double loss of the desertion and later the death of the child he was never even allowed to know and his current life is entirely empty. When given a routine assignment to try to identify the girlfriend of a rich young man when he encounters the girl played with haunted intensity by Isabelle Adjani something clicks. For much of the film we are led to believe that he thinks that she is his lost daughter and only much later do we realize that he is merely pursuing her as a fantasy substitute because he knows very well that his real daughter died as a child. When he realizes that Adjani is living on the edge of desperation just as he is he feels a spiritual kinship with her. Very soon he realizes that she is a psychotic murderess and has countless aliases. She compulsively kills and robs barely stopping long enough to catch her breath between victims. Serrault follows her from country to country watches her trysts through windows even witnesses her disposing of a body slitting a throat and being a very bad girl indeed. But he feels compelled to protect her because he knows that she is living as much in a mad fantasy as he himself is. He becomes emotionally and psychologically complicit in her crimes and even disposes of one of the bodies for her. But he does not speak to her and she never notices him because he is such a nonentity. This is a strange tale of affiliation by osmosis where two people who do not communicate nevertheless come to live a symbiotic existence one oblivious and the other passionately devoted as they travel continuously together from crime scene to crime scene. The film is immensely sad not only as regards Serrault and the tragic hole in his existence his personal nant 'nothingness' but also the demented round of murder pursued by the girl who is powerless to stop herself who is in the grip of a compulsion which is equally a 'nothingness'. We must assume that Marc Behm came under the influence of Sartre and the existentialists as all this 'nothingness' was what they all wrote about the whole time. The existentialists were always such a pain that I am delighted that they have all sunk without trace and no one even gives them a thought today celebrities one day and forgotten the next. But whereas there is nothing sad about their fate there is genuine tragedy about the characters in this film including some of the minor ones such as the blackmailer's jilted girlfriend a poignant portrait of despair which is heartbreaking. Yes this is a film about people at the very edge of desperation and we must never be contemptuous of people who are driven so far that in their wild frenzy they become capable of anything. It is very much a tribute to the sensitivity of Claude Miller that we are able to feel sympathy even for the tormented Adjani character. That is the sign of a real filmmaker.".

As he himself says in the film 'I look like everybody.' His life was shattered twenty years earlier when his little girl died. His wife had left him four years before taking the child away. He is haunted and obsessed by this double loss of the desertion and later the death of the child he was never even allowed to know and his current life is entirely empty. When given a routine assignment to try to identify the girlfriend of a rich young man when he encounters the girl played with haunted intensity by Isabelle Adjani something clicks. For much of the film we are led to believe that he thinks that she is his lost daughter and only much later do we realize that he is merely pursuing her as a fantasy substitute because he knows very well that his real daughter died as a child. When he realizes that Adjani is living on the edge of desperation just as he is he feels a spiritual kinship with her. Very soon he realizes that she is a psychotic murderess and has countless aliases. She compulsively kills and robs barely stopping long enough to catch her breath between victims. Serrault follows her from country to country watches her trysts through windows even witnesses her disposing of a body slitting a throat and being a very bad girl indeed. But he feels compelled to protect her because he knows that she is living as much in a mad fantasy as he himself is. He becomes emotionally and psychologically complicit in her crimes and even disposes of one of the bodies for her. But he does not speak to her and she never notices him because he is such a nonentity. This is a strange tale of affiliation by osmosis where two people who do not communicate nevertheless come to live a symbiotic existence one oblivious and the other passionately devoted as they travel continuously together from crime scene to crime scene. The film is immensely sad not only as regards Serrault and the tragic hole in his existence his personal nant 'nothingness' but also the demented round of murder pursued by the girl who is powerless to stop herself who is in the grip of a compulsion which is equally a 'nothingness'. We must assume that Marc Behm came under the influence of Sartre and the existentialists as all this 'nothingness' was what they all wrote about the whole time. The existentialists were always such a pain that I am delighted that they have all sunk without trace and no one even gives them a thought today celebrities one day and forgotten the next. But whereas there is nothing sad about their fate there is genuine tragedy about the characters in this film including some of the minor ones such as the blackmailer's jilted girlfriend a poignant portrait of despair which is heartbreaking. Yes this is a film about people at the very edge of desperation and we must never be contemptuous of people who are driven so far that in their wild frenzy they become capable of anything. It is very much a tribute to the sensitivity of Claude Miller that we are able to feel sympathy even for the tormented Adjani character. That is the sign of a real filmmaker.";

It is devastating devastatingly so.The original material is a pulp novel by Marc Boehm titled The Ice Maiden. Hollywood remade it with Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor as The Eye of the Beholder 1999 obviously losing the paternal dimension. The movie is about what you see and what to refuse to see what you chose to see instead. Scopophilia and fantasy spectacle and dream.Main character The Eye Michel Serrault formidable is tasked by his bitchy boss the fantastically named Mme SchmidtBoulanger Genevieve Page a monument to French diction to follow and report on the heir of a Belgian shoemaking dynasty. He soon discovers said heir has been victim of a praying mantis Isabelle Adjani whose neuroses reflect his she's lost her father and him his daughter. Only at the end of the movie those two will come across and both will die one symbolically. A feelgood movie it is not even though it ends on a soothing note.The Eye is jaded by a job too easy for his capacities. One look just one look case closed. But the Ice Maiden proves to be a tough nut to crack leading him off track across Europe and within himself. His opening monologue is anything but a conventional voiceover. It deceptively sets The Eye as a man in need. He's not. It's all crosswords for him enigmas piled on riddles. He's looking for meaning. He won't find any or only of the darkest kind. A quantum of solace too.It starts in Paris by a carousel and drifts from there under the pretense of PI work. If you speak French the movie is delectable from start to finish  it was the last one to benefit from the work of dialog writer Michel Audiard father of director Jacques Audiard and author of some of the most cultish sentences in French cinema. It's the French version of screwball comedy both elegantly written and playfully delivered. Actors here do not miss a syllable or a comma for effect. It's clockwork respectfully served by director Claude Miller.The Virgo symbol of the sweetness of things is revealed as a Capricorn symbol of winter.

It's a sacrifice he will regret to exert and try to cope with to no avail. It's a zero sum game a lost lost. But still they go relentlessly from a daylight version of Malcom McLaren's Madam Butterfly video set in Baden Baden to Rome where the sacrifice takes place.The way it spirals downward from there is too painful to tell. A very dark comedy Mortelle Randonne is as venomously funny as it is tragic. It leaves a strong bitter aftertaste. One has watched this movie repeatedly and can't get tired of it. It's a tantalising object much too dark to be watched but through the looking glass and it's impossible to forget. Impossible to unsee.".

This story could have been told in a 30minute short in 115 or 95 depending on which version you watch minutes it is plodding and repetitive she kills he follows her she kills he follows her she kills.... not to mention unbelievable. Serrault gives a good performance however he spends about 80 of the movie mumbling to himself and has little interaction with other people which makes his character tedious not before long. To fair there ARE a couple of memorable scenes Adjani's coldblooded razor slashing of another woman is one the car stunt at the end is another.  out of 4.".

	onyx:emotionText "You can see what this movie is trying to say....in fact you can see it all too well as it keeps beating you over the head with its two central ideas Michel Serrault has lost his daughter and sees Isabelle Adjani as a potential replacement to the degree that he is willing to overlook her murderous tendencies while Adjani has developed these murderous tendencies because she has also lost her father at a young age. This story could have been told in a 30minute short in 115 or 95 depending on which version you watch minutes it is plodding and repetitive she kills he follows her she kills he follows her she kills.... not to mention unbelievable. Serrault gives a good performance however he spends about 80 of the movie mumbling to himself and has little interaction with other people which makes his character tedious not before long. To fair there ARE a couple of memorable scenes Adjani's coldblooded razor slashing of another woman is one the car stunt at the end is another.  out of 4.";

Each of these two movies is pretty good but very different in the way of filming and also story telling. I would say this one is closer to the book at least about the pear eater female character played by Isabelle Adjani. As far as I remember it is not spoken about in the 1999 film. I also appreciate the Genevive Page's performance as the Michel Serrault's boss she reminds me Paul Meurisse in her way of talking at least in her first sequence. Pretty amusing. This is the best French crime mystery movie from the eighties. a sad and poor decade for the French movie industry.".

The rendering isn't naturalistic but since this is supposed to be a doll its apt. What struck me was how natural the movements of the princess played by Barbie were. I think this must have been a marketing decision because if I recall the doll itself is stiff. The decision to have the girl play with what could be sold as stuffed animals also clearly influenced the story.The story itself was pretty standard one arc but with enough elaboration to qualify as long form.But what made this stand out was the music. This was actually a very professional assembly on the order of production values every bit as good as your standard Broadway musical. Naturally the songs are pulled from that formula book. There's nothing to get excited about in terms of depth its just that this was not taken lightly. The little girls who watch this at least get the respect of not being taken for granted.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

I didn't even know that these movies existed until I let my 2 year old daughter pick out a movie at the video store. She picked Barbie  The 12 Dancing Princesses which is also a favorite. I expected them to be silly and not to have much depth like my son's Land Before Time movies. Boy was I wrong! They are so good we've bought almost all of them now.The reason I love this movie so much is that it's the ultimate love story and not just love of a boy  girl but the love of family too. It reminds me a little of the movie Ever After with Drew Barrymore. Sure it's the standard 'formula' movie but it's very satisfying and quite touching in the end I even cried! A 40 year old woman crying watching a BARBIE movie! I can't believe I am even admitting that!. Not to mention the songs are excellent. I am not much for musicals but the songs in this movie really fit in. They don't just break out in song for no reason  it really meshes into the storyline like most Disney movies I love like Beauty  The Beast and The Little Mermaid but perhaps even more effectively than those. The woman that sings the songs also sang in the other Barbie musical movies and her voice is phenomenal.The best part about this movie is that it's not scary in any way for the small kids. My son likes Barbie in the Magic of Pegasus better because of the scary Wenlock but watches this one along with his sister just as intently.Keep the WONDERFUL Barbie movies coming. We are HUGE fans!".

This is a great video and I hope they continue to produce more Barbie Musical videos. I'm already planning on a Barbie themed Christmas this year for my daughter.

None are among my favourite movies of all time and none are the best movies I've seen but I find them cute entertaining and charming with good morals nice characters and the animation and music are also not bad at all and generally get better. The Island Princess is in my top 5 favourites of the movies alongside Nutcracker Diamond Castle Prince and the Pauper and 12 Dancing PrincessesI also have a soft spot for Rapunzel and Swan Lake as well as they were along with Nutcracker the first ones I watched. In fact all of them are worth watching even my least favourite Mariposaand that is still quite good. Here the dialogue is occasionally corny but on the most part sweet and heartwarming. The vocal performances are spirited and the story is simple but cute and charming with lots of heart and positive messaging. The characters are not complex and they don't need to be instead they get through by their likability Rosella is an identifiable lead and her animal friends are adorable. The music is catchy and wellsung and the animation makes Island Princess one of the bestlooking Barbie movies to datethe best looking ones are Nutcracker and Diamond Castle in my opinion with its bright colours and beautiful backgrounds. Overall a very nice movie that should be given a chance without any prejudice. I do got toddler friends who adore these films but I have seen numerous examples of adults who have been satisfied with their child's enjoyment and have liked some of them too. Just for the record I happen to be somebody from outside the target audience20 as of now and while I can think of better movies I enjoy them too and I am not afraid to admit it. 910 Bethany Cox".

The performances are excellent but the not well resolved screenplay does not support the actors and actresses.

	schema:reviewBody "For 10 plus years The Hellstrom Chronicle was regularly plugged into the 2am4am movie slot on a local station in the middle 80's through 90's. Too bad it couldn't get more coverage because this is how a documentary should be made.     The problem with documentaries is if you focus too much on the clinical data it becomes dry.  If yo try to interject drama into it you run the risk of sending up the piece into parody or even farce.  Hellstrom interjects just the right amount of fiction in the form of Lawrence Pressman that links the documentary portions at a pace that keeps it from losing one's interest.  It's obvious that Dr. Hellstrom a fictitious entomologist is paranoid that insects will take over the world through their superiority over men.  The most interesting thing though is he may very well be right!  If the insect world footage has any say in how future matters may turn out it will.     Of particular interest is the portion of the footage devoted to the driver ants.  As has been quoted in other reviews this is a prime example of How DID they film that?! documentary in motion.  It's an inspiration out of Leinengen Vs. The Ants only it's real!     If you can find this movie give it a roll.  Expand your mind a bit with some facts while at the same time become entertained by Dr. Hellstrom... even if he isn't a real doctor but he plays one on TV! Actually he did!  Pressman went on to play one on Doogie Howser M.D.".

On the other hand the film has some amazing footagefootage that is STILL very impressive over 40 years later.The film begins with Pressman introducing himself as Dr. Hellstromthough this is all fiction. This 'expert' really just an actor talks on and on like an excited entomologistan entomologist who seemed more intent at times to scare the viewer than to truly educate. Most of the information is very true but sometimes he exaggerates in order to scare the viewer about the danger of insects or how they ultimately will rule the Earth.There is a lot to admire apart from the occasionally dopey narration about this film. The cinematography still impresses todaywith micro shots of many insects as well as human fertilization. But the dryness and longwinded nature of the film make this one you wish was shortermuch shorter. I think this film would have worked better at about 45 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2002 director Lucky McKee made a big impression with his first full feature film the oddball horror 'May'. Since then he went on to direct the best episode of the Masters of Horror series and this film...which has unfortunately remained in limbo for far too long. It's not difficult to see why the film struggled to get a release as McKee's film isn't exactly your average slice of horror. It's clear that the director has a thing for deviant young women and that theme is carried through with this film along with a whole load of influence which ranges from Video Nasty classic 'The Evil Dead' to Dario Argento's masterpiece 'Suspiria'. The film takes place in 1965 and focuses on central character Heather Fasulo  a girl sent to a an allgirl boarding school by her parents after she decided to burn down their house. The school is surrounded by thick woodland and the girls there tell stories about it which revolve round a coven of witches that decided to take the school by force many years earlier. Furthermore this story seems to have some truth as Heather suffers nightmares which focus on the surrounding woods The film is really slow paced for the first hour and despite some mysterious goings on at first there isn't a lot of horror involved. But that's not to say that the film is boring! McKee utilises this time well and uses it to create mystery around his central theme and build the characters up to a point that we can easily care for them. The atmosphere is continually creepy and this bodes well with the mystery theme and the dark and gloomy woodland. While The Woods doesn't feature much in the way of blood and gore McKee skilfully manages to work some schlock sequences into the film and the frenzied final third brilliantly offsets the slow build of the first two. The director has managed to put together a good lineup of acting talent for the film which sees Agnes Bruckner doing well in the lead role and receiving good feedback from experienced actors including a devilish Patricia Clarkson and cult icon Bruce Campbell whom I'd like to have seen more of. It all boils down to a satisfying yet open climax and overall despite its problems getting a release  this is a damn good horror film and will surely rank as one of the best of 2006! Here's to hoping McKee has an easier time getting a release for his next film.".

	schema:headline " Stylish Imaginative Horror Period Piece Along The Lines Of Suspiria.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd been awaiting this film's release for over a year now and finally after a bunch of problems with editing and whatnot this movie got a DVD release. The Woods tells the story of a troubled girl named Heather Agnes Bruckner who is sent to a secluded private girls school in 1965 by her estranged parents after causing problems and lighting a tree on fire in their back yard. Ms. Traverse Patricia Clarkson along with two other women run the old school. Heather doesn't seem to fit in at the school and has a rough first week there getting in scuffles with a snobby bully named Samantha Rachel Nichols. Her only friend is Marcy a quiet girl who is nice but shy. As she spends more time around the school Heather has nightmares and hears strange voices and is told the story of some witches who took over the school 100 years ago. As more strange events occur in and around the woods surrounding the school girls begin to disappear.Unlike some I found The Woods to be a satisfying horror film. I'll start off with the story  it's intriguing but derivative I'd describe it as a hybrid of Suspiria and The Watcher in the Woods which are both films that I love I might add. While it does borrow ideas from these films it's nonetheless an imaginative and entertaining movie. The direction in the film was great  Lucky McKee who spawned the unique fairytalelike horror film May does a good job with this film. There are some really creative  spooky sequences and some nice cinematography to offer plus the great '60s atmosphere was strongly present brought to life through the costumes sets and the vintage score and providing a perfect backdrop for the story to take place. I tend to have a soft spot for period pieces so I really liked the time setting.The acting was on par and flowed naturally the whole cast performed very well. Agnes Bruckner is likable in her role and Patricia Clarkson was great as the mysterious somethingisn'tquiterightabouther Mrs. Traverse. Horror legend Bruce Campbell of the Evil Dead series plays Heather's father although his role is pretty minor. And Rachel Nichols who had a small role in the Amityville Horror remake plays the rude school bully very well. There are some neat special effects used nicely throughout the film and weren't too overdone. The CG was surprisingly really reallooking. I felt the conclusion of the of the film was slightly rushed but I've seen films end much quicker than this so for me it wasn't really a big deal. Plus the ending features some great witch slashings via an axe which was a nice addition to the film since the majority of it is gore free.Overall The Woods is a satisfying horror movie. It's different but it's imaginative and throughly entertaining with a great story and a strong vintage atmosphere. Definitely not bad at all especially for a horror period piece. Other than the slightly rushed conclusion I can't really say anything bad about it. It took over a year to finally get a release in any form but the wait was well worth it. I love stuff like this so it was almost perfect for me. One of the better horror films of the past year. 910.".

Agnes Bruckner is likable in her role and Patricia Clarkson was great as the mysterious somethingisn'tquiterightabouther Mrs. Traverse. Horror legend Bruce Campbell of the Evil Dead series plays Heather's father although his role is pretty minor. And Rachel Nichols who had a small role in the Amityville Horror remake plays the rude school bully very well. There are some neat special effects used nicely throughout the film and weren't too overdone. The CG was surprisingly really reallooking. I felt the conclusion of the of the film was slightly rushed but I've seen films end much quicker than this so for me it wasn't really a big deal. Plus the ending features some great witch slashings via an axe which was a nice addition to the film since the majority of it is gore free.Overall The Woods is a satisfying horror movie. It's different but it's imaginative and throughly entertaining with a great story and a strong vintage atmosphere. Definitely not bad at all especially for a horror period piece. Other than the slightly rushed conclusion I can't really say anything bad about it. It took over a year to finally get a release in any form but the wait was well worth it. I love stuff like this so it was almost perfect for me. One of the better horror films of the past year. 910.";

It's there that she slowly learns that witchcraft is afoot and that she along with select other students have been targeted for ulterior motives by the nefarious teaching staff as a result of their unique paranormal talents.McKee who rose to fame with his 2002 movie May draws heavily on Italian horror cinema influences the film bears more than a passing similarity to Dario Argento's Suspira The Woods devotes far more time than most films of the genre building audience identification with the central characters which normally is a good thing however in this case it appears to have come at the expense of the fright factor. I suppose McKee was aiming for a slow turnofthescrew approach to mounting tension culminating with the film's orgasmic release however it didn't work for me. Instead the movie seemed to plod along in a meandering fashion only to suddenly kick into high gear during the final 15 minutes.It's all too bad really because The Woods has many strengths going for it. It's terrifically photographed the cinematography even plays with color hues throughout the film for a stylish effect. It's well acted with copious nifty quirks the dialog flows naturally and the special effects are superb. If only this movie delivered more chills than it promises it would have probably been released a year or more ago.".

	schema:headline " A Worthwhile Disaster";
	schema:reviewBody "The Woods is the longawaited followup effort from director Lucky McKee who caught critical attention with his modest but impressive 2002 teen shocker May. With an intermediate budget and slated for mainstream release for the past year or two The Woods still hasn't shown up in theatres and its Canadian premiere at Montreal's Fantasia 2006 leaves an unfortunate impression that it likely never will. It's an intriguing watch for the longtime horror fan as a sincere American approximation of 70s style Italian giallos but demands indulgence for just how bloody awful it truly is. Characterization is nonexistent and the plot which amazingly fails to explain any of its climactic events appears to have lost its thread during scenebyscene rewrites. The result isn't so much a tribute but what looks like a frantic Plan B in the editing room which imitates rather than captures the logicbedamned nightmare flavour of vintage Bava and Argento.The influence of Argento's Suspiria is evident to the point of plagiarism. The setting is an isolated boarding school for troubled girls where young Heather Agnes Bruckner is sent allegedly for pyromania though the film never expands upon nor utilizes this seemingly crucial character trait. Rebellious Heather is an instant magnet for all sorts of abuse from both her snooty fellow pupils and the creepy spinsters who staff the place. She attempts to run away only to find that the surrounding woods are alive with supernatural menace driving her right back to the school. This has something to do with a trio of 19th century witches who got stoned to death or something and are either haunting the place or hanging around as reincarnated teachers though it's hard to tell. Meanwhile Heather befriends a couple other social rejects who mysteriously vanish and discovers that she has latent telekinetic powers something else she puts to no future dramatic use. These the faculty encourage her to develop which she finds a tad suspicious. Is this why she's here as a novice chosen for the teacher's blood coven? Or are they preparing her as a sacrifice to the forest demons? Don't even bother trying to figure it out since she never gets around to it. The confusion merely intensifies when Heather's concerned father Bruce Campbell tries to spring her and the FX budget kicks in with animated ivy vines snaking all over the place and entangling cast members for no apparent reason other than an injokey Evil Dead reference as Bruce dashes about in an axewielding frenzy. Never mind that everything up to this point has been dead serious and mostly low key Gothic and Bruce with his gorestick comedy looks like he was parachuted in at the last minute. If the mess can't be tidied up why not slop some cheap laughs on top of it? One entertaining conceit is the film's 1965 setting suggested with no great ear for retro dialog but little that's noticeably anachronistic. Period detail meanwhile is safely kept to a bare and economic minimum. This is made easy by its singular setting of an old converted mansion and its rustic surroundings which necessitates the production rental of exactly three vintage automobiles. With all the younger cast members in a single change of outfit between schoolgirl uniforms and prudish nightgowns odd that there isn't a whiff of lesbianism in this it's with the teachers that at least the hair and wardrobe departments get to have some fun decking them out in ghastly exaggerations of 60s frump fashions and bouffant hairdos. The head mistress in particular has Joan Crawford's coiffed orangutan look from Berserk and as played by the usually brilliant Patricia Clarkson she exudes pokerfaced menace on a single mortified note as if fulfilling her contract with a gun to her head. Real ingenuity is shown with the spare soundtrack comprised of only three old hits by Lesley Gore the perfect iconic choice for a film about mid60s teenage girls. Rather than just playing in the background the songs are blended with sound and visuals into the mood and action especially You Don't Own Me which is emotionally merged via intelligent montage into an eerie operatic duet with the doomed soloist of the school choir.This is one of several jarring stylistic flourishes  another involves an inspired stereotype reversal of the school bully bitch  that leads one to suspect that The Woods fell victim to militant studio tampering. If his compact and punchy earlier work May is any indication Lucky McKee knows how to construct a horror film and he wouldn't have started with a script as sloppy incoherent as this one accredited to his neophyte collaborator David Ross. As for Ross unseasoned though he may have been it's hard to believe he would've tossed in that pyromania and telekinesis if he didn't have plans for his heroine to throw her weight around rather than letting daddyonthespot Bruce steal her thunder in that cultpandering finale. Hotter heads prevailed on this one probably penny pinching and running creative interference until precious little of the original vision remained. The film's a disaster but a fascinating one and let's hope the compromised talents blamed for it survive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judging from the enthusiastic response at Sunday night's screening I suspect that if THE WOODS were given a conventional theatrical release it would attract a wide audience. The film is structured and presented as a nightmare and it has the inconsistencies and incongruities that a nightmare has. That is too much for some people to tolerate but judging from the screening there are many who get it and like it. There is much to like. Fans of MAY will be happy to see that Lucky McKee has developed more fully into an actor's director zeroing in on character and bringing to a scene the proper dramatic balance and tone. They'll also be pleased to see that given a modest budget by today's shockhorror standards he has exhibited new freedom of movement and imagery. Above all this is a visually stunning film. with an almost overwhelming sound design that is understandably too much for some people. McKee knows how to create a mood of foreboding but he chooses to do it through artistry rather than through cheap manipulation. The clichs that he uses are an evocation not an imitation of classics like SUSPIRIA. What lights up the screen is an individual voice a distinctive style that immediately sets McKee apart from his contemporaries. It's not that he does it better although compared with most Hollywood releases he really does it better but that his work is instantly recognizable as unique clearly identifiable unlike anything we've seen before. There is a unity of artistic elements with cinematography art direction music sound and acting that blend seamlessly into a coherent style that is more important to the film than the details of the story. That's a pretty tough accomplishment and one that may or may not appeal to thrillseeking moviegoers but it's earned him enough respect from his peers to be named one of the Masters of Horror. He belongs in that group because of the way he approaches his work not because of the number of screams his films generate or the clarity and logic of his scripts. It's not for everybody but it does strike a chord with fans who value the way McKee creates and sustains tension allows his characters to come alive within the story and moves the camera with breathtaking effect. I'm still not sure what was going on in that school but I know how it felt to watch it and I found this movie riveting. McKee is aiming at lyricism and while we should expect that plot is also served in this film it is secondary. Nightmare logic isn't covered in Aristotle's Six Elements of Drama. It is McKee's creativity that we experience and it was gratifying last Sunday night to be among so many people who came to enjoy themselves watching the work of this talented film maker.".

	schema:reviewBody "After all the delay this film suffered I finally got around to seeing Lucky McKee's second movie. His first 'May' was weird but brilliant horror with some genuine shock moments. The Woods doesn't disappoint in either department. The film is set in 1965 and centres around Heather Fasulo Agnes Bruckner who is sent to an allgirl boarding school in the middle of the woods. Right from the start she suspects that something is different about the school and it doesn't help the teachers are all a tad weird especially Headmistress Traverse Patricia Clarkson. Her suspicion is raised when the girls at the school tell her the story of three witches who took over the school 100 years ago.McKee's influences are obvious. From cult favourite 'The Evil Dead' Dario Argento's masterpiece 'Suspiria' and the supernatural Stephen King adaptation of 'Carrie.' He blends all these into an original little horror that is effective and interesting from start to finish. The first hour is actually very slow paced and in terms of horror there isn't a whole lot. That's not a bad thing however as it allows McKee to create a mystery around the central theme and develop the characters nicely. The last 20 minutes take a different stance with gore galore and a neat twist which wraps up the movie nicely. The acting is good from all Agnes Bruckner carries the movie well Patricia Clarkson is subtle as the villain and Bruce Campbell makes a cool cameo. All in all 'The Woods' is a fine horror and I eagerly await McKee's next movie! 45".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been waiting for this film to come out for 3 years and finally I saw it a few days ago and I liked it very much. I think Lucky is a very talented director with such insight and vision.I don't know why it took so long to come out or why it went straight to DVD...it's too bad I thought it deserved much more. I thought the story was intriguing but the plot could have been tweaked a bit. I thought the acting was really very good from all the performers but that doesn't surprise me because Lucky is so great with his actors and really works closely with them to get the most out of each scene and performance.

I was also bummed that there are no special features like the making of which I was really looking forward to because Lucky's father was filming everything on a video camera and got some awesome stuff and the outtakes...where are the outtakes? Deleted scenes? Director's commentary? Such a shame because I think many people would have really enjoyed all that stuff..I always do when I watch DVD's. Oh well all in all I enjoyed it and can't wait to see what Lucky comes out with next!! I really do wish him all the best!!".

Not even when Bruce Campbell is your dad.Bruce has a great part in this movie. Because its about a school for girls and 99.9 of the movie is filled with women now I know why the director's name is Lucky you can't expect Bruce to have a big part however his part is vital towards the end of the movie. Lucky mcKay used Campbell in a great way and even makes him go into evil dead mode towards the end.Gore blood and guts are not really what this movie is about. The scenes with the girls waving with axes are bloodstunning though. If you want to see a nice horror that is a bit different from the ordinary watch this! They should really release this baby. It won't be a box office smash hit but I think it'll definitely do something in the cinema at least more than the 12 million it cost.".

	schema:reviewBody "A teenage girl is taken to a private school by her parents after showing signs of criminal behavior starting fires. But the faculty and the school itself might have a long tradition of secrets behind it.I was drawn to this film by the inclusion of actor Bruce Campbell The Evil Dead who has a pretty pointless part until much later in the film. He does very well in his role and appears to be moving towards a more serious sense of himself as an actor he shows none of the comedy in here that has made him famous in such roles as those in Brisco County Jr. or Bubba HoTep.The real star of the film though is the lead actress Agnes Bruckner. Not only very beautiful almost in a Claire Danes way but better but very seductive and gripping. I often find myself pausing movies to get a sandwich or to use the restroom but she had me watching every move like she was a puppeteer and I was her helpless marionette. I cannot say enough about this stellar performance. Oddly Bruckner does not seem to have a wellknown filmography.I have heard from others that this is a sad followup to Lucky McKee's last film May. I disagree. While May was certainly a unique movie and probably McKee's best work this one really stood out as a mature vision from the director. I wish all sophomore efforts could come across as striking as The Woods.The visual effects were very nice keeping the 1965 setting well done and making the school seem isolated in the eponymous woods. Later in the film the visual effects become very noticeable and we see some of the best in the business. I can't say what as it might give something away but let me say it might remind you of a notorious scene from Campbell's earlier film the original Evil Dead.The other actors and actresses were great as well. None stood out as poor though none were nearly as striking as the lead actress. I suppose I should point out Rachel Nichols. While she played a very conservative role here as Samantha she earlier appeared in Amityville Horror as the babysitter and later in G. I. Joe as Scarlett O'Hara. Watch Samantha closely on your second viewing of this film  her motives are more interesting than you first think.One last reason to watch The Woods. Maybe this was a coincidence it most likely was but the film's theme song could easily be You Don't Own Me by Lesley Gore. While many remakes exist the most notable is by a band called Rasputina who featured it on their 1998 album How We Quit the Forest. The title and album cover suggest a girl who is trying to leave the woods she is trapped in not unlike the film.".

	schema:headline " Lucky McKee's homage to Suspiria";
	schema:reviewBody "Within the first minutes of The Woods one can see that director Lucky McKee and writer David Ross are horror film geeks that came of age in the video age of the 80s and feasted their eyes on films like Dario Argento's Suspiria and Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series. This is a Suspiria remake in anything but name crossed with some wood demons and Bruce Campbell to fight them. The picture is beautifully helmed and McKee's compositions are often quite effective and moody even if the overbearing influence of Argento's masterpiece sometimes works against The Woods. It's influence is so blatant because Ross recycles not only the basic plot but even detailed plot points such as the drugged drinks. McKee follows suit by having numerous visual references to that film even copying whole shots. This can become a distraction for fans who are very familiar with Suspiria though McKee gives it enough of a spin for the film to not look like a lame rip off and more like an inspired let's do it like in the good old days romp. The film has some pacing problems though most of which are linked to the heavy foreshadowing. When a girl tells new arrival Heather a spooky myth about the boarding school deep in the woods she has just arrived in the avid viewer pretty much knows the secret of the place the main villain's motivations and secrets and can easily map out the proceedings from there. The second third of the film suffers from this predictability. The Woods does pick up some steam towards the hour mark with the reappearance of Heather's parents and the first words spoken by a formerly silent Bruce Campbell who plays to his adoring cult following once more here. The finale is a bit of a let down though even if the involvement of the titular woods is fun to see thanks also to some convincing CGI not the secondrate crap that often destroys the atmosphere in these smallbudgeted movies. It's pretty much by the numbers though it is enormous fun to see Bruce Don't Call Me Ash Campbell wield an axe and split some witch bitch open.The Woods certainly isn't the most innovative movie of the world  especially not if you have seen Suspiria  but it is very well made and has some really efficient sequences despite the absence of anything truly scary. Considering the poor quality of the horror genre in general this is a small delight for genre fans.".

A troubled girl is sent away to an allgirls boarding school. The staff is creepy and are most definitely up to something. There are legends surrounding the school's history and the recent string of student disappearances might have something to do with them. The film's biggest problem is its tooquick and confusing climax. It's loud obnoxious and unworthy of what has come before. The rest of the film is quite eerie. The acting is very good Agnes Bruckner plays the lead and along for the ride are Patricia Clarkson and Bruce Campbell and McKee's direction is generally wonderful. Perhaps a slight disappointment after May but still a worthy followup. I have faith that McKee will go on to make more great films. Just hope someone deems them releaseable.".

The story is set circa 1965. Heather goes into the school takes a test and cuts herself onto the paper and the paper instantly absorbs her blood this leaves her slightly startled. The head mistress then tells will be attending on a scholarship. Her parents leave her there and Heather is upset. In the Dining Room she makes friends with a nerdy girl named Marcy. As they are eating dinner the school bully comes over and taunts Heather the bully's name is named Samantha. Samantha uses the mean term Fire Crotch towards Heather and it becomes one of the most lame and reoccurring sayings in this movie. Let's fast forward here Heather discovers she has powers to balance objects and has visions or nightmares of certain students killing themselves and eventually these students go missing. The students let her in on an 100 year old story about 3 sisters that were labeled as witches that came into the school. The three sisters enchanted the teachers and the other students were mad so the other students called the 3 sisters witches and stoned them and ran them into the woods. The 3 sisters called onto the woods for help and said they would deliver souls to them. Heather now knows that its probably the spirits in the woods calling her. The woods takes souls and kills people in order to live eventually they kill Heather's mom.In the end Heather is used by the teacher's in a ritual that would enable them to continue to live longer. Heather's vision of killing the teachers came true and by doing this she is able to save the students. At the very end of the movie it said the school burned down but the surrounding woods did not.The movie was horrible. It was 91 minutes of my life that I cannot get back. The inaudible sounds of the woods combined with the over use of the term Fire Crotch and the poor acting is no wonder why this was a DVD only movie release.Not worth your time or money.".

I'm not going to go in on the movie synopsis too much but this one takes a few twists that were very welcome to break that predictable chain we usually see in Swedish actioncop movies.

The basic premise of the plot  revenge  is a very common one for Henning Mankell but it's the characterisation and acting that are both so strong. I thought Martinnson really came alive as a character in this with convincing vulnerability. It is so sad that the actress who plays Linda Wallander came to such a tragic ending  she gives a superb performance in this. And Krister Henrikson's Wallander is starting to become the definitive one for me  even over Kenneth Branagh.".

Naturally the policewoman is attacked from behind and Linda after ripping the bandage off then wanders around aimlessly with a gun wondering where the psychopath is constantly walking backwards naturally. She is supposed to be a trained policewoman but instead of backing into a secure corner any corner and retaining the gun to protect herself if the psycho attacks her from the front the only possibility if she is backed into a corner she keeps wandering around in panic among large building support columns behind any one of which the psycho could be hiding and from where he can surprise her. Of course he does exactly that which is made easier for him by the fact that Linda keeps walking around backwards. I have never seen a more stupid piece of plotting in a police drama.

	schema:headline " Very Subpar Episode of Wallander";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of the Wallander series. The characters are interesting and it's always kind of fun trying to guess who the criminal is in the episode. As with most cop dramas sometimes they can be a bit too formulaic and sometimes the suspension of disbelief is necessary can there really be so many terrorist attacks and multiplemurderers in a tiny Swedish city of only 18000 residents?. That said the plots are generally good and I've enjoyed nearly every single episode I've watched.This episode however really felt like it didn't belong in the Wallander series. It's more like a bad horror movie. And while I'm willing to suspend disbelief a bit this one got very out of hand. None of the characters behave as they normally do and they somehow all seemed to lose all the senses they use to solve other cases. Then there's the matter of the mastermind. He's not a realistic character. First off in order to do the stuff he did in this episode he would've literally had to have spent millions of Dollars or more accurately tens of millions of Swedish kronors. Where does a guy who's been in prison for years end up with all the resources to conduct this operation? They have the guy renting out half the city to install expensive surveillance equipment everywhere. Then somehow he seems to have no realistic limitations like time or need for sleep. He works right under the noses of the cops and they don't notice him which is farfetched enough but how does he keep his job without anyone noticing that he's never around? It just doesn't make any sense. That might be OK in another series where that's the norm but it was a huge departure from the rules of the Wallander world. I enjoy that the Wallander movies are all like puzzles that you are slowly trying to solve but in order to solve a puzzle there has to be some logic and reason behind it. There was no logic or reason behind this episode. For that reason I consider this the worst of the Wallander episodes. This should've been a horror movie not an episode of Wallander.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm a big fan of the Wallander series. The characters are interesting and it's always kind of fun trying to guess who the criminal is in the episode. As with most cop dramas sometimes they can be a bit too formulaic and sometimes the suspension of disbelief is necessary can there really be so many terrorist attacks and multiplemurderers in a tiny Swedish city of only 18000 residents?. That said the plots are generally good and I've enjoyed nearly every single episode I've watched.This episode however really felt like it didn't belong in the Wallander series. It's more like a bad horror movie. And while I'm willing to suspend disbelief a bit this one got very out of hand. None of the characters behave as they normally do and they somehow all seemed to lose all the senses they use to solve other cases. Then there's the matter of the mastermind. He's not a realistic character. First off in order to do the stuff he did in this episode he would've literally had to have spent millions of Dollars or more accurately tens of millions of Swedish kronors. Where does a guy who's been in prison for years end up with all the resources to conduct this operation? They have the guy renting out half the city to install expensive surveillance equipment everywhere. Then somehow he seems to have no realistic limitations like time or need for sleep. He works right under the noses of the cops and they don't notice him which is farfetched enough but how does he keep his job without anyone noticing that he's never around? It just doesn't make any sense. That might be OK in another series where that's the norm but it was a huge departure from the rules of the Wallander world. I enjoy that the Wallander movies are all like puzzles that you are slowly trying to solve but in order to solve a puzzle there has to be some logic and reason behind it. There was no logic or reason behind this episode. For that reason I consider this the worst of the Wallander episodes. This should've been a horror movie not an episode of Wallander.";

Soon after it appears that the daughter of the other detective has been murdered but although her room is covered in blood her body is not there. When the police learn that the blood actually came from the victim Linda found they realise they aren't dealing with a normal killer. As the story progresses Kurt becomes convinced that the killer is in the police station watching them although his colleagues don't believe him.As with the other episodes the acting was good especially from Krister Henriksson and Johanna Sllstrm as Kurt and Linda Wallander. I suspect the story might work better for people for haven't seen previous episodes so aren't expecting a more realistic crime. If you can suspend your disbelief it is still fun.".

Differing perspectives of nationalism and terrorism are exploredone man's terrorist act may also be looked at as a fight for an independent homelandas well as conventional familial and romantic relationships. Notions of love loyalty betrayal patriotism and morality get turned on their head making for a pretty complex film. Is this overly ambitious for a commercial Hindi blockbuster? Perhaps but the intellectual sophistication of the filmmaking team more or less pulls it off.

Also wonderful is that neither motherhood nor her absence from the screen for five years have dimmed her youthful looks or charm. If anything she is more svelte and her face shines with increased character. Kajol has been blessed with sublimely expressive eyes and now that she has acquired more life experience they register even greater pain. One almost feels like looking away at times to allow her privacy in her grief. I welcome her return to the screen and if she displays similar care in choosing her next project it will be worth the wait.Aamir Khan picks his projects with a mix of sensitivity and savvy and presents the filmgoing public with a different persona each time. He contrasted his feisty village yokel role in Lagaan nicely with the glib selfabsorbed urban youth undone by love in Dil Chahta Hai so that in the same year folks got to see two completely different Aamirs. I haven't seen his The Rising The Song of Mangal Pandey or Rang De Basanti as yet but I am confident that he burrowed deep into the souls of the characters of those films too. Here he inhabits the skin and soul of Rehan QuadriMajor Ranjeev with total conviction and allows you into the thought processes of these men. He does look too old to do the romantic shtick demanded of the Rehan character but comes into his own while playing the older Major Ranjeev a profoundly troubled man dealing with adult ethical ideological and moral conundrums. To comment any more on his performance would be a disservice to the plot twists of the film so I shall stop right here.The director Kunal Kohli handled the fun and lighthearted Hum Tum with aplomb and here he tackles subjects far weightier than those of the Rani MukherjeeSaif Ali Khan film. His occasional missteps result in some unevenness of pace and tone which some judicious editing would have remedied but with the overall wallop the film packs these are minor lapses. I personally felt the second half of the film needed no songs but that is my own quibble. The millions in the majority would have none of that I'm sure. Aamir and Kajol do their own singing in a small but powerful scene and this I felt was far more effective and poignant than the overproduced orchestrations of JatinLalit and the vast array of playback singers they assembled.Rishi Kapoor Kiron Kher Tabu and others offer strong support while child actor Ali Hajji as young Rehan is amazingly unaffected and natural.After witnessing the combustible chemistry between Kajol and Aamir why were they never paired together before? and being privy to the volatile seismic shifts in their relationship in this film I conclude that Fanaa is indeed the title that says it best.".

	schema:reviewBody "It tickled me no end to read some viewers comment that a Kashmiri Muslim girl fell in love and allowed a man to bed her in a span of 8 days romance. They thought it slightly implausible. This might have held true for some two decades back but not nowadays. We have to understand Zooni Kajol came from a fairly modern family she was no village bumpkin in the movie and the apple of her parents eye. More so because she was blind and her mother always encouraged her to look forward to her Prince Charming the day he arrived. She was this inexperienced girl full of ideas of romance and blind to boot and Aamirs winsome voice and poetry won her over and she just went into the relationship headstrong girl that she was knowing and accepting that there might never be anything permanent she just wanted to live for those 8 days she was able to be romanced by the person she was besotted with a very common occurrence actually in todays scenario.The story of a man torn between love and duty might be hackneyed but I sure as hell didn't know how it was all going to end and was eager to sit through the whole film and watch it to the very end. I don't know how some people thought the first 90 minutes was horrible and the rest even more so! I found the first half extremely entertaining and the second half was a pleasure to watch just for the sheer pleasure of watching two very high class actors perform as they never have.Kunal Kohli is an extremely sensitive director and while there may have been slip ups in pace here and there it was an emotional rather than an action packed movie after all on the whole the movie shows a director of competence and someone who has a very bright future.The cinematography is breathtaking and the supporting cast of Rishi Kapoor and Tabu adds to the movies worth. Rishi especially is brilliant.But the movies strongest point is the performance of the two lead actors especially Kajol who had the more author backed role. Kajol and Aamirs chemistry leave you wondering WHY they never acted together before. And they look so good its hard to imagine Kajols a mom and Aamir a divorced dad of two.".

	onyx:emotionText "It tickled me no end to read some viewers comment that a Kashmiri Muslim girl fell in love and allowed a man to bed her in a span of 8 days romance. They thought it slightly implausible. This might have held true for some two decades back but not nowadays. We have to understand Zooni Kajol came from a fairly modern family she was no village bumpkin in the movie and the apple of her parents eye. More so because she was blind and her mother always encouraged her to look forward to her Prince Charming the day he arrived. She was this inexperienced girl full of ideas of romance and blind to boot and Aamirs winsome voice and poetry won her over and she just went into the relationship headstrong girl that she was knowing and accepting that there might never be anything permanent she just wanted to live for those 8 days she was able to be romanced by the person she was besotted with a very common occurrence actually in todays scenario.The story of a man torn between love and duty might be hackneyed but I sure as hell didn't know how it was all going to end and was eager to sit through the whole film and watch it to the very end. I don't know how some people thought the first 90 minutes was horrible and the rest even more so! I found the first half extremely entertaining and the second half was a pleasure to watch just for the sheer pleasure of watching two very high class actors perform as they never have.Kunal Kohli is an extremely sensitive director and while there may have been slip ups in pace here and there it was an emotional rather than an action packed movie after all on the whole the movie shows a director of competence and someone who has a very bright future.The cinematography is breathtaking and the supporting cast of Rishi Kapoor and Tabu adds to the movies worth. Rishi especially is brilliant.But the movies strongest point is the performance of the two lead actors especially Kajol who had the more author backed role. Kajol and Aamirs chemistry leave you wondering WHY they never acted together before. And they look so good its hard to imagine Kajols a mom and Aamir a divorced dad of two.";

The background scores are worth more than a mention.But the movie goes deeper and makes one think about the power of love and our utter helplessness before it... how it shapes one's life and choices. The importance of choice is given the limelight in this movie the choices that are so unique and personal to each of us given the same situation. It also asks importantly how much can love forgive?Put yourself in the place of these characters as you watch the movie and see how much is asked of you at each step what strength is required to make the choices they make.This movie in some ways is a lesson in love. It puts to shame our cautiousness rigid moral standards emotional walls etc in love. You cannot walk into love with tiny steps wearing a steel armor and praying not to get hurt. There is no such thing as going too fast or too slow or all these clichs we've come up with to explain relationships To love you truly HAVE to be free. At heart.".

The strong willed intelligent girl out to meet her prince the supportive mother the mysterious and charming lover the lonely house in the middle of nowhere the retired colonel as the only family friend who sometimes comes and shares a drink with the father it's all there.Fanaa is one of the most intense romantic movies to have come out of Bollywood for a long time. Perhaps since Silsila. The pairing of two of the best actors of our generation maybe perhaps of all time needed a story just like Fanaa. You need to scratch the surface to reveal the passion of this unique love story. The director Kunal Kohli has exploited the potential of this pairing admirably. Look at the picturisation of the song 'Dekho Na'. The camera hardly seems to move away from the two faces. There are innumerable scenes in the film where just these two faces share the screen.It is hard to think of any other actors from the present who would be able to pull off such a form of narration. Ultimately the film belongs to Zooni and Kajol comes out with her best performance to date. Rehan asks KOI KISISE ITNA PYAR KAISE KAR SAKTA HAI? and it shows in Zooni's eyes. What a role to make a come back and what a performance to make a comeback! And Aamir never ceases to surprise. He holds his own in a story primarily about Zooni and complements her character brilliantly. His performance is so amazingly understated and yet so powerful. Rehan is one of the most complex and difficult characters played by Aamir. And it's all about the characters of Rehan and Zooni their ideals their emotions their dreams and their passion. It's really like reading a 19th century English novel. It is not easy to narrate a story this way in a mainstream film and this is where the narration stumbles. The scene where Rehan takes Zooni from the train and carries her in his arms looks very clich and awfully out of place. The tag line '.....TERE ISHQ MEIN MERI JAAN FANAA HO JAYE' is repeated to death in the film. There have been some cinematic liberties taken in the screenplay like Rehan infiltrating the Indian Army Zooni fumbling with the radio transmitter and speaking to the right people. The Urdu couplets although all very good seem to hold back the flow a bit. Also the discussion on the political history of Kashmir at the meeting of the Intelligence Heads seems a bit off track. A better place to put that discussion would have been a friendly chat between Rehan and Zulfi Zooni's fatherover a drink.But these are minor skirmishes in a remarkable film. The story remains true to the title of the film and if you have a liking for 19th century English novels you would simply love this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK the much awaited movie. Aamir after RDB and Kajol after a long break. The movie starts off with some brilliant locales and Kajol going to Delhi for a dance program where she encounters Rehan Aamir. The sher shayari bit in the first half is really good maybe coz of the way Aamir says it .Then there's a twist in the tale just before the interval and the story changes. I don't want to write a professional review  just things which i felt. First of all the side cast is amazing . They have been well chosen and do justice to their roles . The story is pretty mediocre . Aamir is fantastic as the happygolucky tourist guide and Kajol glistens as the docile  demure blind girl.There are instances of Kunal Kohli's trademark sequences like putting songs where they just aren't necessary and some elongation of scenes . But the thing that makes this movie from being a common fare to a must watch are Aamir and Kajol . Their screen presence is amazing and the chemistry they share was just too good. They are the only 2 actors who could make a simple hug look like the reunion between two lovers . The ending sequence was also brilliantly handled .There are many mixed reviews to this movie . As i normally don't like any of the Yash Raj movies  this one i found to be quite touching . I would recommend this movie just for the magic that Aamir and Kajol create on the screen.".

The movie starts off with some brilliant locales and Kajol going to Delhi for a dance program where she encounters Rehan Aamir. The sher shayari bit in the first half is really good maybe coz of the way Aamir says it .Then there's a twist in the tale just before the interval and the story changes. I don't want to write a professional review  just things which i felt. First of all the side cast is amazing . They have been well chosen and do justice to their roles . The story is pretty mediocre . Aamir is fantastic as the happygolucky tourist guide and Kajol glistens as the docile  demure blind girl.There are instances of Kunal Kohli's trademark sequences like putting songs where they just aren't necessary and some elongation of scenes . But the thing that makes this movie from being a common fare to a must watch are Aamir and Kajol . Their screen presence is amazing and the chemistry they share was just too good. They are the only 2 actors who could make a simple hug look like the reunion between two lovers . The ending sequence was also brilliantly handled .There are many mixed reviews to this movie . As i normally don't like any of the Yash Raj movies  this one i found to be quite touching . I would recommend this movie just for the magic that Aamir and Kajol create on the screen.";

	schema:reviewBody "OK.........this has been the most over rated movie of recent times.  Albeit kajol looks good and aamir is amazing as usual the kid is  really cute and the cinematography breathtaking...........but the  movie still lacks punch. I went in for the movie expecting a lot and  came out laughing because it turned out to be so predictable. The  initial bits in Delhi were very well done. The movie moves at a quick  pace and for everone who likes Delhi you'll love these parts. Aamir  unfortunately looks old and his shers get tiring after the first 5 or  so but overall it is quite enjoyable.  Just before the interval when Aamir's true identity is revealed the  movie takes a turn to the over the top main hoon na or men in black  type story line. It actually becomes quite amusing at times. As soon as  he starts looking good the story goes down the chute. Reminiscent of  behind enemy lines the snow chase sequence just didn't fit into the  movie. Being glorified as a terrorist just didn't go down too well with  me.   The saving grace in the movie and probably the only memorable scene  after the interval was the one in which they have the small antakshari  exchange and he tells her who he is.   The climax lacks impact and simply fizzles out. It was a fitting end  to a pretty much forgettable movie.   The background music was very powerful and the songs fitted quite well  into the movie. I enjoyed them a lot more than when I first listened to  them   My advisewatch the movie............only for the acting. Expect  nothing from the story and you won't be disappointed. ENJOY!!".

The movies has a very humorous start however the ending is quite sad but that was meant to be by the title of the movie Fanaa. The music was quite different and very enchanting.

Aamir Khan as Rehan was also not bad. I didn't understand the genre of this move. The first half which I guess is the Romantic part isn't that great. The film lacks reality. No girl falls in love with someone within 5 days. And that too by the sheroshairi of Aamir Khan. The second half which portraits Aamir Khan as a terrorist was horrible and is supposed to be somewhat ActionDrama genre. How many lame movies do we want with lame terrorist agencies like AntiTerrorist Agency or whatever it was hunting down a terrorist in the valleys of Kashmir. Taboo and the other guy playing the role of antiterrorist agents weren't up to mark. It was like watching a very very pathetic attempt to copy a part of 24 and CSI. The music was the only thing that I found good in the movie. The background scores and the songs were nice. it would be a better deal if u bought the audio CD than the DVD.To conclude if you haven't seen the movie yet don't get excited about it. Its nothing special. Just the usual bollywood flick with an above average script and story.".

As bollywood freak I recommend this film to all audience even to kids too. Its has huge stars and brilliant director. Kunal gave his best even more than Hum Tum. Way to go Kunal you surely winning in this year. Nominations for sure even awards too. I believe you deserve more this year than Karan Johar from KANK. The direction you made has been the best. I even liked KANK but after I saw Fanaa I think its a way different film and making its mark separate from all films from past. The direction of Kunal has been the best direction I seen so far this year. This film should win the bestplayback and direction as well. The film stars huge cast for sure. It has Rishi Kapoor whom I really adore. He is brilliant even in small role of a father. Aamir Khan is superb just superb. I can't even say in words how he gave his performance. Great comeback from KAJOL. I am a huge fan of her since I began seeing films. Kajol is the best actress ever of new generation.After K3G she has made a great come back. Her performance is just brilliant. Its just marvelous. She was truly character in the film. It for one second you can't say that she is not acting as blind. Her acting is better than Rani from black. I don't say Rani didn't act good but she was good but Kajol is the best in blind role. The film is a must see. When you think you know whats happening but the second next you don't. The dialogs are written brilliantly. The lyrics are just very touchy. The music is worth it that you can't even comment because it's from the soul. Sonu sang the song beautifully. The Tere haath main mera haath ho. This song is sang by Sonu Nigam beautifully. I think he should win awards this year from this song from Fanaa. The tittle song from Kank he also sang brilliantly but he sang this song even better. Yashraj are still ruling. Making the greatest movies. Bollywood awards sometimes are differ from our choices but if i was the jury I would the award for best director of this film. I would also give Sonu for best playback singer from Tere Haath mein Mera haath ho. I would also give the award for best story and dialogs . An excellent film. I am sure this film is getting many awards but these i mentioned I think it should be the winners. As far as acting Kajol is the best and should get an award too. Aamir is brilliant but I think Shah Rukh has acted better in KANK. Kirron Kher is in both so i can't say but she is not much in this film. I give this film 1000000 out of 1000000.".

The music of the film is great and the best song has to be 'chand sifarish' one of the best love songs you'll ever listen to.Verdict Watch it for the story Aamir and Kajol. I give it 9.510".

Yes indeed only Bollywood can do that! Eat this Hollywood! Ha! The smartest thing of the movie is the plot. Especially after the 'intermission' it just drives you through the entire movie it had me sitting up straight for the entire 1 and half hour climax filled with complete and utter dread. With smart twists and turns the writers were just able to up the ante with every other development until you just feel utterly disembowelled by tension  and still you want more.If I would recount the plot here it would sound utterly unbelievable. That's why it requires two great actors to pull it off and make it believable. And dear me do Aamir and Kajol succeed in that. Aamir who basically has three main developments to play from Romeo to terrorist to father succeeds mightily but in my mind is even bested by Kajol she also has three developments to play from alltooinnocent Juliet to mother to patriot  and combine these descriptions and you've guessed the gist of the plot but does that so incredibly well it's just..wow. And moreover there is her eyes. As someone here said above she can cry just so gutwrenchely you indeed feel to turn your eyes away to allow her some privacy in her grief. It seems at times as if the entire tragedy is completely locked in her eyes. Really good.So. I don't have anything negative to say about this movie  alright if I have to the intelligence officer lady is just completely unbelievable. She looks like she ran away straight from some bad American forensic psychiatry series you know the ones where there's a woman playing the lead who is out there to understand the minds of psychopaths and always gets just the right clues after too much empathy and too little hard thinking. I don't know what the current series of choice for that particular genre is now it used to be Profiler.These and other possible flaws are way overcome by the massively riveting plot and the impressively admirable job by Aamir and Kajol. Once again Eat this Hollywood! Ha!".

	schema:headline " A tale of two stars";
	schema:reviewBody "Kunal Kohli's a lucky man. Yes clever too. On third thoughts maybe a tad adventurous. Certainly a big Bollywood buff. And of course a man with a big heart. He's managed to pluck out the two brightest stars from the Mumbai sky and light up theaters warming the hearts of hum and tum.His constellation may not have been that well constructed. The Fanaa script has dollops of the two elements they ask you to avoid at screen writing schools  convenience and coincidence. The loopholes in the storyline are large enough for King Kong to slip through.Then there's that eternal yearning to stir up a Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. The momanddaughter machination of a dream man  the unseen unheard type. Then friends who dutifully oppose and then support the pending affair to remember. And even the great train finale by which producer Adi Chopra celebrates the DDLJ hangover and has one of the friends squeal Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Ja Raha Hai But hang on! We aren't even halfway through this threehour epic tale of emotions. Let's clear the bit about SMS spoilers here. If you haven't seen the film yet or heard from a friend who has well as Al Jolson said in the first ever talkie Jazz Singer you ain't seen nothing yet. The mobile hoaxes are just that  hoaxes. And Kajol is blind  at least for a good part of the film.The twist in the tale is nice and its repercussions even better. The motivation behind the terrorism and the science behind ophthalmology are not clearly laid out. But then isn't it evident that Kunal hasn't set out to make a Dil Se or a Black where the ground realities of terrorist takes and physical challenges were integral to the plot? Fanaa is a love story where two people's lives come together drift apart and cross again by chance thus reviving the pangs the pains the pleasures and even the politics of romance.And what two people they are! For the first time Aamir Khan is less a character and more a star. But that is not necessarily bad news. Because as he drifts through the many shades of his role you can see flashes of Rang De's DJ touches of Dil Chahta Hai's Akash and glimpses of Raja Hindustani's Raja. Here is a star who's reaping the rewards of having been honest to every character he's played on celluloid. So even if Rehaan's character graph resembles the heartbeat of a chronic cardiac patient Aamir brings to it a conviction only he can.And what does one say about Kajol? What does one say about an actress who has turned time back to orchestrate the most remarkable comeback on the Bollywood silver screen? What does one say when breathtaking beauty competes with heartfelt histrionics within the same framework? For those who have been writing off the AamirKajol chemistry as thanda they either need retinal replacements or are so hung up on the SRKKajol combo that they do not want Bollywood history to be rewritten. And that's exactly what Fanaa does. From the time Aamir's Rehaan Guide chances upon Kajol's meandering Zooni at the Delhi bus stand it's protons and electrons at play. He asks Andhi hai kya? and she retorts Haan dikhta nahin kya? and countless dils go hmmm...The sparks have a lot to do with the great cinematographic ploy of playing on Zooni's blindness. Since she can't see Aamir lets his piercing gaze rest unabashedly on Kajol's and she in turn keeps looking to the right or left of the camera revealing threequarter of her face which is easily the angle she looks best in.And that's not the only magic wand Ravi K. Chandran has waved. An absolute contrast to the stark lighting of Black the film is a riot of colors in the first half which then leads to lots of browns greens and greys in the more grim second half. The three love songs  Chand sifarish in and around the forts of Delhi Dekho na in the rains and Mere hath mein in a Kashmir setting  are so beautifully canned that it would have done Christopher Doyle In the Mood for Love and 2046 proud.Look out for the scene towards the end where Aamir and Kajol are standing on a balcony and the frame is lit up just by the expanse of snow outside and the full moon in the dark sky. Also the skiandshoot action sequence is almost Bondlike.But then again nothing shines more bright and nothing looks more gorgeous than the lead pair. Fanaa is not about Rehaan and Zooni. The film has nothing to do with a blind girl and a Kashmiri terrorist. Fanaa is about Aamir and Kajol. It is about every movie that Aamir and Kajol acted in. It is about every character that they ever played. They all come together for this one grand waltz in the psyche of a Bollywood fan and makes Fanaa every bit the blockbuster it is.".

Beyond the nihilistic content which has been well documented elsewhere the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washedout faded film stock using primarily static cameras long shots choppy editing and very few cutaways SALO has a visual style reminiscent of cinemaverite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music piano dirges and the intentionally? scrappy postdubbed dialogue and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. SALO comes across as one long primal scream of rage designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency and in this respect the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once or indeed for 'entertainment' is another matter but SALO is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.".

The problem with most movies is that violence is not portrayed violent enough horror isn't portrayed horrible enough. Most 'thriller' films have these ingredients softened so that people can enjoy it and THAT'S sick. This movie is SANE. It shows horror and violence as it IS  totally revolting and disgusting.I sat as on needles for 1 hour 40 minutes and felt really bad watching this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Salo the final film by Pasolini is far and away the most affecting film I've ever seen of it's type. The images that it shows will stay with every viewer forever they are unforgettable. Yet you will wish you could forget them.The film is about a group of rich Fascists during WWIINazi Occupied Italy where they kidnap a group of 18 youngsters allowing only physically perfect specimins to stay and subject them to various forms of mental physical and sexual torture over the next 120 Days. The torture starts off in a sexual natureSodomy rape humiliation and so on and slowly degrades and descends into mental and physical torture. Just when you think what you are seeing can't get worse it does tenfold.What makes Salo so brutally shocking and disturbing is its uncompromised and blunt way of showing the acts of horror. It is a very quiet and slow film mostly shot using static and still cameras it feels more like a documentary than a fictional film. It's clear upon viewing that Pasolini wanted to remind us all that violence should not be entertainment. As such every act of violence and degredation is drained of all its possible energy and excitement and shown in a sad painful light. Nothing is sugar coated nothing is softened. This film is an attack on our desensitized feelings towards violence. Yet at the same time the film purposely desensitizes us to certain acts  Such as rape. We see it so much during the film that it becomes normality to us we barely raise an eyebrow. Upon realizing this one also realizes how the horrible acts shown in the film are possible and it's a terrible realization.Salo continues to descend until at the end when we are taken to the punishing grounds where various rule breakers are tortured and murdered. This final sequence is the most harrowing and effective I've ever seen in a film. As the victims are tortured and murdered each one of the fascist rulers take turns as voyer watching from a second story window far enough away to not hear the screams of terror and pain. And we watch with him. The film attempts to equate our viewing of this film to their viewing of the executions after all we're watching these acts for entertainment just as he is. And we distance ourselves from the acts in order to enjoy them as he does by watching through binoculars far away. It's a savage and truthful attack one that is impossible to deny. Also incredibly unsettling is the inherent joy that the villains Heroes? feel at their victims pain sadness and discomfort. Sometimes even to the point of sexual arousal. There is a scene where a girl is crying because her mother died trying to save her from these people. She is completely naked as she weeps to us she's the picture of vulnerability and sadness to the fascists it's the most exciting thing they've seen all day. The fascists all stand and watch her weep with the utmost sexualexcitement. It is terrifying. It's scenes like these that set Salo apart from other gross out movies. Some of the most affecting and frightening scenes are ones where there is quiet watching the expressions and reactions of people to the various horrible acts. Salo is a film of rage and sadness. It is a film that asks you to hate humanity to hate what we're capable of to look in the mirror and hate yourself. Then weep because nothing can be done about it. Nothing will ever change..".

This was Pasolini's last and going by what I've seen his vision only became bleaker and more disturbed as the years clawed along. Using the Marquis de Sade's ideas on the decadence of 18th century France Pasolini represents Fascist Italy 194445. We are shown the upper class  always removed and protected from the outer world  as predators of the poor weak young and less educated. A group of wealthy adults shop amongst the kidnapped older children of bourgeoisie. They choose eighteen and steal them away to a hidden mansion where there is no escape. There the adults live out every twisted fantasy they've ever had or can now muster while demeaning raping and torturing the youngsters. The teens react in many ways none of which are pretty. This entire film experience MUST be viewed as a symbolic emotional explanation of what it was like to live under NaziFascist rule in this case and how an otherwise normal decent society could be turned into lunatics and subanimals. Although made 30 years ago with the usual weaker production qualities of that era I cannot think of another work which so blatantly and painfully illustrates what those in power are capable of doing when boredom gives rein to impulse. In comparison Lord of the Flies barely lights upon these issues Pink Flamingos was but a tiny kitschy springboard and Schindler's List described a much narrower range of degradation. To this day Salo  is banned in some countries. This is NOT a film about acting lighting sound camera work etc.. This is a film about states of mind  theirs then ours now. P.S. If you are interested in set design this one is FILLED with original CubistBauhausFuturistModerne furnishings murals and art. Spectacular. Those styles were not yet being reproduced so Pasolini used the real thing. There is also an interesting use of a Charles Rennie MacIntosh chairwhich will alter how you see this design from here on out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the depraved nature of this film a 10 rating may seem a touch high. To be certain the film has it's share of disgusting moments yet those are not the core of the film. The central soul of this movie is the overriding sense of hopelessness. I would call it Schiendler's List's evil little brother.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film late one night after my parents were in bed and for a while it was merely uncomfortable to sit through. The actors weren't particularly emotional the sets weren't hugely exciting and the storyline consisted of four libertines and their accomplices listening to dirty stories and doing dirty things to their child victims.And yet halfway through this blas piece I began crying. It was I believe at a part where the whore was telling one her sick stories while dancing with the libertine and she begins laughing as if it is the funniest thing in the world. And yet the laugh sounds falsenot just false but hopeless. I cried off and on though more on than off the rest of the film and from now on I cannot think about Salo without tearing up I am trying not to cry even as I write this.What makes Salo the most disturbing film I have ever watched no competition? It is not the acts depictedthe coprophilia the torture the murder the betrayal. It is that supreme and utter hopelessness behind the whore's laugh. It is the insatiable desires of the libertines constantly fed and yet never quenched. It is the victims who are willing to sell each other out in order to escape just a little bit more torture before their inevitable death.The novel described the four libertines as being people who not only did as much evil as they possibly could but also as people who went out of their way to avoid doing anything virtuous. Pier Paolo Pasolini has extended this bleak outlook to the entire human race. The entire film is soaked with his utter hatred and disgust for humanitynobody in this film has a redeeming side not even the victims. Everyone in this film is going to dieeven the libertines sometime after the film comes to its conclusion are going to be tried for war crimes as part of the Fascist regime. Pasolini paints a portrait of the human race as a race that is wallowing in the lowest depths of misery as it drags itself towards its own demise.There is no moral to this story. Pasolini figures that the human race will merely ignore the moral if he tries to give one. Neither does he try to spruce up this film with interesting acting or camerawork. The direction is bland and the cinematography is largely staticand therein lies its greatest or is it its worst? talent. It is as if Pasolini is looking up at the human race from behind the camera his face gaunt and hopeless considering the various ways to spice up the scene before saying Why bother? You are worthless this film will not satisfy your desires whatever they may be.Which leads me to one last question how the heck did I give this 10 stars? And how the heck can I possibly recommend it to any of you? It was upsetting disturbing and appalling. And yet it has changed my lifefor the better? For the worse? Does is crush my hopes for humanity or does it give me an understanding of its darkest facets and how best to avoid them? Look people I don't rightly know! I'm still figuring it out!To most of you stay the heck away from this film. But to a few of youa very very fewthose few that want to see this movie for more than its shock value those few that are willing to explore humanity's darkest recesses those few that are not mainstream moviegoers and are actually willing to thinkI recommend no I BEG you to watch Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom.

If you haven't seen Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo you are wrong. Pasolini didn't even live to see the film widelyreleasedhe was murdered by a malehustler or so the officialstory plays. Pier Pasolini was the mostimportant postwar intellectual in Italy period. Like a Renaissance polymath he was adept at journalism the novel poetry screen writing directing motionpictures and more. His revolutionaryphilosophy was against fascism and communism and he had many enemies in the politicalarena as well as the religious. Allsaid however it's likely that Pier Pasolini was murdered by a rightwing assassinationteam under the aegis of gladio a NATO program of secretarmies through Western Europe. Gladio began ostensibly as a defenseagainst a hypothetical Sovietinvasion of Europe but was used to attack legitimate Leftist politicalparties and groups. The Red Brigade bombings in the 1970s were even instigatedby gladiooperatives to justify a lawandorder crackdown of the Italian Communist Partyit is a mystery as to howmuch CIAinfluence this all had. The P2 conspiracy oddly involving the Vatican the CIA KGB and renegade Freemasons! had yettobreak. There were dozens of politicallymotivated killings in 1970sItaly and Pasolini's was oneofmany. One has to wonder howmuch involvement the Vatican had in his murder as well.And so Salo enters this bloodyfray. It could not be any more controversial on allfronts and is a shoutofrage against how little we all care about humanlife itself. Pasolini was outraged and disappointed with the humancondition and Italian politics had become chaosleading Sergio Leone to remark at the time that Italian politics have become ridiculous. The scenario of Salo is fairlysimple a group of Italianfascists retreat to a palace in Northern Italy where there was a greatdeal of support for Italian fascism and the Monarch with a group of sixteen boys and girls. It is the shortlived Republic of Salo hence the title that any Italian of the 1970s would recognize. For 120days they degrade them in almost everyimaginableway. Gayrape buggery forcing people to eatexcrement and finally death. Of course it's all basedloosely on DeSade's tale and stays prettyclosely to the text's themes and scenarios. He chapters each section with some of the structure of Dante's Inferno which is genius. To say this film is merely a statement on fascism would be wrong it is a manifesto on what cruelty rests within all humanhearts. Pasolini understood that under the rightcircumstances we are all capable of these depredations. Some reviewers have stated they didn't find the film shockingthey should checkthemselves into a clinic somewhere. I've noticed that even friends who are into such directors as Takashi Miike respect the power of this film. Miike has some similaritiesinstyle with Pasolini but goes for a more genre stylizedlook. Even John Waters lists this film as sicker than his worstoffenders! To say I was shocked would be an understatement.Besides being pretty sick this film looks prettygood. The late Tonnino Colli's who also workedfor Fellini and Leone photography lends the film a look that could be hung in the Louvre and it gives the film a greater subversiveedge. It should be noted that the film is not legitimatelyavailable in the United State for copyright reasons. However there are verygood copies outthere since it is not inprint. I found one that is an exactduplicate of the original USedition for a decentprice so it is out there with some searching. The Criterion edition is reportedly the mostexpensive DVD in the world going for asmuch as 600.00 USD. Criterion's is the besttransfer we have todate. I've got a few Ken Russell DVDs Salome's Last Dancethat are worth asmuch as 300.00 USD so this is a shocker! It's funny to see used DVDs of the big Hollywoodfare at 3.99 USD while these are inthehundreds! It saysalot about what is lasting and meaningful to people and it ain't blockbuster movies. A company called Water Bearer has sets of Pasolini's other works but I have it on goodword that they are inferiorquality. It would be nice if Criterion did a Pasolini Box that included a newertransfer of Salo with restoration. It is one of the mostimportant films ever made. We all standaccused even the filmmaker and that's the point.

In making what will remain one of the darkest and most vicious films ever made Pasolini's bleak vision at the time of this films production in 1975  wanted to make the point that we are not free. We are limited by social  restraints and political conditioning which makes us no better than the victims in this  powerful shattering cinema experience. That Pasolini was murdered by a male hustler in JFKworthy circumstances  before he had time to  utterly complete and polish the film   is an apt reminder of the forces of censorship and their merciless cruel satisfaction in maintaining blank and reprehensible silences.I refuse to join in the disinfecting and antiseptic treatments that people calling themselves supporters have applied to this film.  There are moments of eroticism beauty and even dark humour in this film and those who seek to castrate and deny Pasolini  his humanity and complexity by pretending otherwise are naive if not duplicitous with those who placed this film in the category of banned in Australia.  To deny Pasolini  the distinction of having created a multiple difficult film with various levels of engagement is to reduce his profound legacy.Pasolini made this film to make people think hard and harshly  and to contemplate themselves.  The darkness of the cinema is part of that indictment and denying Pasolini this space for his film is pure evil. He was a disgusted and angry man and this film shares the passions disapointments and loves of Pasolini. He wanted to change things.  To help people. To provoke and make us ponder and contemplate ideas and arguments.  That some will not is no revelation. But this is not some far off  distant story  Salo is a political electric shock  treatment as relevant today and tommorrow as upon its initial release or nonrelease as may be the case. Its his most lavish and grand film and also his most  personal.  Throughout the film we are reminded that this microcosm of society implicates us  our surveillance of the events in this film is an act of violence and violation. Words are weapons wielded by the Duke and his merry bandits as they systematically annihilate the young people under their pointless control.Pasolini is throwing Salo at us with the pride and courage of  a protestor throwing excrement at a politician. This film is a political act. Australia is as dangerous  a country as those  demonised  foreign countries with more extreme  exploitable examples of political censorship.  Thankfully this film is available in Australia from certain sources but it remains denied its rightful place in the cinema theatre and  general legal release. But at least it can still be seen. The resistance continues.  Like the young man who raises his arm in salute against his captors in Salo in the most dire and deadly circumstances. I do the same to Pasolini in less deadly but no less dire circumstance.  To one of our greatest modern philosophers and visionaries Pier Paolo Pasolini we should be truly thankful.".

There are moments of eroticism beauty and even dark humour in this film and those who seek to castrate and deny Pasolini  his humanity and complexity by pretending otherwise are naive if not duplicitous with those who placed this film in the category of banned in Australia.  To deny Pasolini  the distinction of having created a multiple difficult film with various levels of engagement is to reduce his profound legacy.Pasolini made this film to make people think hard and harshly  and to contemplate themselves.  The darkness of the cinema is part of that indictment and denying Pasolini this space for his film is pure evil. He was a disgusted and angry man and this film shares the passions disapointments and loves of Pasolini. He wanted to change things.  To help people. To provoke and make us ponder and contemplate ideas and arguments.  That some will not is no revelation. But this is not some far off  distant story  Salo is a political electric shock  treatment as relevant today and tommorrow as upon its initial release or nonrelease as may be the case. Its his most lavish and grand film and also his most  personal.  Throughout the film we are reminded that this microcosm of society implicates us  our surveillance of the events in this film is an act of violence and violation. Words are weapons wielded by the Duke and his merry bandits as they systematically annihilate the young people under their pointless control.Pasolini is throwing Salo at us with the pride and courage of  a protestor throwing excrement at a politician. This film is a political act. Australia is as dangerous  a country as those  demonised  foreign countries with more extreme  exploitable examples of political censorship.  Thankfully this film is available in Australia from certain sources but it remains denied its rightful place in the cinema theatre and  general legal release. But at least it can still be seen. The resistance continues.  Like the young man who raises his arm in salute against his captors in Salo in the most dire and deadly circumstances. I do the same to Pasolini in less deadly but no less dire circumstance.  To one of our greatest modern philosophers and visionaries Pier Paolo Pasolini we should be truly thankful.";

It is also the biggest pitfall of Salo.  It could have been a far greater and much more powerful film if Pasolini allowed at least a single slightest ray of light into the infinitely pessimistic philosophy that he portrays here.However the way it ended up was as a cry that human kindness does not exist which pretty much was how it was intended after all.  In the final scene he states that the viewer has every bit of potential to be just as evil and predatory as the four fascists in this movie.  A very powerful and thoughtful statement actually one that any human being should not deny.In the end this is a very intelligent and disturbing motion picture one that forces the viewer to think.

Many reviewers have commented that this movie is powerful and that everyone should see it because it gives you access to true feelings of disgust and guilt about man's inhumanity to man especially during times of anarchistic despotic or fascist rule.  If you need this movie to understand how terrible the crimes visited on people by the fascists Nazi and otherwise during WWII were then Pasolini's only success is that he has demonstrated just how sick and desensitized our global society has become.Stark brutality has its value as a tool for demonstrating the full force of certain horrible events.  This tool was used effectively in other WWII films around the same subject Schindler's List comes to mind.  The problem with this film is that this tool has to be accompanied by real emotion and demonstration of the effect of that brutality.  The only emotion other than pure physical pain demonstrated by the adolescents in this movie is during one scene where a young abductee cries at being reminded of the death of her mother.  Aside from that the victims walk through this movie like zombies as various disgusting acts are perpetrated upon them.  There is no emotion and frankly the movie is an extremely boring series of repetitive acts of violence and humiliation that are reputedly designed to demonstrate the horror of unchecked power.  The truth is this is a dull expose on the acts of several bored wealthy powerful members of society who can no longer find stimulation in the banal trappings of every day life just like the book it is based on.  The truth is this movie has NOTHING to do with the horrors of fascism it just happens that Pasolini chose a setting he knew well.  There is no reason that this same exact movie could not be shot in a palace in the Middle East a castle in Austria a Villa in Latin America or a mansion in the USA and be just as realistic.  It is nothing more than a dull comment on the depravity of the rich and bored.  Don't be drawn in by the mystery and the hushed tones that people use when they speak of this socalled Masterpiece.  And if you are a DVD owner don't be fooled by the fact that Criterion wasted their time with this banal piece of AntiIntellectual trash.".

Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom is probably the most widely excoriated movie of all time but once you see it you realize that Piero Paolo Pasolini has fashioned a daring and disturbing vision of humanity's innate capacity for evil. I've never understood why so many writers and philosophers have made a cult of the Marquis de Sade. It's important to realize that Pasolini's take on the story is completely in opposition to Sade instead of glorifying his aristocratic degenerates he portrays them as callous hypocritical sycophants of fascism whose atrocities are all too plausible in the context of the regime they serve. The notorious manureeating scene while hard to watch was necessary to drive home the point of just how contemptible these monsters are. Much has been written about the disturbing passivity of the victims but it's obvious the young men and women are terrified and with good reason. Rape is an act of violence not sex and the abuses perpetrated here have little to do with real eroticism interestingly any consensual sexual activity among the prisoners is punished with death. Although set in fascist Italy during World War II the story could just as well be taking place in Bosnia Rwanda Cambodia . . . or Iraq for that matter. This film is a cautionary tale about what happens when people forfeit their humanity in service to a corrupt regime. As if to underscore his point Pasolini's characters frequently quote Nietzsche the philosopher who did the most to spread Sade's gospel of evil throughout the world during the final tortureexecution scene we hear a radio broadcast of poetry by Ezra Pound an American poet and willing accomplice in fascism. That Nietzsche and Pound still enjoy any legitimacy in academic circles shows how desperately we need this movie. The final tortureexecution scene though horrific is filmed as seen from binoculars which distants it and makes it somewhat more bearable. I don't think Pasolini was indulging in obscenity for its own sake the violence though brutal is not notably more explicit than what goes on in most contemporary slasher films. Interestingly though Pasolini was gay this film does not portray male homosexuality in a positive light. There's something in Salo to disturb engage and enrage everyone no matter their ideology. Perhaps that's a good thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly 30 years after its release 'Sal' continues to enjoy if that is the word I want a reputation as a pinnacle of depravity and thus draws to it both the bloodlusting 'Mondo Cane' crowd simply interested in being shocked for its own sake and fans of shock auteurs like Von Trier Cronenberg Greenaway et al. who like to look for beauty beneath grotesque surfaces. But both types of viewers will be disappointed to find that the most shocking thing about 'Sal' is how dull it is. Can this film really have raised eyebrows that much in the postWarhol postWaters seventies? Today its parade of filth and violence actually seems rather tame. You need to have the stomach for it but it's hardly mindblowingly horrible.So having dealt with 'Sal's' shock elements I would now move on to its artistic qualities only there really aren't any. Pasolini's technique is hamfisted here reminding one even more of Doris Wishman than of WarholMorrissey or Waters and the content consists of a single thesis statement 'Fascism is bad'. Hardly an idea anybody would argue with but not exactly profound either. Even as propaganda it's extremely weaknever elaborated in particularly imaginative or interesting or convincing ways. It's like one panel of a nonetoointelligent political cartoon stretched very thin over a twohour period. Well here's another rape . . . oh look some shteating . . . well more torture.

But both types of viewers will be disappointed to find that the most shocking thing about 'Sal' is how dull it is.

	schema:reviewBody "So where do I even begin on one of the most controversial movies of all time? I guess that's why I felt that I had to see Salo I was very curious. I like to challenge myself when it comes to film and test my limits. When I watched the film Cannibal Holocaust as disturbing as it was it had a meaning to it that I really admired. Salo is looked at either as the worst film that you could possibly see or a masterpiece. Before watching the film I read a couple of Pier Paolo Pasolini's poems online as he is praised for his writing and I have to say that I was in awe. What a soul this man had and I couldn't wait to see Salo. Well if there was a film ever to test my limits on what I could handle Salo sure did a good job of testing my gag reflex.Four men of power the Duke the Bishop the Magistrate and the President agree to marry each other's daughters as the first step in a debauched ritual. With the aid of several collaborating young men they kidnap 9 young men and 9 women and take them to a palace. Accompanying them are four middleaged prostitutes whose function in the debauchery will be to recount erotically arousing stories for the men of power who in turn will sadistically exploit their victims. The story depicts some of the many days at the palace during which the four men of power devise increasingly abhorrent tortures and humiliations for their own pleasure. In 120 days the children experience sheer horror and never ending torture that you would never wish upon anyone.So the question is is this garbage or a masterpiece? I'm honestly not sure the way the film is shot is just perfect. It really has this cold feeling to it and almost empty. The acting is also pretty good and your heart is in agony for these children as they are pit against these sadists. They are put through every kind of torture that you can imagine and never wish upon your worst enemy. They are forced into sexual acts to eat human feceswhich looks too real that you will be disturbed get beaten and don't know what will happen the next day if they will be let go or be put to execution. You could never imagine or at least want to imagine what they are going through and the terror they must have felt every day.The bad about this film is that maybe it does go too far. I am all for freedom of speech and I totally get why the director wanted to show it we wouldn't have as much sympathy for the teens. However it makes you wonder how far he would go for the sake of art. No one ever said that art was safe but this was really pushing on what your eyes could handle. Also the scenes where the prostitutes were talking about their childhood experiences all going into detail of every sexual moment did drag on quite a bit and while the subject was risky the whole film plays up that you're waiting for the bad to happen. So there are times where it does feel a bit slow paced. Wither to recommend this film to you is a hard oneI know that I'm going to have a hard tie if I ever watch it again it's all in the eye of the beholder. But be warned I can handle a lot of movies this one definitely did get to me.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Pasolini made it quite clear in several texts that this is not an antifascist film but rather that fascism is a symbol for something far more pervasive. He ultimately saw himself as a committed director and thus all of his historical films are about the present and this film was made in the 70's not in the 40's. It is rather an antibourgeois film. Pasolini's political enemies at the time were not fascists at all but the Christian Democrats...Furthermore it is NOT a defense of Sade but an apology for his earlier writings and films which mythicized acts of violence and glorified them as the pure unconscious preverbal expression of the subproletariat. However Pasolini saw the riots of the bourgeois students in 1968 as nihilistic acts of revolt not revolutiona revolt of the Bourgeoise against itself as his poetry makes clear. He watched in horror as he saw his vision of true revolution twisted into a childish and merely destructive tantrum against the previous generation. And so it is the Bourgeoise symbolized by Fascism which he represents and condemns in Salo in the guise of what he considered to be a medieval morality play. And it is in this context that he apologizes for having made statements like Only a bloodbath can save the world 1962 which is quoted in the film. Yet like everything else it has been appropriated by the bourgeoise who misinterpret it first as Nietzsche then as St. Paul until it gets reduced to a merely absurdist Dada interpretation. The characters are continually misinterpreting the many structuralist citations because they have no history. History has been destroyed and thus Pasolini is trying to reintroduce it in the film. The revolution by 1968 was impossible as there was nobody left to fight it. The bourgeoise Pasolini lamented had subsumed everything into itselfthere was no other only a technological godlike and allinclusive power structure. But what is most shocking is that it is the Sadean libertarianism and the permissivness of that class that Pasolini finds most disturbing. He held that the permissiveness of the anarchy of power was more tyrannical than repression. He was most traumitized oddly by the increasing tolerance of homosexuals. And so truely Pasolini takes the side of Dante not Sade. And finally its ultimately a film about misinterpretation. What the characters say and what they do as in Sade are incongruent. He knew that he was to be misunderstood by his Bourgeois audience as it misunderstood itself Pasolini said that it was intrinsic that Salo remain enigmatic on the model of Dante and this is the film's real genius. Judging by most of these reviews Pasolini made his point.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is Pier Paolo Pasolini's testament. It has not aged one iota and is even probably better now than it used to be. The first strong element is that it has to do with sex the body and the use of the body for all kinds of sexual activities and pleasures. But onanism is out. Sex is always an activity that connects at least two people more often than less a lot more than two if you include the voyeurs. The film is turning our voyeurism into a saturated mental ability though strangely enough the film remains extremely prudish as for actually showing the sexual intercourse and the torturing that is to come sooner or later. In fact when he wants for us to  see  the men with erections he keeps them trousered so that you can only see a form which is not an organ per se. Only one erection is really shown but because it is the slave who has an erection after having given anal sex to his master and torturer turned here into the dominated partner. This erection is not like in all other draped or wrapped up cases the evidence of the pleasure of some men in front of some humiliation imposed to other boys and girls hence a sadistic though passive pleasure. In this case it is the domination of the master by the slave who could have strangled him in a couple of minutes and didn't because he does not need to rebel  he has already conquered real power over the master for conquering his backside. In other words Pasolini still plays a tremendous lot with our voyeurism by not showing the real thing but still keeping the act itself covered up dissimulated hidden. Note this dimension of seeing the physical excitement of the young boys and girls strutting in front of us in the nude and quasinude on the screen is only possible with the boys for very organic reasons. But the second level of the film is the political fable or parable. Yes fascism is tremendously present in our consciousness and life. But probably not this kind of fascism which is to alienate a human being to the point when he has lost all existence in society and thus can become raw material with which you can play at leisure in three stages  passions excrements and fatal suffering. Note the passions are those of the masters imposed onto the slaves who are shown as mostly moving along and even getting into the game with quite a lot of willingness. There are many slaves who are happy in the society that makes them slaves. Note the excrements can come from anywhere and it is a pleasure for the masters to eat them and to impose their being eaten to the slaves and here again maybe in a more difficult way some slaves take to it clearly this time in some kind of resilient desire to survive if it requires such a drastic diet. It is true that a kiss of two male mouths that have both eaten some feces has some kind of a pungent taste and even attractiveness in its very kinkiness. Note fatal suffering torturing someone to death is this time definitely one way  the masters are torturing some of the slaves and using the others to help them achieve their pleasure. This time you find out that some will be totally willing to take part in the torture of another one if it enables them to avoid the torture for themselves. This is definitely a heritage from the Shoah and how the Nazis had managed to make prisoners their ancillary servants in the very task of eliminating them all. It is by the way the only reason why there were some survivors. Among slaves there will always be some who will collaborate with the masters even in the torturing and killing of the others provided it protects them from the same fate or at least pushes that fate slightly forward into the future. There Pasolini becomes prophetic. And when the film stops on two surviving fifteen year old boys dancing together on some American sounding music and exchanging the names of their girlfriends we have a sad gospel about the true nature of humanity. Domination power cruelty brutality are one side of all human beings. This side will be dominant as soon as circumstances permit. Then the majority who will be deprived of this power will divide easily between those who will collaborate to survive a little bit longer and those who will not or will be chosen not to resist at all and will become the raw material of the desires of the powerful. So these boys and girls will not sound or look as what their age should make them sound and look. They will have been transformed in our consciousness into some kind of lurking monsters who are roaming in the back of each man's skull and definitely on the retinas of all our eyes. We are all ready to accept suffering if it means pleasure and we are all ready to inflict suffering and death to others because it will mean pleasure for us. Pasolini had a tremendously sombre vision of humanity and it is a good thing this film has come back to life after nearly thirty years of clandestinity.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University of Paris Dauphine  University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne".

The story along with the atmosphere is fantastic beautiful locations the acting is quite good and most of all the directing is superb. For a debut and a limited budget the director Christoph Gans brotherhood of wolf made something no one could expect. The story is put on the screen driven by first class camera work and effects varied with the most stylish action scenes ever made. Beautiful details special moves original killings and many slow motion gunbattlesalso in a original style makes every actionfan happy during the entire movie. If you don't like the story witch would be surprising you certainly wanna watch this beauty for the actionscenes alone. Christophe Gans takes obviously his influence by directors like john woo but does this without copying and manages to create a style of his own. He's one of the greatest. Personally i think it's better than the matrix because it's not so excessively and farfetched makes the action more real. In fact its actually wrong to compare it with the matrix it's a totally different movie. It's more right to compare it with movies like the killer john woo for example. For me this movie is on my alltime favourite list and the director has a place in my heart like robert rodriuegez Tarantino john woo johnnie to... Bottom line If you like nonusual actionmovies that try to be something special with a little more storyline and competent actors andor action packed movies with loads of original and impressive shootouts this is your thing no doubt!".

Marc Dacascos is an acknowledged martial artist and acrobat which adds only to the credentials he brings to the movie. Of course as all avid manga watchers will know there is always a perverted dimension to the Manga movies.

When he is seen doing a kill by artist Emu O'Hara he is forced by his employers to return to kill her.  With the police expecting him and other gangs hunting him for revenge Freeman returns to find that love has grown between him and Emu and he doesn't kill her.I have waited years for this to come onto TV and have stood many times in a video store with a 20 dvd of it in my hand wondering if I should just buy it.  As a fan of Dacascos I wanted to see anything with him in it but having seen it I'm glad I didn't sell out the money for it.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it but it could have been a little better.  Based on the magna series this film has respect for the source material and told the story well at least I thought so as an uninitiated.  The story may not stand up under great thought but it is good enough for this type of film.The direction is excellent and the film is really stylish using the slow motion that at the time wasn't the toast of the town in Western cinema yet.  The weakness the film has is in the action it is good but I didn't feel there was ever a time when it really let rip and became visually stunning or overly impressive.  Considering how able Dacascos is at martial arts it was a shame he didn't have one major fight to really shine on. However like I said the action is still pretty stylish and enjoyable.This was the time when it looked like Dacascos would rise up to take over from more established Western action stars but sadly it doesn't seem to have happened.  Here he has to hide his natural charisma which hampers him a little but he is still a very watchable presence on screen and he is good in the lead.  The support cast ably hold him up and features quite a few well known faces including Chong Karyo Kato and Mann.  The main casting weakness is Condra who I didn't think a great deal of to be honest.  Her narration is droning and bland and her character is not really developed in any way.Despite the weaknesses though this was a good martial arts movie which benefits from having a classy feel to it and a strong source material to fall back on.  It lacks the punch of a balls out' action movie but is still enjoyable.  Could have done with a bit more heart but stands out as a classy martial arts movie.".

As he risks his life in a bloody battle for leadership and respect a beautiful woman falls in love with him offering her help.First I want to note that Crying Freeman is one of the most beautiful action movies ever shot. It's not the gunshots that make it attractive. It's not the experimental directing style that provokes your curiosity. It's the lightly rhythmical plot development. There are a couple of very beautiful shots that you'll never find in a Steven Segal film. The creators show how much they care about that story which is based on anime series. I always like movies that are made out of artistic passion and love for the particular genre.Crying Freeman unlike most 90s boomboom flicks tells a story about honor and human will. Freeman is a perfectly shaped character quite likable although he is not the guy who saved the world. Silent and prepared dangerous and wise. I never asked for such things before watching the movie and I am sure nobody has. Maybe that is why I loved it.It's the depth of the story that made the movie very different for me. This is arguably one of a kind film that depends on its own style. Crying Freeman is almost modest and unambitious which is something I personally haven't seen in the past couple of year. Christophe Gans's movie promises to remain a classic if future generations manage to look through its soul.Of course comments about the cast could hardly be made. Due to realism purposes the creators have gathered a cast of almost unknown performers who do their best and in my opinion succeed delivering good performances.The bad points are almost imperceptible. I kinda disliked how some scenes are way too dark. I've always hated that in movies. Yes it is more authentic but you can easily miss a character being killed or something like that. I had hard times recognizing the villains in the third act because some of them are killed in the first half on the movie.Crying Freeman makes us realize we were in a big mistake. There are action movies about moral values.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movie Review Crying Freeman 1995Directed by Christopher Gans Brotherhood of the Wolf Crying Freeman was the first liveaction manga movie in history.The seminal martial artist Mark Dacascos Drive and Brotherhood of the Wolf stars as Yo Hinimura the latest in a line of executioners of the Sons of the Dragons' an ancient Chinese group originally founded to protect the Chinese people from danger and injustice and still in practice today.On one job when he is sent to kill the son of the leader of one of the Yakuza clans a beautiful artist painting the landscape sees him skilfully executing the man and his bodyguards. Seeing him shedding tears after killing them instead of being afraid she is captivated and drawn towards him. However seconds after introducing himself he disappears.According to the laws of the Sons of the Dragons since she has seen his face she must be killed. But when Yo Hinimura the freeman cannot bring himself to kill her they soon find themselves under fire from the Yakuza the police and even the Sons of the Dragons.Crying Freeman delivers excellent action set pieces as well as solid drama but there are a few flaws. The director Gans often overuses slow motion in the action scenes which quickly becomes repetitive and detracts from the otherwise excellent action. Also aside from Dacascos who plays the character of Hinimura to perfection the acting is occasionally mediocre and lacking emotion. In addition Dacascos one of the best martial artists in the world is not given little chance to shine although this is understandable as why would an assassin resort to handtohand combat when he has firearms and blades at his disposal.Overall Crying Freeman is an abovepar movie. The HongKong style action is very entertaining and while the plot is neither original nor outstanding it is still enjoyable. Although Gans later went on to make another movie with Dacascos Brotherhood of the Wolf which is more polished has a budget about ten times larger and showcases Dacascos' skills as a martial artist much better Crying Freeman is still definitely worth watching.710".

However seconds after introducing himself he disappears.According to the laws of the Sons of the Dragons since she has seen his face she must be killed. But when Yo Hinimura the freeman cannot bring himself to kill her they soon find themselves under fire from the Yakuza the police and even the Sons of the Dragons.Crying Freeman delivers excellent action set pieces as well as solid drama but there are a few flaws. The director Gans often overuses slow motion in the action scenes which quickly becomes repetitive and detracts from the otherwise excellent action. Also aside from Dacascos who plays the character of Hinimura to perfection the acting is occasionally mediocre and lacking emotion. In addition Dacascos one of the best martial artists in the world is not given little chance to shine although this is understandable as why would an assassin resort to handtohand combat when he has firearms and blades at his disposal.Overall Crying Freeman is an abovepar movie. The HongKong style action is very entertaining and while the plot is neither original nor outstanding it is still enjoyable. Although Gans later went on to make another movie with Dacascos Brotherhood of the Wolf which is more polished has a budget about ten times larger and showcases Dacascos' skills as a martial artist much better Crying Freeman is still definitely worth watching.710";

	schema:reviewBody "Many critics didn't appreciate this movie. They mentioned the thin plot. They said that the movie contained too many stereotypes. They complained about thin dialogues throughout the movie. They criticized the editing of the action scenes. They said the movie was too slow paced.All these critics are partially right. Nevertheless I truly enjoyed this movie. For a debut movie Christophe Gans did the best he can with a very low budget.Even though a lot of scenes were turned in Canada or in the studios the movie still has an exotic touch as it is set in Seattle in the United States of America first later in the beautiful city of Vancouver Canada and towards the end even in mainland China as well as in different places in Japan.Apart of the settings the corpse paintings are well done the Asian costumes are well chosen and the fight scenes with or without arms have some kind of aestheticism at some points without being too pretentious.The rather unknown actors at that time with the charismatic Mark Dacascos and the solid Julie Condra also did a good effort. Even though the story is not always credible and somewhat predictable the connection between the two main actors is definitely there. They have known each other on the set of this film and became a couple that actually married and got three children until today. That's why the soft love story is more than just professional acting as it seems and surprisingly authentic.The movie is in fact a real life adaption of a famous manga and anime series but in comparison to many similar adaptations this kind of movie can also easily please to those that don't know the original. I usually dislike the whole manga phenomenon. I think it's overrated and has taken the place of many other and more intriguing cultural aspects of Japan. It's a little bit like sushi as there are so many better Japanese foods than this one. But I happened to adore this movie without caring for its origins. A fan of the original series may analyze this flick from a wholly different point of view.This movie is basically a solid action movie with a good dose of suspense different exotic cultural elements flawed by a few stereotypes some soft porn moments that never get too far but also some calm and quiet parts with emotional moments that give the characters some depth and development. The balance between fast paced passages and slow moods is well found in my opinion. Fans of intelligent suspense flicks may find this movie too simple. Action fans would like to see more martial arts aspects. But those who like more than just a couple of genres will surely adore this movie as a whole and recognize its diversity.The movie won't win a price for exquisite and philosophical dialogues but I prefer the quiet silent and mysterious character of a skilled killer that has fallen in love with his victim to one of those films with endless chatting and pretentiously cool proverbs at each three minutes. I prefer the rude shooting scenes and the rare but well done martial arts moments to car chases without an end big set explosions or soulless computer effects. This movie is rather grounded and simple. It's easy to watch. But it's sympathetic and still varies to be intriguing enough to watch this flick more than just once.Anybody that likes a simple but honest action movie with a romantic side story and some exotic Asian elements in a reasonable running time should try this film out. Anybody that is waiting for something explosive innovating or profound should go for a bigger production.Normally I would just give this film seven points but it had a certain kind of magic that is hard to describe but that really addicted me. I already feel the need to watch this movie again. I would also like to show it to some of my mates which doesn't happen very often. This flick is a surprising little gem.".

Awesomely he even has exploding guns to help cover his tracks. Soon after their chance encounter they're both caught in the middle of a Yakuza war with only the skills of Yo keeping them both alive. Detective Forge Chong and Detective Netah Karyo are trying to sort it all out but Netah may have more going on than meets the eye. It may all seem simple but in the world of the Crying Freeman nothing ever is. Will the Power of Yo prevail? Find out today...Crying Freeman is an excellent film that everybody should see. How it compares to the original Manga or Anime we wouldn't know but as a film in its own right it succeeds brilliantly. In other words you don't really need to know the source material to appreciate this. Maybe it helps but there's plenty to recommend even if like us you were unfamiliar with its origins and background. Classily directed by Christophe Gans  known primarily for his Brotherhood of the Wolf 2008  he balances sensitive and poetic passages that are downright painterly and beautiful with violent action setpieces involving everything from Martial Arts gunfu blowups and even a bow and arrow. Its artistic soul meshes well with the violence. The overall effect is intoxicating and adds up to be we believe a mustsee.Since this is quite obviously a work where the filmmakers clearly had high standards of quality the whole thing seems solid and professionally made on every level  writing directing and notably the cinematography. It's all very solid and it's comforting feeling you're in competent hands. Naturally fan favorite Mark Dacascos shines in the role that he was perhaps born to play. Costar Julie Condra must have been impressed  they later married. They are backed up by some familiar names Rae Dawn Chong and Tcheky Karyo are on board and acquit themselves well though interestingly Condra and Karyo were overdubbed by Deborah Kara Unger and Ron Perlman respectively. Other BMovie stalwarts are here to be found too such as Byron Mann and Jerry Wasserman check out our Virtual Assassin review for the reason why we're always pointing out these unsung actors  and lest we forget fan favorite Mako.A little over an hour in there's a bit of a lull but that's common and to be expected. That's really the only criticism we have of Crying Freeman. And unlike most of its other brethren from 1995 this seems far more timeless. Shockingly  criminally  this didn't receive a U.S. VHS release during the video store era and only came out here on DVD quietly in 2008 and that release is now out of print. There are some fine international releases out there and even a BluRay now. But why this didn't come out here when it would have done the most good for its reputation is puzzling and maddening. I guess it's all part of the adventure of movie watching and collecting  you never know what you're going to find or where you're going to find it. Occasionally you turn up a gem like this.Crying Freeman should be more wellknown especially in the U.S. We absolutely recommend this enjoyable winner of a film.".

	schema:headline " Superb Comic book style film!";
	schema:reviewBody "This has always been one of my favourite action films. Like the Matrix this is like a manga cartoon brought to life with superb visuals that build a great atmosphere in the film and also some top action great music and direction and a very good cast.Amazingly this has yet to be released in the United States this is shocking the film is very good and easily beats a lot of dull and poorly produced action films that have come to the big screen in recent years. As I'm from the UK it doesn't effect me but I feel that America is missing out on a Bmovie gem.The cast at its time of release were all pretty much unknowns. All of them were very good. Mark Dacascos is brilliant in the lead he is one of my favourite action stars and has been since I first saw this. He is a better actor than the likes of rivals Van Damme Schwarzenegger Seagal Lundgren and the hordes of action men below them. He is also an amazing martial artist as well. He moves like a cat with such grace and agility and he is also willing to do his own stunts in this and his other movies. The lovely visuals of the film and Gans subtle direction really help the two leads Dacascos and Julie Condra to draw you in. Dacascos especially he has great eyes and really becomes immersed in his roles something which rival stars just can't do. Some scenes are wonderfully shot and performed they really draw you in. Two in particular are the first meeting between Yo Dacascos and Emu O' Hara Condra and also a love scene between them later in the movie well the pre intercourse moments that is after that it was more sweaty bodies rather than immersing acting. Julie Condra is also very good. This is the only film I have seen her in but I am a fan she is pretty and has great eyes as well. She and Mark Dacascos have an obvious chemistry in the film and subsequently they became married in real life. Also worthy of mention is Byron Mann he was excellent as Koh the Freemans guide he has to make sure that Yo stays in line. Mann was really great in a decent role one scene was really good. In a flashback when Yo remembers when he first became the Freeman he recalls him meeting Koh. Koh then gives this great speech you are the Freeman you serve the sons of the dragon.....etc'.The plot is fairly basic Yo is the Freeman this means he is an assassin for an ancient Chinese warrior cult called the Sons of the Dragon. He is really being controlled by them against his will. He is witnessed by Emu O' Hara when he is assassinating a target. This of course means he has to kill her but of course he falls for her. Its a real comic book story about Yo's emotional struggle between the Woman he loves and the people who control him. He wants to break free from them but this upsets the people he works for putting himself and Emu in danger. It is a comic book film realism and seriousness is not important this is pure fantasy. It has inspiration from comics it has elements of a swashbuckler and romance all elements that Christophe Gans is interested in. He had similar themes in his recent hit Brotherhood of the Wolf. Ithought Brotherhood was slightly better but both have a magic quality and in both movies Mark Dacascos steals the show.Patrick O' Hearn's music is very atmospheric and really combines well with the cinematography which itself makes this film look far beyond the 15 million it cost to make. Finally Gan's direction is excellent. He hits the mark with the action the romance drama and has made an at times enthralling comic book fantasy. There is a mystical quality throughout the film and the audience is always drawn in. Gan's and Dacascos seem to combine to great effect. This is by no means a classic movie it has some moments of bad actors from some support players and occasionally stretches probability to extreme levels but overall it is an enjoyable and criminally unknown film.There is also an amazing end action scene at the end that is quite long which includes Mark somersaulting off 15 or so feet high buildings and also a fantastic swordfight that was choreographed by Gans and Dacascos.  910".

	onyx:emotionText "This has always been one of my favourite action films. Like the Matrix this is like a manga cartoon brought to life with superb visuals that build a great atmosphere in the film and also some top action great music and direction and a very good cast.Amazingly this has yet to be released in the United States this is shocking the film is very good and easily beats a lot of dull and poorly produced action films that have come to the big screen in recent years. As I'm from the UK it doesn't effect me but I feel that America is missing out on a Bmovie gem.The cast at its time of release were all pretty much unknowns. All of them were very good. Mark Dacascos is brilliant in the lead he is one of my favourite action stars and has been since I first saw this. He is a better actor than the likes of rivals Van Damme Schwarzenegger Seagal Lundgren and the hordes of action men below them. He is also an amazing martial artist as well. He moves like a cat with such grace and agility and he is also willing to do his own stunts in this and his other movies. The lovely visuals of the film and Gans subtle direction really help the two leads Dacascos and Julie Condra to draw you in. Dacascos especially he has great eyes and really becomes immersed in his roles something which rival stars just can't do. Some scenes are wonderfully shot and performed they really draw you in. Two in particular are the first meeting between Yo Dacascos and Emu O' Hara Condra and also a love scene between them later in the movie well the pre intercourse moments that is after that it was more sweaty bodies rather than immersing acting. Julie Condra is also very good. This is the only film I have seen her in but I am a fan she is pretty and has great eyes as well. She and Mark Dacascos have an obvious chemistry in the film and subsequently they became married in real life. Also worthy of mention is Byron Mann he was excellent as Koh the Freemans guide he has to make sure that Yo stays in line. Mann was really great in a decent role one scene was really good.

	schema:reviewBody "I hired this on video in the UK and was so suprised to find what an excellent film this is especially as I and everyone else seems never to have heard of it.I have never seen the original Manga anime nor am a big fan of the anime genre.  However I am very interest in oriental culture and so probably more tolerant and open minded to such things than most people.This film is awesomely slick clear and crisp.  To view it as only a film with violence is to watch it blindfolded.  In fact the more I watch this film the more I realize that there is not that much action just that each sequence has a huge impact.  Between the cool elegant and well balanced cinematography and Gans's uncluttered and simple direction the film draws the viewer through a beautiful dark and rich world of a sinojapanese underworld.  The film revolves around the traditional and formal world of the Japanese yakusa and the dark and dedicated world of the chinese Triads both playing for power.  Without any understanding of either japanese or chinese culture this film might well be too remote for the casual viewer.Strongest point of this film is without doubt the cinematography.  Superb composition especially in the slow motion shots the steralized monochrome of the yakusatriads and the fantastic colours of the wonderful tattoos all contribute to a visually deep and absorbing experience.I find many modern action films overly converluted and complicated little reason for being so other than they think they should.  It was very refreshing seeing a plot that was simple and clean.  The characters are well construed if underdeveloped for many critics.  But this has never been a problem for me as I think a lot of films tell a story of events and the prying voyeurism of characterisation isnt needed.  One of the nicest aspects was the obvious nature of the 'crying' freeman.  An assassin that is emotionally sympathetic to his victims but who doesnt really understand it and partially sees it as a curse.  This allows the main character to be softer and more human without having to pile into the emotional struggles.This was the first Marc Dacascos film I had seen and was immensly impressed by him.  His body movement is exceptionally elegant and he isnt challenged by the very dry exterior of the hitman.  Sadly I dont think he has been in anything nearly as good since.All in all Christophe Gans crafted an excellent and entertaining film.  He brings us neozen clinical beauty in magnificent depth.  The slick style and soft characters beat anything that Jon Woo has done.P.S.  Am a big john woo fan so hate to dis him.  But must be said that gans hasnt produced anything of similar quality since again... but here's hoping for a sequel sometime".

I hunted down this hard to find movie and was finally able to satisfy my longing to see Crying Freeman in the flesh. I was impressed by the portrayal of Freeman I feel that the essence of Freeman was well expressed by Mark Dacascos. Julie Condra's resemblance to the anime Emu was uncanny. The action and incredible tattoo on Freeman were the highlights of the film but just like most film adaptations of books this adaptation of the anime doesn't quite match the original.

It might be a genre to itself.Years ago I read a book named The Painted Bird that I thought deserved to be taught as a classic because its clean spare style deserved study. But what really set it apart for me was that it was permeated with violence  it was about WWII and life under the brutal rule of Nazi invaders  but its treatment was so spare and clean it somehow rose above its subject matter into the mythic and poetic.That's how this movie struck me. It is violent without being bloodsoaked has some highly charged eroticism without sinking into porn and says more with the star's silence than could ever be told with dialog. The filming style is as spare and beautiful as I remember the text in The Painted Bird and can't be separated from the overall mythic impact of the movie.I'm not saying this is a worldchanging movie. It didn't give me some sort of epiphany and at my age I'm no big fan of martial arts movies or anime cartoons. I'm just saying there is something quite beautiful about the way this movie fits together that elevates it above a subject matter that could have been cheapened into a spatter flick or bloated into a pure CG actioner. It's worth watching if only to sink your mind into the elusive mythic quality that sets this movie apart.".

The filming style is as spare and beautiful as I remember the text in The Painted Bird and can't be separated from the overall mythic impact of the movie.I'm not saying this is a worldchanging movie. It didn't give me some sort of epiphany and at my age I'm no big fan of martial arts movies or anime cartoons. I'm just saying there is something quite beautiful about the way this movie fits together that elevates it above a subject matter that could have been cheapened into a spatter flick or bloated into a pure CG actioner. It's worth watching if only to sink your mind into the elusive mythic quality that sets this movie apart.";

Because this is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The heroic bloodshed in the movie is equal to that of a John Woo movie. Mark Dacascos is excellent as the crying freeman. Maybe the story is not really compelling. But the atmosphere in the movie is just right. From beginning to end you will be caught in an alternative reality which seems real enough. But throughout the story you realize that it is different from our world. Now realizing this movie is based on a manga comic it makes sense. Christophe Gans does such a perfect job that in my opinion he should make more live action adaptations of mangas. Because this one was magnificent!".

Nine months later a dozen identical children are born to these somewhat suspicious mothers children with white blond hair and scary eyes that glow.

Can kindly schoolteacher the wonderful George Sanders whose beloved wife has borne one of these creatures help the alien children embrace their human half? Or will he have to destroy them all?This is an absolute masterpiece of paranoia scifi style. The acting is superb especially by the late and underappreciated Mr. Sanders whose compassion and intellect sets the tone for this quiet and somewhat sad little tale. The lovely Barbara Shelley as Sanders loving wife is sweet and totally believable. Indeed the townsfolk are all very realistic and approachable kind and simple folk who don't really deserve the wrath of the spooky children who have invaded their small town. Young Martin Stephens who also turned in a creepy performance in the ghostly masterpiece The Innocents is every bit as creepy here as George and Barbara's son. Filmed in moody black and white this movie creeps along with all the menacing stealth of a thick London pea souper. This is an intelligent horror film which deserves better attention. It probably won't be appreciated by people who consider expletives and explosions to be main characters but for people who prefer horror with brains and not brains ripped out of skulls this is the film for them. Fans of George Sanders shouldn't miss this it's quite a switch from his usual smarmy roles and a nice switch at that.Highly recommended!".

Sanders comes to the inevitable conclusion and because they can read his thoughts he must think of a brick wall in order to mask his intent.

	schema:reviewBody "Village of the Damned is a strongly compelling ScienceFiction highlight and easily of the eeriest movies I ever saw. Although it's a very modest and simply made production the scaryeffect of this film is a lot more effective than some of its bigbudgeted colleagues. On a random day the entire English village of Midwich falls into a trancelike sleep. Completely inexplicably they awake again seemly normal but two months later it appears that every fertile woman in town got pregnant on the day of the blackout. The newborns show a strange resemblance in looks and  what is even more bizarre  they're telekinetic! Due to their amazing intelligence and emotionless behavior they form a huge threat and freak out the entire little town. Village of the Damned' is loyally adapted from John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos'. Throughout the whole film you don't get much explanation and as a viewer you're forced to guess at the mystery's origin. Although highly unlikely the events in Midwich really are alarming and make you feel uncomfortable. This effect is reached through solid tension and macabre atmosphere much more than through special effects. The eerily lit eyes of the children' are the only real effects but they cause a lot more fear than gallons of blood ever could! Village of the Damned also owes a lot of its power to a terrific casting job. Essentially to achieve the obtained scary effect were the children. Well they did a good job! The offspring looks alienated almost naturally and their appearance literally chills your blood. The concerned adult in Village of the Damned is excellently played by George Sanders. Sanders was a terrific and shamefully overlooked English class actor who committed suicide in the early 70's. He has a got a few other delightful horror movies on his repertoire like Psychomania' and Doomwatch' both are some of his last films. Village of the Damned is a highly recommended picture that'll certainly keep you close to the screen till the endcredits role. Equally recommended is the unofficial sequel called Children of the Damned'. There's a bit more background in that film as well as some more explicit horror sequences. The 1995 remake by John Carpenter however is rather unexciting and one of the most redundant films ever made. Stick to the original and be scared!".

	schema:reviewBody "The best way to watch this movie is ignorantly. Go to Netflix now put the movie at the top of your queue and watch it when it arrives. Read about it later. If you enjoy scifi classics like The Day the Earth Stood Still and Them! if you love the Britishness of the Hammer horror pictures if you prefer a welltold story rich suspense sympathetic characters and blackandwhite photography to special effects color and gore you will want to see this film right away.The movie begins in Midwich. We meet the scientist Gordon Zellaby having a telephone conversation. Midsentence he passes out. At the same moment every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. When the army gets involved we discover this force has precise boundaries. One soldier after being lassoed around the waist walks past the boundary loses consciousness and immediately revives when his fellows pull him out of the infected area. A few hours later this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks but it has a sequel. All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant.Watching this sciencefiction movie paired with almost any modern one demonstrates how storytelling has devolved as special effects have advanced. It also demonstrates how one simple effect can be more memorable than a thousand complex ones. I happened to see this just before watching The Forgotten 2005 a stupid movie with expensive effects but not of those expensive effects is as potent as this movie's signature device. When the blondehaired Midwich children wreak psychic havoc the picture freezes and their eyes glow. That inexpensive trick shot is worth the millions blown on The Forgotten.Another nice effect George Sanders. He plays the hero Gordon Zellaby a scientist who becomes a dubious father to one of the Midwich freaks. Sanders plays rogues in almost every other movie but here he is sweetnatured and convincingly so he betrays not a shadow of his usual cynicism. Were this his only surviving film one would think he was born to play kindly old men. The excellent cast has one other outstanding performance by Martin Stephens who plays Sanders's coldhearted son. Would you be surprised to learn his voice was dubbed by a female actress specializing in children? I was surprised to learn it wasn't. That is the boy's own eerily precise diction.Special praise must also go to the director and photographer Wolf Rilla and Geoffrey Faithful who give the movie the detached air of a documentary. The script credited to Stirling Silliphant George Barclay and Rilla is an excellent adaptation of a fine book The Midwich Cuckoos by John Beynon Harris. Fans of this movie will want to read it. The book has many enjoyable details that were necessarily and wisely cut from the adaptation. To note one difference the children in the movie are psychically linked what one knows they all know. But in the book the boys are psychically linked with the boys the girls with the girls but there is little or no link between the two sexes. The reasons for this are fascinating.I haven't seen the John Carpenter remake and I don't want to. What would the ideal remake of this film look like? It would look like the original blackandwhite set in the late fifties cast with Brits and scripted with the same restraint. Maybe modern resources could add a piquant touch or two it would be amusing to see all those sheep fall asleep in the opening scene. Oh and that awful model shot of the school could be replaced. Otherwise we have the film we want so why remake it?".

The film is intelligent doesn't talk down to the audience and handles the subject matter in a very realistic manner. Most people in horror films act like idiotsnot in this one! Also some superb acting by George Sanders Barbara Shelley as his wife and those creepy little kids especially Martin Stephens helps a lot. Proves a quiet little goreless film can scare you silly. AT ALL COSTS AVOID THE 1995 REMAKE!!!!!!! Carpenter's a great director but you can't remake a great film. See this one!!".

Village of the Damned is one of those discerning intelligent science fiction films of yesteryear that tends to leave much to your imagination in terms of gore and violence as well as make you think and ponder important questions about the limits with which humanity should go to procure knowledge.  The children are decidedly very creepy as their eyes glow when they are angered.

	schema:reviewBody "Some women give birth various strange children with supernatural power and extraordinary intelligence . An suspenseful and interesting premise dealing about several strangely emotionless children all born at the same time in a small village in Midwich . The scene is a village called Midwich in which a rare event overcomes the idyllic location . At the same moment every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly  some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. Everybody falls into a deep mysterious sleep for several hours in the middle of the day. When the army gets involved they find this force has precise boundaries. A few hours later this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks but it has a sequel. Later on  every woman Barbara Shelley married to George Sanders capable of childbearing is pregnant . All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant . Nine months later the babies are born and they all look normal but it doesn't take the parents long to realise that the kids are not human or humane .And the glowingeyed children Martin Stephens  among others they have will prove to be worse than what they could have feared. The children that are born out of these pregnancies seem to grow very fast and they all have the same blond hair and strange penetrating eyes that make people do things  all of them have telephatic powers  the stare will paralyze the will of the villagers . They result to be mindcontrolling demons or aliens . Meanwhile a government officer good performance by George Sanders along with the doctor Laurence Naismith attempt to stop their plans of conquest .This classic SciFi thriller contains chills  suspense  intrigue and creepy events about some precocious deadly children and their quest of power . MGM shelved the project because it was deemed potentially inflammatory and controversial specifically due to its sinister depiction of virgin birth . Eerie and strange plot very well developed by the screenwritten Sterling Silliphant based on John Wyndham novel titled The Midwich Cuckoos that focuses a British village visited by some unknown life form which leaves the women of the village pregnant. Performance is frankly good as main cast as Barbara Shelley and Ronald Colman was originally supposed to star in this film but he passed away in 1958 and was replaced by an excellent George Sanders who married Colman's widow Benita Hume . Exceptional support cast formed by prestigious Brit actors as Michael G. Wynne  Laurence Naismith and very secondary Peter Vaughan as Policeman . Special mention to Martin Stephens as an unsettling little boy  his creepy effect of the glowing eyes was made by matting a negative image of their eyes over the pupils . Intriguing and atmospheric musical score by Ron Goodwin . Furthermore  it packs appropriate cinematography in black and white by Geoffrey Faithful who photographs splendidly the scenarios from the village . This suspenseful and thrilling film is well directed by Wolf Rilla . Rating  Very good  providing pleasant screams for the viewer . Essential and indispensable seeing for Barbara Shelley and George Sanders followers . Other renditions based on John Wyndham novel titled The Midwich cuckoos and well adapted by Stirling Silliphant are the following  A nice sequel titled Children of the damned 64 by Anton Leader with Ian Hendry  Alan Badel and Barbara Ferris . It's subsequently made an acceptable remake 1995 titled John Carpenter's Village of the damned with the same premise still interesting enough to watch it and starred by Kirstie Alley  Christopher Reeve and Mark Hamill  however it suffers from unimaginative account because being a copy from original film with more violent and explicit scenes and fails to provide the intelligent atmosphere from previous story .".

Both of these films are testaments to the idea that low budgets are very capable of producing great films. It is not the size of the budget that matters it is the skill of the filmmakers and the actors. Village of the Damned makes use of a variety of very easily done but also very effective special effects such as the boundary across which all people and animals lose consciousness the creepy eyes on those kids and their hypnotic powers.The discussion of the exact same phenomenon happening to a few remote towns all over the world does a lot to show what these kids can do and it increases the dramatic tension of the film as a whole. Cheaply made but also very well made because a lot of thought was obviously put into it Village of the Damned is a timeless thriller even in black and white. When you watch a movie like this if you are the kind of person who is so superficial about your movies that you refuse to watch black and white films keep in mind that black and white photography REQUIRES good acting to put it in the immortal words of Orson Welles. You can't have black and white photography and bad acting the film would never work. Village of the Damned takes black and white photography and fills it with excellent acting a fascinating story and good direction that makes me wonder why this was the only film that Wolf Rilla ever directed.".

	schema:headline " This is what happens when you don't beat them enough.";
	schema:reviewBody "A cheap well executed British SciFi film about a cohort of superintelligent mindreading children growing up in a small English village.The original title of the story I think was The Midwitch Cuckoos a less exploitative but far more appropriate title than Village of the Damned. We may think of cuckoos as a cute wooden thing that comes out of a gingerbread clock and makes funny noises to announce the time but that's because we are not birds. Real cuckoos are brood parasites. They lay eggs in the nests of other species of birds. The other birds fecklessly hatch them. And man are the cuckoo hatchlings ugly  gray featherless sinewy things that immediately go about the business of rolling the other eggs out of the nest to get rid of the competition. They are born evil.In this movie the cuckoos are children. Their mothers were impregnated by  well by some kind of extraterrestrial infrared hypermolecular cosmological incubus. Anyway all the women of Midwich become pregnant during a blackout period that encompasses the entire village for a few hours. It's chilling from the outset to see others try to enter the village and flop down as soon as they cross an invisible boundary.These kids aren't ugly though. They all have blond hair and magnetic eyes. And what one of them learns the others know immediately.

Yes  ruthless fascist dictators seem about the right slots for them. I can't readily visualize them as Gestalt psychotherapists.Sanders decides that they have to go but it's a problem because although he's about the only person in the village they feel any trust for they can also read his intentions. And naturally if he succeeds in ridding the world of these kids he must go with them because really how can you murder these beautiful intelligent children and go on living with yourself. In order to accomplish his goal he must think of nothing but a brick wall so they can't read his mind. But they are suspicious and their collective power begins to cause the brick wall to crumble  too late.I said this was a lowbudget flick and it is. There are hardly any special effects to speak of. The production couldn't even afford to pay a stunt man for a full body burn. The performances are fine but the direction is no more than efficient and the art direction and photography project a chilly and grimy atmosphere which seems to have occurred naturally.I also said it was intelligent and it is. It's not exactly a horror flick because it has no monsters or murderers and it's not exactly science fiction in the usual sense because it takes place in the present and there isn't a robot in sight. What it does is use improbable events to pose a series of important moral questions. Nobody would argue that these kids are likable. And maybe their Daddies were nothing more than a shower of golden coins or a stream of photons. But they look human and in many ways act it. They don't want to die  they know about mortality.They certainly DO seem dangerous but they haven't done anything irredeemably evil yet. Sanders decides that there's nothing wrong with them that a darn good blowing up wouldn't cure and we applaud when he manages to carry out his plan. But he's making an awful lot of questionable assumptions. Do they deserve to be killed en masse? Would YOU kill them all?".

	onyx:emotionText "A cheap well executed British SciFi film about a cohort of superintelligent mindreading children growing up in a small English village.The original title of the story I think was The Midwitch Cuckoos a less exploitative but far more appropriate title than Village of the Damned. We may think of cuckoos as a cute wooden thing that comes out of a gingerbread clock and makes funny noises to announce the time but that's because we are not birds. Real cuckoos are brood parasites. They lay eggs in the nests of other species of birds. The other birds fecklessly hatch them. And man are the cuckoo hatchlings ugly  gray featherless sinewy things that immediately go about the business of rolling the other eggs out of the nest to get rid of the competition. They are born evil.In this movie the cuckoos are children. Their mothers were impregnated by  well by some kind of extraterrestrial infrared hypermolecular cosmological incubus. Anyway all the women of Midwich become pregnant during a blackout period that encompasses the entire village for a few hours. It's chilling from the outset to see others try to enter the village and flop down as soon as they cross an invisible boundary.These kids aren't ugly though. They all have blond hair and magnetic eyes. And what one of them learns the others know immediately. But handsome or not they can immediately solve one of those Chinesebox puzzles in which you have to slide panels around up and down until you expose the inner drawer.

A more than decent sequel would follow three years later Children Of the Damned and a poor remake by John Carpenter would surface in 1995.

But I was so memorized by what scenes they were showing that I had to find this movie and watch it I finally found it online last night and I absolutely loved this movie. This is one of the creepiest horror movies I have ever seen so many people who always told me that creepy kids scare them I never understood why until I saw this film last night it gave me nightmares. Granted I know that it's cheesy and you can easily MST3K your way through it but watching this in the dark with those creepy glowing eyes is an image I will never get out of my head.In the small English village of Midwich everybody and everything falls into a deep mysterious sleep for several hours in the middle of the day. Some months later every woman capable of childbearing is pregnant and the children that are born out of these pregnancies seem to grow very fast and they all have the same blond hair and strange penetrating eyes that make people do things they don't want to do.Village of the Damned is a very memorable film and just scared the living day lights out of me. I would highly recommend this for any one who truly appreciates film because it is cheesy in some aspects I think it takes a certain person to really understand this film and in the time it was made. The way these kids looked was just beyond disturbing they looked alike sounded alike and acted alike. Those voices were so light care free it just got into your head that these kids had no boundaries and that's what's scary you know that if a child has those powers there would be no adults in this world. Village of the Damned is a terrific horror film I highly recommend it watch it in the dark it's a lot of fun.910".

	schema:reviewBody "At a time when science fiction films were being made mostly with bad scripts bad actors and even worse production values there were a handful of science fiction films that were the exact opposite. One of these was 1960's Village Of The Damned. Based on John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos this tale of a mysterious blacking out of an English village and the more mysterious children born in its wake has becoming something of a genre classic in five decades since it was released. The reasons for this are not hard to see at all thanks to a fine combination of cast direction cinematography and script.In some respects a film is only as good as its cast and this film is certainly no exception. George Sanders gives a very believable performance as Professor Gordon Zellaby the man who finds himself caught more and more in the heart of mysterious events. Barbara Shelly plays his wife Anthea herself a mother of one of the mysterious children and who finds herself increasingly isolated from that child. Martin Stephens plays Barbara's brother Alan a military man who stumbles across the mysterious events and becomes linked to it from that point on. Then there's members of the village such as Laurence Naismith as Doctor Willers Bernard Archard as the local Vicar and others who find themselves baffled and increasingly alarmed by the events around them. Together these actors help to anchor this film with a sense of reality often lost in films of this genre both then and now.No review of this film would be complete without mentioning the mysterious children of course. Led by child actor Martin Stephens as David this group of children are amongst the most menacing and odd monsters to ever appear in a science fiction film. Notice I use monsters in quotation marks would you? Yes they are children but at a time when bug eyed monsters were all the rage Wyndham's novel and the filmmakers took what should have been innocent and made it into a monster of sorts driven by logic and the need to survive at all costs. With simple looks coupled with a special effect that looks impressive even fifty years later they become utterly believable as creatures of menace. The result makes the film all the better not just then but now as well.Two more ingredients in the film's success are the direction and cinematography. Perhaps taking a cue from Val Guest's direction of the first two Quatermass films Wolf Rilla choose to direct the film in a very low key way that avoids any of the showier techniques of the time except when its really needed as in the climax of the film. This is coupled with the cinematography of Geoffrey Faithful who shoots the film in a low key almost pseudodocumentary style that is also very much akin to that seen in the first two Quatermass films. The result is a film that feels realistic even in light of its science fiction events.Which brings us to the script written by Stirling Silliphant Wolf Rilla and George Barclay. Adapted from John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos the script is a fine example of construction and dialogue being put together brilliantly. From the moment the entire population of the village of Midwich blacks out to the army's investigations of it there's a mystery in place for the characters and the viewer to solve. It is only when the women of Midwich fall pregnant their children are born and begin towards their appointed destiny that the mystery begins to unravel. As that happens the film methodically builds in tensions right to the end. All the while though the script reminds us that these are ordinary people caught in the midst of increasingly mysterious events around them thanks both to character moments and the dialogue present throughout. While I can speak to how faithful or unfaithful it is to the original novel I can say that in either case it is a fine script nevertheless.The only really mixed element found in the film is its score by Ron Goodwin. Goodwin's score is very effective in places especially in sequences where it is wonderfully timed to the special effect of the looks the children give. There are just as many other moments though where the music is utterly out of place no more so then the heroic march played over the closing credit sequence for example. Consequently the score ranges continuously between being highly effective or out of place to the point of clashing.Village Of The Damned has become a classic of the science fiction genre all thanks to a fine combination of a great cast Wolf Rilla's direction Geoffrey Faithful's cinematography and a fine script. By choosing to be the exact opposite of everything bad science fiction films of the time were this film still has the power to be every bit as tense and mysterious as it ever has been. That's proved to be even more true some fifty years after its initial release.".

	schema:headline " A Wyndham Adaptation That Sticks To The Book";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the BBC travesty that claims to be based on John Wyndham's DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS I decided to catch the film version of The Midwich Cuckoos given the more melodramatic title of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and wasn't disappointed . It's a very faithful adaptation of the author's work showing the strength and weakness of Wyndham's writing Like most of Wyndham's work the theme of mankind trying to survive the presence on Earth of an alien life form is well realised . The aliens in question  a new breed of children  are portrayed as being amoral rather than cruel and belligerent . The problem with this is that people nowadays are far more used to  talking monsters  where they come to Earth and explain their plans and motives to the human characters and The Midwich Cukoos is probably the closest Wyndham came to these type of aliens . Certainly if you read The Kraken Wakes you might be surprised that humanity is incapable of making any kind of communication to the aliens If there's a downside to this type of writing it's that much of the drama revolves around scientists  military men and government bureaucrats sitting around tables discussing the matters in hand and how to deal with the threat . Much of the film is dialogue driven and for an audience brought up on DOCTOR WHO they might find this slightly boring . It's not helped by an old fashioned feel where the likes of the local vicar being a centre for the community and a scene where a character visits the doctor's surgery only to see the doctor pull out out a cigarette and light up Perhaps the most effective scene is the opening where the village inhabitants fall asleep and anyone approaching the village also falls unconscious . This gives a very eerie opening installment along with the revelation that several of the female inhabitants have become pregnant . It's a great premise though to be honest once you know where the plot is going it's not as exciting as you expect . The film also has a rather short running time which means there's not much plotting involved . That said at least it keeps to Wyndham's book and is much better than the 1995 remake by John Carpenter".

The problem with this is that people nowadays are far more used to  talking monsters  where they come to Earth and explain their plans and motives to the human characters and The Midwich Cukoos is probably the closest Wyndham came to these type of aliens . Certainly if you read The Kraken Wakes you might be surprised that humanity is incapable of making any kind of communication to the aliens If there's a downside to this type of writing it's that much of the drama revolves around scientists  military men and government bureaucrats sitting around tables discussing the matters in hand and how to deal with the threat . Much of the film is dialogue driven and for an audience brought up on DOCTOR WHO they might find this slightly boring . It's not helped by an old fashioned feel where the likes of the local vicar being a centre for the community and a scene where a character visits the doctor's surgery only to see the doctor pull out out a cigarette and light up Perhaps the most effective scene is the opening where the village inhabitants fall asleep and anyone approaching the village also falls unconscious . This gives a very eerie opening installment along with the revelation that several of the female inhabitants have become pregnant . It's a great premise though to be honest once you know where the plot is going it's not as exciting as you expect . The film also has a rather short running time which means there's not much plotting involved . That said at least it keeps to Wyndham's book and is much better than the 1995 remake by John Carpenter";

All the young women in the quiet remote English hamlet of Midwich mysteriously become pregnant after the whole populace goes into a bizarre and abrupt 24hour trance. The ladies give birth to a bunch of odd emotionless towheaded kids with extraordinary kinetic and telepathic abilities. They also have glowing bright eyes unusual fingernails and acute advanced intellects. Moreover the murderous moppets casually kill anyone they perceive as a threat in strange and startling accidents. Some of the frightened townspeople stand up to the freaky tykes to no avail. It's ultimately up to brave and perceptive military scientist George Sanders who gives a truly outstanding performance to put a stop to 'em before it's too late.Tautly directed with commendable understatement by Wolf Rilla with a smart and compact script cowritten by future Oscarwinning screenwriter Stirling Stilliphant gorgeous blackandwhite cinematography a nicely spare and shivery score an eerily ambiguous tone a pleasingly concise 78 minute running time uniformly aces acting from a topdrawer cast the child thespians are extremely unsettling while Hammer horror queen Barbara Shelley makes for a very charming and pretty damsel in distress and a genuinely nervewracking conclusion Village of the Damned never falters for a minute. The film's smashing success derives partly from Rilla's wisely stark and straightforward execution partly from the sheer vague creepiness of the intriguing plot no explanation is ever given for how or why the children were born in the first place and primarily from downplaying needless flashy special effects razzledazzle to emphasize instead the strong and absorbing adults vs. children conflict at the heart of the narrative this movie could be read as a weird and imaginative fantastic allegory on the generation gap that was a key hallmark of the 60's. A terrific terror tale that's wholly deserving of its substantial classic status.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think producers of Village of the Damned were willing to spend much money on this movie. In fact only George Sanders in the cast could be considered as a star and he was on his way back by the time he made this picture. Though Barbara Shelley and Michael Gwynne where often casted in horror films none of the two got even close to reach stardom. I don't think the rest of the actors where known outside England. The movie was filmed in black and white and no decoration or huge sets were needed. No much for special effects even for 1960.But somehow out of this unpretentious film turned out a real little classic in its genre. The idea of alien children dominating adults and killing them with just a look of their shinning eyes works perfectly and makes an interesting scifi or even horror story that keeps tension till the end. The final confrontation between Sanders and the kids is outstanding as we watch him trying hard to think of a brick wall that starts to brake and reveal the inside part of the bag on the desk. Although the actor didn't seem to put much effort in his role his talent was enough to present a fine performance.The movie lasts less than 1 hour and 20 minutes but that is enough to deliver the plot and no more is needed. Definitely one of the best scifihorror films I've ever seen.".

Ricardo Darin from the Son of the Bride and the Oscar winner The Secret in her eyes as the repented lawyer and Martina Guzman the director's wife and a real revelation as a drug addicted doctor give outstanding performances but the supporting cast quite as good.

The love story between the two main characters slows down the movie a bit. There are a couple of important situations left unexplained. In brief perhaps a little more work on the history could improve this movie but is still far better and effective than 98 of movies currently in theaters.".

	schema:reviewBody "CARANCHO 'Vulture' or 'a bird of prey an animal that attack and feed on wounded animals' is a disturbing film from the opening sequences until the end. Before any story begins we are given the information superimposed over black and white photographs for broken glass and bodies on a street about the number of automobile accidents and deaths in excess of 8000 each year the leading cause of deaths in Argentina. This grim fact has produced an even more grim industry  ambulance chasing lawyers who follow and even at times stage accidents in order to collect from insurance and scam the real victims and the insurances companies too. This industry requires the participation of doctors paramedical personnel and police on the take. Every aspect of this horrendous situation is played out in this tersely written Alejandro Fadel Martn Mauregui Santiago Mitre and Pablo Trapero who also directs. It is a tough film to watch but does serve to alert the audience to a major crime industry that though set in Buenos Aires Argentina is prevalent probably throughout the world. Sosa Ricardo Darn is a lawyer who has lost his license form some unstated reason who is now working for a 'foundation' that falls into the category discussed above. He not only chases ambulances but also pays men to stage them so that he can collect money based on the fact that he works with the distraught families to win power of attorney for the injured or deceased giving him access to the insurance money. His bosses are competitive and Sosa is repeatedly attacked physically a la mob style for his failure to perform. Sosa meets Lujn Martina Gusman a beautiful young doctor who is at the beginning of her career and must work emergency rooms and ride in ambulances to administer to the injured or ill in order to gain experience to become a respected physician. They meet over an accident  Lujn is giving aid to a victim and Sosa is planning to use the victim in his crime racket. Both Sosa and Lujn seem to have occult senses of responsibility and ethics but life has brought them to a place where they must submerge their standards in order to survive Lujn happens to be a drug addicted 'to sustain the brutality of her work' and Sosa endangers the lives of innocent people to satisfy the bosses to whom he must bow in order to survive. It is this contrast between their passion for each other and their participation in the dark crime of 'caranchos' that provides the pushpull of their relationship resulting in an ending few will predict. Both Darn and Gusman are outstanding in very difficult roles but the supporting cast  Carlos Weber Jos Luis Arias Fabio Ronzano Loren Acua Gabriel Almirn and Jos Manuel Espeche  is equally strong in smaller roles. This is a very dark film  in story in locale the San Justo region of Buenos Aires and in the fact that it all takes place at night  but it carries information we all need to note and molds that information into a suspenseful thriller that is so well paced by director Pablo Tapero that every moment is filled with meaning.

The nervous shaking camera style of Trapero in this flick adds tension to the tale but fails to remark some important dramatic points. He misses too regarding to acting direction allowing some of the actors not all granted to deploy methodic works in the sense of Actor's Studio ones which do more damage than good to the development of the plot. All said Carancho adds nothing to the brilliant Trapero's career far away from his brilliant Mundo Gra and El bonaerense. Fairly enough this one can be considered just one lesser work. Worth watching? If you like claustrophobic dark miserable sordid crime movie but with not that good acting and directing yes. If this isn't the case look for Adrin Caetano's Un oso rojo.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is as perfect as any contemporary movie can be perfect nowadays. The uncompromising plot shows the very somber underside of the insurance business in all its corruption corruption found in any other big business as we are getting to know more and more every day just by reading the world news.They show it really as mafia business.Corrupt lawyers corrupt police corrupt doctors. Everybody and his grandmother is corrupt!! A very dark very stark movie.Quitequite depressing to watch but so very well done that it grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go. Road traffic in the big polluted city is the major protagonist the core of the story and it is pack and parcel of many outdoor scenes where the interminable string of vehicles running with their noise and pollution are a permanent reminder that every few minutes inevitably some accident will occur. The music is so perfect following the story that just now I realize that there must have been music because I don't remember any!! The traffic accident victims their pain their waiting for an ambulance lying on the bare cement of the street maybe with broken bones in awful pain any minute of waiting time an atrocious agony and the ambulance taking forever to arrive... to me those were intolerable scenes because I was a victim of accidents too and the whole nightmarish thing came back to my mind. All the hospital scenes were PERFECT.And the dismal public hospitals with stained doors dirt lack of supplies lack of doctors and nurses...and the few available for too many patients dead tired without sleep due to so much overwork and underpaid. No wonder then that they could make horrible mistakes! It couldn't be more depressing. Maybe it's my problem but I prefer to see a comedy nowadays.The length of this movie is PERFECT not a minute too long not a minute too short. The editing and the camera work just couldn't be better. All the actors sheer perfection too. Only one question bothers me when it comes to script logic. At the very end who was driving the white pick up? Because as far as I understood Darin's character didn't have reliable friends to count on. It's the only flaw that I could notice in the whole movie. Excellent a truly excellent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 60's there was a phenomenon in LatinAmerican literature that is today reduced to the word boom. A very good number of writers throughout the continent began producing groundbreaking work they broke every formula and introduced new possibilities to literature unknown so far. Mrquez Rulfo Llosa and notably in Argentina Cortzar and Borges among others. Today that trend still weaves its consequences Chico Buarque has been a revelation as a writer although Brazil is quite a different world. But i think that lately those willing to explore new territories in narrative and storytelling have been working more in cinema. Mrquez and Borges are 2 well known and great! film goers and critics. Anyway LatinAmerican cinema today is the heir to the developments in LatinAmerican literature produced in the last 50 years. In the argentinean case there was a major setback in the country at the beginning of this century corruption and incompetence led the country to bankruptcy and the intellectual class rebels against that so like in Brazil! argentinean cinema is usually densified by the social concerns of argentineans.Literature and social context are thus the 2 great frames where a film like this is integrated.And what a good film. The first thing done here is the establishment of a strange world of people who live under different routines performing different jobs conquering the world in a different way yet in the same sets of the ordinary real life with which once in a while they intersect. The man someone who chases people who've been run over by cars to collect the insurance money and many times simulates the running over. The woman who lives by night as a doctor on site for first aid. And the insight into a corrupt underworld where we only hint that somewhere close there are honest people. By itself this is a bizarre tense and cinematic world worth visiting. Over it there is a layer of poetic sensitivity that eventually springs out of the male character through his infatuation with the woman. So on the core we have a common story of a weak man who redeems himself because of love but set in a strange repulsive yet fascinating world. This could be a short by Cortzar.And on top of everything the wheel that makes this world spin is the boldness and visual power with which this is made. Practically every significant shot is enormous and without cuts. For how the camera is handled we're entering the vast beautiful tradition of Orson Welles that from Touch of Evil as interpreted by the incredible Alfonso Cuarn notably on a huge film Children of Men. This camera is unobtrusive yet manages to be on it should be. It knows everything that's going to happen and it plays with us to show us more often than not and offfield that's puts us away from the action only to find us as unaware of what's going on as every other character in the film. This is really top work i don't remember seeing this kind of visual grammar so well manipulated recently. Quite apart from the production obstacles of engineering such long shots and the tough acting of these actors with really fine performances i was amazed at the level of manipulation employed how this director and DOP understand the subtleties of the devices they use. I'll want to see more of them. Anything. Of all the sequences the final 8 or 9 minutes are the best. See over and over again if possible the last shot. possible spoiler the camera starts at a garage goes on to the inside of a car assists to a car crash sees a street shooting enters another car to end up with yet another car crash. Without cuts with a vividness and wildness with few precedents. What a ride!My opinion 45".

I can tell you we are like him Ricardo Darin resume exactly how we the argentinians talks and gesticulate. The dark like of the movie and the places is nothing more than the reality of the streets the reality of hospitals. They are so human and common that they can do the movie perfectly credible 'cause everything except the love history is a every day real situations. Of course is not everything tetricus and bad is a part there is also good and nice places but this movie is focused on the dark side.I strongly recommend this movie and i wasn't expecting much for this one when i started to see it. It will make you sit and watch all the movie without any second of distraction every minute worth. Very human very real great acts great camera work better than i expect for our cinema everything is very well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would have rated this movie higher but it had one of the most maddening endings I have ever seen in a movie. Not that the rest of the movie was that good. Without the bad ending I would have only increased my rating to 5 or 6.This is one of those movies where the main characters start off in a bad situation and then do one stupid thing after another until their hole is so deep there is no way out. One of the main characters is an attorney who has lost his license and has gotten involved with an ambulancechasing outfit run by gangsters. The other is an emergency room doctor who shoots up in the bathroom so that she can cope with the long hours of her job.In most suspense thrillers the formula goes like this. The good guys get badgered threatened and chased by the bad guys narrowly escaping death but in the end winning out usually in some ingenious way. If you happen to like this formula don't go see Carancho because the people who made it threw the formula out the window.SPOILERS As our heroes are driving away from a climactic gun battle having miraculously survived a horrific car accident and a shower of bullets coming through their windshield they are hit by another car. The guy ends up dead and the girl's condition is apparently serious. The screen goes blackend of movie. I don't know about you but to me the tragic ending is becoming a clich in movies. I think that killing off a main character at the end is an overused trick some filmmakers use to make their movies more dramatic or artsy. OK I agree that filmmakers WERE following the film noir formula If the hero does something unforgivable he must die. But that explanation of the ending only leads to another problem. Why did Sosa kill his boss in cold blood? Sure his boss had Sosa's girlfriend slapped around but it was out of character for Sosa to beat the guy to to a bloody pulp. Sosa is a petty criminal but not a killer. In fact it seems that the main reason for having Sosa murder his boss and having his girlfriend be a drug addict was so that they would be dirty enough to be killed or suffer greatly at the end.".

Cynically her drug addiction feels like an afterthought added by one of the writers to explain her compulsions that go so quickly out of control. Her attraction for Sosi comes out of left field and the drug addiction is probably an attempt to justify this but seems over the top and unnecessarily to stack the deck against her. In any case her habit should have been introduced earlier. The lawyer Sosa played by Ricardo Darin is nasty. He goes after Lujan's assailant with uncontrolled violence and rage far different than Bardem's understated emotional turmoil in 'Biutiful' in a similar situation. Finally why the incomprehensible deusexmachina ending? The filmmakers had a more interesting setup than I think they knew how to develop.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a bleak and hard hitting intense drama! Wow. It starts out sweet yet depressing as a love story between two people struggling in low wage high pressure jobs. But slowly this story enfolds itself into a climax that crept under my skin like a disease gone out of control. The nucleus of the story is about a disbarred lawyer who feeds of traffic victims as his clientele. He even goes so far as to help injure people so they can claim insurance money. This criminal business is slowly spiralling out of control. A new found love only intensifies this already chaotic drama. You gotta see this for yourself to believe how insane and wild this story is.Cant believe this movie has only gotten 17 reviews mine included. This is THE FORGOTTEN GEM out here! Maybe it is not suited for the masses who might MISTAKENLY expect some sort of fun filled action thriller. It is not. It is depressing. But in a passionate way. Those who love drama in relationships will appreciate this criminal love story. This movie is the real thing dark depressing but wild and passionate at the same time. Like only Pablo Trapero and other South American directors of these days can achieve. Lots of masterpieces have originated from those southern countries this past decade. And too few get noticed on Imdb. What a shame.Seen it many times now and it honestly is one of the most realistic hard hitting dramas I have seen the last decade. Ricardo Darin and Martina Gusman perform the roles of their lives. The photography is like a fly on the wall documentary style but not the shaky cam nonsense some other directors use on the contrary the natural flowing camera movements gave me the feeling I was right smack in the middle of this enticing out of control story about love and deceit.Highly recommended for arthouse audiences who have no fear of watching bleak depressing yet very passionate stories. This is wild stuff! Gotta spread the word around about this forgotten hard hitting gem!".

In a way it is unfair to single out the capital of Argentina but since this story happens to be based there it our only reference point as explained by Pablo Trapero with a warning before presenting the story.Sosa a lawyer who has lost his license is now working with an firm that specializes in litigation of victims. After the insurance companies pay the indemnization the unscrupulous lawyers that tried the case give the actual victims only a small portion of what was due to them pocketing the rest of the money. Sosa's boss Casal employs Sosa who is desperate to get back on his feet although he has all the intentions to cheat Sosa of what is due to him. Casal operates with the corrupt police chief who is into the scam himself big time. There is an awful lot of money to be made out of the illegal activity.During his night rounds Sosa meets a young doctor Lujan assigned to an ambulance. It becomes clear Sosa likes the young woman from the start. Lujan in turn has a dark secret of her own something which she is not too proud of. It does not take Lujan a long time to realize what Sosa is doing. In spite of her realization she is helpless to do anything when the people that want Sosa's activities get to her threatening to harm her. As Sosa is putting his own scheme to elude his tormentors he becomes another victim of a traffic accident.Pablo Trapero directed this dark film in which corruption is exposed in a sector of society that is vulnerable because the horrible way people drive and the vultures that prey on the victims themselves. Mr. Trapero also contributed to the script. We had admired two of his previous films El Bonaerense and Leonera. He is a man that is interested in the small guy lost in a society that has little use for him. His stories are almost always set far from glamorous settings and devoid of elegance. Working with Ricardo Darin right after his success with The Secret in Their Eyes must have been quite a challenge for both the star and the director. Mr. Darin whose style is more cerebral here must endure some beatings as well as being asked for more physical action. Martina Gusman plays Lujan the ambulance doctor that ends up falling for an unlikely kind of man. Technically Carancho has some incredible special effects that keeps the viewer thinking how real they appear. All the action is captured by Julian Apezteguia the cinematographer who works with the dark colors of an action that takes place almost always at night.".

Or was it precisely because she was an addict that she could take seriously such a badnews boyfriend? The movie began to deteriorate when it came to be all about thugs and goons threatening and roughing up this misbegotten pair.

	schema:headline " More than an exercise in malebashing";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives. Directed by Ridley Scott who directed the science fiction classics Alien 1979 and Blade Runner 1982 Thelma and Louise is an onthelam chick flick with chase scenes a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969 somewhat akin to Wild at Heart 1990 and Natural Born Killers 1994 but without the gratuitous violence of those films. Ridley Scott walks the razor edge between femmeexploitation and serious social commentary. Incidentally the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote Something to Talk About 1995 and Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood 2002 which should give you an idea of how men are depicted here.Susan Sarandon is Louise a thirtysomething Arkansas waitress with an attitude and some emotional baggage and Geena Davis is Thelma a cloistered ingenue housewife with a yearning to breath free. Both do an outstanding job and carry the film from beginning to end. The characters they play are wellrounded and fully developed and sympathetic in contrast to the men in the film who are for the most part merely clichs or in the case of Darryl Christopher McDonald Thelma's boorish husband or the trolllike truck driver burlesques.I have never seen Geena Davis better. Her unique style is melded very well into a naive woman who never had a chance to express herself but goes hog wild and seems a natural at it when the time comes. Sarandon is also at the top of her game and plays the crusty worldly wise vulnerable Louise with tenderness and understanding. Note by the way her pinned up in back hairstyle directly lifted from TV's Polly Holliday Kiss my grits! who appeared as a waitress in the seventies sitcoms Alice and Flo.Harvey Keitel plays the almost sympathetic cop Hal Slocumb and Brad Pitt appears as J. D. a sweettalking twentysomething who gives Thelma the script for robbing 711s as he steals more than her libido.This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its institutions symbolized in the wideopen spaces of the American Southwest while representing the on again off again incompatibility of the male and female heart. The malebashing is done with a touch of humor and the targets are richly deserving of what they get. The ending is perhaps too theatrical and frankly unrealistic but opinions may differ.Best and most telling quick scene is when Thelma phones Darryl to see if he has found out about their escapades. Weasellike he is trying to help the cops locate them but he is so transparent to her that all she has to do is hear his voice. He knows she says to Louise and hangs up.Best visual is when the black police helicopter appears suddenly menacingly like a giant fly beneath the horizon of the Grand Canyon. Also excellent were the all those squad cars lined up like armored battalions aimed at the girls on the run.I also liked the scenes at the motel with J.D. and Louise's boyfriend. They were beautifully directed and cut and very well conveyed by Sarandon and Davis depicting two contrasting stages in malefemale relationships.See this for Geena Davis because she was brilliant vividly alive and never looked better.".

	schema:reviewBody "For many years now women have taken power into their own hands. So I am sure the women that campaigned for freedom and liberty would have loved the movie 'Thelma and Louise'. The tradition of the American road trip is shown in such a refreshing way in this movie with its two lead characters people who are fed up with life and no longer take any crap from the men that they live with or that they meet. Thelma and Louise is a film that will make you feel warm but also leave a some what 'bittersweet' taste in your mouth.Thelma and Louise are best friends on a desperate flight across the American Southwest after a tragic incident at a roadside bar. With determined detective Hal on their trail a sweettalking hitchhiker called 'J.D.' in their path and a string of crimes in their wake their journey alternates between a hilarious highoctane joy ride and an empowering personal odyssey... even as the law closes in.'Thelma and Louise' are exceptionally well written characters for the bigscreen. Callie Khouri wrote a fascinating script capturing the 'female power' beautifully. But it is in her characters that I like the most. While I had feelings for both Thelma and Louise I also wanted the pair to get caught and part of me also loved what made the pair the individuals that they were. This is all from the great work of Khouri who is an intelligent screenwriter. I have watched this film a couple of weeks after viewing another of Callie's movies 'Something to talk about' another movie from the female point of view that both sexes can enjoy.Yet Callie's screenplay would have been a waste if the actors did not play their part properly. The main stars here are Thelma Geena Davis and Louise Susan Sarandon who are some what fed up with the life that they are living and plan a trip to get away from everything. Things soon start to get out of hand for the women and when trouble causes them have shoot and kill somebody the fun really starts. In fact from the time that this incident begins and concludes the movie to the very end was for me one great joy ride.Davis and Sarandon share a great bond on the film. Thelma and Louise are great friends but completely different characters in their own right. Davis plays a ditsy sort of character who is nave but becomes an individual once again after the men in her life have been nothing but tragedy after tragedy. Then with Sarandon I got the feeling that she was the one that had the 'balls' out of the two making her best friend realise that they should stand for no crap anymore. It was a shame that neither actress won an academy award for their role but of course they were up against a great performer in another 1991 movie that being Jodie Foster in 'Silence of the Lambs'. If foster was not there I am certain that one of these two would have walked away with an academy award.Yet there are other cast members that need to be highlighted from 'Thelma and Louise'. I enjoyed what DJ Brad Pitt brought to the film. He was a character that I trusted but like the girls I was scorned after working out how bad he was. Then there is Louise's love interest Jimmy Michael Madison who shows his girlfriend glimpses of what she is trying to escape and that being married to him would be a mistake. Then to round the cast of this film is Police detective Hal played by Hollywood legend Harvey Keitel. Hal is genuinely interested in working out the situation with the girls but realises that these are extraordinary women in an extraordinary situation.'Thelma and Louise' is well directed by Oscar winning director Ridley Scott. I feel that he brought out the road trip of the girls well making it really interesting for the viewer as we want to know what is going to happen as the girls go from one situation to another. Scott also helps to define what makes the girls tick as individuals and to why they are such great friends. He also makes it easy for his audience to understand what theses girls are doing is necessary to their freedom and survival.I also like the locations that were chosen and shot for this movie showing off much of America that we rarely get the chance to see. The American west which is where the majority of the film takes place looks partly like a fun place to live but also a place that holds great danger for the girls. Thelma also emphasises that going through 'Texas' is completely out of the picture. Then when the girls are really on the run we get the chance to see some of the great cannons that America has to offer. The camera work by cinematographer Adrian Biddle is exceptional and makes wonder what it would be like to visit such a part of the world.There is a lot to like about this movie. Things like its style story lingo characters and conclusion which are all captivating. I feel that the audience of this movie is on an intoxicating sort of ride here by the sort adventure that 'Thelma and Louise' allows us to experience. We are affected by what affects this pair. Well I know I was anyway. This movie also proves by creating more problems you do not make the situation you are in better but much worse. Nevertheless it looks like fun to be on the run!CMRS gives 'Thelma and Louise' 4.5 Very Good  Brilliant Film".

Louise waits tables at the local diner and is also waiting on boyfriend Jimmy Michael Madsenwho is always traveling and seems destined to never settle down. Thelma is a sexually repressed housewife who lives at home with a selfimportant husband Christopher McDonald who doesn't seem to care much for her at all except when she is not fulfilling her housewife duties like having diner made and the house cleaned.It is no wonder these two decide to take a trip for the weekend to the mountains to get away for awhile and have fun. Of course there is an event that happens not long after they have started their journey and right after said event things quickly spiral out of control as the two girls find themselves racing for Mexico with the law quickly on their heels.This movie could've been just another boring road picture but both Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon along with a fine script and clever pacing by director Ridley Scott make it much better. Davis and Sarandon have great chemistry together and the script is loaded with offbeat humor to go along with its clever story. The movie is never boring because Ridley Scott makes it so by slowing the pace down at the right moments and then picking it back up when necessary. I enjoyed all the characters including the minor ones which included a cameo by Brad Pitt as the young hitchhiker JD who Thelma quickly falls in lust with.Some people may see this as the ultimate female picture but I think it is more than that. Harvey Keitel is the inspector on the case who believes that these girls really aren't as bad as some may think and his character is interesting as well because he seems to understand why everything involving the girls has lead up to this series of unfortunate events. Michael Madsen as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy also adds depth to his role as a man who though upset with what Louise is going to do understands and loves her still. These two characters add something more to the story which makes it less of a feminist picture without once taking away from the two leads. If that was even possible.My only gripe with the movie would be the ending. Not the way it ended but how quickly it rushed to the end credits. I for one like Roger Ebert who stated the same thing in his review of the movie believe that the ending should of lasted a little longer before fading out. That's my only problem and it's the only reason why the movie doesn't get a perfect score from me.".

I thought this was a great drama and the acting was superb. No one can deny that this movie is a classic and has influenced the English language. I would also like to mention that I am a man. In response to people who bash the movie saying that it is antimale I would like to say that Thelma and Louise is simply a movie about situations that happen to women all too often. Women are raped everyday and women are abused everyday this movie brings that into the light and says that it is not good enough. I do not believe that shooting the rapist was justified but at least he did not get away with it. The movie shows that by running away from your problems things only get worse. People have also commented that there are no men that are not portrayed negatively. Both the sympathetic police officer and Jimmy are likable characters. The purpose of this film was not to celebrate masculinity but to show two women breaking free from oppression. Not all women are raped or abused but it is something that is very common and it is relevant enough to be a theme of a movie.I was very moved by the movie and I gave it a 910".

Here he succeeded very well his way to the roadmovie and this one is listed among the best roadmovies ever made. At first look the story looks simple and without too many claims two young women Thelma and Louise are going out for the weekend with the firm intention of having a ball. But what they don't know is that this drive will soon become a descent into hell... The movie is worth seeing for its two main actresses Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis both outstanding and what interests Ridley Scott is their temperament and their evolution during the movie. At the beginning a sensitive and fragile Thelma is next to a energetic and realistic Louise but in the second part of the movie more precisely after Thelma burglarized a shop probably the best sequence in the whole movie in order to grab money roles are reversed. This is an occasion to make out Louise's wounds and weaknesses. So don't rely too much on appearances... Thelma and Louise is also a movie where Scott takes a lucid look on the hidden side of the American society and especially on men. Scott introduces them to us with their worst faults either they're macho Darryl obscene the truck driver perverse the rapist or coward the cop. The only one saved is Harvey Keitel who never falls into the caricature of the American cop usually described to us as merciless or obsequious. Here he shows understanding and even compassion towards the two runaways notably Louise because he knows that she hides a terrible secret. A dynamic and panting movie where laugh and sorrow are skillfully married.".

They refer to 90's icons Thelma Dickinson Geena Davis and Louise Sawyer Suran Sarandon an aging waitress and a 'desperate housewife' before a series would turn the term into some cocktaildrinking gossipy upperclass girls.They get a life indeed but what the tagline doesn't say is that they get death too. But what an extra after the twoday ride they had many people live without actually living these two women pushed the notion of being free to its most extreme form and when they decide to take the big jump we're taken by many contradicting sentiments but one of them isn't disbelief because Sarandon and Davis gave life to two extraordinary persons who found themselves. I never really got why the American Film Institute nominated them in the Top 50 heroes' list but a last viewing convinced me the final sacrifice sealed their status as cinematic icons.But aside from the existential aspect of the film which like the best road movies focuses on the journey rather than the destination there's the performances. Lesser acting more clichs or directing  la pseudorebellious 2010's way would have ruined the film. Indeed if there's anything Thelma and Louise exemplifies is how low feminism has sunk today by making everything a matter of being like men well this is exactly what Ridley Scott's film is not but he's a man so what does he know? The fashion of genderoriented movies today is to prove that women are as much capable of men but thankfully we don't need a female cop or a female truck driver for the film we have pretty wellestablished archetypes only this time they're explored from a female standpoint.The waitress isn't just here to cheer up the depressed visitors she gives her personal insights about the rapist and her lack of surprise that he ended up being shot reveals how much of human nature she knows. Now a word about the rapist at first he's your usual womanizer and Thelma is obviously responsive to his charm but we're not fooled it's not his talk but the fact that he seemed to care for her to be sensitive. Thelma left her door wide open so when she was caught in the trap it was too late he couldn't believe a woman who gave herself so easily was suddenly playing 'hard to get' that's why he was totally deaf to her cries and pleas until Louise's gun made him come to his senses. Still why would he sign his own death warrant by letting these last words slip off his mouth.That's the key he didn't anticipate a reaction. This is a man who had such a low perception of women that in no way he felt endangered and that was Louise's epiphany. Obviously raping is the most cowardly and bestial way to assert male power in the physical way Louise knew that and saw her friend in state of helplessness if even the gun didn't insert some sense in his mind then he would do the same thing again. So she killed him and she didn't feel happy about it. This is the hitormiss moment of the film but it works because Sarandon puts so much truth in her acting that you can almost feel some intern brainstorm at that very moment. Was she right or not? Never mind she did what he expected the least and involuntarily setting the pattern for the next moves.This is what the ending is about too this is what everything is about unpredictability it starts with two women going fishing then they must flee to Mexico then circumstances force them to derail their road a young Brad Pitt also manages to lure naive Thelma in his net and steal the money forcing them to rely on a robbery and then the encounter with a young cop makes them commit an irreparable offense and force them to leave a state and blow their cover. But these scenes aren't just time fillers they allow one character to finally blossom Thelma stops being that naive Southern housewife who falls for the first schmuck to a natural gunwielder and a crazy confident girl who neutralizes the ultimate macho symbol a cop and makes him weep like a ballerina.I don't feel like polluting this review by mentioning the recent Ghostbusters movie but the equivalent of a Thelma and Louise today would show female truck drivers acting the same toward men instead of women giving a lesson of decency we wouldn't have comprehensive men like Louise's boyfriend played by Michael Madsen or the cop played by Harvey Keitel all the guys would've been as rude as Thelma's husband Christopher McDonald wimpy as the cop or disgusting like the truck driver and Louise would be a lesbian nothing wrong with that of course but the point is to show that they had nothing against men in the first place. But that today's audience consider a film like Ghostbusters feminist is an insult to real feminism like Thelma and Louise a film that doesn't say that women are little things but that it's the way men look at them and it's up to them to make a difference by acting big which doesn't mean acting like men.It's one extreme case of course but a real staple on empowering movies an instant classic that was parodied a few years after its release in The Simpsons or Wayne's World that's the mark of iconic movies. When I was kid I stopped watching it after an hour because the ad on TV made me believe it was a fun movie it just got too dark after the rape the killing and the robbery it took me some time to rewatch it but I think I always knew there was something special about this film.".

This is a man who had such a low perception of women that in no way he felt endangered and that was Louise's epiphany. Obviously raping is the most cowardly and bestial way to assert male power in the physical way Louise knew that and saw her friend in state of helplessness if even the gun didn't insert some sense in his mind then he would do the same thing again. So she killed him and she didn't feel happy about it. This is the hitormiss moment of the film but it works because Sarandon puts so much truth in her acting that you can almost feel some intern brainstorm at that very moment. Was she right or not? Never mind she did what he expected the least and involuntarily setting the pattern for the next moves.This is what the ending is about too this is what everything is about unpredictability it starts with two women going fishing then they must flee to Mexico then circumstances force them to derail their road a young Brad Pitt also manages to lure naive Thelma in his net and steal the money forcing them to rely on a robbery and then the encounter with a young cop makes them commit an irreparable offense and force them to leave a state and blow their cover. But these scenes aren't just time fillers they allow one character to finally blossom Thelma stops being that naive Southern housewife who falls for the first schmuck to a natural gunwielder and a crazy confident girl who neutralizes the ultimate macho symbol a cop and makes him weep like a ballerina.I don't feel like polluting this review by mentioning the recent Ghostbusters movie but the equivalent of a Thelma and Louise today would show female truck drivers acting the same toward men instead of women giving a lesson of decency we wouldn't have comprehensive men like Louise's boyfriend played by Michael Madsen or the cop played by Harvey Keitel all the guys would've been as rude as Thelma's husband Christopher McDonald wimpy as the cop or disgusting like the truck driver and Louise would be a lesbian nothing wrong with that of course but the point is to show that they had nothing against men in the first place. But that today's audience consider a film like Ghostbusters feminist is an insult to real feminism like Thelma and Louise a film that doesn't say that women are little things but that it's the way men look at them and it's up to them to make a difference by acting big which doesn't mean acting like men.It's one extreme case of course but a real staple on empowering movies an instant classic that was parodied a few years after its release in The Simpsons or Wayne's World that's the mark of iconic movies. When I was kid I stopped watching it after an hour because the ad on TV made me believe it was a fun movie it just got too dark after the rape the killing and the robbery it took me some time to rewatch it but I think I always knew there was something special about this film.";

	schema:headline " At least now I'm having some fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Back in the 30s and 40s there was a kind of movie known as the women's picture. These were typically romantic dramas told from a female perspective and while they often featured headstrong intelligent women at least by the standards of typical portrayals they would often have some kind of moral at the end about being a loyal and obedient wife as a kind of final goal in a woman's life. It was a long time even years after the era of women's lib that patriarchy in the movies began to be completely deconstructed. The subject of women driven to murder by the actions of men was not a new one when Thelma  Louise was made in 1991. But if you look at a picture like Play Misty for Me from two decades earlier where a used woman becomes the antagonist in a Psychotype thriller or I Spit on your Grave 1978 in which a woman's revenge for being raped could only be shown in a lurid exploitation movie we can see how far the perspective has had to shift.Thelma  Louise brilliantly scripted by Callie Kouri gives an explanation for violence by women towards men and it does so with amazing simplicity. There are no explicit arguments made. No character makes an overt feminist statement  the closest it comes to that is a bytheway reminder by Geena Davis to the abducted policeman to be nice to his wife. The message as it were is up there in the screen as the story takes place. And although the basic outline of Thelma  Louise is very much outoftheordinary for most women if you break it down moment by moment the men they encounter and the exchanges they have are very much on the near side of normal.A lot of Thelma  Louise's power is in its magnificent cast. Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have a remarkable realism that demonstrates a great rapport between the two characters. When they laugh together it's the laughter of two friends. Sarandon is brilliant at keeping that mystery to her character  the secret in Louise's past is bubbling under the surface of her performance long before it is revealed to the audience. Davis does an excellent job of showing character development growing from the sheltered housewife into an independent woman comfortable with her newfound criminality. And it's neat how her sense of playfulness remains somehow consistent even as she changes. There are plenty of decent supporting performances as well. Brad Pitt was obviously chosen primarily for his youthful good looks but he can act with it. Michael Madsen is very good too intimidating in his controlled anger but radiating a presence that makes his attractiveness to Louise understandable.The movie is directed by that meticulous craftsman Ridley Scott. He manages the movement in the frame with expert control for the right effect. In the opening scenes the camera follows Sarandon around the chaos of the caf. As she moves into a backroom during her phone call to Davis the movement in the background tails off but is kept going by the chef juggling a can and then as she moves across further the backdrop becomes the tranquil fish tank. These naturallooking setups are carefully controlling the mood of the image. As this road movie progresses the backgrounds become increasingly wide open and breathtakingly beautiful in line with the spirits of its protagonists. Scott culminates all this with some wonderful stylisation in the final action sequence. The movie would be in danger of becoming overly technical if it wasn't for his almost constant focus on Davis and Sarandon's faces such as their quiet smiles as they cross Monument Valley by night.For all its feminist modernity as a type of movie Thelma  Louise treads familiar ground. The story of sympathetic criminals running free across the country as fate closes in can be seen in such classics as High Sierra 1941 Bonnie and Clyde 1967 and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969. Really the only major difference here is that the criminals are both women not a couple of male hoods or a gangster and his moll. And yet all it takes is this simple gender substitution to speak volumes about the experience of women in this society. That it does so without resorting to sermonising and keeping up a healthy feeling of fun makes Thelma  Louise an outstanding motion picture.".

Harlan has a plan though gets Thelma into the parking lot and tries to get her to have sex with him. When she is unwilling he tries to rape her.

The upset friends runs away and suddenly the fishing trip has turned into a run from the law. But at the same times as the net closes in around them they feel more free than ever.Comments One way to put it this is a road movie running down two parallel roads at he same time. Both a simple movie with fugitives running from the law but also a much more deep and complex movie about two women trapped in their ordinary lives that finally at last take charge of their own lives. Unfortunately they had to break the law to do it and someone died in the process. Two strong leading ladies Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon that really carries this movie in a superb way. Especially Davis manages to show the transformation of Thelma from a tied up housewife through several stages were she basically get cheated and tricked by all men in her life a woman taken advantage of to a woman that is strong free and takes control of her life. And a criminal. Louise's trip or transformation is less pronounced though she reaches the same conclusion going back is not an option.Not to forget they are not alone in making this movie. First off at the base is a really good script a script that Ridley Scott handles really well. Some shots are really beautiful and I like the circle he draws by opening and almost ending with the same scene. At least according to the trivia he really made some great decisions and used some good tricks to rally make this movie as good as it is. And Brad Pitt have a small but rememberable part.710".

At least according to the trivia he really made some great decisions and used some good tricks to rally make this movie as good as it is. And Brad Pitt have a small but rememberable part.710";

	schema:reviewBody "Thelma  Louise is not only a classic road movie but also one of the most entertaining journeys to ever hit the big screen. Its delicious combination of drama action and comedy is brilliantly balanced to create a story that delivers sufficient humour warmth and exhilaration to ensure that its commentary about sexual oppression never gets so heavyhanded that it detracts from the enjoyment of watching this special film. Oscarwinning screenwriter Callie Khouri deserves great credit for achieving this balance and also for the quality of her script which is intelligent and witty and contains numerous quotable remarks.Timid housewife Thelma Dickinson Geena Davis and hardworking waitress Louise Sawyer Susan Sarandon take off on a weekend vacation together to have some fun and escape their tedious daily lives. Their trip begins well and they're soon in high spirits. Things change dramatically however after they stop at a roadside bar where Thelma has a few too many drinks and enjoys flirting with a local redneck who takes her out to the parking lot where he tries to rape her. Louise follows the couple outside and successfully rescues her friend by threatening the attacker with a gun. When the man continues to be verbally abusive the keyedup Louise shoots and kills him and the women immediately go on the run because Louise knows for sure that the police would never believe their account of what happened.The two women decide to head for a new life in Mexico and the police and the FBI gather information from Thelma's husband Darryl Christopher McDonald. Louise contacts her boyfriend Jimmy Michael Madsen and he subsequently brings her life savings to her. On their travels the women meet a handsome drifter called J.D. Brad Pitt and Thelma spends a night with him in her motel room where he describes the method that he regularly uses for robbing convenience stores. Next day Thelma's initial state of euphoria suddenly changes when she realises that J.D. has disappeared with all their money and so to compensate for the loss she robs a convenience store using the same method she'd learnt from J.D.Later an encounter with a state trooper ends when the women hold him at gunpoint and lock him in the trunk of his squad car and on another occasion they take revenge on a tanker driver who persistently makes obscene gestures at them by blowing up his entire rig. Their noholdbarred journey then continues in the same vein until it eventually reaches its spectacular and very appropriate conclusion.With one exception the men in Thelma  Louise are an appalling collection of characters whose conduct is portrayed as being the trigger for the women's need to escape and it's ironic that the times when the two friends feel most excited and powerful is after having indulged in the types of criminal actions which are most often perpetrated by men.Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are magnificent in their roles as the two women who've both been treated very cruelly by men and the supporting performances from Brad Pitt Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel as the only decent man featured are all excellent. Christopher McDonald provides a lot of laughs with his overthetop mannerisms and Keitel's reactions to them are equally funny.Thelma  Louise with its wide open spaces and atmospheric music is visually very strong and intelligently paced. It's a marvellous piece of entertainment and unsurprisingly has maintained its popularity consistently over the years since its initial release.".

Cell phone doesn't work no payphones around no phones of ANY kind no Television or radio none of the modern conveniences that we take for granted these days...I love SciFi futuristicky kinda stuff.

	schema:reviewBody "Frankenstein Unbound is one of those movies that is almost impossible to categorize. Part horror part science fiction part fantasy and part comedy. And what is even more interesting is the cast of all stars. Roger Corman is able to put all of these together to form a truly mesmerizing film that you will never forget.It is in the future. John Hurt plays Dr. Joe Buchanan a slightly mad scientist who has developed a weapon for the government that harness's the power of a black hole. In the process he has inadvertently created a worm hole that might destroy the world. On his way home from work Buchanan is sucked into the hole and sent back in time to Europe 1812. It is here he meets Victor Frankenstein played wonderfully by Raul Julia and discovers that the story of Frankenstein's Monster is in fact a true story.I believe what makes this movie so much fun is that as serious as the story appears to take itself it is actually rather humorous. Most of the scenes with the Monster in them are actually laugh out loud funny. There are a few scenes with the monster that just need to be seen to be fully understood as most of the movie is quite a bleak comedy. The ending to the movie is truly one of the bleakest endings I have ever seen.For a Roger Corman film this is really well done. John Hurt and Raul Julia really compliment each other in this movie. It is too bad that Bridget Fonda and Jason Patric didn't have bigger roles in the movie as their characters are fascinating as well.Well I certainly enjoyed this film. I have watched it countless times throughout the years and I still have not grown tired of it. For me truly a timeless film that I will watch many more times. 910".

In the process he has inadvertently created a worm hole that might destroy the world. On his way home from work Buchanan is sucked into the hole and sent back in time to Europe 1812. It is here he meets Victor Frankenstein played wonderfully by Raul Julia and discovers that the story of Frankenstein's Monster is in fact a true story.I believe what makes this movie so much fun is that as serious as the story appears to take itself it is actually rather humorous. Most of the scenes with the Monster in them are actually laugh out loud funny. There are a few scenes with the monster that just need to be seen to be fully understood as most of the movie is quite a bleak comedy. The ending to the movie is truly one of the bleakest endings I have ever seen.For a Roger Corman film this is really well done. John Hurt and Raul Julia really compliment each other in this movie. It is too bad that Bridget Fonda and Jason Patric didn't have bigger roles in the movie as their characters are fascinating as well.Well I certainly enjoyed this film. I have watched it countless times throughout the years and I still have not grown tired of it. For me truly a timeless film that I will watch many more times. 910";

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit I enjoyed this film and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. This is only the second Roger Corman film I've seen so far and therefore I can only really compare it to the other film I saw by him The Terror. I can clearly recognize the directing style and basic filmmaking style but I must say that this is better than The Terror. The plot is pretty good and fairly interesting and more original than most other films dealing with Frankenstein. It has a decent enough pace I wasn't bored for the 90 minutes it lasted. The script is fairly good too a good twist on the original Frankenstein story though I guess some fans of the original story wouldn't like the various changes. The acting is good enough both John Hurt and Raul Julia gives pretty good performances and the rest of the cast is decent. The characters are fairly wellwritten and credible. The film has a fairly bad name it seems yes the monster does look more like the result of genetic mutation or something similar rather than a creature built together by human bodies and arguably the film has several violent scenes that seem to be there mainly to add violence rather than substance to the film but apart from that the film is pretty good at least worth a watch if only one watch. The effects are decent enough at least for a film from 1990. The makeup effects and such were also pretty good I must say that the monster's face especially the eyes did send a chill through my spine the first time he was shown. I liked the various science fiction aspects of the film and the social commentary was very good too. The ending was a little weird but it was a fairly good climax. All in all a decent enough science fictionhorror drama and worth one watch if you can catch it for free. I recommend it to fans of Roger Corman and openminded fans of Frankenstein andor horror films in general just be prepared that it won't be an incredible or very memorable film just an entertaining 90 minutes if you're into violent movies without any real purpose. 610".

The monster was real creepy and he actually talks. All in all a very good movie I highly recommend.

This was his first film in nearly twenty years and he does a nice job with it surprisingly. Based on the novel by fantasyscifi author Brian W. Aldess this film works because it takes the classic horror story and makes it relevant in modern times. A scientist named Joe Bodenland creates a nuclear device which causes much destruction and some of the effects of it causes him to blast back through time to another land in which Mary Shelley and Dr. Frankenstein and his creature coexist. He is repulsed at Dr. Frankenstein's actions but when he tries to put a stop to them he is stopped by his own hypocrisy. For both men have created something that has caused great destruction upon the earth.It's talky and philosophical but on the other hand so was the Shelley book and this film follows in the spirit of the classic novel. John Hurt gives a stunning performance as Joe especially at the end when he and the Creature are blasted far into another time that has been destroyed. We soon learn that this chaos and disorder is a result of his nuclear device and when Joe realizes his monster has destroyed the whole world he looks at the Creature who is demanding to know his identity and says I am....Frankenstein. Hurt does a nice job in this role.The late Raul Julia has little to do as Dr. Frankenstein besides look demented and act insane and he does a good job as usual. Nick Brimble as the Creature also lends support portraying the part cleverly....This monster believes all people on the earth are creations of Dr. Frankenstein so what difference does it make whether or not he kills them? It's sort of innocence combined with rage and ignorance. Not since Karloff as the Creature appeared so frightening. Bridget Fonda and Jason Patric also do well as Mary Shelley and Lord Byron who appear sort of as Joe's consciences.The ending is also depressingly disturbing and it will leave you thinking. All in all Corman directs with crispness and cunning that he lacked in his earlier lowbudgeted films. Perhaps he was a nineties director who was born a generation too early. At any rate he does fine here and if you're looking for a nice horror film that will challenge you as well as frighten you give this one a try. out of ".

And in doing so wouldn't she have changed certain parts of the story or even added the character of Dr. Buchanan into it? One's mind reels at the possibilities.Focusing on that aspect of Frankenstein Unbound would have been provocative enough but the film gets deeper into science fiction territory with Buchanan's particle beam weapon and it's side effects of missing persons time slips and weather disturbances. The number of throwaway scenes that did nothing to propel the story forward surprised me starting with that warrior on horseback that appeared when the youngsters were burying the outmoded bicycle. Buchanan himself hallucinates a couple of dream sequences that don't connect to anything and have no bearing on what eventually happens.Dr. Frankenstein Raul Julia is an interesting character. Disturbed and protective of his creation at the same time it's ironic that he takes no responsibility in the face of an innocent girl's death by hanging for the murder of his younger brother. To him his only rationalization can be  I'm a scientist I cannot sin... Probably a plus the film doesn't dwell on the creation of The Monster he's certainly creepy enough without appearing to be a patch job of multiple bodies to this viewer he calls to mind my vision of the Swamp Thing. Ironically the transformation of Elizabeth into the Bride of Frankenstein is visually stunning and a closer tribute to the original in her brief appearance.Ultimately though it seems the film stumbled around to come up with an appropriate ending and I'm not so sure that was achieved. The character of Buchanan was just as much a villain as Frankenstein and The Monster itself so having him wend his way far off to the futuristic city just left me with question marks. Perhaps that was meant to be his punishment along with making him walk instead of taking his trusty talking carriage.".

As far as I am concerned even though the story clearly does not precisely follow Shelly's tale it is by far truest to the underlying depth of the book and quite possibly the only film version that captures her primary theme of personal responsibility. The acting all around was good especially considering some of the stretches required and I quite enjoyed the special effects. Without going to wild extremes they were subtly effective and quite haunting. There were of course a few of Corman's trademark touches but they fit the story so well even I could find no objection.

He has had an amazing ability as a producer and director to make the absolute most of every single pennymaking amazingly good films for rockbottom prices. This was his first time directing in almost two decadesand that's more than enough reason to see the film.This version of Frankenstein is different than most because of instead of setting it about the time of Mary Shelly's novel in the early 19th century this one sets the story in the near futureat least in the beginning. However this scifi aspect the gorgeous scenery as well as some decent actors requiring higher salaries make this a film that MUST have been relatively expensive for a Corman film. Unfortunately IMDb does not list what the film cost to make.Dr. Joe Buchanan John Hurt is a guy who makes weapons for the Defense Department! However his weapon has weird side effects and inexplicably transports him and his majorly cool car to 1817where he meets up with Dr. Frankenstein! Now I sure didn't see THAT coming! What makes this more interesting is that this is not some parallel worldthere really was a Dr. Frankenstein AND Buchanan gets to also meet Mary Shelleythe lady who wrote the novel! It seems that her inspiration was very close to the bookthe doctor DID work on reviving the dead. However unlike the reckless guy in the novel this doctor was not irresponsible...he was EVIL! So you get to see Buchanan interacting with both the author and her worthless friends Byron and Percy Shelley as well as the monster and the mad doctor! It's all VERY strangebut oddly interesting.Is this a great film? No. The ending is pretty coolbut also pretty weird and out there! But what I really appreciate is that it took the original story and completely redid it in an interesting and novel manner. Worth seeing and STRANGE!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Corman hadn't directed a film for a long long time when he resurfaced in 1990 with Frankenstein Unbound instead he had been busy producing various exploitation potboilers. This science fiction travesty is taken from a Brian Aldiss novel and upon viewing it one of the first things that springs to mind is the question of why Corman would choose to return to the director's seat for a film as terrible as this. The script is all over the place in terms of logic and the sets costumes and makeup have a startlingly cheap and amateurish look about them. The final insult is that a cast of fine talented stars have been somehow lured into the project and then wasted by the evidentlyrusty director.In 2031 a scientist named Buchanan John Hurt invents a weapon that is capable of imploding other objects. Unknown to its creator the weapon is so technologically powerful and sophisticated that when used it causes timeslips to appear. Buchanan and his futuristic car are sucked through one of these time slips and find themselves travelling back to 19th Century Switzerland. At an inn Buchanan meets a man named Victor Frankenstein Raul Julia and immediately recognises his name from the famous Mary Shelley novel. Later Buchanan runs into Mary Shelley Bridget Fonda herself as well as her famous literary contemporaries Lord Byron Jason Patric and Percy Shelley Michael Hutchence. It emerges that Mary's book was not a work of fiction as supposed and that she got her ideas by witnessing Frankenstein working to create a real monster. The monster Nick Brimble is brought to life and wreaks the usual havoc upon the local peasants ripping out hearts and smashing heads with incredible power. The monster is also furious that his creator has not made him a mate and by way of revenge kills Frankenstein's fiance Elizabeth Catherine Rabett.Frankenstein Unbound is an example of selfindulgent lunacy that simply doesn't work. The time travelling aspects of the story remind one of the Back To The Future movies but the similarities end there. When the supposed horror aspects take over the film goes horribly wrong. There is nothing remotely frightening about it and were it not for a few moments of gore chests being ripped apart heads getting knocked off etc. the film would almost be suitable for children! Performance wise virtually every member of the cast fails to do anything worthwhile with their parts  Hurt is totally routine as the scientist from the future Julia chews the scenery embarrassingly as Frankenstein Brimble is buried beneath so much unconvincing makeup that it's impossible to say whether his performance is good or not and the trio of Fonda Hutchence and Patric amble around in front of the camera looking vaguely bemused as the trio of English authors. Frankenstein Unbound is a poor hybrid of oldstyle horror and modernstyle science fiction not even enjoyable for camp value or unintentional laughs. Don't bother with it.".

The only flaw in Buchanan's invention is that it has a tendency to open up one of those timespace continuum thingies in the form of a neonflashing cloud through which the odd Mongol warrior etc has a tendency to pop. Before you know it  and not without the viewer experiencing a certain sense of schadenfraude at his plight  Buchanan finds himself sucked into the portal and spat out again in the Alps of 1816. Him and his car actually  an intelligent talking gullwinged item that looks like KnightRider KITT's sexy sister.Hiding the car in a convenient barn Buchanan wanders off in search of life and happens upon a tavern wherein he finds a certain chap named Frankenstein the late lamented Raul Julia. Strangely enough neither Buchanan or Frankenstein seem in the slightest bit perturbed to discover that the craggyfaced scientist has strayed some 200 years from his own era and strike up a cautious friendship when they realise they are both men of science. Frankenstein has just created his monster Nick Brimble who resembles an overweight redneck trucker in a strong headwind rather than a creature bolted together from spare human parts. The monster has adopted the annoying habit of killing locals including Frankenstein's brother seemingly unable to grasp the fact that unlike him they aren't all creations of the good doctor. A young girl has been accused of the murder and is sentenced to hang for the crime a fact which doesn't bother Frankenstein in the least but which horrifies Buchanan who attempts to enlist the aid of Mary Shelley Bridget Fonda to save the girl. The freeloving writer is in the early stages of writing the Frankenstein novel while enjoying a hippyish summer with George Jason Patric and Percy Michael Hutchence and is quickly taken with this mysterious if rather craggyfaced stranger with the silver horseless carriage. Even back in 1816 it seems a decent set of wheels was enough to pull a bird Frankenstein Unbound was veteran schlockhorror director Roger Corman's first official attempt at directing for nearly twenty years although he did have a hand in the direction of 1978's Deathsport and it's not difficult to understand why he might have been attracted to such a project. There's enough storyline crammed into a scant 82 minutes for three movies and enough subtext to keep the most analytical of viewers absorbed. Having said that Frankenstein Unbound is a movie that never rises above its budgetary constraints and the gradeZ origins of its famous director. A good cast tries manfully  with the notable exception of Fonda who is about as animated as a ventriloquist's dummy in need of a hand up its back  but their characters are never even remotely believable and react to every increasingly hectic plot twist with a total lack of well reaction. Foe example no sooner is Frankenstein's beloved torn asunder by his monstrous creation than he's calmly zapping ten squillion volts through her on the operating table. And peasants who believe in witchcraft tip their hats with only the mildest hint of apprehension or curiosity at Buchanan's sports car as it motors through their cobbled streets.The subtext  that like Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein modernday scientists are at risk of becoming 'an abomination in the eyes of God' as they pursue ever more extreme weapons of defence  is never far from Corman's agenda and is presented with varying degrees of success. It's a message inherent in Shelley's tale and while the finale together with the brief prologue mirrors the beginning and end of Shelley's novel the film abandons any sympathetic attitude toward the monster in order to concentrate on its message. Ultimately the film trips over itself with an unnecessarily confused final sequence in which Buchanan is left alone to face the consequences of his actions.Bottom line interesting idea poorly handled by a director who may have been welladvised to leave the directing and writing duties to someone a touch more accomplished.".

As if things couldn't get any worse the cast themselves although faced with an almost unworkable script never seem to do their characters any justice at all with the exception of Hurt and Fonda. I give special mention to Mr. Brimble who despite having quite a rich role does nothing at all memorable with it and instead gives a performance that you'd rather quickly forget. Oh and what the hell was the designer for the monster thinking? He looked absolutely ridiculous! It was an absolute mess! About the only thing that I found remotely interesting in Frankenstein Unbound was its science special effects and gore. However even these small elements failed to leave any sustaining effect on me as they were very rarely seen. So it is with great pleasure I recommend NOBODY to watch this monster of a film.

There he meets Dr. Frankenstein Raul Julia and finds he DID make a monster who wants a mate. He also runs into Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Bridget Fonda who later became Mary Shelley and wrote Frankenstein George Byron Jason Patric and Percy Shelley Michael Hutchence.What a mess! The story lumbers all over the placeI had no idea where this was going. It looks pretty good but has lousy makeup on the monster and hilariously terrible special effects. The acting is the sole saving grace. Julia is terrible as always but Hurt is good and Fonda Patric and Hutchence are obviously having a GREAT time. Stiil it can't save the movie.This got a lot of notice when it came out in 1990 because it was the first film Roger Corman had directed in about 20 years. All the interest evaporated when people actually SAW the film. I saw it in a totally empty theatre back in 1990! This is a real disaster and has rightfully been forgotten. Only the scenes with Fonda Patric and Hutchence work. Skip this one.".

Therefore I have now inflated that relatively puny amount by 7 'Frankensteins' after all BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1935 is  and is likely to remain  my alltime favorite film! and 4 'Three Musketeers' ones...Anyway one can assume that what made filmmaker extraordinaire Roger Corman step back into the director's chair after a significant absence of 19 years was his desire to not miss out on a chance to finally tackle the mythical Mary Shelley creation on celluloid it should be remembered that during their heyday Corman's employers American International Pictures strangely steered clear of the material despite venturing into many other fantasyrelated literary areas apart from their celebrated Poe cycle there had also emanated from their stable adaptations from Bronte' LeFanu Lovecraft Rice Burroughs Wells and Wilde! Unfortunately although the end result is hardly as negligible as its muted reputation suggests which had led me to bypass its numerous cable TV screninings in the past it eventually put paid to the idea that Corman resume his old dayjob! Actually FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND was not a direct retelling of the original tale but rather Brian W. Aldiss's timehopping futuristic reimagining of it British scifi writer Aldiss is bestknown for having penned the short story which spawned A.I.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2001 the aborted Stanley Kubrick project resurrected after the latter's untimely death and ultimately realized by Steven Spielberg. Once one accepts the preposterous premise  John Hurt is a New York scientist from the year 2031 who through a timeslip of his own making falls into 1816 Geneva complete with his 'strange' attire and stateoftheart talking car! where a series of murders committed by Victor Frankenstein's creature but attributed to waifish Justine Moritz are being tried in the Swiss law courts and witnessed by one young Mary Godwin soontobe Shelley!! Surprisingly enough it was nominated in 4 categories at the U.S.A. Science Fiction academy awards but came out emptyhanded against some formidable competition that included THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and TERMINATOR 2 JUDGEMENT DAY both 1991! The casting is a mixed blessing on the credit side one certainly finds John Hurt curiously but effectively cast as the outoftime American scientist preoccupied by the repercussions his own temporal experiments are having on his real world but hopelessly fascinated by both Frankenstein and Shelley in this past life! Raul Julia making for a suitably brooding and ruthless Baron Bridget Fonda lovely as Mary Shelley the practitioner of free love and amused no end when Hurt provides her with a page off of a 21st century reprint of her asyetunpublished novel! and Catherine Corman the director's own daughter who is quite poignant in her few scenes as the illfated Justine however on the debit side one must put Nick Brimble unfortunately unsympathetic as The Monster saddled as he is with an awful PREDATORlike look he was given an introducing credit despite having already been in the business for 20 years! Jason Patric illatease as Lord Byron Australian rock star Michael Hutchence barely registering at all as the poet Shelley and Catherine Rabett as an even blanderthanusual Elizabeth.Despite being ostensibly an American production the film was completely shot in the Italian region of Lombardia and looks all the better for it and consequently utilizes many crew members from the European continent most prominently distinguished cinematographer Armando Nannuzzi formerly a regular of Luchino Visconti's and composer Carl Davis famous for underscoring several revived classics of American Silent cinema. Another noteworthy American contributor here is coscreenwriter F.X.

Ultimately Roger Corman's FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND proved to be an interesting worthwhile and despite the futuristic trappings a charmingly oldfashioned addition to the neverending cinematic saga of the misguided medico that for all the difference in allocated budget was not far removed qualitywise from the wouldbe definitive Francis Ford CoppolaKenneth Branagh version released in 1994.P.S.

When Hurts character uses a clapper to activate the laser effects in the ending sequence I would have laughed if the movie didn't take itself so seriously. I can't decide if it was a really lame attempt at high camp or a miserable attempt at science fiction. Apart from clap on clap off laser effects projected on the side of a castle I've seen better in gay night clubs there wasn't much to like about this film. I wondered why such high profile actors with such obvious talent agreed to such a bad film. The car was cool though. I wish I could have one of my very own. Maybe I'll watch it again but make sure I'm in an altered state first and then it might seem worth watching.

But  let's face it  it's been more than 30 years since he directed those adorable quickies of his and he certainly 'lost the touch'. In 1990 after nearly twenty years of producing only Roger all of a sudden decided to direct again and he chose for a funky hitech update of the classic Frankenstein tale. Even though the cast is filled with prominent names and even though Corman's filming budget was reasonably high Frankenstein Unbound constantly looks like amateurish garbage. The screenplay adapted from the Brian Aldiss novel attempts to spoof the Frankenstein premise by catapulting 21th century scientist John Hurt back to the 1800's where he encounters the mad doctor Raul Julia. This latter tries to involve the mysterious man from the future and his sorcery tricks in his experiments to create life etc etc... The story is too stupid for words and it's really exaggerated to see how Hurt even succeeds in seducing the legendary female novelist Mary Shelley. The monster looks very unscary and the gore  although plenty of it  fails to entertain. Corman stuffs his film with metaphors that make no sense and there's a complete lack of involvement. The only sequence that slightly pleased me was Raul Julia screaming out his interpretation of the famous It's Alive...It's Alive!!!! words. I still think Roger Corman is a genius for the brilliant Edgar Allen Poe cycle he did in the sixties starring Vincent Price! but this Frankenstein Unbound is one movie you won't ever see me recommending.".

	schema:headline " My extended review of the film";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers limited review due to word limit.This film is an intense character study essentially about emptiness in life. Thomas feels that everything in his life is superficial and he wants to do something more than just take photographs. If he could solve a mystery then his life would have a definite purpose. Therefore he sees what he wants to see and invents a mystery from one of his photographs.What he sees is essentially part of his imagination. There are many factors that indicate this such as his friend the artist who mentions that a detail in a painting is like a clue in a detective story. Thomas plays detective in the film however life is full of distractions and ultimately he is unable to solve the mystery.Time management is a key idea through the film as Thomas is a procrastinator. He knows that there are many things that he needs to do and he uses them as an excuse at one point saying I haven't even got a couple of minutes to have my appendix out even though he fiddles with a coin and just before that he had visited some friends. He has lost his dedication to his work. He does things because they need to be done not because he wants to. He indulges himself in antiques then on the spur of the moment goes to a park.Ultimately Thomas wants to escape from his life. Reminders of escapism follow him about such as a sign that a protester places in his car with the words go away on it. The sign later falls out and is run over by another car indicating how futile trying to escape life is. He meets an antiques dealer who wants out her job and from her he purchases a propeller  a device that can be used to fly away with.Thomas is often presented in an isolated environment whether it be running down alleyways or wandering through a park. He is removed from the world with no real friends or family. At one point he says that he has a wife then he changes his mind and says that they just have kids together. Then he admits that he has no children and that his wife is not beautiful but just easy to live with. Following this he changes his mind once again and says that she is not easy to live with. Thomas wants a family but he does not have one. He wants a wife who need not be beautiful since the models who he photographs are superficially beautiful and children.Thomas feels that his life is empty and his photography  his work  has replaced his sex life. In one scene he photographs a model by sitting on top of her in a sexual position and the things he calls out could be used as expressions during sex. However this is not pleasure for him  it is work. He later indulges himself with group sex but after watching two of his friends making love he realises how meaningless sexuality is for him.For all these reasons Thomas sees what he wants to see  a possible murder  something that he can take credit for. Much of the film involves this notion of seeing what one wants which is represented by the mimes. The mimes are contrasted in the opening sequence against the gloomy England workers. At nighttime Thomas visits the park where he photographed the supposed murder and lo and behold a corpse is lying there. This scene is unrealistic as it is highly unlikely that someone would leave a corpse lying around or that no one else had spotted it yet however Thomas is seeing what he wants to.After visiting the park he tries to find someone who he can confide in about the body. He treks through a building where a rock band is playing along his journey. The fans are mostly just standing or sitting around with blank expressions. Their lives are as empty as Thomas feels that his is. They idolise rock musicians who are crazy and smash their guitars. From there he goes to a party for sophisticated uppermiddle class people however they are mostly smoking dope and wasting away their time. Their lives are empty too.In the morning Thomas visits the park again but he is no longer as excited as he was before and this is shown through his slow pacing and long distance photography. After seeing that others have empty lives  and are happy with them  he is unsure if he should be happy too. In the park there is no longer the body as he not seeing what he wants to see anymore.The mimes return and Thomas watches them 'play' tennis. The camera follows the imaginary ball around. The mimes seem so happy and therefore Thomas joins in when he has a chance. After he throws the ball back to them we can hear tennis rackets hitting a ball. Thomas is still alone and isolated even though he is finally seeing what he wants to see. His life is still empty. There is not much of a resolution to the film and from what there is it is bleak but as a character study it is engaging stuff.The technical side of the film is great  especially the sound in some scenes showing how isolated Thomas is that he can hear soft sounds. Every shot is set up with care and Hemmings is superb. 'Blowup' is not the type of film that will satisfy every taste but it has quite a lot to it.".

	schema:headline " A confusing but thought provoking film!";
	schema:reviewBody "Antonioni was not a director that worried too much about people completely understanding his films. In fact I'd bet that he actually hoped they didn't understand everything. So I did not find it strange or surprising when after finishing the movie I felt quite confused. But the movie made me think for a very long time which in my opinion is what a good film should do. There are so many aspects to this film that if you give them a chance and think about them they will keep you reeling for hours on possible interpretations. The first and probably most important aspect of this film dealt with love. From what I have seen of his films love is Antonioni's favorite subject. But this love was different than that of past films it is much more shallow and uncentered. Thomas the photographer is surrounded by women he goes from one to the next without thinking twice treating them like dogs the entire time. But he can do this and get away with it because he is a famous photographer and can make the women what they all desperately want to be Beautiful. For The first half of the movie I honestly did not like his character whatsoever. Whereas in the past the director has chosen mainly to explore the ups and downs of married life or the problems of being hopelessly devoted to one person he now points the camera at the single care free over sexed youth of the sixties. Half an hour into the movie I found myself wondering what the heart of the film was going to be. We were introduced to Thomas and his world but there seemed to be no conflict driving the story forward. Then came the quasimurder mystery. This is what is really interesting and unique about this film in my opinion. Antonioni for a while leads us to believe that the movie is going to turn into some suspense thriller or murder mystery but never seems to quite get there. He has all the elements ready to go but never follows through with them. He introduces this alluring and mysterious woman who is in on the murder and then never brings her back. The murder victim is discovered but his identity is never revealed nor a motive given for his murder. Thomas after a very energetic and exciting photo investigation seems to not really care too much as to what happens with the investigations results only telling a couple of his friends who couldn't care less. Antonioni seems to have used this whole murder mystery convention as some sort of glue to hold the rest of the real story together. The story of a mindless beauty obsessed celebrity idolizing drug addicted and violence obsessed culture. Probably my favorite scene in the film is after fighting over the piece of broken guitar with the other fans Thomas just discards his prize as garbage. Something that kept bugging me was the antique shop. I kept wondering what in the world it had to do with anything in the movie it stuck out like a sore thumb. But I knew it that there was some major purpose or explanation for its existence in the film and then it just kind of clicked. Upon his first entry into the Antique store Thomas encounters an angry old man who we eventually find out is not the stores real owner the true owner is a beautiful young woman who is planning to sell the old place and travel the world in search of something new. All this stuff she owns the gold of past cultures is old and useless now. She has a hard time making a living because nobody wants the stuff any longer. Here is where I think Antonioni's major message is hidden That is the way life is it moves on constantly things change people die cultures evolve and the only thing that remains in the end is nature itself. Antonioni finishes the film beautifully Thomas stands alone in a large field of grass the only thing heard is the wind and the trees as the camera backs away slowly he disappears leaving nothing but the grass blowing in the wind for like all the antiques and all the people that created them in the past eventually Thomas's life will end and so will the current popular culture in which he takes part. Change is life's only constant.".

Something that kept bugging me was the antique shop. I kept wondering what in the world it had to do with anything in the movie it stuck out like a sore thumb. But I knew it that there was some major purpose or explanation for its existence in the film and then it just kind of clicked. Upon his first entry into the Antique store Thomas encounters an angry old man who we eventually find out is not the stores real owner the true owner is a beautiful young woman who is planning to sell the old place and travel the world in search of something new. All this stuff she owns the gold of past cultures is old and useless now. She has a hard time making a living because nobody wants the stuff any longer. Here is where I think Antonioni's major message is hidden That is the way life is it moves on constantly things change people die cultures evolve and the only thing that remains in the end is nature itself. Antonioni finishes the film beautifully Thomas stands alone in a large field of grass the only thing heard is the wind and the trees as the camera backs away slowly he disappears leaving nothing but the grass blowing in the wind for like all the antiques and all the people that created them in the past eventually Thomas's life will end and so will the current popular culture in which he takes part. Change is life's only constant.";

If you don't connect with the film that is fine but to call it trash is a mistake. Many people try to pin this as being a 60's statement. It is not however. Antonioni was a veteran filmmaker who got lumped in with the new wave scene because he was around at the same time. This was initially a hit though that probably had little to due with it's actual merits as a film.It is the story of an artist. The photographer Thomas who has lost all feeling of passion for his work. He hangs around London taking fashion photographs. He is cruel to his models and other women in his life. He seems interested in other's art but cannot be roused to create any of his own. He will soon be releasing a book of photographs all of which are uninspired photos of the poor sick and dying. While in the park he takes a series of shots he hopes will be a nice epilogue to his collection. They are of a couple playing in the park. These pictures however are not what they seem.Antonioni makes great use of insinuation. He tantalizes us with the possibility of what could have been. In us he insights the same passion that is in Thomas. In the end I don't think he disappears so much as he returns. He does not return as the same person though. He is changed by the passion for his art and the challenge of reality. He is no longer playing the game of catch the murderer or faking the motions of being a photographer or posing as a deep artist by taking sad pictures. He is now truly inspired.Today many people hate Thomas. And with good reason. He is definitely not a nice person but he is one of my favorite antiheroes. There is a scene many people may miss. It is short. He is driving in his car I think after speeding off from some want to be models he turns on the radio and starts bobbing his head and making funny faces to the music. This is the scene that redeems his early self to me. When he is alone we see he still has an innocent streak despite his cruelty. All that being said I only recommend this to the more serious moviegoer. 1010".

Was there or wasn't there a crime being committed in the middle of the day in a London park? Are there any answers and is this whole mystery even worth even investigating? These are questions that are the root of the matter and Michaelangelo Antonioni toys with what happens and what doesn't happen what is what is not what is real and what is unreal. The story if there truly is one moves slowly and deliberately David Hemmings portrays an unsympathetic fashion photographer  he is credited as Thomas but we never hear him called this way  who seems to wallow in his own prowess as a photographer. He treats women like mincemeat  to him they're only objects for his lust as when he meets Veruschka and practically rapes her through a photo shoot  or mannequins who can't pose worth anything and only fuel his anger. He also has a painter friend who's girlfriend Sarah Miles seems to have a certain interest in him but whom he ignores like all other women who come in contact with him. After what turns to be a lousy photo shoot he does some meandering and comes to a park and from a distance witnesses a woman and a man Vanessa Redgrave and Ronan O'Casey in an apparent romantic interlude enjoying the day and the semiprivacy within the park's confines. He takes pictures walks closer takes more pictures walks even closer... almost predatory so much like a voyeur.That is until she sees him and demands he return to her the film roll  he can't take pictures just like that and is against her consent. He declines so and gives her a different film after almost having her beg for it. And a little after halfway through the story he develops his film... and sees what looks to be like a body on the ground the outline of a man with a gun hidden within some thick bushes. And her reaction full of angry surprise.Has he truly photographed a murder in progress? Is he privy to more than he should be and could this have some danger in store for him? Antonioni toys with the audience never letting in on Redgrave's character but letting us experience the world through Hemmings untrustworthy eyes and superficial values that momentarily seem to have been thrown out of whack due to this disquieting incident. The problem is what Hemmings sees may or may not be true  a classic shot where he tries to find Redgrave and he sees her in the middle of a walking crowd and she literally makes an aboutface and disappears from view. Just like that. And his grasp of the mystery emanating from his brush with her at the park like even Hemmings at the end is gone dissolved into the grass.This is not a film for people looking for action and adventure as quite the opposite happens here. It's a film that echoes the French New Wave as it tells a story about an antihero who has a moment of crisis and decides to maybe take action and is left suspended at the end. Influential for Coppola's THE CONVERSATION this is a fascinating puzzle which is missing its last vital piece.".

A wonderful manifesto about the dangers of voyeurism and what it does to a man's sexuality that is 40 years ahead of its time.

Hemmings is Hugh Grant before Hugh Grant but in this role at least much more interesting. He's highly sexual but unlike his painter roommate his chosen art form represses him all in the name of the shot. And when he finally gets the perfect shot in the perfect light it's so perfect that someone steals it and for good reason. Did those events actually take place or just through his camera lens?

Hence in the film to Thomas David Hemmings the murder did occur. But the murder's reality is objective only if Thomas can verify it through someone else's experience. Otherwise Thomas' observed event is subjective and problematic. Each individual thus sees through a glass darkly ... even when the glass is an objective camera lens.

There are all kinds of references to the assassination the grassy area and picket fence photographic evidence of a badge man character with gun hiding in the bushes the subsequently developed pictures having been presumably stolen or altered as part of some conspiracy. It's almost as if Thomas and his camera represent the Zapruder film component of the assassination. Indeed the causal reality of the JFK murder was and still is to some extent a function of human perception derived from an interpretation of what the camera sees.Blowup is unlike most films. There are long takes with minimal editing. This gives the film a slow meandering feel. Dialogue is minimal. Natural sounds override music throughout. And like other Antonioni films this one is mostly visual. The cinematography is striking.Another characteristic is that the film is not plot intensive. Nor are the characters sympathetic. Thomas is not at all likable. And other characters are mere mannequins. I question whether Antonioni needed two hours to convey his message. More of a plot might have reduced the need for so much seemingly irrelevant filler.Blowup is mostly for viewers who like unconventional arty films that impart abstruse philosophical meaning.

Upon returning to his studio loft later that day he develops the pictures and discovers that he has inadvertently stumbled upon a murder. Antonioni is not interested in the details of the murder itself as in a typical detective story but rather with how the protagonist's perception of the world and his relationship to it is altered by this event.As a fashion photographer Thomas is a creator of illusions that define a certain kind of young urban lifestyle and Antonioni's flagrant use of the loud splashy attentiongrabbing colors of billboard advertising  a visual association elevated to an unholy apotheosis in his next film ZABRISKIE POINT 1970  brings to the surface the transient sensation and hollow artifice that lies at the heart of all pop culture consumerism. In his previous work RED DESERT 1964 Antonioni spraypainted both the manmade dcor as well as the natural setting as a means of giving concrete expression to the heroine's neurotic state of mind and her ameliorative aestheticizing vision of a world despoiled by technology and pollution. He does the same in BLOWUP painting doors fences poles and the faades of entire buildings to emphasize the exhilaration and alienation that characterizes life in a large modern city.Psychedelic colors make the 'real' world of the film seem exaggerated and hyperbolic like a fantastic 'surface' reality while the 'captured' and reconstructed world of the photographs appears ominously stark grainy and documentarylike   the bare denuded 'essence' of reality. In the central montage sequence of the film the camera  in place of Thomas' eyes  slowly moves back and forth from one photograph to the next and likewise Antonioni cuts back and forth from the pictures to the protagonist looking at them. Since the act of looking at these enhanced images effectively reconstructs an event that the protagonist  and the audience  never actually saw with the naked eye in 'real life' technology is shown to reveal a new surface of the world that is normally hidden from view. Antonioni's own particular brand of phenomenological Neorealism is concerned primarily with the process of seeing through a camera as a way of exposing an ultimate truth or a lack thereof that underlies the surface of the world.The curious selfreflexivity of this scene is an epistemological hall of mirrors Antonioni's camera looks at Thomas looking at photographs which are blown up larger and larger so that eventually they become merely an abstract collection of dots a Rorschach test in which almost anything can be read. Like the Abstract Expressionist paintings of the tormented artist son in Pasolini's TEOREMA 1968 the received cultural baggage and semiotic referentiality of the image is eliminated until all that remains is purest subjectivity of the spectator. And so picturemaking technology mediates reality only up to a point once the threshold of referentiality has been crossed the suspicion of a murder in the park gleaned from a series of enlarged photographs would seem to say more about Thomas' own paranoid state of mind than what his camera may or may not have recorded.This subtextual aspect of the film has been compared to the controversy surrounding the various interpretations of the Abraham Zapruder film as a definitive and reliable record of the Kennedy assassination  and particularly the mystery of the notorious 'grassy knoll.' Also the possible incidence of adultery and The Girl's desperate efforts to retrieve the film suggest the scandalous fallout of the Profumo affair. Vanessa Redgrave with her thick dark brown hair and affected temptressnaf manner hinted at by a schoolgirl outfit and arms folded seductively over her breasts seems meant to evoke for a British audience at least thenrecent memories of Christine Keeler.BLOWUP is full of visual and verbal nonsequiturs and nearly all the scenes are composed of longtakes with plenty of 'longeurs' and 'temps mort.' This realtime approach  often fragmented by abrupt and seemingly arbitrary cuts  faithfully simulates Thomas' experience and the mechanical routine of his creative process and its fleeting moments of sudden inspiration and frenzied excitement. All throughout the film there is a recurrent pattern of relationships left unconsummated and work left undone. Just as he appears on the verge of establishing meaningful contact with someone or about to finally resolve himself to some efficacious deed or another he is immediately distracted by something else that pops up.Thomas resembles Odysseus in the way he is continually thwarted by chance encounters which cause him to lose sight of his mission. Indeed the film's meandering episodic plot does seem to have elements of classical epic the rock concert and the marijuana party afterward all suggest a ritual journey through a modern 'Land of the LotusEaters.'  Ironically it is just when he discovers a sense of emotional commitment and social obligation in his life that his selfjustifying cynicism and arrogant indifference toward others is replaced by a growing sense of impotence and defeat.  In the final scene speech is phased out of the film entirely leaving only a silent form of physical communication unmediated by language and social pretensions.BLOWUP was the Antonioni's greatest commercial and critical triumph and the film's narrative  an odyssey through a modern city following the protagonist from feigned poverty to the false security of wealth and ending on a note of final lingering doubt about one's place and purpose in the world  seems itself a trenchant comment on the nature of success and what it does to people. By transposing to 'Swinging London' the Marxist concerns of his Italian films Antonioni demonstrates once again that this malaise of modern life is not caused by technology and consumer culture but rather by man's failure to adapt to the conditions of the new environment he has created for himself.".

By transposing to 'Swinging London' the Marxist concerns of his Italian films Antonioni demonstrates once again that this malaise of modern life is not caused by technology and consumer culture but rather by man's failure to adapt to the conditions of the new environment he has created for himself.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Blowup' is frequently mentioned as one of the most influential movies of the twentieth century. And I believe it is. But it is no dry and dull document that the viewer must force himself to appreciate while he stifles his yawns. Like 'Citizen Kane' 'Breathless' and 'Psycho' it is not only an important movie milestone it is still a living and breathing work of art that will fascinate and impress any movie lover who approaches it with an open mind. 'Blowup' lures you in with its snapshot of swinging 60s London and it's tease of being a murder mystery which it really isn't but by then you're hooked. This movie is a puzzle with no solution a text with any interpretation the viewer cares to bring to it. That may sound heavy going and off putting but this is a surprisingly watchable movie. Even the boring sequences are interesting! Anyone who enjoys David Lynch Dario Argento whose 'Profundo Rosso' deliberately referenced this Nic Roeg or Jim Jarmusch movies where atmosphere and visual images are more important than characterization plot or dialogue will appreciate this 60s classic. I think it gets better with every viewing.".

Blow Up is the cinematic equivalent of the TR4 cabriolet designed by Michelotti and manufactured by Triumph during the same period and mixes the best of two rather different cultures. The movie offers the right amount of nudity sensuality and perversion without offending the prude status quo of swinging Olde England. David Hemmings plays a character who is by all accounts snobbish homophobic prejudiced rude and macho. This pseudo thrillerwhodunit unwinds rather slowly and with little dialogue and I think is just an excuse for Antonioni to show how weird the English were.

	schema:headline " Disappearances in a distorted reality";
	schema:reviewBody "I was initially apprehensive about Blowup. The enigmatic mystery where the lack of resolution is a reflection of a universe where answers continuously elude us is one of my favorite types of film so I knew I wanted to see it because it's a cornerstone Polanski Lynch Peter Weir they all took from it but something about the movie's mod reputation kept me at distance. I expected something garish as opposed to seriously introspective. Boy was I wrong! It turns out that the swinging tunes and fashions of 60's London are a pleasant backdrop to the mind's confusion in fact they abet it in similar ways to how the drug culture permits the collapse of personality in Donald Cammell's Performance. It's a booming prosperous world full of possibilities yet the mind still is unable to cope. The film doesn't just invite us to be lost in this conundrum it's also a rare case that we're presented with the devices that control it.Back to the point of my Antonioni quest you can read the premise in my review of Zabriskie Point what appears in the film as we go backwards in time through his filmography what facet of consciousness to meditate on? Every time a camera lens appears in a film 'filmaboutfilm' interpretations become myriad. Dissertations about apparent realities and fictions seem to practically write themselves. In a brilliant early scene Antonioni gives us the photographer as the creator of reality a cruel god who has a world at his bidding. When he tells his models to shut their eyes for no good reason out of the whim of power they do.Then he wanders through streets antique shops and parks hoping to see something through the lens something that is worth seeing. The ultimate ground or principle of the photographer's trade is that through his camera he can capture the world as it really is that he can enable a true perception through his artificial eye. But so many of the famous photos that capture our imagination over time with their spontaneity of a life caught unawares years later we discover had been staged. This was also the lofty aim of early Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov.It's in the dark room however that the film shapes itself when the photographer notices a small inexplicable detail in the frame. I see then the walls of his livingroom where he hangs the blownup images of film as the walls of memory where the reality of what used to be exists fragmentary and elusive not quite up to the task. The reality surmised there is but a recreation that demands new contexts a folly for the mind to dwell and be haunted.Later in the park he discovers that he didn't prevent a murder after all and his apparent reality becomes concave collapsing upon itself in question and doubt. It's not the eye that has deceived him though because the lens of his camera is impartial and operates at the whim of clicking a button but the mind shaping in memory something different from what was originally perceived jumping to the conclusion.It's not then simply a case where if we magnify something enough it becomes meaningless as Antonioni explained of the film but also a metaphor for the illusionary reality of the mind which in its frantic quest for meaning gives birth to chimeras.Yet another transfiguration of the walled mind we find in the nightclub scene. Where a small reaction the guitarist's irritation at an amplifier that won't work escalates into a frenzy and turns a crowd of passive observers into crazed animals. It makes sense then that even a more indifferent onlooker David Hemmings is swept up in this until out of the club in the quiet he's struck by the meaninglessness of the encounter. What he salvaged with so much effort out of it was but a useless piece of wood.It's with the appearance of memory this debilitating function of the mind with the power to break us for lifetimes that the immediate reality the world as we know it becomes a distortion the rippled surface of a lake.All the odd tidibits and disappearances in the film like for example the marvellous scene where Vanessa Redgrave simply vanishes from our sight in a crowd leaving behind an empty street are a product of that distortion.I can't be sure if Antonioni would concur but this is one of the great Buddhist films. If The Passenger is an approximation of nirvana an impassive detached state of mind that permits true awareness Blowup is an essay on the formation of sankaras the root of human suffering. If craving or some form of it is behind all human suffering the craving here is the utmost one metaphysical an unquenchable thirst for answers and meaning when those things elude us. The journalist in The Passenger the man essentially seeking truth abandons his quest for answers and meaning. This final bond to clinging and desire now severed the illusions of ego and identity dissolved he attains liberation. By embracing his transience he can then wander the world in order to experience it in its true form.I'm very keen to see what Antonioni did before this.".

It is very different from his earlier films in that it is much less overtly intellectual and is purportedly a thriller. However it is no more a standard thriller than is The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Instead it is an examination of reality and illusion and an exploration of what distinguishes the one from the other. The movie has an exceptional lyrical quality to it which of course is also not associated with thrillers. The color is gorgeous and Vanessa Redgrave is a total surprise. I have generally not found anything appealing about her but in this movie mastermagician Antonioni transformed her into a ravishing beauty. Sarah Miles is also very sexy as the nextdoor neighbor. Young Jane Birkin plays a groupie who gets to roll around nude in the photographer's backdrop paper. As in L'Eclisse the final scene is stunningly poetic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've often contemplated my large DVD collection and wondered why in the hell I paid good money for some of the titles I have collected. Sometimes it's because I saw the films as a kid in the 1960s and remembered them as good films. Other times I've just been in the right place at the right time and purchased on a whim. Many I have only watched once disappointed that they didn't remeet my expectations or others' on whose opinions I had relied. Working from the other end of the equation  films I'm glad I've purchased  I've tried to consider what makes a good addition to a film collection like Blow Up a film that I want to watch again and again.In the case of Blow Up the reason I can watch it often is the atmospherics. The sound of the dismal London breezes in the park where the central pivotal action of the film takes place. The damp greenery that accompanies the breeze. The nihilism of the photographer. Even the photography itself. I spent many a long month trudging through parks in London Paris and other places making decisive moment photographs just like Thomas the main character did. I can appreciate the loneliness of this aspect of his work as opposed to the studio sessions where he has a large yet virtually mute cast of robotic assistants who do his bidding without so much as a please or thankyou from him. Peripatetic photography is  by definition  something you have to do alone and Thomas is alone. One gets the feeling that candid photography is his true love where he gets closest to the truth the only part of his craft that he is emotionally excited about.Thomas is surrounded by others mostly because they're paid to be with him  models staff agents shopkeepers the London traffic itself  but he hates his existence and the hangers on in his life. I think that is why he's so disdainful and rude to everybody near him. He resents the space they occupy.When he finally becomes interested in a woman Vanessa Redgrave she enters and exits his life by suddenly appearing and just as suddenly disappearing as if by magic. Blink twice and she's gone. All he has left are his photographs of her taken in a blink but remaining as permanent images on film. In them he first sees her with her lover and then enlarging the images sees something more sinister. Is she really who he thought she was? These revealed truths and questions lead him first to wonder if he really did see what he photographed and then to ponder what course of action he should take. Real life has come up and headbutted him and he has to respond in some way. But noone else seems to care not his friends or business associates. He is on his own again.We see him at the end of the film back in the park accompanied by the same lonely damp London breeze revisiting the scene of his photographs taken just 24 hours before. Whether what he saw was real or not we don't know for sure by this stage... and neither does he. Just about every scrap of evidence that he was there such a short time ago is gone the woman the man she was with the photographs. He has only his imagination to rely on. As his painter friend in the first act painted his artworks and only then sought meaning in them so Thomas found meaning in his photographs only after the act of creation  the opening of the shutter  was over. But by then it is too late. As he picks up an imaginary tennis ball and throws it back to some frolicking mimes playing imaginary tennis he smiles and realises that what he saw or thinks he saw in the park the day before is none of his concern. It's as if what happened never happened as there is no record of it any more. The leaf fell in the forest and there was for practical purposes noone there to witness it and bring back proof that it fell.An excellent complex film about a lonely arrogant man who for once wants to care about something but can't find anyone who believes in him. Full of atmospherics and rich photography. A film that I can definitely watch again and again each time learning more about the many ways reality can be viewed and most importantly interpreted.".

But in this madcap 'film' being caught in the act gives a desultory twoline exchange to wrap it up.  And we think sitcoms are superficial.But hey this is a movie about a photographer who snaps a murder remember? The husband and wife having solved their adultery in two lines shall now change topic in midmaritalangst.In some circles  those in which the inhabitants have minds that cannot sustain concentration for more than three minutes drug addicts and preadolescents mostly  this disjointed derivative devicefilled melange serves as art and is called a 'film'.  Art  a troupe of mimes joining the cast apparently.I'm positive that if the editors hadn't strung together the scraps from the cutting room floor there might actually have been a story behind this art and perhaps a mime would have been shown to have killed the poor sod with a pretend gun.  But fortunately or otherwise we'll never know.";

Then I watch this film for the fifteenth time attempting to gain the knowledge to access this as a masterpiece. It is a masterpiece a masterpiece of idiotic imagery that reflects snobbish art film aficionados to discover different meanings when in fact the illusion of this film is how artsy the famed director can get and then laugh at the people trying to give depth to it in reviews. Going back to the time it was made it was a success only because it featured models nudity and a charming actor in David Hemmings. The plot of Hemmings playing s photographer who seems to relish in undressing underage girls and driving around in his Rolls Royce convertible centers on some photos he snaps of Vanessa Redgrave and an older man at a park. After he shoots the pictures Redgrave wants them back. She even turns up at his house. Takes her top off. And he gives her a roll of film which is really another roll. He develops his film and blows up the pictures to see images of s gun and a possible murder attempt or murder. People reviewing the film seem to miss the clues at the end of the picture of what he really saw and how it was blended into the photos. But instead the reviewers wallow around about the fake tennis game whether he saw a body or not and what was the real reality. Damn. It's right there in the last five minutes of the film. Now my comments will enrage the fandom of this picture looking for what I saw and trying to reconcile it into their interpretations of the film. SPOILER ALERTI wrote about this film and read about it 25 years ago in s film school. Capturing the students thoughts on surrealism and what in their minds was real or illusion in the film. I then called out for those that thought this was an intellectual test to define the film from the director. Their theories were like other reviews praising this film. But three other students seeing it for the first time were puzzled. Finally one of them said the whole answer if there is one is in the last five minutes.I won't reveal that concept in detail. Because unless you like a meandering unexplainable story that has a sum less than its parts you won't like this. Film snobs. Get real.".

I didn't sit down anxiously awaiting a structured plot and narrative. In the event it turned out to be much more straightforward than I imagined. Some people might interpret it as an exploration of the questions  what is real? how do we know if it is or isn't?. Yet it's certainly not the only or most important interpretation to be had.There's little point in rehashing the story as plenty of other reviews here have already saved me the trouble. The thing that caught me about it was its sense of realtime. Blow Up's been called slowmoving but in fact the events of the film don't happen over a matter of weeks. From what I can tell they barely span 24 hours give or take. The transition of thought and attitude and confidence that Thomas goes through in that small space of time is artfully handled with no clumsy epiphanies or idiotic unrealistic moments of revelation. You share the confusion that has crept up on him and seized him before he actually realises it  HIS confusion exactly not the confusion of an uninvolved viewer watching an arty labyrinthine film. Antonioni injects you AliceInWonderlandlike right into his head.Thomas is from the start magnetic but brutal someone you wouldn't expect pity or benevolence from a man who is aware of his own power in the world despises everything around him and acts kindly only if it's in his own interests to do so. By the end of the film as an imaginary ball is tossed accidentally across a park by a ghostly teenage pack of mimes the look on his face as he retrieves it for them suggests empathy a sense of understanding that was lacking when we first met him. The events of the film are not explosive or loudly momentous yet we understand that they are enough to change him and by the end of the film we understand why. The sharp little shocks of distraction throughout  in particularly his encounter with the wouldbe models  are startling and realistic in their unconstructed spontaneity as such experiences often really are. It's easy to see how Blow Up came from a short story it has the elusiveness of one and those who didn't appreciate it as a feature film might enjoy it more if perhaps they watched it again as a detailed anecdote rather than expecting a crashing epic.".

The picture contains thrills  symbolism  emotion  thoughtprovoking issues and plot twists during the last reel . It has some nudism  reportedly the first British feature film to show full frontal female nudity . As the picture was really censored and a way of bypassing the Production Code  the powerful MGM created Premiere Productions  a dummy company . The title of the original short story by Julio Cortzar  who has a cameo  translates into English as The Spit Of The Devil . Nice acting by David Hemmings as a photographer who takes a simple snapshot resulting in amazing consequences . However  Terence Stamp was originally cast as Thomas  but was dropped two weeks before shooting began in favor of the thenunknown player Hemmings . His role is loosely based on the careers of Swinging London's ace fashion photographers David Bailey and Terence Donovan . Support cast is frankly well such as Sarah Miles  John Castle  Gillian Hills  Tsai Chin  Peter Bowles and Jane Birkin .Evocative and appropriate cinematography  rich in colour  by Carlo Di Palma  Woody Allen's ordinary cameraman . However  Antonioni unhappy with the color of the grass in Maryon Park  London  had it sprayed green so he could reshoot the scene . Jazzy musical score by Herbie Hancock  the film contains a rare performance of The Yardbirds during the period when Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck were both in the band . Being well produced by MGM  this production company did not have to cut the full frontal nudity or other sexually explicit scenes and maintained all rights to the film when the film opened to rave reviews and excellent box office this defeat was considered the final blow for the Production Code's credibility and was replaced with a ratings system less than two years later. This wellmade motion picture was stunningly directed by Michelangelo Antonioni . The picture achieved success at box office  it allowed him to go abroad and to work on international scale in English language  Zabriskie Point 1970 in the USA as well as Professione reporter or The passenger 1975 with Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider . Antonioni's initial films dealt with neorealism  reflecting his bourgeois roots like in his first movie Story of a love affair 1950 or La Signora Senza Camelie 1953 or The friends 1955. His biggest success was the trilogy about noncommunication and silent with many layered meanings such as The adventure 1960 The night 1961 and The eclipse 1962 with which he won several prizes . His films frequently starred Monica Vitti or other statuesque actresses . A stroke in 1985 severely inhibited his productivity until his death in 2007 . Blowup is essential and indispensable seeing for thriller and suspense lovers .".

It is a film that makes you think as you can see from the numerous long comments a film in which the viewer has to work to appreciate as a participant.Antonioni's films are slowlangorous visual driven neither by plot nor by character but by the unfolding revelation of the perception of our situation itself.  In this they are unique and represent a challenge to the viewer to drop the expectations of fantasy gratification that film usually exploits.  If the viewer can lose the speed of modern life and just flow along with the film much deeper rewards are to be found here as attested by the many posted reviews.When sound was added to film many filmmakers were worried that the artistic value of film as visual motion would be lost to the complexities of text which has largely been the case.  Antonioni's films however have explored and deepened the visual aspect of film as a means for making profound communications.  The dialogue doesn't for the most part tell anything about the message but is merely a supporting aspect of the visual metaphor. His last film the superb Beyond the Clouds is more talky and gives some verbal clues about Antonioni's world view.I feel that Antonioni's films are artistic and spiritual landmarks of cinema but of all his films I have seen this is the most accessible with the most conventional presentation plot etc.The rest of this includes my interpretation of the film and might include spoilers.A lot of the comments here are excellent.  I will just add that for me the film is about our attempt to observe and understand our world through our placement of our attention.  The photographer is just us as the observer his professional work reflects our customary perception of the world through preconception kitsch convention.  It is meaningless exploitive alienating even cruel.On the other hand when he observes reality rather than artificiality when he turns up the intensity and magnification until things are no longer recognizable he is seeing the essence of things and not his conceptual projections.  He discovers a crime for me this murder is a metaphor for the murder of real perception along with real feeling by a society which alienates us from our own natural ability to see things as they are.From here the film goes even deeper into the meaning of this crime and how one can live with it.  Yet the film never gets into any obvious deep speculations it makes its point completely in the domain of visual images and metaphors that also serve as plot devices until the enigmatic conclusion of the film.Like any great work of art the meaning of the film lies in the symbols and metaphors and cannot be reduced to words the success of the film lies in the tremendous emotional impact it has on its viewers who probably often like myself the first time I saw it don't even realize it has such deep levels to it.  Antonioni has constructed something that has a life of its own with the ability to reflect profound meanings that arise from an interaction of the film and the viewer.".

One morning several years ago I bumped into a chap I knew called Derek who was doing a media course at college . Derek decided to show me his work from the course and one of his essays was on the 1966 film BLOWUP .  Blowup  I said to Derek  Thats utter crap Ive absolutely no idea why but so many of the reviewers on this page have also done media  film making courses that use BLOWUP as an example of film making  Ive got to ask in all seriousness  Is BLOWUP used as an example on how NOT to make a good movie ? What I really hate about it is that there is absolutely no substance to the movie . David Hemmings plays a photographer called Thomas who smokes hash  has sex with a model  sees some mime artists driving past  smokes some more hash  has sex with a couple of models  smokes some more hash and sees some mime artists driving past again . Thats it  thats the plot of the movie and dont be fooled by the promotional con trick that states this is a murder thriller because this is only a minor subplot that really goes nowhere . To tell the truth BLOWUP is a load of 1960s crap made by pretentious snobs who were no doubt looking down their noses at commercial British blockbusters like ZULU  ALFIE and the James Bond movies . It also contains just about the worst ending Ive ever seen in a British movie .As for Derek I think hes working in a hotel somewhere in England . So if I were you Id be very careful about doing a media  film course that uses BLOWUP as an example of film making because you might find yourself having a career in the hotel trade . Worse  you might find yourself working as a mime artist".

The audience is never totally allowed into any character's head never going much deeper than the aesthetic. Thomas is the only character who seems to develop in any way and even then we're kept at a distance. Handsome coolly charming David Hemmings is perfect for the rolean existentialist photographer freefloating through life without purpose living through a series of fun but ultimately unfulfilling experiences. When he discovers a possible murder he is given a solid goal and the mechanical quality fades from his life as he tries to unravel the mysterybut those around him are too involved in their own insubstantial activities to listen or care. Finally both he and us are left tired alienated and unsure of what lifelike the blown up photois supposed to be. The final shot explicitly depicting an illusion of living is an incredibly heavy statement.This motion picture is like a photograph itselfwe are shown the surface and can only infer anything more. It's a glossy gorgeous snapshot of Swinging London featuring Hemmings and Veruschka in one of the sexiest nonsex scenes of all time. Blowup is a sensuous and sensual experience but doesn't show much beneath that. We don't get all the answers. That's the point.".

From the utter confusion and tragic consequences of the Malmedy Masacre depicted in this movie as more an accident of the fog of war rather than a cold calculated act to the final climactic battle scenes this movie shows world war II as it most likely really was. A very personal war for each soldier involved.My uncle was a soldier who lost a leg in Europe during that time and as he related experiences of battle he always made it perfectly clear that war was always a very personal thing. You were doing everything to survive. Your enemy was doing the same thing and somehow battles were eventually won or lost. The average G.I. didn't know or much care what was going on over the hill or on a grand scale. He only knew he and a few of his buddies were being shot at by a few of the enemy and they had to shoot back or perish. It's all about living another day.This movie conveys those sentiments very clearly. It is about daily survival without the grandiose trappings. You really wind up caring about each of these characters. It is well worth seeing. Especially if you were a soldier or know a soldier or just want to know more about being a soldier. In my opinion it will go down in history as one of the more realistic war movies ever made.".

I felt like this was an appropriate movie for my 13 yr old daughter to view I would not recommend for any younger. The story was told so well that I felt she understood the underlying messages. We were able to have a very long discussion afterward about war and accountability of those who unjustly cause wars. We talked about recognizing the humanity behind the enemy soldiers who are for the most part just doing their duty to country. These men have wives children fathers and mothers who love them just as much as the families of the soldiers on our side.I literally was speechless at the end of the film. The surprise ending caught me a little offguard with its VERY poignant and thought provoking message.The characters were well developed and I really felt that i could empathize with each man's approach to the situation they were in.The impact of the movie far exceeded its budget. I was very impressed with the actors for example the beautiful French woman...who WAS that?. I think I was most impressed with the acting of the Medic The exchange of looks between him and the German prisoner at the end of the movie was classic!.I read a lot of the reviews prior to watching this film so I had somewhat of a biased opinion about what I might see.

	schema:headline " A simple story told with great skill. Very satisfying";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very simple story told in a very simple way.A group of soldiers escape capture and fight their way to rejoin friendly forces. Nothing new or unusual there. However Ryan Little has managed to tell this simple story with a great sense of compassion and feeling. So much so that at times I had to remind myself that this was a story of war. Little manages to do what many others have failed in the modern war movie let the story take preference over special effects and shock tactics.The largely unheralded cast turn in steady rather than spectacular performances. Yet they work well within the over all feel of the movie showing that war is fought by in the most part ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances. At times the pace was a little labored particularly at the farmhouse. The relationship with the mother and child seemed to develop too quickly somehow become pivotal almost instantly.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very simple story told in a very simple way.A group of soldiers escape capture and fight their way to rejoin friendly forces. Nothing new or unusual there. However Ryan Little has managed to tell this simple story with a great sense of compassion and feeling. So much so that at times I had to remind myself that this was a story of war. Little manages to do what many others have failed in the modern war movie let the story take preference over special effects and shock tactics.The largely unheralded cast turn in steady rather than spectacular performances. Yet they work well within the over all feel of the movie showing that war is fought by in the most part ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances. At times the pace was a little labored particularly at the farmhouse. The relationship with the mother and child seemed to develop too quickly somehow become pivotal almost instantly. This aside character development occurs at a natural and easy pace. All these men are people we will meet in our own lives bringing the story even closer to the audience.This is one of the most satisfying war movies that I have seen for a long while.

It has enough to convince the audience that it's all real and then brings you into the atmosphere by the fantastic acting. Kudos to all actors involved This is also a lowbudget film which helps you appreciate it even more because there are no signs of that small budget. This is just as intense as pretty much any war movie you will ever see but you don't have to worry about it being too violent or bloody. It's just as compelling because it puts you inside the eyes of the soldiers themselves. I hope that all who have access to see this movie take advantage of it because this is a side of cinema that isn't seen often.".

In fact the film itself never at all mentions the LDS church and for all we know Deacon could have been a baptist.  That is all besides the point. The film takes us where a war film has never been before the religious implications. And it is not overtly preachy. Somehow with under 1 million dollars the director has made a film that looks like an epic hollywood war film complete with handheld cameras and a few war buddy cliche's. But what seperates this film from the pack is its main character a devout religious sharpshooter shellshocked from a raid gone bad trying to make moral sense of what is going on. The film is also a great war film and impecably accurate historically. The only sign that the film is low budget is its musical score which at some times is a bit obtruse but the acting is superb and the directions is excellent. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "About a week ago i watched a trailer for the war movie Brotherhood and i liked what i saw.After renting the title and thoroughly enjoying it i returned it to the store and whilst there saw an equally promising trailer running for Saints and Soldiers. Me and a friend of mine instantly rented the title and afterwards we felt our money was wasted. Firstly as far as authenticity is concerned it is flawed and these flaws are listed on the IMDb page. Secondly in the first 10 minutes of the film i had nailed every character in the movie. The over questioning medic the gung ho yokelI just wanna shoot me some krauts the honourable sergeant the crazy religious marksman with a mental condition and last but not least the stiff upper lipped British pilot which as a Brit extremely offends me. Most RAF pilots were local boys ranking as low as flight sergeant not the pompous mustachioed lord types. The tongue in cheek conversational exchanges between the pilot and the yokel almost made me switch the film off 'dammit i just need a cigarette'.Awful. The accompanying banjo music whenever he was on screen made me want to tear out my hair. The lack of combat in the film is a major weak point and in the few instances in which there is a war on the scenes are literally unbelievable for example the American infantryman firing a bazooka at German soldiers video game style when there is a perfectly good perimeter set up with machine guns overlooking the field. Grenades seem so over used is this a James Bond movie? It was obvious that Sarge was going to die maybe he would be more fitting in Starship Troopers i dunno. A film of this calibre would have been accepted as 'good' back in the 1950s but come on this is 2005! The film obviously had a decent budget it could have done a lot better with the resources it had people want to see realism. You can badmouth special effects all you like but that is what the people want.The whole story was fit for post midnight television. Seriously if you want a good laugh rent this movie its funnier that Sergeant Bilko but if you want a seriously good example of winter conflict just watch Band of Brothers or to give you a low budget example When Trumpets Fade.".

It seemed like an ambitious undertaking for a low budget filmmaker. As time went on and the film was completed word came out that the film was very good. Instead of bring it immediately to local theatres Excel the distributor for the film began showing it at film festivals all over the place  and it hit home with film fans winning numerous awards.When the film opened its theatrical run here in Utah. I have had the opportunity to see the film for myself and can say that it is EXCEPTIONAL!Uncle Sam invited me to join them for 2 years back in the early 1960's. I was glad to serve my country and was even more grateful that I did not have to actually fight in a shooting war. Going through basic training and later holding my breath as the Cuban missile crises came and went I wonder what I would do if called upon to fire with intent to kill. I'm glad that I was not put to that kind of test.As I experienced SAINTS  SOLDIERS watching a young soldier of faith who had previously served his church as a missionary in Berlin face the reality of killing those whom he had come to love and respect it touched my heart in a way no other war film has ever done. The film is very well acted tense moving and thought provoking. In short this is a film that I will strongly recommend will return again to see in the theatre and will certainly purchase when released on DVD.Congratulations to all involved!".

None of the characters managed to become more than cardboard figures representing some clich archetypal movie character if that. Two of the main characters were just about invisible as badly drawn as they were. No doubt the true stories that the film is based on are extremely interesting and impressive on their own but that never makes it into this movie. It all falls apart because of onedimensional acting shoddy directing and well bloodless plot. There are no hooks.I watched the whole thing with directorproducer's commentary afterwards and the banality of their thinking shocked me. More than once my girlfriend and I burst out laughing from the Hallmark card philosophy and the team's blindness to the film's obvious faults.Sorry  good try but doesn't really cut it.".

The movie has many problems that were not related to the limited budget. To begin with the characters who escape the Malmedy Massacre are wearing 101st Airborne Div. shoulder patches. This unit was not in the area of attack at the beginning of the German's Ardennes offensive. In fact it was members of a field artillery observation battalion who were captured at Malmedy. The portrayal of the medic is is unbelievable and designed to make the Mormon hero appear even more saintly. It was a rare occurrence that a combat medic in the European Theater would carry a sidearm let alone a rifle while wearing red cross identification patches as this was a violation of the Geneva Conventions. The medic in this movie carries a rifle without hesitation and acts more like an infantryman. The movie claims to be based on actual events but the only actual event it seems to use is the massacre. The plot line for the RAF pilot seems pretty bogus. He says he was flying photo reconnaissance but that early in the battle Allied aircraft were grounded by the weather. Even if conditions were clear in England ground fog and a low cloud cover would have prevented the taking of intelligence photos from the air.The film looks nice but that is about it. The production needed a fact checker.".

When I think about it of course I should have understood the tipoff given by the use of the word saints in the title.

I think it's the former.In any event once in the theater it soon became apparent that something was amiss with the film. The American soldiers in the film were in a platoon that could not exist outside the state of Utah.Look at the star ratings given to this film by the reviewers on this site and you'd think this movie ranked up there with BenHur or Gone With The Wind. What's happened of course is that the hometown Provo crowd and their Utah coreligionists have packed the site with positive reviews. Page after page of raves for what is in essence a film with all the production values  as good as they are  of a madeforTV movie. Especially egregious in the film was the absurd English accent attempted by actor Kirby Heybone  absolutely the worst foreign accent on film since that Scottish actor tried to pass as a Russian in Hunt for the Red October. So despite the seemingly objective patriotic mainstream message of this war movie in reality director Ryan Little's film is more an unconscious homage to the work of Leni Riefenstahl than anything else.

This guy is religious and has scruples. At times the narrative gets stuck so badly it is actually quite comical.Sure technically all the gear is OK the explosions and bullet hits look real. Modern war films are like that. But there is nothing here that hasn't been done better somewhere else. I give it two extra points for the rather honest humanist message.".

The story is layered with sadness but also comedy. Kaurismki masterfully translates all of the comedies and tragedies of life to the screen populating this interpretation of the human experience with unconventional heroes and some of international cinema's most unexpectedly kind hearted characters. Kaurismki humanizes those who would often be looked upon as despicable criminals in a way that makes me root for them more than I would for any superhero.

	schema:headline " Kaurismki's delightfully picaresque modernday fable";
	schema:reviewBody "In the two opening sequences of Ariel 1988  director Aki Kaurismki's typically straightfaced character study about a life and its cruel ironies  the main character Taisto watches as the mine where he once worked is closed and demolished only to then observe with a calm detachment the suicide of his father in a coffee shop restroom. Both sequences are captured in Kaurismki's typically deadpan approach that is rife with a cruel satire and an almost absurd sense of humour whilst also setting up the spirit of defeat failure and the unpredictable twists of fate that will conspire against the character throughout the rest of the film. From here we follow Taisto as he travels from Lapland to Helsinki in a Cadillac with no roof and observe his completely disconnected and often bemused approach to life as he wanders the city falls in love goes to prison and ultimately learns something about himself along the way.For me the film was somewhat reminiscent of Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man! 1973 with Kaurismki presenting the film as an incongruous picaresque fable that is rich in character humour and an astute sense of pathos. Like Anderson's film the plot is relatively simple in a cinematic sense  with the emphasis on a single character charting an unconventional path through life  but is adapted on a completely epic scale with the sheer number of adventures and misadventures packed into such a tight running time destroying any broader notion of the social realist tag that many have applied to Kaurismki's earlier works. Although I love his first three films in particular Crime and Punishment 1983 and The Calimari Union 1985 for me Kaurismki really started to settle into his trademark style with Ariel building on the greatness of the previous year's Hamlet Goes Business 1987 and setting the scene for later films such as Take Care of Your Scarf Tatiana 1994 Juha 1999 and The Man Without a Past 2002.Like many of Kaurismki's best works the reason Ariel works so well is as a result of the perfect casting. Every single performance in this film is great in its own unique little way and really manages to convey a great deal about the characters and their roles within the film without having to fall back on lengthy scenes of dialog and exposition. The structure and visualisation of the film is light as a feather as Kaurismki takes one shot of a character looking pensively from a window and carefully examining a halfempty packet of cigarettes and gives us a wealth of information not only about where these characters are coming from but also where they're heading. As with the other two films in the trilogy and indeed many of the director's other works the film skilfully manages to walk that fine line between a cruel and mocking sense of humour as we watch these characters strive and fail and ultimately fall flat on their faces in such a manner as to offer an obvious comedic punch  and a genuine sense of warmth and compassion.If you're at all familiar with Kaurismki's particular style of directing from films like Shadows in Paradise 1986 and The Match Factory Girl 1990 then you'll already have some idea of what to expect from the film in question with those particular films acting as the bookends with Ariel in between to an informal trilogy of works looking at the downtrodden underclass constantly striving for hope and happiness in a cold and confusing world. Out of the three films in this loose triptych of modernday fables Ariel is for me the most moving and entertaining and is also the one in which Kaurismki themes and motifs are best served by the character and the situations he finds himself in. The direction is truly great typical of Kaurismki's minimal approach with selfconsciously flat and iconic compositions and an incredibly warm approach to lighting while the script and the characters are strong enough to draw us in and make the experience all the more rewarding.".

When I watched Ariel the first thing I noticed was as in the previous movie the characters don't speak much but when they speak they are concise and to the point. The relationships start very abruptly and different from what is normally expected but all of them end up being loyal and caring. With the beginning of the journey of the miner Kasurinen to the south by a convertible car the movie also starts to present its comedy romance action and drama. Kasurinen keeps his calmness through all that happens to him and in the end he achieves his goal. I can recommend this movie to those who like details .".

His father expresses his discontent with his life and hands over the car keys to his Cabriolet to Taisto before he goes to the toilet and shots himself. With his new car Taisto drives to the bank where he cashes out all his savings and then he heads for Helsinki and happiness.

Taisto gets a job and checks himself in on a hotel nearby his new job. The following day he meets single mum Irmeli and suddenly everything looks brighter for the unfortunate bachelor.With stylistic directing short dialog subtle film editing and very realistic milieu depictions Aki Kaurismki has created an enjoyable and quietly paced fable about interpersonal relations identity love and the Finnish workingclass during the late 1980s where the throughout melancholic atmosphere is contrasted by the dry witty and laughable humor. Aki Kaurismki's ambivalent and anonymous characters is brought to life by skilled Finnish actor Turo Pajala 19552007 and Finnish actress Susanna Haavisto who achieves the viewers enthusiasm by presenting their characters in a clumsy and gullible way. With their unusual reactions almost as static as the actors in the films of Robert Bresson and their eccentric ways of approach they radiate true emotions with great efficiency.This characterdriven and dialogdriven comedy drama which gained two awards at the Moscow International Film Festival in 1989 and one award at The National Society of Film Critics Awards in 1991 tells a charming rare and engaging story and has a significant score which varies from Finnish rock to Piotr Tchaikovsky. Aki Kaurismki's detailed depiction of everyday life which was shot in the capital city of Finland is a piquant minimalistic and comical Filmnoir which belongs amongst the finest in the history of Scandinavian cinema. So simple so beautiful and so appealing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this movie the second chapter of the workers trilogy Aki Kaurismki cunningly mixes social drama and hardboiled gangster film with impressive results creating an opus that's both deeply touching and cruelly funny  often in the same scene.The film revolves around Taisto Kasurinen Turo Pajala who comes to Helsinki in search for a job. He manages to get something to do at the docks and also embarks on a relationship with a single mother. Naturally being this Kaurismki good things don't last that long Kasurinen is framed for a crime he didn't commit and sent to jail. Once there he starts planning his escape with cellmate Mikkonen the consistently good Matti Pellonp. As it turns out escaping isn't that hard it's not getting caught again that causes trouble...I've always liked Kaurismki's films for how they show people who are on the edge of desperation and still find the strength to move on. It's the kind of movies we don't see that often the only other director I can think of who tells these stories is Ken Loach. This time he adds shades of crime comedy Kasurinen and Mikkonen meet some bad people and end up in some awkward situations with a couple of scenes that are among the darkest and at the same time funniest he's ever shot  one of the film's best sequences anticipates Pulp Fiction by six years.And let's not forget the ending. Without ruining anything I can say the beautiful conclusion contains a famous film song  in Finnish!Truly priceless.".

He manages to get something to do at the docks and also embarks on a relationship with a single mother. Naturally being this Kaurismki good things don't last that long Kasurinen is framed for a crime he didn't commit and sent to jail. Once there he starts planning his escape with cellmate Mikkonen the consistently good Matti Pellonp. As it turns out escaping isn't that hard it's not getting caught again that causes trouble...I've always liked Kaurismki's films for how they show people who are on the edge of desperation and still find the strength to move on. It's the kind of movies we don't see that often the only other director I can think of who tells these stories is Ken Loach. This time he adds shades of crime comedy Kasurinen and Mikkonen meet some bad people and end up in some awkward situations with a couple of scenes that are among the darkest and at the same time funniest he's ever shot  one of the film's best sequences anticipates Pulp Fiction by six years.And let's not forget the ending. Without ruining anything I can say the beautiful conclusion contains a famous film song  in Finnish!Truly priceless.";

What I saw was what seemed like a crime film that starred zombies. Zombies?! Yep...or at least they had the emotional range of zombies. NONE of the actors showed any emotion...none. It was as if they were the living dead or had been lobotomizedand I bet you never knew you needed to see a film like this!! Sadly it was not a comedy...so the zombie thing didn't work for me.The film begins with a guy telling his son that life stinks. Then the father calmly walks into the bathroom and blows out his brains. The son has no reaction to any of this. I think that this was meant to be an absurdist film. By 'absurdist' I mean a brilliant and sophisticated comedy that is simply too brilliant and sophisticated for 99.98 of the population to understand or enjoy. And I guess I am just one of those stupid troglodytes who couldn't get the genius that was Ariel.I could talk more about the plot but frankly the plot was irrelevant. Everything that happened seemed to make little sense nor did most of the people's reactions. And since I didn't enjoy a single minute of it I won't bother to discuss the bizarre meeting with the metermaid the 6 yearold who greets the leading man with a Luger or any of the rest of this weird and not in a good way film.If you actually like this sort of thing try watching Buffet Froida French film that makes even LESS sense than this one. It too is too smart for us mere mortals.".

Some might feel the acting be emotionless.But believe meI think Kaurismaki was trying to make understand everyone that while creating a movie of drama genrethere is no need to be over emotional in one's role.Instead if one goes through such a situation in real life the character won't be acting his emotions.Instead they would be in an emotionalnothing tolive for style.The emotional content in this movie is very clear when Irmeli asked Taisto to be with her all her life the last words of Taisto's father before committing suicide and his friend's death wish. Every scene ends up with a darker frame which clearly states what the director was trying to tell through this movie.A movie without much dialogs.But they are there when needed.It's a good watch for a movie in drama genre.My rating for this movie is 810!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Any film that features in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die is guaranteed to be one that I will eventually watch and this is one of the titles that was listed and I got my hands on. Basically mine worker Taisto Kasurinen Turo Pajala has left his job and afterwards his father commits suicide by shooting himself in a caf toilet. He picks up his convertible car and goes to the bank to take out everything he has 8000 marks but his money is stolen by some muggers who beat him outside a burger bar. With no money Taisto goes to the dock to try and get a day's paid work he does do the job and get paid but he cannot get a permanent position meaning that he has to go to a place and pay for a bed. Next day he is circling jobs listed in the newspaper but instead of going to look for work we next see him boozing with some mean drunk and stealing a portrait from a building and renting a bed again. Next day he sees a woman giving him a car ticket and to let him off she suggests Taisto take her to dinner and after letting him stay the night with her it is in bed that she introduces herself as Irmeli Pihlaja Susanna Haavisto. Next morning is when he meets her son that she mentioned to him they have breakfast and he goes to look for work again including in factories but without success he takes the woman and her son to the beach. Taisto tries to get work on the docks again but he is not picked out so he takes the drastic decision to sell off car and the only amount he can get is 65000 marks. In a shopping centre he recognises one of the men who stole his wallet and when the guy pulls out a knife trying to kill him but when he is killed by Taitso he is framed and mistaken as a killer himself. He is sentenced to prison sharing a cell with Mikkonen Matti Pellonp and in his time he works the machines and he does get visited by Irmeli and her son there he proposes marriage. In their cell Taitso and Mikkonen talk about wanting to escape and go on a ship somewhere with each other but surprisingly Taitso has a violent tantrum with the guards and is put in solitary. Irmeli gives him when he is out of solitary a cream cake and present a book but he knows it is not his birthday and inside the book is a chisel. With this chisel Taitso files through his metal bed post to use as a weapon and Mikkonen turns on the radio loud they get the attention of the guard knock him out take his key and they both go for the nearest door and escape to freedom hopping over fences avoiding the guard dogs and swimming the water. After getting two suits smashing the window of a store they go to get Taitso's car back and he and Irmeli get married with Mikkonen as witness and back at the house the two fugitives narrowly miss the police catching them when they jump out the window. Wanting to escape to another destination they go to see gangsters for travel arrangements on a ship and two new passports and to pay the 4000 marks they need to rob a bank. The head gangster is paid but after getting the passports and confirmation of travel Mikkonen tries to steal the money back but they turn on him and they are only stopped when Taitso comes in to find his friend shot and he shoots the two crime lords dead. Mikkonen near death tells his friend to head for the ship called Ariel and he dies in the car from his fatal injuries he is buried by his friend and Irmeli in the woods. In the end Taitso Irmeli and her son manage to reach the dock where the ship Ariel is sailing away they pay the man waiting for them and they get on the ship heading for Mexico. Also starring Eetu Hilkamo as Riku Erkki Pajala as Miner Kaivosmies and Matti Jaaranen as Mugger Pahoinpitelij. The cast all do their parts fine it is a near road movie theme in terms of that the characters do not stop somewhere for long there are certainly some interesting moments with the prison and gangster scenes and even though it is only an hour and seven minutes that is long enough to be a watchable comedy drama. Very good!".

	schema:reviewBody "The expectations were high for the new Wallander series. The most expensive Scandinavian production  13 films in total  and a conscious change of style to the previously filmed Wallander films. The first one in the series Innan frosten is the only one of the new stories to be based on a book by Henning Mankell. The other 12 are brand new stories written especially for the films. It is also the first time Rolf Lassgrd doesn't play the role of Kurt Wallander he is replaced here by Krister Henriksson. Despite some of the negative reviews it has received in Sweden in Finland it has been well accepted. After having seen Innan frosten in its first week in cinemas I am very pleased with the result.Innan frosten or Wallander  Innan frosten as it's named in the opening titles tells the story of a murder investigation in which detective Kurt Wallander Krister Henriksson Reconstruction tracks down a sadistic killer that seems to have connections to a religious sect. These are people that are ready to burn a flock of swans to death just to get a vignette on their web site not to mention what they are willing to do to those that are not true believers. To make matters worse for Wallander his daughter Linda Johanna Sllstrm Under ytan graduates from the Police Academy and joins the Ystad police force. Already on her first day she puts herself in a situation that could be lifethreatening something that her father isn't very thrilled about. In resolving the crime they are joined by the new recruit from Stockholm Stefan Lindman Ola Rapace Tillsammans who was the lead character in Danslrarnes terkomst The Return of the Dancing Master an another Mankell bestseller.I think the producers made a terrific choice with casting Krister Henriksson in the role of Wallander. In this story Wallander has lost weight tries to live better despite the occasional glass of whiskey and really tries to be more of a father to his daughter than he's been before. Wallander is older more calmer and very much different than he's been in the previous films so I don't think that Lassgrd would've done as a good job as Henriksson. Also the change of the visual output is more like the Beck films with Peter Haber with the exception of dark city landscapes being replaced by the countryside nature of Ystad.Wallander  Innan frosten is a well made and very entertaining thriller that keeps you interested throughout the story although that is something you by now expect from Swedish thrillers. The cast is excellent and live up to their characters. Krister Henriksson's portrayal of Wallander is very solid and gives high hopes for the ones yet to come. Johanna Sllstrm is also very reliable as Linda who might be less experienced but even more eager than most of her colleagues. Of the supporting cast Niklas Falk S som i himmelen stands out as the leader of the religious sect. His character believes in the holy word but seems to have a heart of darkness inside him.Innan frosten Before the Frost is well worth to be seen. It's not a classic of its genre but the best of its kind at the moment.  12 4 12 out of 5".

After having seen Innan frosten in its first week in cinemas I am very pleased with the result.Innan frosten or Wallander  Innan frosten as it's named in the opening titles tells the story of a murder investigation in which detective Kurt Wallander Krister Henriksson Reconstruction tracks down a sadistic killer that seems to have connections to a religious sect. These are people that are ready to burn a flock of swans to death just to get a vignette on their web site not to mention what they are willing to do to those that are not true believers. To make matters worse for Wallander his daughter Linda Johanna Sllstrm Under ytan graduates from the Police Academy and joins the Ystad police force. Already on her first day she puts herself in a situation that could be lifethreatening something that her father isn't very thrilled about. In resolving the crime they are joined by the new recruit from Stockholm Stefan Lindman Ola Rapace Tillsammans who was the lead character in Danslrarnes terkomst The Return of the Dancing Master an another Mankell bestseller.I think the producers made a terrific choice with casting Krister Henriksson in the role of Wallander. In this story Wallander has lost weight tries to live better despite the occasional glass of whiskey and really tries to be more of a father to his daughter than he's been before. Wallander is older more calmer and very much different than he's been in the previous films so I don't think that Lassgrd would've done as a good job as Henriksson. Also the change of the visual output is more like the Beck films with Peter Haber with the exception of dark city landscapes being replaced by the countryside nature of Ystad.Wallander  Innan frosten is a well made and very entertaining thriller that keeps you interested throughout the story although that is something you by now expect from Swedish thrillers. The cast is excellent and live up to their characters. Krister Henriksson's portrayal of Wallander is very solid and gives high hopes for the ones yet to come. Johanna Sllstrm is also very reliable as Linda who might be less experienced but even more eager than most of her colleagues. Of the supporting cast Niklas Falk S som i himmelen stands out as the leader of the religious sect. His character believes in the holy word but seems to have a heart of darkness inside him.Innan frosten Before the Frost is well worth to be seen. It's not a classic of its genre but the best of its kind at the moment.  12 4 12 out of 5";

At the same time while it is extremely safe it does offer 90 minutes of decent entertainment and perhaps one should not ask for more.Based on a novel by the rather politically oriented author Henning Mankell Innan frosten deals with religious fanaticism and vaguely with gay marriage and abortion which is a decently interesting topic. Moreover it is hilarious how the casting unflatteringly managed to find so many people who naturally look like crazy fanatics. To spice things up further the plot also involves the complicated relationship between the inspector Kurt Wallander a great Krister Henriksson and his police daughter the talented late Johanna Sllstrm. Unfortunately it is overall handled rather clumsily but there is one terrific scene in which their relationship reaches its culminating point.Stylistically the film does little more than what is required and again perhaps you should not demand more than that. However the opening image of burning swans flying through the air is quite striking and it also features some rather nice images of nature. Finally the aptly adequate finale concludes what is still probably one of the best films of the series even if it does not spur any afterthoughts exactly.".

	schema:headline " A great introduction";
	schema:reviewBody "Having seen the more recently made BBC version of Wallander I was curious to see the Swedish version when it was shown on Television soon afterwards. At first it seemed a little strange as it is based on later stories where his situation has changed somewhat the biggest change is that his daughter Linda has joined the police and in this opening episode she moves to Ystad after graduating. Almost as soon as she gets there we learn that things are not well between her and her father Kurt this wasn't helped by the fact that he missed her graduation. He invites her to live with him but she decides to ask a friend if she can stay with her instead.The case this week opens in a rather macabre way when two swans are set alight and filmed as they try to fly away. A woman witnesses this but she is killed before she can report anything. When she is reported missing Kurt accompanies Linda to her daughter's house and he says that they will start an investigation if she hasn't returned by the morning. Linda thinks they should start looking straight away so heads off to where the woman was going and finds her body. Rather than being impressed with her police investigative skills Kurt reprimands her for going off alone. Soon after there is a second murder this time an abortion doctor is abducted and hanged in a church. She was clearly targeted and soon a video of the crime is posted on the internet. It becomes apparent that the crime is some how related to the Jonestown massacre that took place in the 1970s and that the friend Linda is staying with is connected to the people concerned.This was a great introduction to the series I've seen it three times now and still enjoy it. This is largely down to the quality cast especially Krister Henriksson who plays Kurt Wallander and the late Johanna Sllstrm who played his daughter Linda it is a tragedy that this fine actress died so young. The story was gripping and had several tense moments. There were also some more humorous moments such as when newly transferred Stefan complains about an overzealous traffic cop who stopped him to Kurt not knowing that the policewoman in question was his daughter. Even though I had to rely on the subtitles as I don't understand Swedish I enjoyed this more than the British version.".

Instead of disabling the van while they follow the baby's cries they just walk right past it.Then the cops shoot the driver and stop the van. Of course then one of the cops lets the female passenger get her gun and they drive off toward a church they want to blow up. Man how hard is it to catch a criminal.Of course the church is being guarded by police with rifles and they get a call the van is coming their way. So what do the cops do? Well of course they go into the packed church and tell everyone to leave all the while getting stuck in the middle of the crowd. Maybe they could have set up on the road to shoot and disable the truck as it's coming toward the church? Instead some of the people were sitting ducks in front of the church right next to the road.I can overlook the antireligious theme I've watched enough Morse and Lewis to almost expect it. But if this were a realistic depiction of the police in Sweden the criminal community of Europe must be flooding in there because they don't have to worry too much from the police.If you can get past how much more depressing the Branaugh Wallander is his version is more interesting and less frustrating. Henrikkson is a less volatile and moody KW but carries the role OK.".

But if this were a realistic depiction of the police in Sweden the criminal community of Europe must be flooding in there because they don't have to worry too much from the police.If you can get past how much more depressing the Branaugh Wallander is his version is more interesting and less frustrating. Henrikkson is a less volatile and moody KW but carries the role OK.";

I haven't read the book but I've read some other Wallander books and seen some of the previous movies. Although I really like Lassgrd as Wallander Henriksson does a really good job and we should stay away from comparing them too much. They are different actors making their own interpretation of the role. Johanna Sllstrm does a good job as Wallander's daughter and there's a lot going on between them that I hope will get explored more in future movies. It's beautifully shot and generally speaking of pretty high production quality. Since they are doing 13 movies in pretty short time you could suspect it would come across as rushed and cheap but I don't think that's the case with this one. Perhaps because it's the first and maybe it'll get worse as we go along. The supporting actors are of high caliber and do a good job. The story is a bit strange at times but they keep it together and going well and there's really no boring parts. So in short not the best Wallandermovie made but I enjoyed it and I think most other viewers will as well.".

The father was at Jonestown and is nutty as a fruitcake. This makes for an interesting plot. The downside of this is as another reviewer has pointed out that the police are about as incompetent as they can be. The mess up the most basic protections possible. There is a van loaded with explosives. At the very least it should have been disabled. It is left and the bad guy jumps in and takes off.

The writers Per Berglund Stefan Ahnhem and Henning Koch had a daunting task of bringing the essence of the novel into a ninety minutes format something that proved to work against the overall success of this chapter in the Wallander series. Director KjelAke Andersson did what he could with the material he was given to bring a story that made sense.The mass murder in Guyana by Rev. Jim Jones plays a key factor in the story although it is not too obvious when the clue appears to the viewer. The self righteous sect behind the burning of the swans hanging of an abortion woman doctor and the almost drowning of an infant was much sinister in the written page. In this version it is somewhat tame in comparison. Henning Mankell's pessimistic view of the Swedish society shows in this story. His Kurt Wallander is a complex man who now has to welcome his own estranged daughter Linda into the police ranks he is in charge of. That alone is a conflict in the making because the kind of relationship father and daughter have shown each other. The appearance of Stefan Lindman is a distraction. The basic problem with the disappearing Anna is not fully developed something that had more of a dramatic play in the novel. The first episode in the season shows Krister Henriksson as Kurt Wallander. His reading on the character is closer to one's imagination of how the real inspector would have been in the flesh. Mr. Henriksson downplays the part to good results. We also enjoyed Johanna Hallstrom's Linda. Her conflict with the father appears to be real. Ola Rapace is seen as Stefan Lindman. Niklas Falk a distinguished Swedish actor has only a small part as the leader of the sect.Ystad is a small place but in Henning Mankell's world it is a huge place where the most heinous crimes are committed by ordinary people for the enjoyment of millions of the genre.".

And gets to meet every point in this almost geometrical construction.It somehow serves the storyline but is it plausible to snipeshoot the driver of a cruising van loaded with explosives? The van stops nicely ready for later timed explosion in open field. I give this 710 partly because of nice Swedish details and memorable scenes like the hanging in the church or the gay wedding but at the end I'm not convinced  too much geometry too little glimpses of reality... there were some like the stolen bike scene but I'd wished for more.".

Jack finds himself being held hostage while the criminals decide what to do with him and the leader's beautiful girlfriend Erin is left alone to watch Jack. Erin who we discover is a master manipulator of the men in the gang reveals another side to Jack  a melancholy romantic who could have been a classical cellist. She finds Jack's captivity an irresistible turnon and he can't figure out if she's for real or manipulating him too. Before the gang returns Jack and Erin's connection intensifies and who ends up with the money is anyone's guess.";

	schema:reviewBody "No good deed based on a short story by Dashiell Hammett is kind of movies that have many elements and themes of a classic film noire but it is not exactly one of them. The themes include a robbery plan that goes awry though here it is more of a con rather than robbery and it is executed without resorting to violence. Second theme is domed love which in this movie is rather short more of this later. The elements include mastermind and ruthless gangster a femme fatal  and rude maniac hitman. And add to these people a couple that had a dream of living happily ever after. The strength of the movie is in building up of its characters. They all do what they are expected to do whether they act strongly or weakly. Their strength and weakness comes from their personalities and not from the requirement of the plot. Erin character is the main difference of this movie from classic femme fatal. As a kept girl with ten percent rebate on pedicure expense though she is cunning in some scenes  but she is also deadly frightened. Her motives are dark at worst and suspicious at best but in her main thrust of manipulations getting rid of Tyrone she deserves our sympathy. Other characters do not show something unexpected but the story has enough power and twist that make the movie worthwhile and interesting. Movie scenes are limited and most of it is in closed places which intensifies a sense of claustrophobia. This kind of story which has little physical action and is mainly based on suspenses needs good acting that fortunately this movie does not lack it. This movie shows that good noir still can be made and their time has not passed yet".

Add to that that Murphy's Law is in effect when they go for the score. This is modern film noir and it's fairly solid. The characters are all grey no black and white not necessarily likablenot that any of them are annoying wellcast credible and wellwritten. Yes they have some fun with how odd they are but not excessively so. This isn't funny as such at most it has sardonic moments and the occasional joke. It isn't about action either. There's tension and suspense and the plot is kept moving nicely by many twists and turns. Not everything is followed up on and the ending doesn't really pack much of a punch... in fact on the whole this is a bit of a slowburner. There is a bit of disturbing content a little violence and nuditysexuality. I recommend this for at least a rental for those into crimedramas. 610".

It's about finding a balance that doesn't include too much violence without taking it all out. It's about creating a story that makes sense and deals with human emotions so we can care about characters. It's a very challenging goal difficult t achieve. There must be anyway one movie that represents that perfect balance. I've heard Goodfellas is the perfect example or haven't II'll talk about that movie soon. The thing is that while No good deed contains some of the elements required to become a good movie it has another ones that make it stay behind.The film tries to hard with the plot twists and it's just a way to waste the time recycling until they can finally get to the ending. There's too much violence and with no credible purposes to help the plot. The movie involves some of the typical things as the intelligent guy and brain and another stupid man who depends on the brain because if not he can't do things right. And let's not forget about the spicy ingredient that can't be absent and always works the girl. What doesn't work is the sexual tension between the girl and I forgot to mention it the main guy a cop trying to make room for a love story relating them both as the most important characters.Bob Rafelson manages to keep us interested with his quick movements in a slow paced film. Writer Christopher Canaan manages to create situations that are motivating enough for the viewer coming up with very original ideas and attractive supporting characters. Some obvious revelations that are not even revelations are samples of the weakness the film has you know what the password is when they're trying to figure it out that together with the lame edition bring this movie down.This time they chose a very attractive young woman for the part of the girl. This was Milla Jovovich very attractive and with the acting skills required for this specific job. She had no big problems to play Erin always seemed comfortable and it looked like the role suited her. Stellan Skarsgard is at his best in Tyrone's skin. Relaxed and natural he created a memorable character you won't feel bad hating and that's possibly the best compliment for a villain. In the list of the stereotyped characters the stupid guy Hoop is played coldly by Doug Hutchison that guy who I didn't even like in The Green Mile and seems to be related to Kevin Spacey because of the way he looks. In a hero character away from clichs Sam Jackson's Jack Friar brings the actor in top action form since his days in The long kiss goodnight One eight seven and most recently Shaft. A pleasure for me was to see the man in his groove again. Two lovable Grace Zabriskie Mrs. Quarre and Joss Ackland Mr. Quarre and an underused Jonathan Higgins David complete the supporting cast.The movie succeeds however in the aspects we expect the least. It succeeds in character development making its characters understandable in the situations they're involved and in the way they make their decisions. It explores personality aspects not many other films of this type explore like the intense peace the main characters find in music forgetting about everything elseWhen the movie begins Jack is playing the cello and we comprehend that's the only thing that eases him down".

	schema:headline " What A Dumb Story";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing to say is that a movie has to draw you in to the story within the first few minutes. This one failed to do that. But that's really only the first of many problems. I'm going to highlight just a couple of them  one was to me a huge problem with the story the second was just something that bugged me personally because it was just so absolutely stupid on the part of whoever came up with it.The major issue for me was that this particular gang of thieves didn't strike me as having the intellectual wattage to successfully steal 100 from a convenience store never mind 10 million from a major bank. There's the old couple Joss Ackland and Grace Zabriskie whose relationship with the leader of the group is never really explained except that he flew some combat in Vietnam and can therefore fly the getaway plane. We also discover that they're horny enough to get it on in the airplane while they're waiting for everybody to show up to make their escape. There's the apparently brainless Hoop Doug Hutchison  who's so out of control that he can't possibly be of much use to the group. Then there's the leader himself Tyrone Stellan Skarsgaard who's the bright light of the group I guess but who still is quite willing to leave his lady friend Erin Milla Jovovich whom he met when she was an aspiring musician in Russia alone with Jack the cop Samuel L. Jackson so that he can teach her how to play the cello while she's holding him hostage. This is just plain dumb which made it completely unbelievable that the gang could get as far as they did. That's the major complaint about the story. Now for the personal irritant.As the movie comes to an end Tyrone Erin and Jack approach the Canadian border. The scenes at the border are absolutely ludicrous and show how little homework was done by those who made the movie. First the border crossing was identified as Sudbury. Sudbury? Did anybody bother looking at a list of border crossings or better yet a map? Sudbury is in northern Ontario. The nearest border crossing would be more than 4 hours away! Did anybody bother doing just a little bit of research about Canada Border Services? CBS agents wear dark blue uniforms not the grey uniforms used here which makes them look a bit like sheriff's deputies in the southern US. The shootout at the end is also highly unlikely given that in 2002 CBS agents didn't carry guns! Maybe somebody should have checked into these things?This is a terrible crime drama. It might have worked as a sort of whimsical heist movie but that wasn't the intent. It was a crime drama  and a sad one! 210".

Milla Jovovich is beautiful and has never looked as good. She is absolutely mesmerizing to look at in this role.

He was very convining.Out of 10 stars where 10 is the highest I would give it a 5. I must say though Jovovich and Jackson were worth the price of admission. To bad Hollywood is not ready for a love scene between the two. That would have made this an exceptional cinematic event.".

And when a film relies on such tricks and these don't work...well it's just sad. I won't insist on the rather technical flaws like the pouring rain which only pours on half of the screen. But what I will say is this I've seen today that some actors can not advance Doug Hutchison is a disappointment considering that I've first seen him in The Green Mile Milla Jovovich is the second. Maybe it's just her terribly silly character but I tend to think it's her.

Then the antagonist gang takes him hostage well sort of. No real reason to do this other than that they think they've been discovered. But from there it's all lost. Samuel L. Jackson is the protagonist but he's tied to a chair for 23's of the movie!Then there's the absurd robbery by an apparently blind man in clear glasses so you can see his eyes move and react and his cohort and evil little blondehaired troll who's NEVER accosted not once while walking directly into the power room of the bank. He's able to amazingly hack into the bank's computers and shut the power off to the whole building. Somehow I think that ALL transactions would be off regardless of the circumstances at that point  but maybe that's just me. Then there's the wimpy banker that just HAS to get his rocks off BEFORE they flee the country and the little war troll that's too stupid to realize that he shouldn't kill the only man who knows the allimportant password and the account information is stored on a 3.5 inch disk right dated technology there why not on a reel tape?. They whiz through banks at a breakneck pace withdrawing large sums of money without so much as a batting of the eye. I'm not even going to get into Samuel and Milla's musical interlude while she has him untied. Mr. officer I think might have had a trick up his sleeve to elude her and get out of the house at that point.Bad movie bad plot bad characters the kind of movie that's 97 minutes long and you'd swear you've been watching it for 4 hours.

Perhaps he wasn't helped by the screen play of Christopher Canaan.The Hammett story was one of his best ones. The idea of the kind policeman Jack Friar trying to investigate something for a neighbor brings him into a situation that will ensnare him as he discovers the people in the house are planning a caper and take him prisoner.The acting is interesting in general. Samuel L. Jackson has to act tied to a chair throughout the movie. His scene with Erin played with gusto by Milla Jovovich brings a sensuality to the screen that adds another dimension to the story. Stellan Skargard makes a mean Tyrone. Doug Hutchison is intense as Hoop Tyrone's partner in crime. Grace Zabriskie and Joss Ackland are seen as the Quarres a couple that are involved in the robbery. Ms. Zabriskie an excellent actress has great moments as the older woman who presents a kind front but is no good. Joss Ackland a veteran English stage and screen actor doesn't have much to do. The film while predictable offers some good moments. Bob Rafelson knows how to motivate his actors to give above the average performances.".

The story starts with samuel playing cello!! as he is a wannabe musician and he is also a grand theft cop. the neighbor comes in and convinces him to look for her dissapeared daughter. he has a photo of her and her boyfriend and goes on to look for them on turk street. He ends up in a house where some criminals live and are planing to rob a bank and think that he is after them while he is not. The robers are an old couple a psycho guy with bad temper mila jojovic and tairon the brain of the operation apparently. The plan they have for robing the bank is verry unconvincing and thats a very weak part of the movie. The other weak part is the relationships between the characters which is also silly and unconvincing. There is no chemistry between the characters and the whole story just sucks the acting and the script doesnt help either. The ending is crap too.To sum up avoid nothing here to see except of the breasts of mila jojovic lol!".

Milla is beautiful and looks great and she does her best as does Sam Jackson but I don't think anything can save this snooze fest. If you have nothing else to do and there is nothing else on TV and you don't have to clean or clip your toe nails and if there is no paint pealing off the walls you can watch and or you are a Jovovich fan give it a shot but its really just not that good.

I say more power to her. To all the aspiring actresses out there getting advice let this show that if you have some talent you don't have to mutilate yourselves with implants. Just say no! But I digress. The supporting cast did well also. Stellan Skarsgard was suitably menacing Joss Ackland was suitably eccentric Doug Hutchison was suitably psychotic.

Milla Jovovich is the centerpiece as a woman who uses her sexuality to attract men who are then robbed by the other members of her gang. But when detective Sam Jackson intrudes on this little arrangement it begins to unravel. Jealousy deceit and betrayal follow and soon sparks and bullets start to fly. The cast are very good and completely convincing in their lowlife milieu and the script gives them plenty of hardedged banter to bandy back and forth amidst the various sneakings around. The action when it comes is not the usual stylized action movie nonsense but is explosive and violent and most importantly organic to the plot rather than gratuitous. And the plot twists have a similar organic logic rather than having that contrived feel of being a plot twist because we haven't had one for a while. There is a nice gritty yet realistic look here that really helps to pull together the various crime genre elements into a credible and watchable drama and the actors make it all work.

	schema:reviewBody "Hi This film is an all time hard rock classic! I love my music flicks and especially movies or docs on rock bands. This film is very raw and is basically showing viewers what ACDC do best and that's play live concerts. They are one of the greatest live rock bands of all time and this moviedocumentary shows them playing live in Paris at their peak. Prior to 1979 ACDC had already conquered Australia and were making big inroads in the UK  Europe. With this growing success their next target audience was the US. ACDC desperately wanted a hit single andor album in the US. It came with the Highway to Hell single and album of the same name in 1979. Shortly after this ACDC toured UK Europe and the US. This film captures a young band playing live and at a time when they were at their best. The concert in Paris is simply awesome with lead guitarist Angus Young mesmerizing the audience with his energy on stage and his great guitar playing skills. On a whole the band's playing is tight loud and the guitar riffs awesome to say the least. Malcom Young's rhythm guitar skills are faultless Phil Rudd on drums never skips a beat and Cliff Williams is the same and lead singer Bon Scott is a true rocker and a great show man. The movie cuts from their live concert in Paris to interviews with band members and filming of them doing their hobbies etc... Not overly interesting but it does show the bands down to earth personalty. I would not worry about that too much as the film is more about how damn good this band was live and it shows the whole concert. And they were AWESOME! In February 1980 lead singer Bon Scott tragically died after a night out on the drink. This was one of his last live shows and most likely the last bit of footage of Bon Scott leading ACDC live in concert. This is raw no rubbish hard rock at it's absolute best!! A must see for ACDC fans or any true rock followers and admirers of raw musical talent. Brilliant moviedoc of a great rock band at their peak. Sadly this movie is hard to get and unfortunately has only ever been released on VHS. Why they have not released this on DVD is unbelievable it deserves to be on DVD! Highly recommend!! Cheers Bradley".

This film is very raw and is basically showing viewers what ACDC do best and that's play live concerts. They are one of the greatest live rock bands of all time and this moviedocumentary shows them playing live in Paris at their peak. Prior to 1979 ACDC had already conquered Australia and were making big inroads in the UK  Europe. With this growing success their next target audience was the US.

	schema:reviewBody "When you gather together the great stars of the early 30's give them a great script a great director and let them have their head you get Dinner at Eight.  This is a delightful film which bridges the gap between comedy and drama.  Granted it is a little dated but that it only a minor inconvenience to those of us who love this movie.  You would be hard pressed to find another actress who could play the part of Carlotta Vance with such panache as Marie Dressler.......she is magnificent. She may give the best performance in the film but she has stiff competition from the rest of this starstudded cast.I find John Barrymore's performance particularly good as it seems to mirror his own career and problems with alcohol.  Arranging himself in the right light to capture the great profile one last time is poignant. I am not a Wallace Beery fan but he is spot on as the vulgar grasping business man with wonderful Jean Harlow as his slutty wife.  She is a treat and of course no one can forget her exchange with Dressler at the end of the film when she announces that she was reading a book!  The lovely Billie Burke who made a film career out of dithering society women although she was a former Follies beauty and wife of Flo Ziegfeldis a delight.  Lionel Barrymore plays it pretty straight as her long suffering tragically ill husband.  Edmund Lowe passes muster as the philandering doctor and the rest of the supporting cast is as good as it gets.They don't make 'em like this anymore.  It's a movie lovers paradise!".

As aging star of the theatuh Carlotta Vance a living relic of the 'Delmonico' era in New York she walks away with an immortal movie as entertaining a contraption as the studio system ever confected. And she does it effortlessly despite some very tough competition  the most lustrous talent MGM could summon in the worst year of the Depression and maybe the best it was ever able to gather together in the many constellations it assembled. Dressler heads a large ensemble cast with several distinct but interlocking stories all leading up to but never quite making a posh dinner party at the mansion of Billie Burke wife of shipping magnate Lionel Barrymore. Desperately trying to snag the unseen Lord and Lady Ferncliffe  moldering aristocrats she once met at Cap d'Antibes  Burke bullies and badgers everybody she can think of to seat a swank table. Worrying about nothing so much as how 'dressy' the aspic will be  it's the British Lion molded out of a quivering gelatin  she's oblivious to the human dramas whirling around the people on her guest list.For starters her husband is not only seriously ill but close to bankruptcy to boot. Down in his nautical offices on The Battery he's paid a visit by an old and older than he flame Dressler a bit down on her luck herself 'I'm flatter than a pancake  I haven't a sou' she wants to sell her stock in his company. Another visitor one of the sharks circling around to feast on his bleeding empire. is Wallace Beery a loudmouthed boor whom Barrymore nonetheless cajoles Burke into inviting against her snobbish sensibilities. Beery a politically connected wheelerdealer has problems of his own namely his wife Jean Harlow. She lounges luxuriously in bed most of the day changing in and out of furtrimmed bed jackets and sampling chocolates while waiting for her doctorlover Edmund Lowe to pay another house call under the pretext of tending to her imaginary ailments. Burke's and Barrymore's young daughter meanwhile conceals a clandestine affair with 'free white and 45 marquee idol John Barrymore a washedup drunk whose grandiose airs can't even fool the bellboys he sends out for bottles of hooch a storyline in the screenplay cowritten by the also alcoholic Herman J. Mankiewicz  from the George S. KaufmannEdna Ferber stage hit  that can't have been comfortable for the similarly afflicted Barrymore who's even referred to in the movie by his emblematic sobriquet 'The Great Profile'. Those are the major strands of the story but there's even more talent on board Louise Closser Hale as Burke's pithy cousin May Robson as the cook in charge of the illstarred aspic Lee Tracy as John Barrymore's exasperated agent and deliciously Hilda Vaughn as Harlow's mercenary maid. The goingson range from the farcical to the tragic and for the most part the cast does proud in coping with the often drastic shifts of tone true some episodes carry more weight than others some players less inspired than their colleagues it's an episodic movie at times dated from the infancy of talkies when scenes were not a snappily edited few seconds but prolonged and often stagy. Still in this starry cast Dressler shines brightest. A Canadian gal who started in the circus she worked in vaudeville theater and in the last few decades of her life in Hollywood. Despite her girth and the delapidations gravity had worked on her face she's never less than transfixing. She tosses off the requisite comedy as effortlessly as that oldest of pros that she had become yet can draw the camera to her deeply kohled eyes when she imparts some very bad news and turn it into a few seconds of threnody. Only Barbara Stanwyck commands so boundless a range which we have the luxury of observing over several decades of her career what survives of Dressler dates only from her few last years. Dressler would make but one more movie before her death but it's chivalrous to think of Dinner At Eight as her grand exit.As Dinner At Eight winds down the aspic never makes it to table nor do some of the expected guests. But life plods on if capriciously and unfairly. Burke at the end of her tether utters a plangent cry that sums up man's impotence against the cruelty of fate 'Crabmeat...CRABMEAT!'".

These names are even more impressive than the castlist Brothers Barrymore Jean Harlow Billie Burke Wallace Beery et al. All under the direction of George Cukor in a film produced by David O. Selznick for MGM which at the time 1933 was run by Irving G. Thalberg. Old Hollywood enough for you? Of course you'll have to make allowances for the primitive miseenscene  after all talkies had been around for only a few years when this movie was made. The new innovation of sound was considered a more than fair compensation for the loss of the visual pyrotechnics introduced by the great silent directors like Griffith. Therefore movies from this particular era look boxed in stuffed with talk talk and more talk. Luckily in this instance the talk is generally interesting almost always witty and attuned to the idiosyncrasies of the various characters. Finally the whole piece is shot through with that certain worldweariness that comes from creative artists attempting to assess and say goodbye to the end of an epoch. Let me expand a bit on that. Consider three of the characters first there's Marie Dressler's former stage actress a sort of grande dame Sarah Bernhardt type now old and corpulent keeping a merciless eye on her finances wistfully recounting the glories of the longpast era of Delmonico's and horsedrawn carriages on The Broad Way. There's her longtime friend and former beau Lionel Barrymore a sclerotic magnate of a shipping empire. His heart and his business have both seen better days. And finally there's John Barrymore the Barrymores don't play brothers in the movie in fact they never share a moment of screen time a washedup hasbeen 47yearold movie star of the silent era living in a posh hotel room he can't afford haunted by the memory of fame and three exwives pestered by a 19yearold girlfriend who won't allow him to drink himself to death. These characters are the most obvious symbols of an era that has passed . . . but even Billie Burke's nervous socialite with her humorously singleminded pursuit of the perfect dinner party represents a melancholy reflection of What Used to Be. When her husband Lionel confesses to her that his shipping business is going broke in the new age of airplanes we know that dinner parties will be the least of her worries in the near future. There's a Depression on you know. And modernity  the current heartless variety  is hot on everyone's heels.The movie sets these relics against the crass New Breed typified by the most unlikely husbandandwife team in the history of movies Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery. While Beery goes about the business of destroying Lionel's business Harlow lolls around in bed wearing furtrimmed gowns noshing chocolates. Even their maid is a disrespectful blackmailer demanding from Harlow hushjewelry to keep from mentioning Harlow's adulteries to her husband. But somewhere between having an affair with her doctor and clawing her way into respectable society Harlow manages to find her own core of decency she keeps that pig of a husband on the relatively upandup. The movie's writers don't ENTIRELY give up on the new generation. Harlow is even reading a book  a NUTTY kind of a book but it's a positive sign nevertheless.Dressler's doubletake after hearing Harlow confess to reading a book is of course worldfamous. Everyone remembers Dressler's punchline too. But too few pause to think of what Harlow describes her book to be about a society in which machines do all of the work for us a society in which machines will virtually replace us. And thus this brings us back to theme of the passing genteel age and the coming new age with its attendant ugliness parading under the banner of progress. Yes Harlow will never be replaced as Dressler points out. But who among us is Jean Harlow? Dinner at Eight is probably the snappiest dirge the wittiest elegy ever produced by Hollywood. It was made in an era when actual artists worked in that L.A. suburb  unlike the automatons running the show today. As such it's prophetic about the artform to which it belongs as well. 9 stars out 10.".

Dinner at Eight is one of the classic plays of that era having been written for the stage by George Kaufman and Edna Ferber. The screen adaptation of the play is by Herman Mankiewicz Frances Marion and Donald Ogden Stewart some of the best writers the movies ever had. The film under the impeccable direction of George Cukor makes Dinner at Eight one of the classics of the American cinema.Dinner at Eight is a comedy at heart but there are elements of drama in it as well. On the one hand it offers easy laughter for the viewer but it also has a dark aspect in its dealing with alcoholism and adultery. The film like its predecessor offers several story lines that keeps us interested in the different relationships the film presents for us.Dinner at Eight boasts one of the best casts ever assembled for a movie. Marie Dressler who is seen as Carlota Vance was one of the best actresses working in the movies at the time. Lionel and John Barrymore had been seen together in Grand Hotel and both play pivotal parts in this film as well. The effervescent Billie Burke is one of the best things in the movie. Ms. Burke was one bright star whose contribution to the success of the films she appeared in was a guarantee for the people behind any project.Wallace Beery plays the boorish and influential industrialist Dan Packard a man to be reckoned with. Jean Harlow portrays his wife the low life Kitty who was twotiming Dan. In a way Dan and Kitty seem to have been the prototypes for Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday because both characters bear a certain similarity in both films.The supporting members of the cast are impressive. Edmund Lowe Lee Tracy Madge Evans Louise Closser Hale May Robson Jean Hersholt Karen Morley and the rest aside from giving good performances leave their own mark in the film.A great cinematographer was behind the camera for this movie William Daniels. His amazing work is one of the best in any of the pictures he photographed. Mr. Daniels knew how to direct his camera to get the most out of these talented actors one sees in Dinner at Eight Of course this is a film that bears the David O. Selznick signature for it was he who decided to transform the play into a motion picture and he succeeded in doing it. Most of the creditor must go to director George Cukor who was truly inspired in making Dinner at Eight a movie that has endured the passage of time.".

This lavish allstar MGMproduction still is great entertainment. Some of it's notions are somewhat dated perhaps but with this team behind  and in the film  nothing can go wrong.A portrait of various strata of New York society the clash between the newly riches and the old elite the Old and New World the battle of the sexes between Wallace Beery and Harlow Gotham in a nutshell. Nothing is really happening the same as its twin brother GRAND HOTEL and essentially it's a filmed play based on the play by George S.

Jean Harlow the Blonde Bombshell as the deliciously vulgar wife of Wallace Beery the new man in town trying to connect with the New York elite and Washington politicians. John Barrymore is fantastic as a once famous actor from the silent era who cannot accept the fact that his career is over.To me the film is just a perfect time capsule of so many typical topics of the era the depression the transition from silents to talkies the continuous transformation of the upper crust of New York society the traveling by ocean steamer to Europe... It's actually a very rich film no matter how fluffy it might look in the case of Jean Harlow's wardrobe quite literally. And when given a treatment like this the topnotch cast good writing gorgeous sets under the supervision of David O. Selznick and George Cukor it's a feast for the eye. Camera Obscura  910".

	schema:reviewBody "DINNER AT EIGHT MetroGoldwynMayer 1933 directed by George Cukor MGM's second attempt with an allstar production following the success to GRAND HOTEL 1932 is a remarkable as well as memorable movie that has benefited from repeated viewings over the past years. As with GRAND HOTEL DINNER AT EIGHT was adapted from a stage play by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber and reunites some of its GRAND HOTEL performers including John and Lionel Barrymore Wallace Beery and Jean Hersholt. Unlike GRAND HOTEL DINNER AT EIGHT is one of the best movies ever assembled to not receive a single Academy Award nomination. Even though it would be difficult to pinpoint which of the major stars might have been worthy of that honor a Best Picture nominee would have spoken for the entire cast. In the usual manner of all star productions of the major leads all introduced with each face framed in a dinner plate the one whose name comes first is the one with either the least amount of screen time or the one whose character enters late into the story. The star in question is Marie Dressler a topname at the time leaving a big impression with her limited performance and yet it is Billie Burke as Millicent Jordan whose presence is felt throughout mainly because it's her dinner party. The story begins with Millicent Jordan Burke a New York social wife announcing her upcoming dinner party she's arranging for Lord and Lady Ferncliffe and the people she intends to invite. As with the stage production the movie plays out in numerous acts a The Jordan Home Introductory scenes focusing on Millicent Burke her husband Oliver Lionel Barrymore head of a declining shipping company and their troubled daughter Paula Madge Evans b At the Office Oliver is visited by once acclaimed stage actress Carlotta Vance Marie Dressler with whom he had loved in his youth as well as one of the invited guests and Dan Packard Wallace Beery a middleaged promoter whom Oliver hopes could save him from his financial difficulties c The Battling Packards As a favor to Oliver Millicent reluctantly telephones Kitty Jean Harlow and invites the lowlife couple to her dinner. Kitty spoiled and lazy wants nothing more than to break into society and meet the right kind of people. Being home all day doing nothing Kitty secretly carries on a love affair with her family doctor Wayne Talbot Edmund Lowe while her husband goes away on business a secret known only by Kitty's maid Hilda Vaughn d The Matine Idol In need of an extra dinner guest Millicent invites matine idol Larry Renault John Barrymore a friend of the family in town staying at the Versailles Hotel. Unknown to Millicent her engaged daughter Paula is secretly Renault's mistress e Dr. Talbot's Domestic Problems Scene involves Kitty's doctor and his illicit affairs with his patients as discussed between him and his understanding wife Karen Morley. which concludes with a visit from gravely ill Oliver who is diagnosed with heart disease f Back to the Jordan Home While Millicent is interacted between scenes involving the dinner guests this segment involves Millicent's own domestic problems with her hired help as well as the news about her guests of honor departing for Florida leaving Millicent to locate substitutes as the guests of honor g Final Showdown for the Packards In their home getting ready for the function Dan and Kitty come to a showdown revealing how they actually feel about one other with all their secrets coming out h Renault's Tragic Performance Renault turns down the one act part as a beachcomber in a forthcoming play offered to him by an important producer Jean Hersholt. Believing he is still important to the theater Renault's trying and upset agent Lee Tracy brings the drunken actor to reality by telling him his career has ended long ago. Later after the management asks him to leave the hotel Renault agrees thus giving his one last performance to take place in the room i Dinner at Eight The gathering of all the party guests at the Jordan home with some resolutions resolved concluding with the most celebrated exchange between Carlotta and Kitty. Categorized as a comedy with the exception of some cleverly written dialog DINNER AT EIGHT is anything but a comedy. In truth it's actually a stylish dramatic story centering upon the troublesome lives of Millicent Jordan and chapters involving her invited guests. The most interesting as well as tragic is John Barrymore's as Larry Renault and how his character closely foreshadows his own life as a habitual drinker a fading actor with exwives now in financial ruin. He is even addressed to as The Great Profile by his agent Tracy. What's even more ironic is that Marie Dressler and Jean Harlow who closing scene is classic each would be dead not long after the release DINNER AT EIGHT leaving their legacies behind them. Besides the leading players others in support include Phillips Holmes Louise Closser Hale May Robson Grant Mitchell and Elizabeth Patterson all giving capable performances under Cukor's excellent direction. No underscoring whatsoever with the exception of I Kiss Your Hand Madame which is themed during the opening credits and orchestra playing at the final minutes of the function DINNER AT EIGHT appears to be a motion picture that has surpassed the 1932 Broadway play.Distributed on video cassette as far back at the 1980s and later on DVD DINNER AT EIGHT which makes a good double bill along with GRAND HOTEL frequently plays on Turner Classic Movies. While there has been a 1989 madefortelevision remake which premiered on Turner Network Television with everything brought up to date the main course on the menu today continues to be the unsurpassed 1933 appetizer.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Dinner at Eight is one of the best comedies ever made in Hollywood. Any reviewer who has claimed that it isn't a comedy needs to reexamine the picture. Although undeniably dark in its tone the film is undeniably hilarious especially when certain actors are onscreen. It could be called a dark comedy even a black comedy but a comedy it is nonetheless. There are eight abovethetitle' stars in this picture.Billie Burke except for the scene in which she discovers her husband is ill is a parody of the society woman. Every line of hers emphasizing her scatterbrainness and her lack of priorities reeks of hilarity. Her role is pure comedy.Lionel Barrymore playing a sickly business tycoon has a less comedic role. His opening lines about Australian mutton' are hilarious. The way he watches his wife planning the party is also quite comedic. His dramatic moments juxtapose alongside his wife's to create some of her funniest moments. His part is almost split down the middle between comedy and drama.Wallace Beery portraying a ruthless uncouth business man is hilarious. His vulgarity contradict everything Mrs. Jordan views as ideal. He screams yells and has a violent temper. And boy is he funny to watch. Anyone who tries to label his performance as anywhere near dramatic should have his or her head examined. He gives the funnies male performance in the film. The role is almost all comedy.Jean Harlow as his slutty common vixenofawife gives the finest comedic performance of her entire career. She snarls changes her voice in different conversations manipulates and lies all to comedic perfection. Just the sound of her voice saying the most outrageous dialogue to boot triggers the laughs. This is the most comedic role in the picture.John Barrymore as an aging silent matinee idol is the film's most dramatic performance. Although he has some comic moments very few and some ironic and satirical actions when he kills himself for example he positions the light perfectly to capture his profile for the most part his scenes give the film their most dramatic moments. The performance is about 90 drama.Edmund Lowe playing a doctorcumplayboy having a tryst with Harlow has his part split down the middle. He is often funny never reaching the sheer hilarity of some of the others but also never quite elevating to the heights of histrionics either. His views on extramarital affairs are pretty funny but when he has to tell a patient of impending illness its drama. The fact that he specializes in bedside manner' is just funny and his first embrace with his patient' is a scathing critique of corrupt society. Just as Lionel Barrymore's role Lowe's is split fiftyfifty right down the middle.Lee Tracy as John Barrymore's agent is simply hilarious. His vocal fluctuations were his trademark and the part seems tailormade for him. Although he has many dramatic moments he is very funny most of the time. His reactions and gestures are wonderful. In all this part is about 60 comedy 40 drama.Marie Dressler as a grand dame of the 1890s is priceless. She allbut steals the picture from her costars. Sprinkled among her part are dozens of comic innuendos and perfect double takes. She is perfect and absolutely hilarious at all time with the exception of the one scene in which she must explain to a young woman that her lover has committed suicide. The rest of the time she goes traipsing about making a perfect spectacle of herself and she is the greatest asset to the film actingwise. Her part is 99 comic except for that one scene.The supporting actors particularly Louise Closser Hale and Grant Withers are comedic perfection. With the exception of the scenes in John Barryore's room at the Hotel Versailles almost every supporting role is meant to be funny. The sets and costumes poke fun at the times too and in the last analysis the picture is a dramatic comedy but a comedy bien sr!".

	schema:reviewBody "Dinner at Eight is MGM's screen adaption of the George S. KaufmanEdna Ferber play of the same name that went immediately to the screen upon completion of its 232 performance run on Broadway. None of the cast from Broadway made it to Hollywood but MGM put together one stellar cast of its own.The central figure in this American drama of manners is Billie Burke who plays Mrs. Millicent Jordan society woman whose sole concern is seeing that a formal dinner she's given comes off just right. All around her including her own family and the lives of her guests are in crisis. Her husband Lionel Barrymore has health and business problems. Those business problems are being caused both the Depression and Wallace Beery who's trying to take over Barrymore's family shipping business. Of course Beery's concerns are domestic his wife Jean Harlow's been carrying on with her doctor Edmund Lowe who in turn has got nurse Karen Morley on the side as well.Also on the Jordan domestic front Barrymore and Burke's daughter Madge Evans is about to throw over her fianc Phillips Holmes because she's gotten herself involved with a has been actor with a substance abuse problem John Barrymore. Through all of this Burke flounces her way through like a female version of Clifton Webb's Elliot Templeton from The Razor's Edge whose sole concern was gossip and making sure his clothes properly fit.Rounding out this cast and in fact first billed is Marie Dressler who plays an old musical comedy star who Lionel as a youth crushed out on big time. She's a wise old bird probably could give some good advice if more people would confide in her. This was Dressler's next to last film and they don't get better than this. She's got the final and best line of the film when she comments on Jean Harlow's prospects for the' future. Frank Capra wanted Dressler to play Apple Annie in his first real hit film Lady for a Day earlier in the year. The part went to May Robson who is also in the movie as Billie Burke's cook. It was interesting to have them in the same film I only wish they had a scene together.The best performance in the film goes to John Barrymore who probably drew from his own self destructive impulses to create the character of Larry Renault. He's an over the hill motion picture actor who apparently only Madge Evans loves any more. No one will put up with his king size ego when they're accompanied with king size benders. John Barrymore created a whole group of self destructors in his career several films of which I've seen recently like Counsellor at Law Beau Brummel and Grand Hotel to accompany Dinner at Eight. Barrymore is nothing short of brilliant. See how he goes to pieces when his press agent Lee Tracy finally tells him he's washed up and Tracy's washed up with him.George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber are a pair of unusual collaborators. Both members of the famous Algonquin Round Table Dinner at Eight is unusual for both. The usual Ferber saga about empire builders is certainly not Dinner at Eight. Lionel Barrymore's empire is already built and its tottering. And Kaufman's satire the kind you find in works like I'd Rather Be Right and The Man Who Came To Dinner is muted here to a large degree.This was George Cukor's first film under his new MGM contract where producer David O. Selznick brought him when they both left RKO. It was an auspicious debut for Cukor. Cukor got spot on performances from his cast. Dinner at Eight is dated however still excellent. People just don't put on tuxedos for dinner any more today's audience might find that strange. But it was a more elegant time.".

Personally I much prefer brother Lionel's playing of Oliver Jordan he's not so hammy.

Kaufman comedydrama that covers the lives of people involved in a high society dinner party in Manhattan in the early 1930's. Billie Burke's Millicent Jordan is so excited that she has gotten the wealthy British Ferncliffs to come to dinner. But as soon as she gets the good news everything else seems to go wrong. The kitchen staff is fighting her daughter has romantic problems and the guests she wants can't come so she has to invite the guests she doesn't really want only because they are business associates of her husband's.Burke is married to wealthy businessman Oliver Jordan Lionel Barrymore who is having health issues. When his old flame Carlotta Vance Marie Dressler shows up for a visit she too is invited although she's a bit insulted when Oliver's secretary Elizabeth Patterson recalls seeing her on stage when she was just a little girl. We must have a talk about the civil war some time Dressler snaps eyeing the obviously middle aged woman up and down in aghast fury. Just you and I. With those huge sad eyes and that imperious presence Dressler looks as if she ended up being reincarnated as the St. Bernard in the T.V. series version of Topper and here she steals every moment she's on whether offering advice to Burke and Barrymore's daughter Madge Evans or taking her own pooch to task for being naughty on a hotel carpet.Then there's the Packards Dan and Kitty Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow new money as Burke would refer to them as and just as tacky as they appear to be. Kitty is obviously a philanderer and Dan is too busy to even seem to care. He's working on a takeover of Jordan stock and when this is revealed to Oliver his health begins to decline even more. Drunken actor Larry Renault John Barrymore in an ironic choice of casting is desperate for work but turns down a small supporting part in a play presented to him by his frustrated agent Lee Tracy. In love with Evans but not wanting to saddle her with being down on his luck Barrymore makes a drastic decision that will certainly have a massive effect on Burkes' plans.If there had been Oscars for supporting performances in 1933 Billie Burke would have won for her role of the selfish demanding Mrs. Jordan who goes haywire and finally has a breakdown as her plans all fall apart. She goes off on a tirade so delicious that you can't believe that this is Glinda the Good Witch and all of those dizzy socialites she later played spouting. In smaller performances May Robson Louise Closser Hale and Grant Mitchell shine. The direction by George Cukor is superb. In the just over two hour running time everybody has something delicious to do and in that time you will find so many thrills you will want to return to dinner again and again.".

It made me very happy to see her that way glammedup if you will. I read about Marie's early life and have seen photographs of her in her stagestar days early in the 20th Century. She was a tough personality forceful and not really ugly. Later on she was a major force during the Actors' Strike of 1919  on the side of the actors I think. She was true to her ideals.Lionel and John Barrymore I have studied many times the genealogy of their famous ancestors and progeny. Ethel Barrymore was a beautiful Broadway star during the early 20th Century. I feel that all three of them turned to films for money reasons after the utter tragedy of World War I the theatre business died  a lot of the old stories were now severely outdated. We come down the generations to today's Drew Barrymore. Her ancestors were John Drew and Louisa Lane Drew as well as Georgiana Drew and Maurice Barrymore. Love that famous drunk John Barrymore.Jean Harlow  played the slut who had the unmitigated nerve to stand up to seamy Wallace Beery LOL. He threatened to throw her out  to kick her to the curb but yet she kept on mouthing off at him as if he were old newspapers to be taken to the garbage can. You go girl! Too bad her career was cut short by early death.The maid was cool. I loved the part about the bracelet Harlow threw on the floor and that the maid really knew all about the doctor Harlow was messing around with LOL. Harlow called the maid Stupid and verbally abused her. Beery called Harlow Stupid etc. yada yada. LMAO! I know that actors have to be smart to play dumb case in point Marilyn Monroe fer cryin' out loud.Billie Burke was always so divine. I read the books she wrote. They tell fascinating reports of her life as Mrs. Florenz Ziegfeld plus they give tips on makeup and how to hold on to your man. Priceless. Just click your heels together and there's no place like home. Don't quote me exactly.The doctor was a handsome hunk and I think his wife was stupid for clinging to him like such a pathetic vine  what with all his affairs in which he couldn't help getting involved. He didn't deserve his saint of a wife from what I could see at any rate. Today the wife would go to a women's empowerment group and find the strength to leave her multiadulterous husband.I like another Wallace Beery movie where Carmen Miranda is secretly teaching him how to dance as a surprise for his wife. He gets into dutch when he is suspected of having a flingontheside with the little South American hot tamale. Can't think of the name of the movie though.That's about all. I really liked this movie and hope I can see it again. I see that other posters give this movie rave reviews. I have never seen it all the way through always some interruptions. Still if you read my other reviews you know that my favorites are always singing and dancing movies but Dinner at Eight rates near the top of my evergrowing list. Really a 1510.".

When Vance first tells Jordan the name she has to look at the check to get the name. When Jordan is on the phone she states the name as she remembers it and the two differ. The change in the name is not a goof but a wonderfully done Dressler moment showing that her character after downing a large glass of whiskey neat that she is more than a bit addled. It was so marvelously done that she fooled even the IMDb staff! Hurrah Marie. Well done!".

When Vance first tells Jordan the name she has to look at the check to get the name. When Jordan is on the phone she states the name as she remembers it and the two differ. The change in the name is not a goof but a wonderfully done Dressler moment showing that her character after downing a large glass of whiskey neat that she is more than a bit addled. It was so marvelously done that she fooled even the IMDb staff! Hurrah Marie. Well done!";

	schema:headline " A Glorious Film About a Disastrous Dinner Party";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was the followup to 1932's best film GRAND HOTEL. MGM had discovered that there was tremendous box office appeal if they had a film with a roster of stars in all the main roles. In this case the roles are played by Lionel and John Barrymore Wallace Beery Lee Tracy Edmund Lowe Philips Holmes Jean Hersholt Marie Dressler Jean Harlow Billie Burke Madge Blake Karen Morley Louise Closser Hale and Grant Mitchell. Mitchell adds a nice touch of brief asperity to the proceedings as a relative by marriage dragged to the dreary dinner party on the night he was planning to see a Greta Garbo movie. I take it that George Kaufman was responsible for that little jab. Kaufman wrote this screenplay with Edna Ferber SO BIG SHOWBOAT from their Broadway play  later they would do the masterly STAGEDOOR. The director was George Cukor who managed to get the best performances from all of the players.Lionel Barrymore is Oliver Jordan married to Billie Burke Millicent Jordan and father to Madge Blake Paula Jordan. Barrymore is the owner of a steamship line that is suddenly having financial difficulties. He is facing bankruptcy unless he can get help. He is also suffering from heart disease and is keeping this from his family.Barrymore turns to Dan Packard Wallace Beery a wealthy stock manipulator with political ambitions he has been mentioned for a possible cabinet post. Packard is actually undermining Jordan's company to take it over. Barrymore is also checking into some of the stockholders. One is an old flame of his Carlotta Vance  a great stage star of the teens Marie Dressler. Carlotta is socially a success but her financial security is not as good this is the depression and she may have to sell the stock for her own sake. Burke is planning a large dinner party for the richest man in England a steamship tycoon. Barrymore could really not care that much but it might help his business. Packard is interested in the dinner party  his dreams of a large steamship empire could stand an English partner. So he wrangles an invitation for himself and his wife Kitty Jean Harlow. Harlow is a toy wife Packard's first wife died and is a low class type who looks terrific. But she and Beery are constantly at odds about almost everything. She too is interested in attending the party because she wants to be socially accepted by the wealthy set. Also her physician Dr. Wayne Talbot Edmund Lowe is attending with his nursewife Lucy Karen Morley. Harlow is happy about that  she has been having an affair with Dr. Talbot.Madge Blake has been engaged to Ernest DeGraff Philips Holmes but has wrangled a dinner invitation for Larry Renault John Barrymore a once great leading man now headed for oblivion due to his alcoholism. Blake has been secretly having an affair with him. Renault's career is at a nadir despite the work of his agent Max Kane Lee Tracy. But Tracy has a last opportunity to save Renault with a small role in a play produced by Jo Stengel Jean Hersholt. If the job is secured Renault may not face eviction from the hotel he is currently in managed by Edwin Maxwell.All these elements come together in the last act as chance comic misunderstanding and farce and tragedy are blended together to prevent some people from attending the dinner and others are invited in their place. Relationships are ended and others are reinforced for better or worse. The funniest performances are Dressler Beery and Harlow as the battling Packards and Burke when she explodes in anger about her guests. The saddest is John Barrymore who with the assistance of Cukor uses that great profile of his in a macabre final scene. But the dinner is still served to the guests who show up at 800 P.M. on the dot and the final moment is gloriously shared by Mrs. Packard and Carlotta discussing literature and the future of man...and women.".

Remarkably though it consistently engages with the darker side of life. It's one of the few 1930s movies I've seen that takes into account the Great Depression and the everpresent risk of financial ruin. It also deals quite maturely with adultery illness and aging.The movie follows a week in the lives of a number of New Yorkers who have been invited to a dinner party hosted by Oliver and Millicent Jordan Lionel Barrymore and Billie Burke. While sometimes the plot is a little melodramatic its serious undercurrents make it more realistic than other movies of the era and a good social commentary.That's not to say though that Dinner at Eight isn't funny. The humor arises from the characters rather than the situations this is not a screwball comedy!. Marie Dressler as an aging grande dame of the theatre Jean Harlow as a vulgar and ambitious young wife and Billie Burke as the sublimely frivolous hostess all have great fun with their somewhat stereotypical roles finding fresh gestures and intonations that make them very amusing. John Barrymore is also excellent as a proud but washedup matine idol in his last scene he is simultaneously funny and moving.Dinner at Eight's only flaw but it's a big flaw is that it still feels like a filmed play. Most of the vignettes go on for too long after they have made their point and could use some trimming. If that had happened there might have been room for an additional subplot found in the play about a love triangle between the Jordans' butler maid and chauffeur. This triangle is mentioned briefly in the film but it would be nice to see it play out especially because it might provide more social commentary about class distinctions.".

If you don't respond to the stiffly filmed camera on a tripod movies of this time and not all of them are like this you'll struggle with the tableauonastage effects here. But if you think of it as theater with its requisite focus on acting in all its exaggerations and subtleties both you'll see some amazing writing and performances in what is one of George Cukor's best directing efforts. I really think this is a brilliant film and if it lacks the visual drama the interesting lighting or the naturalistic feel you expect give it another try and take it on its own terms. You might be really glad.First of all I think the best performance of all is Lionel Barrymore's. Sure coming in a close second is the pathos filled drama made vivid and tearjerking by his brother. The scene with John Barrymore as the washed up actor as he kills himself is one of cinema's great moments I think and I sound like I'm exaggerating but watch how it unfolds without sound and without pretense until he fades away his profile carefully positioned so that when the door is opened on his corpse that is what everyone will see. Beyond even that though and working with less emphatic material Lionel as the businessman struggling with the full weight of the depression parries all the woes and the friendships as he suffers his brush with mortality. His understatement is perfect. He makes the film more than a sensation.His wife played by Billie Burke of Wizard of Oz fame as the good witch is brilliantly frivolous. Watch how she actually makes her absurdity fluid and alive. And most of all watch how by the end her love for her husband crystallizes not in some sea change but in a believable minor shiftcanceling the performance refocusing on the moment. But not giving up dinner not after all that has preceded.Some people love Jean Harlow for her role as a ditzy tart and I have a problem with women portrayed as idiots even if they have a razor sharp side to them and so Harlow grates on me a little. She does act with verve and you can tell she's a lot of fun. Not so her husband played by Wallace Beery. I'll leave his bombast alone. But the third caricature in the movie is the brilliant brilliant need I repeat brilliant Marie Dressler playing an aging woman who has both her history and her wisdom to delicately trail behind her. Her interactions with the wouldbe tartlet the young woman and daughter foolishly and understandably in love with John Barrymore are treasures from start to finish especially at the end. Don't mistake Dressler's oversized expressions as hamming it up. There are people almost like that and it projects on the screen really well.When all is said and done the multilayered plot here wraps together with clever ease and by the time the movie ends right at eight o'clock yes dinner is served after we are done watching there is this feeling of complete satisfaction. It may not be coincidence that one of the screenwriters Herman J. Mankiewicz also famously helped with Citizen Kane. Life has its dramas and traumas and humors and disappointments. But it works out somehow in a different way than we intended surely but because of the good will and smart reactions of the best of us.".

Yes it is staged but what of it the performances shine through. Marie Dressler steals her scenes to great effect and is perfect up against Jean Harlow with the famous reading a book double take at the end of the movie for which this film is usually remembered. Billie Burke's performance is somewhat overlooked but is a comedy masterpiece. They simply do not make films like this any more enjoyable thoughtful and very funny. It helped to have so many Stars under contract to MGM at the time in this film they had the pick of the bunch.";

Clarice Starling the FBI agent whom he aided to apprehend a serial killer was placed in charge of an operation but when one of her men botches it she's called to the mat by the Bureau. One high ranking official Paul Krendler has it in for her. But she gets a reprieve because Mason Verger one of Lecter's victims who is looking to get back at Lecter for what Lecter did to him wants to use Starling to lure him out. When Lecter sends her a note she learns that he's in Italy so she asks the police to keep an eye out for him. But a corrupt policeman who wants to get the reward that Verger placed on him tells Verger where he is. But they fail to get him. Later Verger decides to frame Starling which makes Lecter return to the States. And the race to get Lecter begins.";

In fairness perhaps there was no way it could be.  In SOTL he was somehow more foreboding more of a sort of superhuman monster in Hannibal he's more accessible a guy you meet on the street.  Maybe it was impossible to maintain the mystery of Lecter that we saw in SOTL because of the risk of doing a rehash.  I'd give the overall Dr Lecter character a 9 of 10 in this film vs. a 10 of 10 in the last one.  Not quite as good but still very good.Starling's character on the other hand fell flat in this film.  In SOTL Foster perfectly portrayed Starling's flat surface with a turbulent depth in Hannibal there was nothing under her surface.  Foster's Clarice evoked feelings of sympathetic grief Moore's Clarice evoked nothing.  I do not necessarily blame Moore this could be due to writing andor directing. Obviously though SOTL focused mainly on Starling's character Hannibal focuses on well Hannibal.  Still that's no excuse for what was done to Starling.  Her character gets a 3 of 10.The story was much weaker in Hannibal than in SOTL.  It almost seemed like an excuse to present us with the characters rather than a story in and of itself.  Still it had no other major flaws so it gets a 6 of 10.Now there's another category I'll call the shock factor.  It's different than ordinary gore it's... creative gore.  The sick disgusting depravity we expect to see and like to see in this type of film.  I can't go into detail without spoiling it but I'll have to say it goes even beyond what I expected.  Do not watch this film if you are squeamish or dislike gore. There isn't a lot of gore in the film but what there was was... concentrated.  Shock Factor 10 of 10.Overall I give the film an 8 of 10.  Very well done with a few weaknesses well worth watching.".

It may have been revolting okay it was very definitely revolting but so few movies these days have any lasting impact and I appreciate that this one did.

Of course the horror of the climax is effective because the rest of the film is so good. Hopkins a little chunkier than the last time we saw him in this role positively exudes menace especially in his final confrontation with Pazzi an excellent Giancarlo Giannini whose sad eyes make him the most sympathetic character in the film. Then there's Gary Oldman's Mason Verger who is so contemptible that he never elicits sympathy no matter how he suffered at the hands of Lector. And Julianne Moore is an improvement over Jodie Foster who I have always believed was overrated.But the best thing about Hannibal is the atmosphere in which Scott and his team envelop the story. A cloud of dread hangs over this film and beautiful Florence Italy though still beautiful appears haunted by Lector's very presence in the city.".

It could have bombed badly therefore if writer and actor had let us down by failing to catch the magic again. It was after all a decade after the original was made. But they don't and Anthony Hopkins turns in another delicious performance as the man with the evil intent cloaked in inestimable menacing charm.Julianne Moore drew the short straw in having to recreate the Clarice Starling role that had been so memorably played by another actress. She does well in my opinion but inevitably we keep thinking 'where is Jodie Foster?' and this lends her portrayal a lack of credibility which is entirely unfair. Gary Oldman's Mason Verger is suitably loathsome and manages to make Lecter seem almost like the hero in their battle of wits. If there is a weak link Ray Liotta's Krendler seems a bit misplaced.The direction deserves special mention. The lush beautiful settings are mocked by the horror of what is happening in them and the perfectlyselected atmospheric music stayed in my mind long after the film had ended.Once again the film lacks realism but as with the original it doesn't matter. Of course things like this don't really happen  but so what? It's a film. Get over it! I was prompted after seeing it to read the books and the right decision was made in changing the ending of this story from that written by Thomas Harris.

Most people hate this film I love it....well 95 percent of it anyway.The shame of it is that most people only remember the last 10 minutes a totally gruesome scene in which the top of a man's head is cut off and he's fed a morsel of his own brain. Of course it's disgusting and I don't find it easy to watch either.However the first two hours of the film offers a feast if you'll pardon the pun for the eyes and ears that is not revolting except for one other threesecond shot. This is one of the most beautifullyfilmed movies I've ever seen. Scene after scene is just jaw dropping and features some of the best shots outside and inside of Florence Italy you could ever imagine. Ridley Scott is known for his stylish direction and that is certainly the case here.The dialog is fascinating led by Anthony Hopkins' famous Hannibal Lecter character whose vocabulary and intelligent sarcasm and baiting are clever and entertaining to hear. Unlike Silence Of the Lambs there is little verbal crudeness in this film very little profanity at all. On the third viewing I played this with the English subtitles on so I could catch all the dialog.This was a much lowerkey film than it's famous predecessor which probably disappointed a lot of people who prefer a lot more violence and fwords in their crime movies.Although Jodie Foster performed well in the role of FBI Agent Clarice Starling I preferred watching and listening to Julianne Moore play the part in this film. A sleeper here too was the great performance by Giancarlo Gianni as the greedy Italian lawman who winds up paying a huge price for his avarice.Like Godfather III this is a very unjustlycriticized and overlooked third installment of a famous film trilogy.".

While a little unevenly paced the beginning was a bit slow David Mamet and Steve Zallian have done a good job of telling the basic story Thomas Harris gave to us  and incidently the book was incredibly underrated by critics whose thought processes seem to have been damaged by too little quality literature. People have complained that it took ten years for Harris to write it  well read it! It is chockablock full of mythology astronomical and religious themes that weave their way throughout. The threads never break. The movie would have had to be eight hours long to even begin to explore the depths plumbed by Harris in the book.Anthony Hopkins is as usual brilliant! Julianne Moore was sexy and strong. Giancarlo Giannini was outstanding and Gary Oldman creditable. My only complaint with casting was Ray Liotta who just didn't have it.Having seen this movie three times thus far I will say that watching it is like peeling layers off an onion. You see more and more with each viewing  little treasures and nuggets that you find almost by accident. The first time I saw it I left the theatre not really knowing what I thought of it. Then I found myself smiling. I did like it. When I went back again and again! I liked it more and more.Gory? Not really  and I consider myself pretty sensitive to gore. I have seen far worse. The story does have violence in it and I think Ridley Scott while depicting an integral part of the story handled the violence tastefully if you'll pardon the expression.Is it as good as Silence of the Lambs? No. It's DIFFERENT from SotL. In Silence we had a caged monster whose intensity was extremely focussed. Here we have a monster who is on the loose in a great big world free to indulge in his passions. Hannibal Lecter's essence has not changed. He's merely in a different situation.My only disappointments were The changed ending. This was the major one. I realize the critics lambasted Thomas Harris for the ending in the book saying Clarice would never have done that but Clarice was the child of Harris' imagination. The author is god and if god says a character will do something who are we to secondguess?The length of the movie. It could have been a little longer and more focus could have been put on the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice  specifically his obsession with her and the time they spent together after the fiasco at the Verger Estate.It was also too bad that Mason Verger's sister Margot was written out of the script.All in all though I thoroughly enjoyed the dark humor and the adventure. Hans Zimmer's score is magnificent! This is a really good film  not a great film but a really good one.  Don't go into it expecting to see another Silence of the Lambs. It's not  and I don't think anyone has ever tried to claim that it is. Expect to see a weird and wonderful love story and an adventure! It's just too bad about that ending!".

The controversial gore scene towards the end made myself and the majority of the audience flinch scream and nervously giggle simultaneously a feel goodfeel bad movie rolled into one!.Having never read the original book I took the film at face value. It is beautifully filmed by a talented director and crew and features lovely Italian location scenes which contrast with the grim plot. The acting is mainly excellent. Hopkins character appears creepier due to him beginning to resemble a kindly grandad who suddenly turns and eats your brain. Julianne Moores excellent Clarice vaguely reminded me of Ripley the star of Ridley Scotts masterpiece Alien. At worst the rest of the cast were well above average.The film had me captivated with its style twisty plot acting and gore. I found myself slightly rooting for the baddie Hannibal at some points something I havent experienced since my empathy for evil Alex in A Clockwork Orange. If people find the deaths of some characters predictable then maybe Scott has directed well in projecting Hannibals approach and morality.This is the sort of big budget horror film moviegoers have been waiting for so go see it on the large screen before its too late! Okay it is not the same as Silence so what? Ten years have passed and things have changed. Ive heard the book is better. Well I may now read it but in the meantime I have enjoyed an excellent thought provoking Film Of The Year!".

The controversial gore scene towards the end made myself and the majority of the audience flinch scream and nervously giggle simultaneously a feel goodfeel bad movie rolled into one!.Having never read the original book I took the film at face value. It is beautifully filmed by a talented director and crew and features lovely Italian location scenes which contrast with the grim plot. The acting is mainly excellent. Hopkins character appears creepier due to him beginning to resemble a kindly grandad who suddenly turns and eats your brain.

	schema:reviewBody "HANNIBAL  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchSome movies are born to inspire sequels but The Silence of The Lambs is a movie that does not need a sequel. The Academy Award winning thriller earned ubiquitous critical acclaim therefore a continuation is nearly incapable of living up  to its standards. To make things worse for the highly anticipated sequel Hannibal the original film's director and main star bailed out leaving Ridley Scott Gladiator and Julianne Moore Magnolia filling their places in the credits. It is hard to imagine how this movie could possibly succeed. But the exceptionally beautiful filmmaking strong performances intriguing story and moody atmosphere provoke more nailbiting moments than most thrillers these days.The story of Hannibal does not compare with The Silence of the Lambs. It replaces tensionfilled sequences of psychological terror with scenes featuring some of the most grotesque images and realistic gore to ever make its mark on the big screen. This film relies heavily on the shock factor of such extreme graphic violence although such content is never excessive or relentless. It has perfect timing. The sheer presence of Anthony Hopkins in another horrific and career defining performance often creates enough terror for several movies. Hannibal knows that and frequently gives the character more freedom than he had in he first film. But I am not so sure that is a good thing is it more terrifying listening to Hannibal Lecter discuss his disgusting actions or to actually see him perform such disturbing behaviors? The film takes place ten years after FBI agent Clarice Starling Jodie Foster then Julianne Moore now interviewed convicted mass murdering cannibal Hannibal Lecter Anthony Hopkins while searching for another disturbed killer. Present day Clarice is involved with a drug bust shootout that leaves many dead. Justice Dept. Official Paul Krendler Ray Liotta is about to punish her when she gets a call from a the unrecognizably deformed surviving victim of an attack by Lecter. His name is Mason Verge  Gary Oldman a wealthy recluse who asks that Starling be placed back on the case of the Cannibal who has been on the loose for ten years. The movie investigates a lot more than Clarice's experiences with Hannibal Lecter. The script actually consists of two separate stories one detailing the revenge scheme of Mason whom is still angry with Lecter after he caused the removal of his face and partial paralysis. The other takes place in Italy where an inspector named Rinaldo Pazzi Giancarlo Giannini is out to claim a multimillion dollar reward for providing authorities with proper evidence leading to the arrest of a local who turns out to be none other than Lecter himself. Obviously this man does not know what he is in for and ends up losing his cuts for the moneyliterally.  Parallel stories are always interesting but are easily sidetracked with certain characters and or events. What keeps this movie intriguing is the consistent focus on Lector everything in the story seems to revolve around him. Then again Hannibal is also quite pointless because it solves nothing. Without giving away the ending I will say that we are once again left pondering about Lecter. Most any movie that provokes thoughts is worth seeing but Hannibal forgets the first film takes a stand on its own and once again sets us up for another unnecessary followup.The most apparent conflict many audiences with have with Hannibal is the absence of Jodie Foster. Julianne Moore is most definitely a capable and challenging actress and plays the role of Starling with exuberance and clarity. But Foster is simply better in the role and we miss her dearly. Anthony Hopkins saves the movie the actor is so intense and grisly in his subtle and classy manner he once again qualifies as an award nominee. Thank goodness he returned for the role without Hopkins Hannibal would be nothing but underdone carnage.".

Well after my third viewing this evening i have to say i've wasted nearly 6 hours of my life on a movie that has absolutely no redeeming features. I will never view it again. The scriptwriters when faced with a selection of some of the most unpleasant characters ever submitted to film resorted to some extremely lazy options. It's like they said OK we have to make Hannibal the anti hero here but he maims and kills quite a few innocents any ideas? Well we could make the Italian policeman corrupt make him shop in Hannibal all for the sake of a few bucks rather than going through the correct authorities yeah that would work. How about this Verger geezer he was mutilated by Lectors sadism and now wants revenge.I know lets make him a paedophile brilliant. Oh and just for kicks lets turn Clarice into a dumb broad who makes one stupid decision after another man we've nailed it surefire hit. I cannot fathom how anyone gets anything out of this film i enjoyed Silence and Red Dragon and to a lessor degree Manhunter they were all intelligent to at least a reasonable level. Hannibal is schlock horror and has nothing bar beautiful cinematography in it's favour. Of the many many DVDs i own Hannibal is going right to the bottom of the stack and will never see the light of day again.".

Suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller not to mention superbly written and tensely directed.

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator while Verger places a 3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.The sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book so I'm told anyway and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.For one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like even support Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character 'okaydokay'? that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.Even the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him the film could happen without Foster but not without him. His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.Overall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite sorry in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated.".

	schema:reviewBody "While hard to compare to its predecessor Silence of the Lambs was a true masterpiece the reintroduction of Hannibal Lecter M.D. has truly been worth the 10 year wait.The film strikes a very different tone from the outset and this is down largely to director Ridley Scott. He and Sir Anthony Hopkins are having fun with this character and Hannibal film and character is very funny albeit with a dark slightly twisted sense of humour. Hannibal is essentially the hero here and you like him and route for him to the end which is quite different from the book.I will not go into plot as most people have probably read the book and saying more could only work to spoil the enjoyment so I will now just tackle the actors and production. Needless to say the film looks spectacular. The Florentine sets are breathtaking but what else would you expect from the director of Blade Runner Gladiator and Thelma  Louise  we know Ridley Scott can deliver the visuals.As for the actors Hopkins delivers the goods as we have come to expect from him. But here he is having a blast with a character he clearly enjoys inhabiting and he is rarely more powerful and commanding a presence than he is in this film and Lambs.An unrecognisable Gary Oldman and uncredited it the opening titles and on posters holds his own as subvillain Mason Verger Lecter's only surviving victim and the flashback of his mutilation is well handled. The film does provide plenty of gory surprises.As for the key question what of Julianne Moore? We all know how good an actress she is Magnolia Short Cuts Boogie Nights but can she fill Jodie Foster's Oscar winning shoes? The answer is yes! You will not give Foster a second thought in this film as Moore is Clarice Starling from the moment she appears. She is not trying to be Jodie Foster she IS Clarice Starling. Hannibal is more a cat and mouse chase than the onetoone Silence of the Lambs and it is difficult to imagine Foster playing this side of the character. That is the key showing a different side to the character gives Moore something to work with more substantial than just being Jodie Foster. Personally I love both actresses but I wouldn't want Foster in this role having seen it if you paid me. This is Moore's part and she equips herself well.See this film marvel and then see it again. It may not quite be the masterpiece of Silence of the Lambs but it's close and it's a lot more entertaining. You'll laugh you'll sit on the edge of your seat you'll say now that's just plain sick!Enjoy!".

	schema:headline " Silly And Uneven";
	schema:reviewBody "I dont know if it existed in the novel of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS but the impression I got from that film was that Clarice Starling was very uncomfortable in the presence of men . This character trait is totally ignored in HANNIBAL as the film opens with Agent Starling asleep in a police van surrounded with men and as the film continues we see that the Clarice Starling of this version is a strong willed and assertive woman at odds with the timid insecure girl of the 1991 film . I guess some people may say this is character development but Id call it a lack of internal continiuty and I wasnt too happy with the way the character was underused either.Julianne Moore made little impression with her portrayal of Starling though thats through little fault of her own because its always the most difficult job of an actor playing a role made famous by someone else  and as I said Starling is sidelined in much of the film . But still I would have liked to have seen Jodie Foster return to the part . As for the other actors Hopkins is competent but by no means spell binding  Liota gives the impression that a robot played his role throughout the film and not just in  THAT  scene  Giancarlo Giannini is good  but Gary Oldman absolutely steals the show as Mason Verger playing the role just the right side of camp complete with some great make up .As for the other aspects of HANNIBAL Ridley Scott directs with an almost operatic touch  and I mean that both figuratively and literally . You really do get the feeling watching this that Scotts ambition in life is to do a remake of AMADEUS with Hopkins in the role of Atonio Salieri . But the one major flaw with HANNIBAL is the script by Mamet and Zaillian . Again I have little idea of what the novel is like since my entire knowledge of it is confined to what Ive read about it on this site but a couple of screenwriters with their great track record should be able to produce a satisfying screenplay no matter how poor the source novel . Here they fail  especially with the ending which is riducously over the top . But it was probably a good idea to omit Vergers lesbian sister as this would have made the film descend into a camp joke".

	schema:headline " The weakest film to feature Hannibal Lecter";
	schema:reviewBody "This sequel to the seminal Silence of the Lambs is a mixed meal. At times gripping thrilling and beautiful at other times it is confusing slow and clumsy. One of the best parts of the film is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter he IS Hannibal and whilst not as menacing intelligent or as complex as he is in 'Silence' he is nonetheless one of the film's stronger points. The lack of return of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling is one of the film's weaker points. Julianne Moore tries her best but doesn't have the emotional vulnerability and connection with Dr. Lecter that Foster had. Also Julianne Moore slips in and out of the old West Virginian twang that played such a surprisingly large role in 'Silence' far too noticeably. This is not one of Director Ridley Scott's best films and the direction is not the reason why. The film looks fantastic the city of Florence in particular becomes a gruesome and macabre setting for the grisly proceedings. Several scenes in particular had me feeling quite nauseous although possibly in part to blurring motion rather than the events in the scene. The film adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris follows a very similar narrative and the story idea itself is simple and effective. One of Lecter's victims wants revenge. Simple powerful and eerie an unrecognisable Gary Oldman seriously plays Mason Verger. A single minded wealthy man who had the misfortune of crossing Lecter's path.The main issue I have with the film is that it's surprisingly heavy handed. In this at time it appears that Lecter is a redemptive moral story instead of a brilliant serial killer. His relationship with Starling again is too subtle the fondness from Silence is still present but it's not as a awkward or as powerful as the scenes between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. The ideas of corruption and redemption are further weaved around an idea of romance. Something that was hinted at but never as explicit as it is here. So instead of a brilliantly complex psychological thriller with well crafted characters and razor tight scripting you have a slightly clumsy pseudo religious horror film. It's not bad per se but it pales in comparison to films in the series both older and newer.Read further reviews at httpthegiff.typepad.comfilmflare".

Yet the persona of Clarice Starling did manage to reveal his sociable side  ambiguous love story ? I don't think that even Thomas Harris knows himself. Harris just made an important effort in creating a paradoxical manmonster. What puzzles us is that he's cultivated and capable of the most atrocious crimes of flesh at the same time  in brief he's not like the real life serial killers. Is he really a serial killer by the way ? What motivates his murders ? His personal freedom when he butchers those who hold him prisoner but the others ? On what bases does he kill ? Despise for rudeness ? Bordedom generated by the petty tales his patients tell him ? Simply a hobby ? Even the story of his childhood remains superficial in answer to these mysteries. Hannibal Lecter is just a romanesque serial killer exactly as James Bond is an idealized secret agent capable of speaking several languages and of many other things. This absence of credibility really makes it impossible for me to enjoy this film. Norman Bates or Leatheface are far from exaggerated next to him.".

But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison.         Usually when I see a terrible movie I find myself more amused than anything else. Sadly though I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that Hannibal is. The movie was filmed with promise I guess. It had Anthony Hopkins Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And for directing there was Ridley Scott. There have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. There was so much I would have cut from this film that I doubt anything would have remained. It was pathetic. The storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even crazier and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included which is sad in the case of a movie whereSPOILER AHEAD Ray Liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. That scene more than any other made me want to cry because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. But Hannibal was a two hour plus joke. This movie should only be watched if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.".

Once he created the world he should give his characters free will they should act by the logic of their personalities not by their creator's sheer caprice. What Harris did in Hannibal is unspeakable  he just showed his fans how much he despised them. Actually he did two things wrong  the ending and his attempt to explain Hannibal to look behind the mask. The film comparing to the book has several redeeming values visually it is a stunning work of a great director. I am yet to see Florence the celebrated City of Flowers as dark dangerous and antitourist as in Hannibal. Second the movie did not try to explain Hannibal to get inside his head and understand him. Harris attempted in the book to give us the reasons why Hannibal was what he was  it was weak and laughable. If he chose to present Hannibal as some sort of supernatural creature with almost animals' instincts he should've left him as an eternal mystery. The best description of Hannibal belongs to Clarice. When asked Is it true what they're sayin' he's some kinda vampire?  she replied They don't have a name for what he is. And finally the film avoided the literally vomitinducing absurd irrational obnoxious slap in face book's ending  for this alone I think Hannibal is a very decent movie and a lot of fun.7.510".

Menjou is a duplicitous restaurateur who blackmails Tyrone Power into going along with his scheme Loretta Young romanced by Power is the beautiful daughter of Charles Winninger.If you're a shallow person this is the movie for you because it's Eye Candy City. Power and Young two people very very high on any most beautiful list are so ethereally incalculably gorgeous that it's hard to listen to a word they're saying while they're on screen. And Young's fashions are divine '30s couturier. This is one of Power's very early films he was only 22 when it was made and though only a year older than he was Young had been around since silent film days. For me Power's looks reached their full dazzle about two to three years later but if you only saw him in Cafe Metropole you'd have a hard time believing there could be any improvement in that face. And in a tuxedo for so much of the movie. Almost too much of a good thing.Anyway if you can concentrate Cafe Metropole is a delightful film.As a bit of trivia Power and Young made several films together in Power's early days at Fox. They remained friends and in 1958 Young showed up for Power's funeral straight from filming her TV show decked out and unrecognizable in Oriental garb and makeup to match. In the late '70s she was photographed with Power's son Ty Jr. and you would swear you'd gone back in time. His resemblance to his father was so striking and she was still so very beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gregory Ratoff's idea of a Parisian restauranteur with debts that drive his bookkeeper to thoughts of suicide became a vehicle for rising star Tyrone Power.  He's handed what can be coyly referred to as an ingenue role the kind that does not demand much more than standing straight and looking pretty more specifically an American dilettante with scarcely any money to live on and no way to get home.  Owing a rather tidy sum to the restaurant owner played by wily Adolphe Menjou he is blackmailed into passing himself off as Russian royalty to charm a Yankee heiress.  And in walks the breathtaking Loretta Young under a white lace mantilla aware from the start that he's a fake and working her own little scheme to land him. Young is as assured as Katharine Hepburn was in Holiday although you get the feeling when she's throwing fits and tossing heavy objects at her millionaire father Charles Winninger the people in charge wanted to invest her performance with a little of the spirit of Carole Lombard.  It's all over Tyrone Power and considering how dapper he looks in his tie and tails His hair has the highgloss ArtDeco sheen of a baby grand piano. who could blame her?  There's a funny sequence in a haberdashery with his accent waxing and waning like the phases of the moon.  It's blithe and loony and lovely all at once and ends with Ratoff as the real Cossack spouting indignantly at Power's pitiful imposture.  Duplicity abounds and everyone is wise to it including Helen Westley as Winninger's canny sister whom the mock Russian aristocrat at one point coyly slips a bodice boutonniere.".

Owing a rather tidy sum to the restaurant owner played by wily Adolphe Menjou he is blackmailed into passing himself off as Russian royalty to charm a Yankee heiress.  And in walks the breathtaking Loretta Young under a white lace mantilla aware from the start that he's a fake and working her own little scheme to land him. Young is as assured as Katharine Hepburn was in Holiday although you get the feeling when she's throwing fits and tossing heavy objects at her millionaire father Charles Winninger the people in charge wanted to invest her performance with a little of the spirit of Carole Lombard.  It's all over Tyrone Power and considering how dapper he looks in his tie and tails His hair has the highgloss ArtDeco sheen of a baby grand piano. who could blame her?  There's a funny sequence in a haberdashery with his accent waxing and waning like the phases of the moon.  It's blithe and loony and lovely all at once and ends with Ratoff as the real Cossack spouting indignantly at Power's pitiful imposture.  Duplicity abounds and everyone is wise to it including Helen Westley as Winninger's canny sister whom the mock Russian aristocrat at one point coyly slips a bodice boutonniere.";

He sees the opportunity with handsome Tyrone Power a broke American whom he makes pose as a Russian prince in order to bilk American millionaires Charles Winninger Loretta Young and Helen Westley. However the real Russian prince he has Power impersonating is there under the guise of one of his own waiters Gregory Ratoff. Related to the czars of Russia 25 times 5 times illegitimately Ratoff is indignant over the use of Power with his identity. When asked by Winninger if Ratoff is a real Russian Menjou says he is. Winninger's feisty sister Westley retorts Then how come he isn't driving a cab? That's the type of humor to expect from this very enjoyable nonsensical screwball comedy the year of The Awful Truth Topper and Nothing Sacred alltime classics as well as duds like True Confession and Double Wedding. Cafe Metropole falls closer to the classic mark. Looking at Tyrone Power and Loretta Young here before she became Attila the Nun it's impossible not to see why they were a popular screen couple. William Powell and Myrna Loy were sophisticated and witty but Power and Young are downright beautiful to look at together. You can't help but wonder what their children would look like. Young is great when she's sinning a little A few years down the road she'd be a lot more difficult to watch. Power always remained easy on the eye even if by the mid 40's he looked like a manboy that resented his own prettiness and yet unable to face the oncoming middle age.There's also some rather humorous gay moments particularly with an obviously gay hat seller who sells Power his own hat and is then told by Power to throw the other one out. Adolph Menjou makes a wonderful scoundrel. You want to see him get his comeuppance even if it's just the leads conning him on his own con. Winninger and Westley as usual are great scenestealers. Westley gets the last word and is so amusing. What would we do without those salty character people like Jessie Ralph May Robson Marie Dressler Alison Skipworth and Ms. Westley? They are like the grandmothers we'd love to havefilled with both love and discipline yet bubbling with an earthiness that makes us want to see them a bit under the influence to reveal what they are really like. Predictable but lots of fun!".

Loretta says with a sexy French accent I was thinking maybe you give me beeg kiss now. Then My accent it comes and goes comes and goes parroting Ty's statement in the flower shop.I've noted some incongruous or mysterious things in my summary. Maybe you have better insight.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a harmless though brainless film. However due to the many logical errors in the film I can't recommend it as anything other than a timepasserand only if you can manage to turn off your brain for a while while you watch. Otherwise what happens in the last portion of the film might make you either throw something at the TV or curse yourself for investing this much time in a dopey film. Now I know that there are many Loretta Young and probably more Tyrone Power fans out there and I don't mean to offend them. Heck I usually love these actors too but I also can't lie and say it's one of their better films.The film starts off well enough and I really liked the first half. Adolph Menjou is the coowner of this restaurant but he needs to pay off a loan FAST or lost his restaurant. So on a lark he gambles and actually earns enough to pay off the money he lent himself illegally and save his butt. However it turns out that the young guy Tyrone Power who he won the money from is broke. Instead of sending Power to jail for writing a bad check to cover his losses Menjou decides to force Power into becoming his slave. And as his slave he has Power pose as a Russian prince so they can both bilk a rich young lady Young of the money to save the restaurant. So far so good.Now the fact that Power didn't do so well with impersonating a Russian wasn't a problemafter all he wasn't supposed to be perfect and she was supposed to eventually figure out that he was a phony. However and here's where the film gets dumb although she knows he's a criminal she falls in love with him???? and insists she must marry him. Now we could assume that either Miss Young's character is schizophrenic or suffered a massive brain injury but when her aunt agrees with her and they work hard to get Power even after he's robbed them this strains common sense way beyond the breaking point. She barely knew the guy and most of what she knew about him was terribleyet she insisted on marrying him and having everyone live happily ever after. And on top of this Ms. Young yells and bellows and overemotes like mad when she argues with her father about this. Oh brother give me a barf bag!! The only reason I even gave the film a score this high is that despite being brainless the film had some nice moments and the actors seemed to try hard with material that was simply beneath them. Also the film deserves no better than a 4 because some excellent dance scenes with Bill Bojangles Robinson were in the film but they were cut before it was released!! Fortunately they are included on the new DVD version of this film. You'll find the first one simply brilliantand probably better than anything Fred Astaire ever did. The second cut scene is less brilliant and rather politically incorrect but it's still a shame it was eliminated.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cafe Metropole 1937  12 out of 4 Decent comedy about the American Alexis Tyrone Power who loses a big bet to Monsieur Victor Adolphe Menjou and afterwards has to admit that he doesn't have the money to pay up. Through what's basically blackmail Victor forces Alexis to romance the beautiful and rich Laura Loretta Young so that she will marry him and in return Alexis can pay Victor. CAFE METROPOLE offers up a terrific cast but sadly the screenplay is just a tad bit too silly and too farfetched to be believable. Yes you might argue that any type of comedy can be silly as long as it makes you laugh and this is certainly true but there's not enough laughs here to really call this a comedy and what happens at the end is just so out of touch with reality that you really can't help but roll your eyes. However the two leads are in fine form and manage to have that wonderful chemistry that they did throughout their careers. Power isn't believable playing Russian but this here isn't all that important as I can overlook this as part of the comedy. Young is as charming as ever and just floats with her grace on camera. The two of them have that good chemistry together and help keep the film moving. Menjou is also good in his supporting role even though the screenplay does very little to actually help him. I think the film works best early on when we see Power and Menjou going after one another as they try to solve the issue with the money. Once Young enters the picture you have the before mentioned chemistry but the screenplay just becomes too wacky for its own good. I think a dose of reality would have really helped things and the various crosses in the final fifteenminutes just don't work. Still fans of the three stars will still want to check this one out.".

His parents inform the teacher that he's gay which the son decides to play along with in hopes that the teacher will try to change him. This was my first stab at this genre and if you were offended or found the American teensex movies to be dumb then you'd best stay far away from this thing. This movie is so incredibly over the top that I couldn't help but feel things were just too stupid for their own good. We have farts being set on fire which is just the start of what happens. The film is far from a bad one but at the same time I really don't see too many people enjoying it. I think the biggest draw is going to be fans of the beauty Fenech who once again shows that she's too good for the material. She acts circles around everyone else in the cast and manages to turn in a very funny performance even though she's just shown as the piece of meat. Her beauty certainly can't be questioned and she has several nude scenes to show off even more. Pea is decent in his role but the character is just too annoying for us to really like. The comedy is very low brow and that includes many jokes about gay people which certain groups will be offended by. The jokes are rather mean spirited as well and there's also jokes towards suicide and rape. The majority of the film has the student forcing himself on the teacher which might not go over too well in America but if you don't take the film too serious and you're a fan of the star then just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is.".

These movies were really a step down for Fenech from the gialli she was making with her paramourproducer Luciano Martino and his director brother Sergio in the early '70's but her presence in these kind of movies was a real step up for the movies themselves. Fenech was as beautiful and frequently naked as Gloria Guida the other regular female star of these kind of films but she was also a genuinely talented comic actress. It is very hard to believe a woman that looks like her would be so unsophisticated and respond in any way to the clumsy advances of the homely and idiotic male protagonist of this movie but I guess that's half the appeal of these kinds of flicks isn't it? This is a terminally stupid movie but it is redeemed somewhat by the presence of Fenech.".

Partly because Jancso antagonised the critics by including explicit for its time sex when they had been used to more political content.  Jancso used the sexuality in his film to point out that we live in a repressive society and showed that the characters in his film were willing up until the point of death to live out their free attitudes towards sexuality. This was and still is a subversive issue as sexuality still seems to need some dismal excuse for inclusion in nonpornographic films.  In this film Jancso was bold enough to present eroticism within a deliberately anarchic context.  Contrary to other readers comments this film is neither boring nor rubbish.  The fact also that it has homosexual imagery disturbs a lot of narrow minded viewers but there again Jancso showed these images to represent a multisexual utopia.  This utopia of course in the film had to be destroyed.  You can't get more political than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Australian video release cover of Miklos Jancso's 1975 ode to sexual freedom and personal rebellion had it placed alongside pornography in Australian video stores when it was released in the 1980s alongside other classics like In The Realm of The Senses and A Zed and Two Noughts. It features naked bodies moving and lying all over one another in a wildly joyous orgy. Once you watch the film you realise this is no simple recitation of the pleasures or mechanics of the flesh.This is a fascinating film which can be aligned for many reasons with Pasolini's Salo they were both made almost in parallel. Both films are subversive historical studies of human sexuality and the treatment of the human body as a political object. Or more simply the way bodies are always at the centre of the forces of power. The two films are very different  but not absolutely distinct. Both do concern the events at a distant place where sources of political and social power subvert the order of things. In Salo however it is an insatiable facistic power which reproduces itself through acts of abuse and murder. In Private Vice... it is a subversive power of a less annihilistic order aiming to alter order by embracing passions and overturning the military order. Quite the opposite to Pasolini's much more bleak vision of politics in the shadow of modern forms of exploitation since WW2.Private vice Public Virtue follows a rebel son embracing the ideals of sexual freedom dionysian joys such as wine and song and the rebellious refusal to accept the orders of absent elders. The scenes where they mock the military ruler with caricatured masks as the army returns from battle is one such example. But throughout the film seeks to alter roles and power structures. Women wield dildoes nakedness is not the domain of women as in so many other films and sexual expression is an unstoppable force. The film is both a beautiful utopian vision and a tale of the violent power of history.".

	schema:reviewBody "A single still of naked revelers taken from this film which I found in one of my fathers old magazines had long intrigued me and having been recently bowled over by Jancso's THE ROUND UP 1965 I leapt at the chance of acquiring the utterly barebones Italian DVD edition of it despite knowing nothing of the quality of the disc itself. Actually being an Italian production after all I had wrongly assumed that as was the case with the directors other three films shot over there it would eventually be shown at some point on late night Italian TV however in hindsight its total invisibility for all these years isnt that surprising. In fact if I were pressed to pigeonhole the movie Id say that had Walerian Borowczyk ever directed a screenplay cowritten by Federico Fellini and Pier Paolo Pasolini the end result might well have looked something like this. Ever since debuting at Cannes the film has provoked either outrage or outright dismissals as pornography with pretensions amusingly in his enjoyable Stracult tome Italian critic Marco Giusti proudly admits to having watched it several times on first release despite its having been confiscated twice by the prudish authorities! Typically for Jancso' there is very little to relate plotwise as a matter of fact this can be seen as simply an erotic fantasia on the infamous Mayerling affair in which the heir to the AustroHungarian empire the Archduke Rudolph carried out a suicide pact with his mistress. According to Jansco' and his regular Italian screenwriter Giovanna Gagliardo however the events were not so clearcut. Although the film never strays from the Princes country estate Jancso's realization of 19th Century Vienna is as visually sumptuous and technically elaborate as expected while the political subtexts as they relate to our modern age are equally important. Although this is the first film Ive watched myself which dealt with this particular historical incident there have been countless others over the years with Anatole Litvaks 1936 Max Ophuls 1940 and Terence Youngs 1968 versions being the bestknown its safe to assume that PRIVATE VICES AND PUBLIC VIRTUES is unlike any of them. For starters most of the films running time is devoted to a marathon orgy to which the Archduke invites the younger generation of Austrian aristocrats to spite his father Emperor FranzJoseph a mask of whom is donned by several of the revelers. Apparently a coup to overthrow the monarch had already failed and consequently the Archduke retired to his Mayerling estate to live a life of hedonistic abandon. Knowing full well that his family disapproved of his scandalous behavior he further intends to shock the establishment by photographing the guests in flagrante and sending a copy out to his peers thus exposing the veiled degeneracy of the ruling class. Ultimately however court officials present themselves at the gates of Mayerling to put a stop to the bacchanalian excesses The three main protagonists of the film are the Archduke his stepbrother and stepsister who forming an inseparable and incestuous mnagea'trois are soon joined by an equally libertarian hermaphrodite when a circus troupe stops by the mansion. Having disposed of his boringly proper wife early on the Archduke falls in love with this newest addition to his inner circle. Left alone after the guests have been dispersed apprehended or executed offscreen the four lovers are ominously shrouded in white sheets like corpses during their final openair rendezvous an oppressively melancholy mood makes itself felt towards the end aided immeasurably by Francesco De Masis lovely mournful score. The officials ostensibly there to put a stop to the offending proceedings and arrest the Archduke mostly stand around befuddled not knowing how to cope with the extraordinary situation  but their ultimate reaction is swift and abrupt leading to an inspired slowmotion finale depicting the royal funeral procession.Among the cast list there were only three names that I recognized the formidable Laura Betti who as the loving nanny performs a handjob on her royal charge laying about in the hay! Theresa Ann Savoy she plays the crucial role of the hermaphrodite here and would later be equally central to Tinto Brass infamous CALIGULA 1979 and Ilona Staller adopting the evocative stage name of Cicciolina she later became a highly popular porn star and later still an Italian MP  but ironically she is here wasted in the thanklessly chaste bit of the Archdukes wife!. Although there is much fullfrontal nudity involved the only time it really approaches hardcore territory is the aforementioned scene with Betti  unless one wants to count the brief instances of bestiality when some of the guests decide to get it on with a few runaway turkeys!! Typically for Jancso' his characters resort to much communal dancing and gameplaying  which is here joined by the improbably effective singing of English childhood ditties including BaaBaaBlack Sheep! The sparse original music then has been mingled with classical pieces  notably Strauss The Blue Danube  and appropriately enough a handful of military marches.I suppose that for the uninitiated all of the above would seem pointlessly perverse and terminally tedious but stylistically the film was something of a new departure for Jancso' while the intermittently creative editing with especially notable use of ellipses and his trademark long sequenceshots are still in evidence he reportedly utilized 343 shots here as opposed to the lowly two digit figures of earlier works. On the downside the video presentation is a bit dodgy at first an obviously unrestored print has been utilized for the transfer albeit uncut as proudly announced on the sleeve of the Italian R2 DVD but is still acceptable enough for its velvety cinematography and extreme handsomeness to shine nonetheless the layer change however is quite roughly handled at least by the Pioneer model I watched it on.".

	schema:headline " Art has its own language. Do you understand it?";
	schema:reviewBody "For many this film is pure pornography with a lot of pretension.But for some 'in the know' it is a historical allegory reinterpreting the reallife Mayerling affair in which the AustroHungarian Crown Prince Rudolph and his mistress the Baroness Maria Vetsera committed suicide at the family hunting lodge Mayerling because they were not allowed to marry. The official records of the deaths were long hidden then destroyed and the public's imagination was captured for decades to come with the mysteries surrounding the lovepolitical affairs of the ruling society.The film director Jancs having long artistic controversies of his own suggests that contrary to this official version the lovers were indeed assassinated by his father Emperor Franz Josef. Rudolph and his friends were in direct opposition with the world of the Emperor on many issues and used plots to convince him that his time was past and that it was now the moment to allow the YoungNew to rise to power. Some of those plots consisted of attracting the youth of the best families in the AustroHungarian Empire to their castle involving them in giant orgies. Photographs were taken during these orgies and sent to the Emperor in order to blackmail him and convince him to let the new order rule ?!. After the soldiers led by the Austrian secret police shot the couple their corpses were arranged suggesting a romantic suicide pactto avoid scandal or radical overthrow of a society obsessed with image.In this movie Jancs is inventing a 'real story' in order of translating the complexities of the realities of repression and freedom into images. In it he replaces a romantic clich with a modern politicized take on a particularly tormented historical period but his visual language's coding brings forth the controversy that rendered this piece of his art to obscurity. The explicit use of nudity and erotic encounters of all kinds seems to be concealing the message of aspiring political freedom from an initial and superficial glance. The use of nudity is a recurrent visual element in Jancs's art but while in his earlier works it was a symbol of humiliation now it is a sign of liberation and he goes much farther than that. The mix of both sexes in wild celebration of nakedness and sex in a state of joy and ecstasy is an expression of rebellion and free will. This is in contrast with the attitudes of those in power who seem to want to cover every inch of flesh with as many layers as possible and every act of life with prude social contacts 'In MY family we do not have sex!'. This revolution replaces the unnatural uniforms of the army and clergy with natural uniformity of the nakedness of allbeautiful young bodies and the highly coded social behavior with spontaneous sexuality. This alone indeed often places the unprepared spectator at certain unease.Due to contractual terms Jancs enjoyed less than usual artistic freedom that shows up as discontinuity with both his previous and later works when it comes to editing using of music and photography. Despite these minor artistic flaws the film remains a powerful work reflecting on youth movements that attempted revolutions in the 60s and 70s' Western World bearing signs of knowing what they did not wantbut being not sure of what to replace them with. Jancs proves himself to be a lucid analyst not only of history but also of modern society. The young in this film are mistaken by hoping to make their voices heard as silence and conformance with the social order is to be maintained by those in power  regardless the arbitrary nature of this order. One can argue that the mockrituals of the Crown Prince are as legitimate as the Imperial etiquette but a revolution without proper preparation is doomed to failure.In summary 'Vizi privati pubbliche virt' is a sorrowful meditation on the limits of a revolution that failed to come to life not a pretentious porno flick  as an unperceptive observant would judge it to be. The question is ours now to answer 'Is our society and we ourselves are so far removed from the puritanical world of the AustroHungarian Emperor Franz Josef and his obsessively clean image? '".

	onyx:emotionText "For many this film is pure pornography with a lot of pretension.But for some 'in the know' it is a historical allegory reinterpreting the reallife Mayerling affair in which the AustroHungarian Crown Prince Rudolph and his mistress the Baroness Maria Vetsera committed suicide at the family hunting lodge Mayerling because they were not allowed to marry. The official records of the deaths were long hidden then destroyed and the public's imagination was captured for decades to come with the mysteries surrounding the lovepolitical affairs of the ruling society.The film director Jancs having long artistic controversies of his own suggests that contrary to this official version the lovers were indeed assassinated by his father Emperor Franz Josef. Rudolph and his friends were in direct opposition with the world of the Emperor on many issues and used plots to convince him that his time was past and that it was now the moment to allow the YoungNew to rise to power. Some of those plots consisted of attracting the youth of the best families in the AustroHungarian Empire to their castle involving them in giant orgies. Photographs were taken during these orgies and sent to the Emperor in order to blackmail him and convince him to let the new order rule ?!. After the soldiers led by the Austrian secret police shot the couple their corpses were arranged suggesting a romantic suicide pactto avoid scandal or radical overthrow of a society obsessed with image.In this movie Jancs is inventing a 'real story' in order of translating the complexities of the realities of repression and freedom into images. In it he replaces a romantic clich with a modern politicized take on a particularly tormented historical period but his visual language's coding brings forth the controversy that rendered this piece of his art to obscurity. The explicit use of nudity and erotic encounters of all kinds seems to be concealing the message of aspiring political freedom from an initial and superficial glance. The use of nudity is a recurrent visual element in Jancs's art but while in his earlier works it was a symbol of humiliation now it is a sign of liberation and he goes much farther than that.

	schema:headline " A serious historical film but perhaps somewhat misleading";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fascinating historical film created by Miklos Jancso  a highly competent director and it is sad that it has become regarded by some as an essentially erotic work dressed up in the trappings of a historical drama. I find it hard to understand how any viewer who watches it carefully can fail to recognise that the Director was not attempting to create an erotic drama for its own sake this would have been much easier to do free of the constraints associated with the historical theme but had what he felt was an important message to convey through his largely fictional story. Remember that the events portrayed in this film have had a major influence on the lives of most of us. The death of Crown Prince Rudolf and his mistress in 1889 was a fundamental link in the chain of events which led to the start of  the war of 191418 and subsequently to the development of World War II. At the time these deaths were officially attributed by the Hapsburg government to a suicide pact which followed their recognition that the couple would never be able to marry but right from the start many commentators both nationally and internationally suggested that foul play was a more probable explanation. The full story was exceedingly complex and had more twists than most detective novels but there can be no doubt that the Hapsburg authorities attempted to conceal many of these facts adding fuel to speculations that the Emperor himself may have been involved in some sort of plot designed to end Rudolf's illicit liaison with his mistress Baroness Maria Vetsera. This is the story line followed in the film which suggests that Rudolf was attempting to force Franz Joseph to abdicate by gaining the support of the Austrian society of the time for a more liberal social order and that Franz Joseph either planned or condoned the assassination of the couple in order to avoid their licentious activities continuing to embarrass the Imperial Court. I believe it is intrinsically unlikely that FranzJoseph would have ever contemplated the assassination of his son the heir to the Hapsburg throne however acutely he had been embarrassed by his behaviour. After more than six centuries of continuous rule by the same family the Hapsburg dynasty was almost unique and throughout Franz Joseph's long life devotion to the continuation of this dynasty had been the major driving force for most of his activities. He had little respect for his brothers son through whom the succession would pass and it is recorded that he never once spoke to the great nephew who was his eventual successor during the remaining 27 years of his rule. He must have been aware that his death would constitute a major crisis which the empire itself might not survive and it is hard to believe that whatever the provocation he would deliberately have done anything to create such a crisis. There are at least two other more credible explanations for the assassination of Crown Prince Rudolf. Over the centuries the Hapsburg empire had expanded more by marriage than by conquest until it incorporated a vast array of diverse ethnic groups which became difficult to hold together after the Napoleonic wars released their tide of libertarianism and nationalism. One revolt in Hungary was suppressed but the Empress persuaded her husband to make a very conciliatory settlement with the Hungarians in 1867 which effectively created what became known as the joint AustroHungarian Empire. Rudolf was also strongly supportive of Hungarian aspirations and this antagonised many members of the Imperial old school. Some of them may well have decided to take steps to ensure that Rudolf would never succeed FranzJoseph as Emperor. An alternative explanation for his death is supported by near deathbed testimony from Countess Zita the wife of Emperor Karl Franz Joseph's eventual successor who inherited the imperial throne in 1916 following the assassination of his uncle in Sarajevo in 1914 and the death of the old Emperor during the resulting world war. Empress Zita lived to the age of almost 90 dying in 1989 fourteen years after this film was produced. Before her death she recorded accounts of Hapsburg family conversations which suggested that Rudolf's death followed an approach from French authorities seeking to gain his support for an attempt to persuade Franz Joseph to abdicate so that Rudolph could introduce a more liberal regime which internationally would support the French rather than Germany. Rudolf had indignantly rejected this proposition and reported it to his father. His assassination at Meyerling followed  presumably by French agents or their Austrian sympathisers. Her account was largely ignored at the time it was first published but three years after her death and several years after this film was releasedit was supported by late autopsies of the bodies of the two victims which showed that contrary to the official accounts Baroness Vetsera had not been shot but had been battered to death and that Rudolf  had fired six shots from his revolver before he died. It is interesting to speculate how this new information might have changed the message Jancso was attempting to pass on if it had been available when the film was produced. We are now never likely to know what actually happened but if like me you do not believe Franz Joseph was directly responsible for the death of his son you can still enjoy this film and its message that the old order will eventually have to yield to the pressures created by a younger and more virile generation. It is an important film which should be made available as a DVD but be aware that whilst the Rudolf of the film is just a libertine who is something of a caricature the historical Crown Prince appears to have been a well travelled cultivated individual with remarkably progressive views who was highly regarded by most of those that had anything to do with him.".

I read that the script is based on a novel which I am determined to ignore especially after having seen the movie.Kate is played by SJP an actress who could easily be described as the female Tom Hanks  albeit slightly less talented. Her likability is enormous but unfortunately her choice of roles very limited in her repertoire there are only comedies most of them remarkable failures at the box office. Her sidekicks in this movie are Greg Kinnear and Pierce Brosnan two good actors with a wider range who play respectively her husband and a business associate. One wishes there was more of them on screen. Unfortunately we get plenty of SJP and of her friend played by Christina Hendricks. It could have been any other actress playing second fiddle to SJP as poor Christina is used only to enunciate a string of questionable statements.For a comedy there are very few laughers. Actually none at all from me. The punch lines sounded tired and unfunny and the real life situations abused and stale what about an envious colleague who would like to steal your glory? Or a supportive best friend with a lousy love life? Not to mention the neglected husband. All seen in a million other comedies most of them better than this one.The problem with this and an increasingly larger number of movies is that they are targeted to a very restricted public. This one is targeted strictly to 1 working mothers with young children and 2 diehard fans of SJP. I doubt anybody else will find it even mildly amusing as it does not work at all as a comedy. Indeed in the cinema where I saw it even if the audience was mostly female only a woman in her midthirties laughed out loud.".

When you hear Kate's friend telling you how great Kate is and that it's so much harder for her being a woman in corporate America it's a sign to switch off. They introduced the concept of the supermoms and how they are the enemy with everything so perfect but disappointingly never really developed it. She makes a list of things to do in her head but it doesn't go anywhere or really contribute to the film. It goes on and on about how she is holding this together being so hard for women in corporate America I mention this again it really is all this film is about at which time i found excuses to get up and go to the toilet get up and get some popcorn just to leave. Normally when I have to leave a film I am all questions when I get back What did I miss? Did she tell him yet? Who's that guy? Typical man but with this one I just didn't care. It's not a Rom Com as there's little romance and it ain't funny so i don't know what you would call it. At this time I thought this might be me but my wife also fell asleep watching it so yes it really isn't me.So hardship for a woman in corporate America... What is to be gleaned from a movie like this? Do they tell you how to cope? Stay awake until 3 every morning making imaginary lists in your head for things to do... that's it nothing more exciting. Do they expand on how hard it is for a woman? No If you ask me the character played by Greg Kinnear had just as hard a time and nothing really expanded. Is it romantic? An unrealistic cheesy made for TV approach made by her coworkersuperiorI don't know where he falls into thisPierce Brosnan and that's it. Lots of traveling? Welcome to corporate America!So in short nothing to take home but 89minutes of your life you'll never get back... Almost as depressing a thought as the film".

She and Greg Kinnear manage to create a chemistry that is actually believable. And Greg Kinnear is so manly in this film I actually found him a bit strong and handsome. I realize that the story is kind of a fairytale but overall the movie seems to just be pointing out that it is different to live life in this world as a woman than it is to live it as a mannot just because of the way the world treats us but because of how we see and approach life. Women are capable special creatures with their own unique purpose in the worldnot in a women are less than men and are here to cook and clean type of way but in a the world would be poorer without what women bring to the table way. To me this film is a celebration of womanhood and the important myriad roles we play in society along with the joy and compromise that can be found within them. I enjoyed the performances of all the actors and actresses in this movie although apart from the two leads I especially enjoyed Olivia Munn Pierce Brosnan and Seth Myers who I always like to see.

	schema:reviewBody "The title says it all as I do not know how Sarah Jessica Parker has this ability to continue in being the marquee of her films playing roles that may seem a little bit whiny and neurotic but gaining and establishing an incredible following which has to be attributed to a certain degree to the very successful Sex and the City television series and movies despite the latest one being not quite hitting the mark. Still you can't keep a good woman down especially when she has the knack for snagging roles that allows her to play well the usual superwoman whose life is in a constant juggle between work and family.And in many ways this film has characters that makes it easy for any working adult to identify with whether one has a family of one's own or not. If life means tackling the various friends and fiends that come our way and dealing with issues problems and challenges that get thrown in our direction then this story adapted off the novel by Allison Pearson encompasses just about everything in episodes. There's the best friend and confidante the rival at work just waiting to pounce on mistakes or steal thunder snarky moms who cannot figure out why someone wants to be a career woman an attractive boss to report to and work with an anal retentive assistant all rolled into the story of the work life balance.Sarah Jessica Parker's Kate Reddy seemed to have it all figured out on the outside at least when others look at her the perfect formula to keep everything together although folks on the inside and by that I mean family members with husband Richard Greg Kinnear and kids Emily and Ben Emily Rayne Lyle and Julius and Theodore Goldberg respectively disappointment and the lack of quantity time become very evident and frequent and goes to a certain extent of reminding us of the things that actually matter and the importance of that balance and difficulty to achieve so because it isn't a zero sum game but definitely something's gotta give and the crux of this film is how Kate slowly erodes what should be held dear for career progress and reputation to upkeep.Which is not a bad thing but calls for very discerning time management and knowing when to call it quits. Director Douglas McGrath weaves a very punchy narrative that relies a fair bit of comedy even employing things like hair lice and other quite unladylike behaviour to send the message across be it presenting the challenges Kate faced or to try and present the narrative in a fairly novel manner with the use of talking heads interviews that makes it become like a mockumentary even having Kate break the fourth wall and communicate directly with the audience more than once. It also offers keen insights into the modern day career woman and if you remove gender from the equation the many issues on display can apply to any working adult with similar responsibilities where life may mean a constant juggle of roles and the apportioning of one's time against activities.It's a film about contemporary lifestyle and the relationships built at work and at home with many social tools used today featuring very much in the film from email to phone to text messages which creep into and become part and parcel of communications in life. Then there's the subplot about the perils for the working mom in a jetsetting lifestyle with the temptation that comes in the form of her attractive working partner Jack Abelhammer who comes in the form of Pierce James Bond Brosnan and that of her relationship with assistant Momo Olivia Munn who probably exists in the film to provide that tinge of sarcasm a person who's high on the IQ but needs plenty of work in the EQ department.Of course you don't watch this film to look out for solutions on offer but it may provide suggestions that some you may already know of but fail to practice or have it successfully implemented because a movie can conveniently lump things together and skip the nitty gritty ugly details. But such is life and what this film can do is probably a temporal pause from our own predicaments and to remind ourselves that we're not alone in this struggle to maintain an even keel. I may not be the biggest Sarah Jessica Parker fan around but I cannot argue the case against this film. Recommended.".

That said every day week month is an internal battle as to whether we are doing the right thing and this movie just helped to make us feel like we are not alone and that ultimately you just have to do what's best for you and your family. The best part of this movie in terms of the comedy factor was the depiction of the stay at home moms  they nailed it! Not sure why so many people gave this movie such a bad rap  maybe because they felt like they were being made fun of?  If you are a two income family with both spouses holding good jobs but have kids this is a mustsee movie. At the least you will find it entertaining.Back to work...".

	schema:reviewBody "An ironic title for such an obvious and in many ways clichd plot premise. Directed by Douglas McGrath and adapted from the popular novel by Allison Pearson the film follows Kate Reddy in her apparent 'struggle' to maintain a worklife balance. A powerful business woman with a loving husband beautiful children and oodles of cash it is difficult from the off to see where the problem is. And who I hear you ask is the woman to take on this complex and challenging role? Stepping out of her Jimmy Choos and into well Louboutins is SJP Sarah Jessica Parker perfectly preened as ever trying and unfortunately failing to convince us that she doesn't even have time to brush her hair in the morning. Whilst Kate flits between Boston and New York pursuing the deal that could define her career we are treated to a series of slightly odd and disjointed straight to camera dialogue segments in which characters completely unrelated to the plot tell us what being a good mother means to them. Case and point is gym bunny Wendy Best Busy Phillips who sees working out all day but making sure she is home for the kids after school as the quintessential quality of a good mother. Questionable logic at best.Returning to globetrotter Kate we are teased with the possibility of a burgeoning illicit romance with suave financial bigshot Jack Abelhammer the ever so wooden Pierce Brosnan. With all the racy instant messaging and exciting evenings out with the 'normal folk' at the bowling lanes it's a wonder that Kate is able to resist Jack's smooth and symphonic declaration of love. Irony becomes the only way of describing such awkward interaction. Things barely get any better with Richard Greg Kinnear sweet and unassuming left to play house husband aside from the full time nanny of course. The lack of chemistry in both of these couplings can at times be painful to watch. On a general note the film is stripped of all its British wit the book originally being set in London for American schmaltz. SJP doesn't even bring to the film the sassy 'woman who has it all' vibe from her Sex and the City days. There is no true sense of a woman on the edge as the title suggests. The film addresses the right issues the struggles of motherhood from finding pancake batter on a suit lapel to the nightmare of nits are all explored but they are not taken to the point of desperation to prompt empathy or even sympathy in the viewer. The film wraps with a thought provoking moralas the snow conveniently begins to fall outside the school gates Kate can finally fulfill the important promise she made to her children to wait for it build a snow man.".

Richard is involved in his own business and has just been offered a great opportunity himself.The movie is peppered with insights from the various characters which explain the whys and wherefores of Kate's behavior.Pierce Brosnan does a very good job of portraying the driven businessman who has had a personal tragedy early in life and work has become his obsession. His loneliness shows through his business exterior and even though we know he is falling for Kate he keeps the relationship purely professional.The film has not received very favorable reviews  3.7 out of 10 on IMDb and only a 20 positive rating from Rotten Tomatoes. I disagree with this. I found this film to be entertaining and at times touching  especially for those of us who have ever missed the school play or anything concerning our children because of work related obligations. True  the film is not Oscar worthy and is pretty much a formula movie with the moral of the story being family should come first....but it has many redeeming qualities and that proverbial happy ending.This movie is worth an afternoon trip to the theater Matinee Price.".

	schema:headline " A Classic Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van OrtonMichael Douglas in one of his best roles who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brotherSean Penn gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun rollercoaster ride with many twists and turns.What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editingwhich is the popular way of making movies today The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.1010".

Yes we like our fun but we like to exercise our brains once in a while also. And let there be no mistake about the great performances offered here by Michael Douglas and his costars.

	schema:reviewBody "Having conquered the critics and the boxoffice with Se7en David Fincher could have sold out and kept delivering more of the same. Fortunately he was wise enough to try different paths and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.In Fincher's third film The Game that solitude is physically incarnated by Nicholas Van Orton Michael Douglas a wealthy businessman who is so obsessed with his job he has forgotten everything about the simple joys of life. The only person who still stays in touch with him is his younger brother Conrad Sean Penn who is Nicholas' polar opposite in terms of attitude. One night when they're out to celebrate the elder brother's birthday Conrad mentions a game that changed his life and suggests Nicholas participate too as it would be fun. Though initially hesitant the latter eventually gives in to curiosity and decides to give it a shot. Within a few hours however he will regret it the game is actually some sort of conspiracy involving everyone in town. With his assets frozen his apartment no longer a safe place and no one left to trust Nicholas must figure out how to solve the problem before it's too late  for him or someone else...As usual Fincher makes sure the film works on a technical level cleverly using camera angles lighting shades of red and brown being the dominant color and editing to keep the suspense alive and the atmosphere conveniently murky. It is mainly this masterful handling of filmmaking tools that keeps the viewer from questioning the logic of the nonetheless brilliant screenplay some of the twists giving the impression of a dystopic setup rather than a plausible situation and yet the script is supposedly based on a real event. Two other elements contribute to elevating The Game above the average mystery tale a truly unpredictable phenomenal ending in pure Fincher tradition well at least until he made Panic Room and the great work by the leading men Douglas' paranoid desperation slyly erasing all hints of typecasting after all this is not the first time he has played someone who is being manipulated in fact one scene explicitly spoofs one of those previous movies and Penn's smug anarchy anticipating director's masterpiece Fight Club and its central character Tyler Durden without a doubt Brad Pitt's best role to date.In short those looking for a different cinematic experience should give The Game a try it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a reevaluation Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released and stands the test of time as one of the most original smartest films of the '90s.".

The premise involves  what do you get for the man who has everything   Nicholas Van Orton has everything we wants in a material world but it's come at a price where he's a lonely middle aged man and you're instantly reminded of Michael Douglas Oscar winning role in WALL STREET as Gordon Gekko . His brother Conrad buys him a birthday gift from Consumer Recreation Services and then all sorts of strange and dangerous things start happening The problem with the scenario is that when the ending is revealed your suspension of disbelief may not have been suspended enough . The comments pages for this film is full of people pointing out things like  What if Nicholas got mugged in Mexico or if he jumped off a different part of the building or if he did or didn't contact such and such a person ? he wouldn't have arrived at the ending  and they're right . In fact if you stop to think about it it also means that every single previous customer who used CRS must had a successful time other wise the customer would have sued the company in a multi million pound court case . Are you trying to say all that excitement wouldn't have caused a previous customer to have a heart attack or be seriously injured  perhaps even killed ? Why do you think no one in real life has come up with something like CRS in real life ? That's because of the real life possibility of litigation I do confess that I'm taking things a little too serious and people will point out that it's only a film and they're right . For most of the running time I found THE GAME rather compelling entertainment similar to TOTAL RECALL without the high body count and scifi elements and though everything disintegrates with the revelation I do recommend THE GAME as entertainment mixed in with a redemption plot".

The film stars Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Deborah Kara Unger David Cronenberg's Crash turns in a fine supporting roll as well. Davd Fincher director of Seven and Aliens 3 continues to set high standards for motion picture making.

	schema:reviewBody "The Game weaves its way into and around your brain challenging you to figure out the puzzle. It's a rather unique film experience because of that noholdsbarred challenge  it challenges you to figure out what's coming next in a direct way not many other films attempt. It's a thinking person's film whether it's actually intelligent or not probably depends on the individual but I'd like to think it's pretty smart. Also pretty smart is the character played by Michael Douglas  business smarts that is. Douglas was near the end of a roll playing businessmen began in Wall Street87. He becomes involved with an odd company CRS introduced to him by his younger brother Sean Penn in a small role. What begins as amusing distraction for his orderly world soon turns sinister.The film points out that people especially smarter people whom you'd think don't need amusement all need some kind of distraction. Isn't that what we're all doing essentially during our lifetimes  finding different means of distraction before the inevitable end? And aren't those distractions just a means to avoid thinking about that end? Douglas may be closer to that end than he thinks here. As the toying escalates and becomes dangerous the viewer may think this has the makings of a slick if standard thriller but that's not the case to everyone's credit. You reach a point however when certain incidents demand suspension of disbelief no matter how much you trust the filmmakers. How far can a man fall for example before you start to think there's a limit of how much I can buy into here? How much can be allowed how much power can you allow for the puppeteers before a line is crossed? It crosses that line with me towards the end but reaching that point was an interesting experience something I can say about too few films.This was Fincher's middle film in his personal great trilogy caught between Se7en and Fight Club. If there's one other minor quibble I might voice it's that his stylistic flourishes are missing in this one  it's comparatively straightforward even with the Super8 type flashbacks and I would have to rate this a smidgen below the other two. However if I had to pick one to watch over and over it would be The Game.".

Today am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?The question like this movie and many others before it deals with the problem of distinguishing what is real from what is illusory. An old philosophical question. But this movie does a pretty good job of exploring the issue.The plot basically is this. Sean Penn enrolls his brother Michael Douglas in something called the game. Douglas enrolls in this program a birthday present without having any idea of what it's all about. Douglas is an extremely wealthy control freak who lives a life encased in ice. He's brutal to subordinates frosty to friends and lives alone and likes it. Then things begin to go wrong. First little things. His pen leaks and stains his shirt at the airport. A waitress spills wine all over him at his favorite restaurant. A man seems to drop dead in front of him. Then things spin wildly out of control. People shoot at him. His bank accounts are emptied by the people running the game. A wild taxi ride ends up with him trapped in the car at the bottom of San Francisco Bay. He's drugged by someone he trusts and wakes up dressed in rags his nose bloodied with no ID and no money in a rubbishstrewn Mexican graveyard. This has happened to me once or twice and I can tell you  it's discomfiting. It's like an episode from The Twilight Zone or John Fowles' novel The Magus. Or citing cinematic history like the pod people or Carpenter's The Thing or Steve Railsback in The Stuntman. Who belongs to the conspiracy and who doesn't. Or does ANYBODY not belong? And as a birthday present this game is like one of those really ugly ties that somebody gives you that you know you'll never wear but you can't take it back either.Douglas gives a surprisingly good performance. He has greater range than I'd previously given him credit for. He shows the same disdain for others that he did as Gordon Gekko but he brings a fragility to the character as well. When he sees mouthtomouth resuscitation being given to someone he displays what could easily pass for real disgust. And when he cuts his hand on a sliver of glass he grimaces with pain while he rinses it and wraps it in a handkerchief the way the adventurer of Romancing the Stone would never do. And there is none of the comfortable matteroffact laid back quality he showed as a doctor and boy friend in Coma. The other performers are competent but Douglas has the only role that stands out.Interesting use of location shooting too. San Francisco doesn't look like an urban theme park here. Almost all the scenes take place at night on depopulated streets and they make San Francisco look about as ugly as it's possible to make the city look. The dialog doesn't leap out at you but it does have its quiet wit which I'm not sure is always appropriate. Douglas loses a shoe to an attack dog. There goes a thousand dollars he remarks to his companion. Your shoes cost a thousand dollars? she asks. That one did.At the movie's end just when you think the game is over there's yet another twist coming the last one leading Douglas to suicide by jumping off the roof of a highrise hotel only to land safely on an air bag judiciously placed below in what looks like the lounge of the Sheraton Palace. The movie is entirely implausible. As explained at the end there isn't a believable moment in it. But it has the kind of illogic that a real nightmare has. The viewer may realize afterward that what has happened is impossible but Douglas has no way of finding that out. Everything seems askew to him as it does to us while we watch. Even Daniel Schorr on CNN has an interactive exchange with him. This is impossible says Douglas. That's right replies Schorr. It's impossible. You're having a conversation with your TV set. If you can't trust Daniel Schorr something is seriously screwed up.Alas the denouement does flunk the believability test and badly. Douglas has been put through hell and it all turns out for the best  all those dangerous pranks the living nightmare the humiliation the druggings the action movie clichs all have made him a better man. He's grateful. Whereas a lot of fairly normal people myself included would try to track down every soul involved in this scam and beat the living crap out of them. I'd make a particular point of celebrating my brother Sean Penn's next birthday by crowning him with a crowbar  a real one.".

Okay so it asks you to accept some pretty wild premises and some fairly insane leaps of logic. Okay so after you think about it the suspense really has no sensible roots. The bottom line is that this movie is fun to watch.There's really no way to so comprehensively map a person's every possible reaction that you could keep constantly abreast of himher. I'm also not sure how sane the idea of plunging a taxi cab into water is whether there's a supposed diver on the scene or not. And shipping the guy to Mexico in a box? Come on. I mean at some point this guy is going to come up with something the gamewriters can't foresee. So the game itself I just don't believe could work.But the movie does. The viewer is brought into the game at the same speed as Nick Van Orton Douglas so the mystery works on two levels. It raises a number of questions and although it doesn't satisfactorily answer them all or even most of them it still sends chills up your spine. What would you do if they seized your bank accounts stole your identity chased you drugged you and shipped you a thousand miles away in a coffinsized box? It's creepy to think about it even with your brain constantly untangling the overbearing contrivance that put it on screen in the first place.The truth is that I was totally skeptical of the game all the way through and even after I saw the movie but I just don't care. I liked watching it. I was entertained. And isn't that what the movies are all about?".

When he participates in this game unusual events happen that interfere with his daily routine endangering his life. The closer he gets to figuring out the master behind the game the more dangerous the events get making him become closer to death. He must risk everything he has to discover the deadly secret.The director David Fincher creates this film in a great way. The earlier success of his previous film Seven gave the producers of The Game an opportunity to acquire a higher profit. The film was eventually ranked 44 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.This thriller successfully holds suspense the whole way through. The incidents displayed throughout the film are shown in a sequence that continually makes us wonder what is happening and the rapid change in events keeps us watching. There is a wide range of occurrences happening throughout the movie which only make sense at the end of the story so once we have seen a few of the experiences that Nicholas must go through we are dragged into the film continually wondering who is good who is bad and how the events all link together. I recommend this film to anyone who likes mystery story's thrills and suspense. It is fantastically structured and it is a must see for anyone who likes films in this genre.810  The Game is full of surprises and should not be missed!".

That is without any good clues about who the players are or why it's quite happening except that his birthday has come and gone events begin to happen around him that are inexplicable.

The main example is of course The Fight Club the distortions are almost literal in the more ordinary Panic Room and the world is somewhat friendlier in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Yes these are all Fincher films as is the brand new American version Dragon Tattoo flick and the riveting Se7en.The production and the shooting and editing in particular are all first rate classic Fincher. Douglas plays his part with conviction and you end up not quite sympathizing with him he's a spoiled jerk even as his world evaporates but you certainly are in his shoes wondering what is going on. It's crazy and exciting and certainly baffling for a viewerwhich is part of the game actually. The viewer is another layer in the layers of perceivable reality.And then it just goes too far. In a way the film is preposterous from the start but yet you go along with the idea because very rich people have very unusual lives and maybe this kind of mindtrip birthday present with lots of people participating could happen. Money moves mountains. But when things get almost comically absurd when the twists of identity and loyalty keep happening you want to just say walk away. Get a grip. Refuse to play or maybe at least refuse to believe things like this are possible.This is where Michael Douglas is perfect and maybe does what few actors could pull off. Because as it gets insane his character toughs it out. He's the type to take a challenge to get extreme to be risky to protect his selfinterests without surrender.In some ways it's a great movie so watch it as if it'll never let you go. And when it's just too much be glad you went along for as long as you did. And enjoy the rest of the show for its theatrics. It remains really well made all through.".

Only a few people know about this organization and what it does in the movie it seems. But if only a handful of people know about the organization how could it possibly get booming business? That's one of the many many plot holes that The Game seems to have. It just has too many plot holes to save itself. It has a pretty good plot good acting good directing...even a good script...but the plot holes in the script cause the problems.Michael Douglas plays a rich businessman whose birthday is coming up soon. Sean Penn his younger brother tells Douglas that he Penn has bought a present for Douglas called The Game. Douglas goes to the location of The Game Headquarters it has a name but I can't remember right now and there he finds out that The Game Headquarters must test Douglas' health before they activate it The Game. They ask him questions do health tests...all of this going to use later...and then Douglas goes to dinner. At dinner one thing leads to another and pretty soon things start happening. A hysterical Penn tells Douglas that he didn't have enough money to pay for The Game and now The Game is coming after him. So now Douglas is caught up in this conspiracy which he may never get out of alive. Because now they're coming after him. Blackmail is only the beginning of what they'll do to Douglas.First of all The Game has a nice setup. I really enjoyed the beginning. It holds a great sense of suspense and seems to be filmed effectively in a very suspenseful way. It has all the markings of a Hitchcockian thriller. Unfortunately Hitchcock would have ironed out the plot holes before he filmed the movie because despite being a suspenseful film the plot holes are unbearable kind of negating all the suspense and belief in the film.SPOILERSFirst of all how does The Game know that Douglas is going to do everything he does? They're betting an awful lot that he will jump off the building at JUST the right spot to crash through JUST the right glass if you've seen the film you'll know what I mean. I can't exactly go into the entire filmit would spoil the entire thingbut the plot holes in the movie are just too obvious. They are literally betting on every step Douglas will take and while they have people to help him make decisions along the way there are times that he is by himself...how do they know in a moment of despair he will not try to put a gun to his head?At the end major spoiler ahead Douglas stands on the edge of a skyscraper with a gun. They make it look as though Douglas has just shot his brother by accident. Douglas on the verge of a mental breakdown walks to the edge of the skyscraper and jumps. Here are two things.1. How did they know Douglas wouldn't just lift the gun to his head and blow it off? Why jump off the building? Yeah I know that's what his father did and therefore Douglas would do the samebut what if he hadn't? If I were Douglas' character just because my father jumps off a building doesn't mean that that would be my decision of effective suicide.2. What if Douglas had jumped off the wrong point of the building? What if he all of a sudden before anyone could do anything he decided to run off the other end of the building? And even if he jumped off the building at the right point what if a the wind there could be some strong gusts from that high up blew him away from his destination and b from that speed even fake glass would cut him up IF he reached his destination.That's one of the things that got me but really the whole sake of the film lies on what Douglas will do. What if Douglas shot himself early on? What if the shock of thinking he killed his brother gave him a heart attack? What if he didn't get out of the underwater taxi and drowned? What if?

	schema:reviewBody "Most Americans know this film if they know it at all as VOYAGE TO THE END OF THE UNIVERSE. According to most sources the film was chopped  redubbed from its original 81 minute length the original Variety review pegs it at 90 minutes to approximately 64 minutes for its limited theatrical run by American International Pictures. Curiously I have an old VHS tape off of TV that runs about 78 minutes.  The odd thing is that the cuts that were made apparently there were both Theatrical and TV Versions prepared are actually LESS important to the ADDITIONAL footage that was added. And that Additional Footage runs about 5 seconds! How could 5 seconds be more important that the 5 to 20 minutes that were cut out?? More on that below with SPOILER ALERT to come. IKARIE XB 1 the Czech cut is on display as part of a traveling series of Czech films and hopefully will show up on DVD soon in a definitive version. Unquestionably IKARIE is one of the best SF films to come from outside the USA. Well mounted production values solid acting and an intelligent storyline. The film has many parallels to such  Productions as 2001 SOLARIS the German TV series SPACE PATROL PLANET OF THE APES and many others. What's particularly intriguing is that the film doesn't condescend to its audience. Some of the most fascinating aspects of the script are more implied than detailed this may cause some to be confused or distracted  Why for instance does the crew not know of the previous mission they come up close to the target 'White Planet'NOT the 'Green Planet' as it's US version calls it?. A true find. Hopefully a restoration would allow the film to take its rightful place in the SF Film canon.  SPOILERS BELOW Most of the cuts made in the TV version of IKARIE are fairly minor most just made to speed things up. But it's that 5 seconds of new footage that makes for an entirely different viewing experience. For the US version changes THE ENTIRE MEANING OF THE MOVIE! When the Space Travelers finally reach the Green Planet it appears that they have either never left gone thru a time warp a la PLANET OF THE APES or gone around in circles  NONE of these endings was inferred by the original film at all! Shockingly when I've talked to people who've seen the US Version or read about it in Film Reference books their view of the whole film is not only tainted by these 5 seconds but actually results in their dismissal of the film's quality. Most huff that it's got this lame and OBVIOUS ending  And sadly they are referring to an ending that is neither lame nor was obvious  for it was never meant to be by the filmmakers! Tragic shocking and sad. People read the film from the ending backwards and dismiss all that came from before due to its trick ending. Again I hope the film and its purposefully ambiguous ending will out.".

As a result the transitions between interior and exterior shots are somewhat jarring.All the same this movie is a very interesting example of midcentury science fiction.

	schema:reviewBody "IKARIE XB1 is one of the most compelling science fiction films ever made. Filmed in very Cold War era Czecheslovokia and rarely seen in North America in it's complete widescreen form this is a movie that was so ahead of it's time that only 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY managed to raise the bar above what was set here with it's meticulous depiction of outer space vehicles in action.If there is any shortcoming to IKARIE it's simply that The space ship model effects are somewhat awkward  unconvincing a setback that the movie might not recover from in the mind's eye of viewers raised on 30 years of George Lucas  Steven Spielberg special effects films. But viewers who are interested in a story will be more than rewarded with a complex drama about a group of humans off in search of a brave new world to populate with an ending sequence that is perhaps the most provocative element of the entire film  and would later find form again in Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES albeit in a different manner. There is no doubt that the Italian master was influenced by this film.For me the most striking sequence is a daring risky and potentially scandalous commentary by these Soviet Bloc filmmakers when they have their explorers encounter a derelict craft floating aimlessly  without power in the empty nothing between the stars. A boarding party is dispatched to discover that it was an early Earth craft which had been dispatched during a nuclear conflict who's crew was made up of decadent aristocrats who had been attempting to escape the carnage back on Earth. They are long dead mummified to the point where their bodies disintegrate when brushed against and had apparently been killed off by the military flight crew when it became clear the oxygen supply was about to run dry. The quiet calm horror of the scene is unprecedented even by today's standards with the accidental triggering of one of the ship's obsolete but still functional nuclear warheads providing a nerveshattering moment as the two hapless crewmen attempt to escape the airless gravity deprived hell in space.One of the aspects that makes the scene so convincing was the space suit designs created by the artistic visionaries behind the film. They look even more functional practical and real than the Mercury era space flight technology of the day Bulky armored pressurized tin cans with knee joints clawlike cloves and magnetized boot plates. The scene of the two astronauts trying to run across the derelict flight deck for the airlock to escape the explosion is a marvel of not only applied science but choreography. In my opinion the film is worth tracking down for this one sequence alone.And now you can The film was issued in 2005 on a marvelous Czech made PAL format DVD that shows the film in the correct 2351 Techniscope widescreen format with the original unaltered  unmessed with ending sequence intact. Any serious fan of Cold War era science fiction simply must acquire one. I will admit that some of the more talky middle soap opera in space segments sort of lag the pacing a bit but the 81 minutes is over quickly and the impression one is left with is that the thinking behind the movie was miles ahead of anything that came out of the West at the same time. Along with the Russian PLANETA BUR and the East GermanPolish SILENT STAR aka FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS this is one of the most important  overlooked masterpieces of science fiction from the time when manned space flight was becoming a reality.All three films are grounded in actual science with impressive visual power that still has potency. What makes IKARIE XB1 even more impressive is that it lacks some of the gloryboy propagandizing of the Soviet Bloc's entertainment machine which was designed to enthrall the masses with depictions of glorious Soviet cosmonauts conquering the cosmos  something that never really quite happened. Those movies were meant to placate the Proletariat and give them a reason to make do cheer for the genuine oppression under which they lived. By contrast IKARIE is almost a work of pure artistic expression which is in itself remarkable considering the conditions under which it was made.810".

A boarding party is dispatched to discover that it was an early Earth craft which had been dispatched during a nuclear conflict who's crew was made up of decadent aristocrats who had been attempting to escape the carnage back on Earth. They are long dead mummified to the point where their bodies disintegrate when brushed against and had apparently been killed off by the military flight crew when it became clear the oxygen supply was about to run dry. The quiet calm horror of the scene is unprecedented even by today's standards with the accidental triggering of one of the ship's obsolete but still functional nuclear warheads providing a nerveshattering moment as the two hapless crewmen attempt to escape the airless gravity deprived hell in space.One of the aspects that makes the scene so convincing was the space suit designs created by the artistic visionaries behind the film. They look even more functional practical and real than the Mercury era space flight technology of the day Bulky armored pressurized tin cans with knee joints clawlike cloves and magnetized boot plates. The scene of the two astronauts trying to run across the derelict flight deck for the airlock to escape the explosion is a marvel of not only applied science but choreography. In my opinion the film is worth tracking down for this one sequence alone.And now you can The film was issued in 2005 on a marvelous Czech made PAL format DVD that shows the film in the correct 2351 Techniscope widescreen format with the original unaltered  unmessed with ending sequence intact. Any serious fan of Cold War era science fiction simply must acquire one. I will admit that some of the more talky middle soap opera in space segments sort of lag the pacing a bit but the 81 minutes is over quickly and the impression one is left with is that the thinking behind the movie was miles ahead of anything that came out of the West at the same time. Along with the Russian PLANETA BUR and the East GermanPolish SILENT STAR aka FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS this is one of the most important  overlooked masterpieces of science fiction from the time when manned space flight was becoming a reality.All three films are grounded in actual science with impressive visual power that still has potency. What makes IKARIE XB1 even more impressive is that it lacks some of the gloryboy propagandizing of the Soviet Bloc's entertainment machine which was designed to enthrall the masses with depictions of glorious Soviet cosmonauts conquering the cosmos  something that never really quite happened. Those movies were meant to placate the Proletariat and give them a reason to make do cheer for the genuine oppression under which they lived. By contrast IKARIE is almost a work of pure artistic expression which is in itself remarkable considering the conditions under which it was made.810";

It proudly carries on the tradition started by Forbidden Planet and This Island Earth even though its not as exciting. It is actually more like the Magnetic Monster and the Outer Limits. This is science fiction done in crisp black and white. The screen may not be vivid yet the special effects have an ethereally surreal quality. Mix that in with the futuristic Shostakovitchlike score and we have a compelling and eerie trip into the unknown.The excitement and glory that comes from living and exploring space Star Trek Star Wars etc. is minimized in the movie. We get the basic day to day activities of the crew of the Ikarie on its 28 month 15 years pass back on Earth mission to our closest solar system Alpha Centauri. We also get the dangers and rewards of hurling ourselves into the vast darkness.It is the 22nd Century and we are out in the galaxy searching for life. The crew is comprised from a coed international pool. We never get to see Earth yet we get a glimpse of what humans are like from the interactions of the crew work entertainment nutritional intervals exercise reproduction and crisis. This is a future full of video screens blasters personal transmitters turbo lifts artificial gravity Beatniklike futuristic dancing and even Nike light up magnetic boots. This is the perfectclassical example of the scifi antithesis to Idiocracy. Humanity will improve with time. The future is bright shiny and worth waiting for. Man fixes the malaise of his species. We are never shown anything more lethal than a hand blaster when it comes to weapons. On their mission they encounter a perfectly preserved space relic from an Earth expedition of the 20th century. Let's just say our predecessors had very little nice things to say about us. Let's not forget that the 20th century contained two world wars numerous genocides the birth and use of the the atomic bomb. One would also assume that a movie made in a Soviet influenced country would contain a certain amount of Communist and ProSoviet propaganda for example Planeta Bura. Thankfully this is all missing. About the biggest commentary comes from the critique of our 20th century counterparts. I found the only anticapitalist message in the writing on the Earth relic. Everything inside is written in English the ship was fully loaded with nuclear warheads and the the crew turned on each other. And even this critique is more of a jab at our collective selves then at full fledged opposition to capitalism. If you are looking for epic space battles for the fate of the universe look elsewhere because the crew kills absolutely no living thing. If you want 90 minutes of Georges Mlis mixed with Jules Verne then you have found the perfect movie. I can easily see this movie as an influence on Kubrick's 2001 Rodenberry's Star Trek Lucas' Star Wars and even Irwin Allen's Lost in Space. We even have a robot. He's definitely not as cool nor as good as Robby the Robot nor the robot that constantly saves the Robinsons. We named him Patrick. Patrick the Robot. RIP.

	schema:reviewBody "Still relatively unfamiliar to western audiences Ikarie XB 1 is an example of east European science fiction cinema on a fairly ambitious scale deserving of wider appreciation. Usually it's been only seen in a butchered edition created Stateside  duly shorn of a plot strand dubbed with a different ending with a dumb title.With the benefit of hindsight a lot of the original seems familiar. With its clean interior ship design crew neck uniforms all round glide doors shiny deck flooring as well as a 15year mission to seek out new life Ikarie may have given later pause for thought for a certain Gene Roddenberry. Genre fans will also note that during the first big set piece the crew are startled by an unexpected alarm and deviate from their mission to investigate a derelict spacecraft  events which end with a nuclear detonation in space. Add to this the changes wrought by the American bastardisation of Voyage To The End Of The Universe that included an ending which anticipates Planet of the Apes as well as its possible inspiration to Kubrick when planning 2001 and Ikarie certainly offers much of interest. Not to mention its own borrowings eg Ikarie's robot Patrick inspired by Forbidden Planet 1956Polk's was also responsible for an intriguing Nazi time travelling movie with a small cult on its own account Tomorrow I'll Wake Up And Scald Myself With Tea made in the late 1970s. Less idiosyncratic than this one imagines Ikarie is much more serious in tone set mostly aboard a roomy spacecraft crewed by 40 dispatched to discover if there is any life on Alpha Centauri. A feeling of worthwhile isolation permeates this journey with none of the trivial trials and stresses one expects from space dramas made closer to home at this time where mad scientists lurk robots lumber threateningly or spacewomen defer to their mates. Missing too is the pseudo technical claptrap which lumbers much American SF then or now. Ikarie's hardware exists mainly in the background without need of explanation. The film expects us to take its conspicuous 22nd century advances just as seen being concerned more with sociology than technology.Ikarie features a harmonious society in miniature shown in a series of interactions aboard even down to the calm acceptance of on board pregnancy  an adult theme incidentally completely excised in the American version. In such an hospitable environment even the mad can be talked round without violence as in the case of Michael Otto Lackovic who affected by radiation and in a disastrous manoeuvre wants to turn the ship back to Earth. That the only real threat the crew face is an external one is significant and also primes the dramatic moment that begins the narrative. A flashforward to when infected by the same source as we learn later one of the crew is wandering bewildered and aggressive through the ship. Earth is gone he says. Earth never existed. But he's not beyond help from his peers. Here the deluded or mad in space are not assumed lost such as we might see in such recent American films as Event Horizon but taken back and with promise of cure at that.Critics have contrasted these shipboard mores to the signs of capitalist degeneracy confronting those who board the 'Tornado' the derelict space station from 1987 unexpectedly encountered en route. Here amidst the dark clutter of its interior are found signs of gambling and money coded elements of capitalist speculation just as fatal as the death gas and nuclear warheads also there. For those who explore it the Tornado reflects a place thought left behind both geographically and politically. We have discovered the 20th century says one dismayed crewman. The determined self destruction encountered by those who board the derelict recalls one of TV's original Star Trek shows and those found died as result of a selfish fight for survival. The signs of a corrupt political system fall exposed with as much horror as does in a notable moment the skin off the Tornado captain's face.This and then the debilitating effects of rays that emanate from a hitherto unknown black star are the two principal threats facing the crew. How they finally overcome this last hurdle is part of the end of the quest. Without giving too much away it is sufficient to say that the close of the film the ship's long anticipated arrival at Alpha Centauri's 'white planet' brings a sequence both uplifting and brief carrying over the theme of mutually beneficial cooperation. But viewers today may find less interest in the ending than the scenes that have preceded it. It's the Ikarie crew's social or dutiful pairings even to the point of bringing each other flowers or taking showers together which lay at the heart of the film rather than any encounter of a new civilisation and the socialist message entailed. Whilst in basic narrative terms the 'white planet' brings closure our attentions have for long been focused elsewhere in scenes such as the notable dance sequence. Through the hypnotic rhythms of Zdenek Liska's striking score the astronauts take part in something akin to a weird 22nd century disco their slow somnambulistic movements reassuring while also slightly disturbing. Reassuring as we can see the crew reacting together as one social unit even after the inevitable trials of months in space disturbing because it is all so emotionless and controlled. Such ambiguous group occasions beg questions we really want answered. Are they really happy? Or does the Earth we thought we recognised in them no longer exist?The Czech originated disc I have seen offers a splendid widescreen transfer of the movie with English subtitles. Most of the extras are unfortunately not subtitled but there's a chance to see some sample scenes from the American International version to give an idea of how the original was changed as well as a stills gallery.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ikarie XB1 stands alongside First Spaceship to Venus and Planeta Bur as one of the fine achievements of 1960s Eastern Bloc science fiction. Like the other two films it provides a relatively realistic look at what a longterm journey to another world would entail and avoids Hollywood contrivances such as warp travel. Like the other films mentioned there is surprisingly little in the way of overt communist propaganda in this piece.The Ikarie Icarus is the first interstellar ship and is travelling to Alpha Centauri. The film handles time dilation in a realistic way and shows how the cosmonauts cope with the knowledge that they will age more slowly than their colleagues at home.The film is episodic in form and shows the tribulations and successive crises the crew face on their protracted journey. Some of the challenges are minor but they become increasingly fraught with danger as the ship nears its destination.The film does not feature an omniscient thirdperson narrator rather all events are told from the perspective of the crew of the Ikarie. Hence some mysteries they encounter do not have answers. Who exactly was aboard that 20th Century Earth ship? What was their mission? Why were they gassed to death? The film's director Jindirch Polak seems to have looked to France and taken some ideas from the nascent nouvelle vague movement. The camera work is fluid and the black and white cinematography is presented almost in the style of a documentary. The acting is natural and there is a lightness and energy to the proceedings that the early Soviet science fiction films lacked.The symbolism of the birth of the new child in space between two worlds is a subtle and tasteful event and adds to the documentary feel of the film. The music and sound effects are a little discordant and unnatural reinforcing the mood of the film and sense of isolation of all that is harmonious and natural.The ship is an odd bold design and shows a clear trend away from traditional rockets and flying saucers that had predominated in cinema science fiction up until that point. Indeed the design reinforces the idea that the Ikarie is a small city in space.However any notion that the Ikarie is a substitute for a real city is swept away at the end when the characters reach their destination the Alpha Centaurian system planet covered in a vast futuristic city of light. The film ends at this point with a glimpse of the brave new world. This technique works extremely well as it forces the viewer to imagine what this utopia will be like for him or herself. The only hint is that the aliens seems welcoming extending a friendship to the humans by saving their lives and guiding them down with the tractor beam. They are aware of the threat of the black hole and save the human strangers from it.There is a real hope then that the alien other seeks to be a brother to us and that we are welcome on his land. How this message came across during the Cold War with tensions between the east and the other world of the capitalist west would be interesting to research. The hope for a warm welcome and a recognition that all life is equal is implicit to this ending though.In this sense this is a piece of true science fiction. Only by travelling away from our time and our place can we look back at ourselves and understand our humanity and our social and political problems and enact change. Perhaps the film hints the alien world is not so alien after all and the extraterrestrial inhabitants of Alpha Centauri are as humane as the earthlings. An excellent science fiction film far superior to Hollywood offerings in the genre let down only by a few clichd moments a few moments of awkward pacing and overuse of the disturbing dissonant music. Its sense of atmosphere documentarylike nature and uplifting ending raise it well and truly above most genre fare and make it one of the few great science fiction films to have been produced.".

According to reminiscence of Lem this novel was not from his favorites. But at that time 1962 and I think nowadays also it is a remarkable novel and movie also. In interpretation of Soderbergh's and Clooney's Solaris they was finding the heaven or paradise to live there and at the end Rheya and Kelvin have found it. Interpretation of Ikaria was full of agreements with new socialist ideas against capitalist ideas dead casino in space criticism of red nail polish etc. but in one time between lines there is the criticism of socialist reality during fifties and sixties predestined madness and no future impasse deadly illness from radioactive accident at the end of the Magellan Cloud novel.

The Encyclopedia of SF says the original film is in color but AI's print is BW probably to save costs on the number of prints they may have made from a film I suspect they got for little money in the first place.The story is about a big community sized spaceship making a long journey to the green planet.  Another reviewer said the ship was faster than light but a couple of references to timedilation effects in the dialog make it more likely that the ship was a nearlightspeed model.  This has an influence on the spooky atmosphere that pervades the whole film making the crewcommunity highly insular as they realize they are cut off completely from the lives they have left behind.The sfx are slightly better than Dr. Who episodes of similar vintage with a couple of really good spacesuits and an unusual design for the ship itself. There's also a very very neat shot of the ship in orbit around its destination that is a dead ringer for a similar moment in Alien and quite effective in both films in a way that most movies about spaceships seem to forego.Still the story rambles and seems kind of shallow.  The sets and sfx aren't bad but don't make up for the weak script.

It's interesting and surprisingly fairly accurate compared with what came before and after it's ahead of it's time While there are scientific inaccuracies  it's pretty authentic stuff  I liked the explanation of the time dilation effect on this journey to Alpha Centauri and the fact that their families back on Earth would age while they would not. The crew are beset by various problems on the way mainly the effects of a hidden black star and consequent radiation. The set design in this film really stands out being quite futuristic it's sort of 'Things To Come' meets 'Metropolis' in outer space. There's some odd unintentional distortion effects on the extreme ends of the widescreen film frame which is a shame it could be related to the type of lens used or some kind of distortion caused by an anamorphic squeeze. The film is quite gripping but just as it is getting really interesting the film ends at the point they arrive at their destination. You don't even get to see a glimpse of the new world unlike say in the film 'When Worlds Collide'. This film must have influenced the production design of 2001 a few years later. The exterior special effect sequences in this film are far less effective and are kept mercifully to a minimum. I thought the control panels and video screens shown were well ahead of their time. Pretty good stuff.".

Czechoslovakia's first science fiction film Icarus XB1 embodies a kind of romantic view of socialism everyone happily working together the cast like Star Trek  is remarkably multiethnic with British Russian Czech America French and Scandinavian crewmen. The second part of the film in which a derelict satellite is found is of course resemblant of Star Trek The Motion Picture while the investigation of the derelict recalls Ridley Scott's Alien. Then there's a giant robot which resembles Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet the film's title which recalls Rocketship XM and several sequences which conjure up the look of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. The film even manages to fit in a subplot in which a crazy crewman goes on a murderous rampage akin to the atrocious ending of Danny Boyle's Sunshine which incidentally was also about a ship called the Icarus.7.910  Very atmospheric and ahead of its time. The film was released in the US as Voyage to the End of the Universe.

	schema:reviewBody "some spoilers One of those early scifi flicks full of nice touches and effects that still influence the genre today from Star Trek to Minority Report. While the plot is about a lengthy trip to another solar system a main complication is about a health problem that deranges one of the crewlater borrowed for classic Star Trek's Naked Time and more blatantly used in Trek's Next Gen Naked Now episode. Their view screen projects images largerthanlife still used in movies today to look cool. While the ship models aren't too convincing there's one scene when a miniship is docking and suddenly an astronaut waves hello from inside! It's a slightly offkilter matte effect but a nice effort. The highlight of the film starts in the ballroom with futuristic music and dancing which is interrupted by an alarm an encounter with a derelict ship. Then we watch as the astronauts investigate their boots that light up with each slowmotion step unknowingly performing a dance of death. It's a sequence worth watching a few times. No doubt the climax of the scene was a contemporary message about the dangers of nuclear weapons. The derelict ship also foreshadows what will happen to the crew of the ship. There's alot of goodnatured humor in the film similar to the other Russian classic Planet of Storms.  The final scene isn't too surprising but it's better than no surprise at all and was apparently borrowed 2 years later for the same final scene in the Italian Planet of Vampires. A nice little flick which is in public domain so it's often sold by independent distributors on Ebay.".

I remembered the ship with the three flying saucers flying Swooooosh! through Interstellar space. It had Robots. It had flying saucers. It had Spacesuits. It had a scary derelict rocketship with dead bodies in it. And it had one explosion. Then My mother told me to go to Bed. Aaaaargh! Literally close to 40 years later the memory dogged me to get a DVD of the full IKARIE XB1. And it was worth it.Remember if you saw it as a Kid you saw it chopped to fit on the square TV screen. This is a Full widescreen Movie Production. And it's Long.Caveats No Monsters...other than the dead Capitalist kind chuckle!. No Space Battles. No Alien Invasions. No Mad Scientists. And it's BW.As other reviewers note there are segments where they go to explore a derelict ship and an incapacitating flyby a 'Dark Star' and cope with temporary madness from Radiation. Kind of a prelude to the old Star Trek.The rest of the Movie is Life aboard the first Interstellar ship everything from matchmaking to a dance party Which I thought to be endearingly comical both the music and the dance steps!!! to the birth of a baby.There was even a pet Dog onboard! The Departure from the usual run of American Space Movies also included female crew members who clearly had important roles on the ship and were treated with unfeigned respect by the men when they were consulted for opinions and input.All in all the movie spoke to me like an early version of '2001 A space Odyssey'. And even though it was made in Communist Czechoslovakia beyond the rather pointed social hints in the derelict 'Tornado' there was no heavy handed proletariat propaganda.On the FX front for 1963 the sets and setup were very high quality. The Spacesuits and the extravehicular saucers wowed me.Warning There are probably several versions of this movie out there. One English dubbed version is actually partial. There are sections of the movie where English Subtitles appear and you hear Czech then in the next scene they flip back to English. And lastly by today's hioctane Hollywood standards this movie is languid. But by today's standards hallowed '2001 a Space Odyssey' would be called Boring.A Different milieu and a Different Cultural perspective. So have a little patience. This one is best for a Sunday Afternoon. Give it a try if you can find it....and yes it's girlfriend friendly.".

I wasn't very positively surprised by the music either which tries too hard to sound like futuristic tech noise.All in all Ikarie XB1 was a quite positive surprise.

I did laugh at couple of occasions just because of the special effects but it really isn't that bad of a movie after you get past of those silly looking space ships. All in all well worth a watch to a scifi fans";

It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age full of affection and French mood. It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture. It is particularly a tribute to ToulouseLautrec and of course to Jean Renoir father PierreAuguste. You will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some Renoir master work. Excellent casting scenery soundeffects and  music.

A Belle Epoque impresario down on his financial luck is going to open a new club the Moulin Rouge with a new dance the French cancan. He encounters a working girl and makes her a dancer. She'll become a star. There are several crises to overcome before that happens.The movie is Jean Renoir's tribute to show business and he puts it on the screen with color verve humor and humanity. There are wonderful performances by all the actors. The leads are Jean Gabin as Henri Danglard the impresario Francoise Arnoul as Nini the girl who'll become a star and Maria Felix as Lola de Castro an overwhelmingly tempestuous beauty and Danglard's lover at the start. Gabin exudes confidence worldly humor and dedication to show business. He even dances a bit. Arnoul is first rate too. It looks like she was doing her own dances and as an actress think of a young Leslie Caron with brains and charm.The climax of the movie is the opening of the club with Felix's star dance comic songs a whistler a Danglardiscovered singer all moving toward the introduction of the French cancan. The crises happen and are resolved. Then the cancan explodes. Dancing girls come bursting out from the stage the front of the theater through posters down ropes from the balcony. The house swirls with the black tie and tails of the swells and the garish colors of the dancers' gowns. The cancan number lasts probably ten or fifteen minutes or so all music and gaiety all high kicks and splits. It's amazing when row after row of the dancers moving toward the camera through the audience leap up legs extended straight forward and backward backs arched then land on the dance floor in full splits. I didn't know whether to shout or wince.The last scene of the movie is outside the club shot from the cobblestone street looking at the entrance. It's a medium shot and from the side street a happy inebriated fellow in black tie and top hat staggers across pauses to tip his hat at the camera then staggers off. A completely charming ending.This really is a marvelous movie.".

The story is clich a laundry girl Nini Franoise Arnoul is discovered by a night club owner Danglard Jean Gabin. Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers. Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too. I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have. The film ends with the opening of Danglard's new night club the Moulin Rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers. The first of them Complainte de la Butte which also provides the base of most of the film's musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and Renoir himself wrote it. If you're a fan of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge! you'll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although it isn't very prominent in that film everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it. In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen. It's hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl. 810.".

	schema:headline " Renoir 10 Hollywood 5 Luhrmann 0";
	schema:reviewBody "Jean Renoir's homage to the Paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways. Not only does it appear to have been photographed by ToulouseLautrec and Mucha it portrays the geographic Paris the streets accessible only by staircases the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by Hollywood. There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacon's 42nd Street which had been made about 20 years before featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation a freshfaced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business who saves the show when the star failsYou're going out there a kid from the chorus but you've got to come back a STAR!! Warner Baxter's Julian Marsh is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated. Jean Gabin's Danglard keeps running afoul of genital politics but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh. He's all about the game exceptfor his pointy thing. He has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress. His prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes. Danglard takes Mistress 1 Lola de Castro played by Maria Felix slumming to a dive where he sees Nini Franoise Arnoul with her boyfriend and first lover Paulo the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage. The prospect of money and fame charms Nini and she become Danglard's next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which Danglard has dubbed French Cancan to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dance.Both 42nd St and French Cancan are tributes to show businessto modern entertainmentthat has is own iconography and its own conceit. 42nd St. is centered around Julian Marsh a great director of Broadway shows which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement. The male juvenile is a middleaged twit with lumbago replaced by Dick Powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide. Danglard on the other hand goes from woman to woman seducing them with the promise of fame hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment. One has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active. Postcoital scenes abound.Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo he has discovered Esther a Piaf type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film's theme song while he plays it on her fiddle. That of course arouses Nini's jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of Lola. And of course Nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a Czarina! The whole movie is about how Danglard's concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the showhow the audience demands devotionand it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men. At the movie's conclusion Danglard having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible and believe me it IS incredible performance of the cancan. Have you ever thought about being on the stage? he asks and the curtain descends. Meanwhile poor Julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to Peggy Sawyer's new fans disparage his contribution to the show's success. I won't even go into 42nd Street's central line Oh Guy it was GRAND of you to COME! Furthermore I won't go into the glimpse one gets of legendary Parisian entertainers including a brief vision of Piaf nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural. Certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered Trenet and Aznavour. But it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any Hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30's Hollywood musicals including my beloved Fred Astaire not to mention Dick Powell let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in movies like the repulsive American in Paris. All those fountains! We'll save our comparison of that turkey to Breakfast at Tiffany's and its deconstruction of the American male for another day.That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision in postwar France of a kind of hypermasculine mec that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point. That he is a man's man neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton is perhaps more on target. That he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question. I for one wouldn't mind living his life at all. I wonder if Gabin was that lucky. At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called boloney. I never got that far. Baz's Moulin Rouge... well Paris doesn't put that kind of stuff in the Seine anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't yet been completely blown away by a Jean Renoir film. The closest candidate so far was the wonderful 'A Day in the Country 1936' which unfortunately suffered the handicap of being unfinished. Even so I find the director's films to be extraordinarily pleasant viewing and I'd much sooner sit down for a Renoir than I would for say a Godard or Fellini film. 'French Cancan 1954' is a completely pleasant and entirely unpretentious musical comedy that goes by so breezily that you're apt to forget that you're watching the work of France's most respected filmmaker. Less concerned with cultural satire than 'The Rules of the Game 1939' the film is instead similar in tone to 'Elena and Her Men 1956' a completely inconsequential piece of cinema that is nonetheless a lot of fun to watch. Both of these films were shot in exquisite Technicolor of which Renoir takes full advantage filling the frame with glorious costumes colours and people.Henri Danglard Jean Gabin is a respected theatre producer who lives the high life despite relying upon financial backers to sustain his extravagant lifestyle. A charming chap and convincingly debonair given his age Danglard shares the company of the beautiful but temperamental Lola de Castro Mara Flix into whose bed many have attempted to climb and probably with little resistance. When Danglard woos a pretty young laundryworker Nini Franoise Arnoul into dancing the cancan for him Lola is overrun with jealousy and all sorts of anarchy takes place amidst this romantic rivalry. Meanwhile a handsome European prince Giani Esposito offers Nini his hand in marriage but she's not willing to make such a dishonest commitment more inclined to stay with Danglard who inevitably plots to discard her as soon as his next promising starlet comes along. Jean Gabin who had previously worked with Renoir in the 1930s is terrific in the main role overcoming his mature age to succeed as a potential lover.It's interesting to compare Hollywood films of the 1950s with their European counterparts. Thanks to the Production Code most American romantic comedies kept the romance almost entirely platonic whereas here Renoir's characters speak of sex and adultery as though it is a perfectly acceptable practice. Even the adorable Franoise Arnoul who occasionally reminded me of Shirley MacLaine is treated as an openly sexual women and not just because her character specialises in a dance designed purely to display as much leg as possible. Like many of Renoir's films the characters themselves aren't clearly defined and so it's difficult to form an emotional attachment. Indeed only in the final act does Danglard come clean with the extent to which he romantically exploits his dance recruits though even this moment is overshadowed by the premiere show of the Moulin Rouge. Perhaps it is through his caricatures that Renoir is making a quip about bourgeois French society  that they're all hiding behind fallacious identities and intentions. Or am I looking too far into this quaint musical comedy?".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone once described this film as a wonderful souffl and they were quite right. Lighthearted and full of zest for life the bold colours reflect the pure joy and optimism bursting from this Renoir vehicle.Unlike a Hollywood musical however there is a slightly dark undertone that gives this film more depth. The lead character played by the evertalented Franoise Arnoul is an antiheroine and the does little to generate empathy from her audience. Disloyal selfish and ambitious her love affairs highlight her capricious nature and result in one attempted suicide.Far more likable are the male leads each of whom is an interesting and for a musical welldrawn character particularly the aristocrat who attempts suicide after he is treated so poorly by the girl. Bravely Renoir leaves the love affair unresolved at the end just as it would be in real life. The musical numbers are wellchoreographed the climax being one of the most dazzling scenes ever filmed with dancers bursting forth and flying everywhere. The pace of the film is rapid reflecting the energy of the dance numbers. The sets are perhaps a little too sanitised for the music halls of the late nineteenth century but they reflect a nostalgia for an idealised past and a hope for the future as Europe left the Second World War behind. The lighting is bright throughout again reflecting the new optimism of the postwar age. Even in the darkest scenes of the clashes between Arnoul and her lovers there is a brightness that ironically works well.Ultimately this is a film about optimism but it is not a naive optimism that everything will be perfect. Hard choices will need to be made and people will be as selfish and ambitious as ever and the good people who try to care for them will still suffer through their total disregard for the feelings of others. Nevertheless there is a hope that things are improving and that basic joys like that of the music hall and light entertainment however banal can be enjoyed once more with an innocence regained after the darkness of the 1940s and the reign of the Vichy Government.".

The pace of the film is rapid reflecting the energy of the dance numbers. The sets are perhaps a little too sanitised for the music halls of the late nineteenth century but they reflect a nostalgia for an idealised past and a hope for the future as Europe left the Second World War behind. The lighting is bright throughout again reflecting the new optimism of the postwar age. Even in the darkest scenes of the clashes between Arnoul and her lovers there is a brightness that ironically works well.Ultimately this is a film about optimism but it is not a naive optimism that everything will be perfect. Hard choices will need to be made and people will be as selfish and ambitious as ever and the good people who try to care for them will still suffer through their total disregard for the feelings of others. Nevertheless there is a hope that things are improving and that basic joys like that of the music hall and light entertainment however banal can be enjoyed once more with an innocence regained after the darkness of the 1940s and the reign of the Vichy Government.";

The genius of Jean Renoir lies in his ability to take a simple rather mundane story and transform it with brilliant color palates charming actors and gorgeous scenery that recalls earlier Hollywood musicals such as An American in Paris. Jean Gabin that wonderful actor who also worked with Renoir in films like Grand Illusion and The Lower Depths lends his easygoing charm and grace to the role of Dugland a respected but unsuccessful dance club owner who decides to revive the classic French dance of the cancan which requires finding fresh new faces complete with long slim flexible legs. The best dancer he finds is a laundress named Nini played by Francoise Arnoul with such elegance and beauty it is hard to think of another actress with such charisma. She is truly a work of art herself and gives the film a whole other dimension with her smile and naivet. Overall the climatic scene is what truly grabs you. After the somewhat clichd arguments between lovers and quarrels over rights of sleeping partners we finally get to see what we want a group of beautiful French girls dance the cancan. Beyond even that Renoir films it at a highpace energy level along with dazzling colors that fill our senses with wonder. Indeed here we see the genius of Renoir not only in his ability to transform this material but also in showing foreign audiences the essence of French culture. Known to the outside world as impulsive highly passionate people Renoir seems to defend their behavior through dance and the reasons for which they celebrate life. Whether you like the French as a people or not Renoir makes it very difficult to not appreciate their culture and all the richness and joy that comes with it.".

This is just one of several love triangles in French Cancantrue to stereotype these French showbiz folk are always falling in love.Renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie. Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used.French Cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc. only one character Casimir ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation. The actor who plays him Philippe Clay is fun to watcha really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortions.The movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together. The dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in Moulin Rouge in fact if I have one complaint about French Cancan it's that the whole thing is a little too Technicolor. Even when Nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding. Yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy it's just that I can't help thinking that things weren't ever this colorful and innocent in real life.".

His most popular films were made in the 1930s before the outbreak of World War II and before he fled to Hollywood when France fell to the Nazis. After struggling to find any projects that suited him in the U.S. Renoir eventually returned to his native country where he started work on a project seemingly out of his comfort zone a trilogy of bright and bouncing musical comedies. These films were The Golden Coach Elena and Her Men and sandwiched between them French Cancan.French Cancan is filmed deliberately to evoke the paintings of the great Impressionist painters including Renoir's own father Pierre Auguste. Set in 1980s Paris this is the fictional origin of the Moulin Rouge and like Baz Luhrmann's spectacular Moulin Rouge! released 46 years later the tale is told with elements of fantasy and lashings of colour. With his failing cafe about to fall in the hands of the creditors the womanising Henri Danglard Jean Gabin hatches a plan whilst out one night in Montmartre with his rich colleagues and bellydancing mistress Lola Maria Felix. He will bring back the cancan renaming it the 'French Cancan' in order to sound more exotic to visiting Russian and American sailors. He eyes the beautiful Nini Francoise Arnoul and offers to pay for her to have dance lessons enraging her jealous boyfriend. With chaos growing all around him Danglard calmly tries to hold it all together in time for the big opening night.Clearly indulging his love for theatre Renoir really goes for broke with French Cancan infusing the many love triangles and business arrangements going on with a bawdy almost slapstick quality. Jean Gabin the terrific actor Renoir employed on a number of occasions manages to express so much by doing so little and always with a sly grin on his face. It is a far better performance than is even required for such a character and he offers an extra dimension to the workhorse who cares as much about putting on a dazzling memorable show as he does for the leggy girls he employs. The titular dance at the climax is as eyecatching and fantastical as anything produced by Hollywood during the genre's Golden Age and perhaps this was something Renoir picked up from his time there. Of the musical trilogy French Cancan was the only hit and it isn't difficult to see why this whimsical retelling of the origin of one of the most iconic locations of its time struck such a chord with audiences at the time.".

The best documentaries provide both or more sides of the story show the conflict allow the emotions to speak and inspire the viewer to decide or research further. Director Gaylen Ross does just that with this terrifying tale of truth ... a truth left open to interpretation.Rezso Kasztner arranged for the rescue of 1684 Jews. That much is known. The bone chilling debates occur when one views him as a hero and the other views him as a traitor  a collaborator with the Nazi's specifically Adolph Eichmann. Kasztner has been referred to as the Jewish Schindler but also as the man who sold his soul to the devil.Ms. Ross provides us access to many sources including his probable assassin! When this admitted killer sits down with Kasztner's family it proves the adage that truth is stranger than fiction. His family especially his daughter are on a mission to see him portrayed as the hero they see. The problem is that many including some of those he rescued see him as a Nazi collaborator and are unable to forgive.So many fine moments and interviews in this one that it actually left me wanting more. Somehow we never really got to know Kasztner as a man but I do walk away admiring his daughter and granddaughter for working to get their side of the story out and even more amazingly having a touch of pity for the assassin.".
