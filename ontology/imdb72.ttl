While waiting at the train station the young boy witnesses a brutal murder inside one of the bathroom stalls. Police detective John Book is assigned to investigate the murder of the man who was a undercover cop. Soon after Book finds out that he's in great danger when the culprits know about his investigation and hides out in the Amish community. There he learns the way of living among the Amish locals which consists of nonviolence and agriculture. Book soon starts a romance with the mother of the little boy but their romance is forbidden by the Amish standards. But it's not long before the bad guys find out Book's whereabouts.";

	schema:reviewBody "It all starts off when a beautiful Amish widow takes her little son Samuel from their home in Lancaster County Pennsylvania to visit her sister in Baltimore and try to get over her grief...While passing through Philadelphia and on entering alone a men's restroom in a train station Samuel glances up to see two men advancing with unmistakable menace toward a young man... He caught sight of the face of one of the two attackers who killed him...As the plot becomes more intricate and through a series of interesting events detective John Book finds himself forced to protect the shy eightyearold boy and his helpless mother... He disappears for some days in the Amish Country... Harrison Ford stars as a fugitive cop who is initially unwelcome in a community he knows a little about... He tries to learn the importance of family and community the philosophy of brotherhood and nonresistance... He becomes involved in a case that will essentially change his human perceptions... And later he finds himself falling in love with a sensitive young woman...Kelly McGillis is captivating as Rachel a woman who feels a shadow of confusion crossing her mind... She stares at the honest cop realizing the price he's paid in returning them to safety... In one scene she catches him watching her bath... She hesitates for a moment but in that precise moment she makes a choice... Slowly she turns to face him topless without shame... For a moment she attempts a tender effort to become for an instant a woman of his world...In another scene we see her playing the charade of her life... Bound by duty but tempted by desire she leaves her white cap  symbol of her identity  on the table and surrenders to a passion that makes her sensual nature say it all... Lukas Haas is very fine as the cute kid in the black coat and hat... He slowly raises his hand to point at the black and white photograph... This nice boy remains untouched by the violence interposed into his peaceful world...Jan Rubes is believable as Rachel's fatherinlaw Eli... He is torn by conflicts between faith discipline dedication and humility... He tries his best to protect what's left of his family from the pressures of the outside world... It's pretty clear he doesn't like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith... For him his daughterinlaw has brought fear to his house... and now she is dancing to English music!Alexander Godunov brings a solid performance to the role of Daniel Rachel's discarded suitor... It's no surprise that he wants the disappearance of the policeman... Book's tempting presence will only weak his chance with Rachel... In one remarkable scene and on a road running parallel to the train track he urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts to keep pace with the train...It is quite interesting to see Danny Glover as a crooked cop who's corrupt and evil... But the heart of the movie is a study of the Pennsylvania Amish through the eyes of an outsider suddenly introduced into their life... Peter Weir tries to paint a realistic portrait of the Amish who are best known for their severely 'plain clothing' and their 'nonconformed' way of life... The Amish also avoid telephones and electric lights and drive horses and buggies rather than cars... Weir delivers a powerful and romantic story an engaging film of different style mixing two different cultures the simplicity of the Amish lifestyle with the urban culture and fashion... The music and cinematography work beautifully to impart all the emotions of the characters...'Witness' won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Original Screenplay. Nominations for Best Actor Ford Art Direction Cinematography Director Score and Best Picture.. is quiet provoking.. thrilling and entertaining.. I highly recommend it..If you look carefully you'll spot Viggo Mortensen in his screen debut.. as Moses Hochleitner Daniel's little brother...".

The crime story is nothing more than a pretense  a MacGuffin in Hitchcock's phrase  on which to hang this sensitive and insightful story of the conflict between modernity and the culture of the Amish which is portrayed here with admiring respect and not a hint of condescension. Harrison Ford's portrayal of John Book is perhaps his finest work on screen so far. In particular Book's struggle to suppress his rising attraction for Rachel and his tormented realization that a relationship between them is not possible is achingly portrayed. Ford's effort is wellmatched by Kelly McGillis whose beauty here is almost breathtaking. The erotic interplay between them because it is unconsummated radiates an almost painful tension and the easily lampooned running through the field scene  because it has been led up to so convincingly  is almost heartbreaking. The character of Eli Lapp wonderfully played by Jan Rubes is richly multifaceted. His suspicion of the English outsider and his anger at Rachel's attraction to him is surmounted by an underlying humanity. His parting words to Book You be careful out there among them English are moving testimony to his acceptance of him. His stern yet loving dialogue to his grandson about renouncing hatred and violence is a treasured moment. Both direction and cinematography are splendid. The simplicity of Amish interiors is shot in a way that makes its austerity almost beautiful and the barnraising scene is an exercise in cinematic lyricism.It would be easy to fault the movie for the facile scene in which the punks taunting of Book's newfound friends and protectors drives him over the edge Eli It's not our way Book  Book No but it's MY way. but his gift to the young thug of a bloody nose is mighty satisfying to behold.My one criticism is with the music certainly not with the venerable Maurice Jarre's score itself but with its paltry synthesized realization. They should have found the money to spring for a full orchestra.In short a highly satisfying richly themed and multifaceted film which is well worth watching.".

Nominated for five more Oscars including Best Picture Best Actor Harrison Ford and Best Director Peter Weir. Weir Directed the 'The Year of Living Dangerously' and 'The Truman Show'. After seeing it maybe 10 times I find it is one of those infrequent stories that still draws my attention. This places it in the company of pictures like 'The Godfather' and some others which stand the test of repeat viewings over time. Kelly McGillis is the film's intelligent and talented secret weapon. Her performance makes me wonder where she is these days. She is an Amish widow from a rural Amish community. On a trip to the city her little boy witnesses a murder in the restroom of a train station. Police investigator Harrison Ford finds himself targeted along with the boy by corrupt cops in his unit that did the murder. He is hurt in a shootout and hides with the Amish. He wears Amish clothes and labors with the men of the community as he rebuilds his strength. An attraction naturally develops between the McGillis and Ford charactors. The chemistry is remarkably intelligent and authentically portrayed. Their worlds are seperated by a cultural gulf. They are drawn by each other and respect one another. The contrasts are drawn clearly between the quaint honesty and almost dreamlike serenity of the Amish and the horrible violence intruding upon them from the outside world. The resolution of the story should not be given away to someone who has not seen the movie. This film is a different kind of thriller in more ways than one. It's makers kept it intelligent instead of resorting to another pyrotechnic joyride. Robert Hartman".

	schema:reviewBody "You want to know how to make a successful movie? Just look here. You have tremendous suspense a topflight popular actor as the hero a touching romance story plenty of action a different kind of setting than normal people you care about nice photography very moral and very immoral people a little humor.....I mean this is how it's done.I also appreciated seeing Amish people of which I am not portrayed in a better light than secular Hollywood usually puts them. I also liked the wholesome female lead Kelly McGillis although she was the only Amish character out of character a bit loose than what you would ever find and who didn't think young Lukas Haas was the cutest kid they ever saw on film?Harrison Ford gives a typical solid performance as John Book a Philadelphia detective who winds up protecting the young boy Samuel Lapp his mom McGillis as Rachel Lapp and others against crooked cops Hollywood's favorite kind.

You have tremendous suspense a topflight popular actor as the hero a touching romance story plenty of action a different kind of setting than normal people you care about nice photography very moral and very immoral people a little humor.....I mean this is how it's done.I also appreciated seeing Amish people of which I am not portrayed in a better light than secular Hollywood usually puts them. I also liked the wholesome female lead Kelly McGillis although she was the only Amish character out of character a bit loose than what you would ever find and who didn't think young Lukas Haas was the cutest kid they ever saw on film?Harrison Ford gives a typical solid performance as John Book a Philadelphia detective who winds up protecting the young boy Samuel Lapp his mom McGillis as Rachel Lapp and others against crooked cops Hollywood's favorite kind.

	schema:headline " Though it obeys some of the Hollywood formulas Witness proves to be one of the most entertaining exciting thrillers of all time!";
	schema:reviewBody "I just recently watched this movie in my Development of Film class.  We're studying the Social Drama.  Last week we watched Fury with Spencer Tracy so this week we watched a contemporary film in the genre.  I have to give it up for Peter Weir!  He did a spectacular job!The premise is intriguing.  A young Amish boy goes to the bathroom in a train station and witnesses a bloody murder.  Enter Philadelphia cop John Book Harrison Ford.  Now we had several discussions about this film and I started to realize some flaws that didn't exactly come clear in my mind at the time.  First of all a little innocent Amish boy isn't going to witness something that grisly and recover that well.  Living in an Amish environment he probably doesn't even know the definition of the word violence.  So the boy wouldn't be able to return to his native environment and go on with his life like usual.  He'd keep having nightmares and flashbacks.  He'd be traumatized 'til the day he dies!  However I have to note Lukas Haas delivered a terrific performance.  I'm not sure how much appraise he got for this moderately thankless role.  For a boy of his age to take on a role like that I have to commend him.  Lukas in recent years has concentrated on more independent works like Boys with Wynona Ryder and the underrated johns with David Arquette in which he plays a gay prostitute.  He's still a fine actor and I'm impressed to see his advancement to more grownup roles but many probably forgot about him. So I think he should be remembered for that little role even to this day. But typical Hollywood Harrison Ford agrees to do a filmhe's the star!  And the whole subplot with the little boy gets pushed aside.  Now Harrison was terrific in this movieprobably why I wasn't bothered too much about him being the center of attentionand I think he's a very underrated actor sure he's widely known but recognize him more as a macho action hero than an actor but I think if Weir decided to expand that subplot it would've made a more interesting film.Kelly McGillis is convincing as the boy's Amish mother who gets swept away by Book.  Even as an Amish woman I think she looked beautiful.  I haven't exactly been traveling around Amish country but I don't know how often you would find an Amish woman that beautiful.  Plus that scene where she's spongebathing toplessWow!  That brings me to another point.  I like how Weir never actually decided to put a sex scene to demonstrate the relationship between her and Book.  In the aforementioned spongebathing scene there's a long period where they just stare at each other and there's absolutely no dialogue!  I found that very impressive.  It's a very erotic scene without them actually having to jump into bed together.  That's something you rarely see in the movies.  The sexual tension between the two characters is simply impressed by their mannerisms.  Danny Glover is convincingly frightening as the villain.  Also look for an early performance by Viggo Mortensen.  He doesn't have manyin fact I don't if he has anyspeaking parts but he's in quite a few scenes.There's a lot of good fishoutofwater comedy when the cityborn Book tries to learn the ways of the Amish.  I was cracking up when Harrison puts on the Amish garb with the bottom of his pants above his ankles.  That's a picture worth a thousand words.  Weir is fascinated by clashes in cultures and it's highly evident in many scenes from this movie.  Those scenes provide some good comic relief.  This may be considered typical Hollywood but I loved the scene where Harrison Ford gets out of the chariot now as one of the Amish to beat the crap out of one of the thugs who was giving them trouble. That was an awesome scene!  Weir also captures some beautiful sometimes breathtaking shots of the scenery.  The music is great too especially in the barnraising scene.  The ending is welldone and I liked how it wasn't one of those walkintothesunset conclusions.  I don't want to give anything away but that was one of the nontypical Hollywood elements of the film.Despite its nowdiscovered flaws I still love this movie and wouldn't mind watching it on many repeat viewings.  It's just a fascinating wonderfully made piece of cinema that will hold its place in the history of celluloid. I urge you to witness this triumphant work!My score  9 out of 10".

This perhaps reflects rather negatively on my filmbuff credentials but the film's opening act mounted the tension so brilliantly that it was a pity to see that suspense slowly dissipate into the background. Such an appeal however seems quite groundless where director Peter Weir is concerned given my previous experience with his work both in Australian cinema the classic war picture 'Gallipoli 1981' and following his move to Hollywood the uplifting 'Dead Poet's Society 1989' Weir has always favoured emotion and human interaction over the raw thrill of adrenalincharged action. Even as it stands 'Witness' deserves to be celebrated for its strong performances sensitive screenplay and thoughtful exploration of the contrast between the pacifism of the Amish people and the violence and corruption of 1980s mainstream America. The film was Weir's first in Hollywood after achieving great success with the Australian productions 'Gallipoli' and 'The Year of Living Dangerously 1982.'Following the death of her husband a grieving Amish woman Rachel Lapp Kelly McGillis takes her young son Samuel Lukas Haas into the city. It is Samuel's first major venture into the lifestyle shunned by his people and he is initially awed and excited by all the fresh sights and sounds presented to him. But it doesn't take long for the reality of modern society corrupted and poisoned by the stench of greed and violence to rear it's ugly head  in the bathroom of a railway station Samuel witnesses the brutal murder of a city detective and only he can identify the men responsible. A weary cop Det. Capt. John Book Harrison Ford employs the young boy's help in solving the case and when Samuel positively identifies a respected narcotics detective from his own department Book begins to understand that they've stumbled into something far deeper than anybody could ever have anticipated. Now with a price on his head Book falls into hiding with the reluctant Amish community and both parties come to learn a thing or two about the conflicting values of their respective worlds.Harrison Ford has rarely given a better performance. He's not an actor whom one would typically associate with having a lot of emotional range but John Book is an intriguinglysubtle character. Note most particularly the scene in which Book and Rachel dance in the barn to Sam Cooke's Wonderful World  throughout the entire sequence Book is continually pausing contemplating the physical contact that is seemingly obligatory in cinematic moments such as these and consistently deciding against it. Kelly McGillis is remarkably beautiful as the emotionallyconflicted widow all the more because her character actively attempts to repress any lingering streaks of eroticism and also thanks to her Amish attire which fortunately denied her one of those horrificallydated 1980s hairstyles  see 'Top Gun 1987'. A crucial benefit of the film's sobering middle act supplemented by the soft graceful cinematography of John Seale is that the audience gradually loses his desensitisation towards violence on film and so the story's brutal climax is a completely jarring shock to the nerves.".

	schema:reviewBody "Witness works on 3 levels  as a thriller  drama and romance. The thriller elements of the movie appear at the beginning and the ending of the movie while the middle of the film is basically a drama with a love story in it. It's an interesting combination and while it might not work for those who like pure thrillers or dramas it certainly worked for me. One has to remember that Witness is first a electrifying and poignant love story  then the thriller. A romantic thriller.It's a movie worth watching just for the fact that is first and one of the few films to focus on Amish culture. As a kid I would laugh at their philosophy of life . The more and more I'm getting older the more I'm thinking they are right. The Amish way of life has many virtues  they have a deep faith in God  pacifism  sense of community.Witness is a story about cultural clash between two completely different worlds. Both cultures are forced to come together. Each one had to search out the moralities prejudices and actions of the other. The film is thankfully devoid of easy moralizing.It's an interesting thing that Sylvester Stallone Rocky and Jack Nicholson One flew over the cuckoo nest were considered for the role of John Book . While I do believe that they would handle the role very well  I'm happy that Harrison Ford Raiders of the lost ark got the part in the end. Harrison Ford gives his finest performance in Witness  the only one which got him an Oscar nomination. Hord walks away from his hero persona Indiana Jones  Han Solo. His John Book isn't stereotypical cynical and strong cop. His tough enough to be convincing as a city cop  but it's more about his sense of duty and dignity. It's interesting how the film uses Ford's reallife carpenter's talent. Kelly McGillis Top gun also gives a great and underrated performance  the best in her career.

The say much more by the things they don't say for example the bating scene  the dance scene. The romantic plot reaches it's climax with one of the best onscreen kisses in the history of film. This briefscene is powerful  sincere and moving. The love story here is beautiful and tragic. Danny GloverLethal weapon does a nice job as the bad guy. Who could forget Lukas Haas Inception as the Amish kid. His cheerful  colorful face is something that can't go unseen. Watch out for Viggo Mortensen The Lord of the rings  trilogy in his debut as an Amish. Peter Weir gives a brilliant direction . This is a simple story wit heart . Every dramatic moment is powerful and every small scene is important. Weir isn't a actionthriller director  yet he gives us great Hitchcockian set pieces such as the scene in the toilet and the final confrontation in style of High noon silo death. The screenplay quite rightfully won the Oscar. The film's script by Earl W. Wallace William Kelley and Pamela Wallace has become a frequent model for budding screenwriters often used to display clear structure in a screenplay. It is a film about adults whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them just like it's a story about cops.The soundtrack by Maurice Jarre is good  but I think it would have sounded much better with real orchestra instead of synthesizer. John Searle's cinematography is gorgeous  the scene of raising the barn is cinematic lyricism.Highly recommended. I give it 810.".

	onyx:emotionText "Witness works on 3 levels  as a thriller  drama and romance. The thriller elements of the movie appear at the beginning and the ending of the movie while the middle of the film is basically a drama with a love story in it. It's an interesting combination and while it might not work for those who like pure thrillers or dramas it certainly worked for me. One has to remember that Witness is first a electrifying and poignant love story  then the thriller. A romantic thriller.It's a movie worth watching just for the fact that is first and one of the few films to focus on Amish culture. As a kid I would laugh at their philosophy of life . The more and more I'm getting older the more I'm thinking they are right. The Amish way of life has many virtues  they have a deep faith in God  pacifism  sense of community.Witness is a story about cultural clash between two completely different worlds. Both cultures are forced to come together. Each one had to search out the moralities prejudices and actions of the other. The film is thankfully devoid of easy moralizing.It's an interesting thing that Sylvester Stallone Rocky and Jack Nicholson One flew over the cuckoo nest were considered for the role of John Book . While I do believe that they would handle the role very well  I'm happy that Harrison Ford Raiders of the lost ark got the part in the end.

	schema:reviewBody "It is a film about adults whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them. The story focuses on a detective Harrison Ford protecting a young Amish boy who becomes the target of a ruthless killer after he witnesses a brutal murder. Witness is as much about the meeting of cultures as about cops and robbers this is one of those lucky movies which works out well on all counts and shows that there are still craftsmen lurking in Hollywood. The film is powerful assured full of beautiful imagery and devoid of easy moralising which is good. Ford is Chicago Detective John Book assigned to investigate a murder that was committed by crooked cop Danny Glover. The only witness is the son of an Amish widow played by Kelly McGillis. When Book gets too close to the truth the crooked cops try to kill him forcing Book to take it on the lamb and hide out in the Amish country. There he slowly makes a transition into their society their way of life and of course he starts to fall for Kelly McGillis. who would later star with pretty boy Cruise in Top Gun. Alexander Godunov who later played the murderous Karl in Die Hard makes his debut here as an Amish farmer who is Ford's romantic rival for Kelly. Also making his debut here is a much younger Viggo Mortensen as another Amish father. Mortensen's barely evident in the role out herealthough had his eventual success as Aragorn in Lord of the Rings ........ After Star Wars  Indiana JonesFord succeeded in a serious role and his multilayered performance earned him his only Oscar Nomination till date.Well directed Romantic Thriller by Peter Weir Director of Dead poet's Society and Truman Show that earned him his first Academy Award Nomination. Do watch this one for great Cinematography and ArtworkMy Rating  810".

	schema:reviewBody "After her husband's premature death a young Amish woman Rachel Lapp Kelley McGillis takes her son Samuel Lukas Haas on a train trip to Baltimore. While in the men's washroom at the Philadelphia station young Samuel witnesses a brutal murder. By his own wits he saves himself from the scary murderer McFee Danny Glover. Detective John Book Harrison Ford summoned to the murder scene perceives that the dead man is an undercover cop. He questions Rachel and Samuel. From a photograph Samuel fingers McFee among others a corrupt cop. McFee had stolen large quantities of a chemical substance used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The bad guys try to set up Book for a hit but fail although he is wounded by McFee. Now searched by the bad guys Book goes into hiding in Pennsylvania German Amish country Lancaster County PA to blend in with the religious sect.The middle part of the movie and by far the greater segment overall is the focus on the Amish community. This section is almost a documentary. We learn that the Amish shun the new ways and live much as they did in the eighteenth century. Unlike the nearby Mennonites the Amish reject automobiles electricity and telephones. Gas lamps are used. The Amish ride in traditional horse and buggy units while heavy traffic passes them by when they can. They wear plain clothes and use hooks and eyes rather than buttons or zippers which they consider proud and vain. There is a nice barnraising scene where the Amish people together erect a barn within one day for a newly married couple. We see how the tourists think about the Amish and Book's reaction to human pests. There is the obvious clash between the modern Bookurban and the olden Rachelrural ways. Nevertheless as Book outwardly becomes part of the Amish community Rachel and he begin to draw closer. The sponge bath scene is probably the most notable one in the movie. If John and Rachel decide to come together one of them will have to give up hisher ways for there is no middle ground. What will happen? Meanwhile three bad cops including corrupt Chief Schaeffer played by Josef Sommer and McFee track down their quarry and arrive in Amish country to do in Book. So the final scenario is the shootout between the good and the bad. What will the peaceful Amish people do? Perhaps not what you may expect! The acting is very good allaround. Harrison Ford may have given us his best performance here as a decent cop who does not overact although others may opt with justification for The Fugitive or the Indiana Jones series. Kelley McGillis makes a fine and dedicated Amish lady. Jan Rubes plays moral kingpin Eli Lapp while Danny Glover is indeed chilling as a bad cop. The subtleties  expressions of the actors work so well. For instance Lukas Haas's bewildered face when he spots McFee's photo in the police station speaks volumes. Of course the looks of Mc Gillis and Ford during the famous sponge bath scene do not require a word of dialog. See this movie more than once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Witness is a subtle thoughtful and intelligently directed film which is both a crime thriller and an extraordinary love story. A police investigation into a brutal murder provides this drama with its momentum and drive and a tragic romantic tale adds the intensity warmth and poignancy that elevates this movie to a higher level than that normally achieved by more routine thrillers. The story about two people from different backgrounds who fall in love but know that their love can't transcend their circumstances has a timeless and universal appeal which explains why this movie has retained its popularity so consistently since it was first released in 1985.When a recently widowed young Amish woman and her son are in a train station in Philadelphia the 8yearold boy witnesses the murder of an undercover cop. Detective Captain John Book Harrison Ford is put in charge of the investigation and questions Samuel Lapp Lukas Haas but even after showing him mug shots and arranging lineups of suspects the boy isn't able to finger the culprit. A little while later however Samuel is looking around the police office when he notices the killer's picture on a newspaper clipping that's pinned up inside a glass cabinet. When he brings this to Book's attention it's quite a shock because the man in the photograph is the highly decorated Detective Lieutenant McFee Danny Glover of the Narcotics Division.Detective Book tells his superior officer Detective Chief Schaeffer Josef Sommer about this development and Schaeffer asks him to keep the information confidential. Shortly after when he's shot at and injured by McFee it becomes obvious to Book that McFee and Schaeffer are both corrupt and Samuel and his mother Rachel Kelly McGillis are in mortal danger. In order to protect them Book drives them back to their Amish community but after his arrival there he collapses and has to remain with the Amish where Rachel gradually nurses him back to health.During Book's period of recuperation he and Rachel fall in love but he soon realises that neither of them could survive indefinitely in the other's world. Book adapts well to living with the Amish and earns their respect as he readily helps with milking cows and building a barn but his presence in their community places them in danger as becomes all too clear when the story reaches its actionpacked conclusion.Nonverbal communication is used frequently in this movie and provides the action with an extremely natural feel. A couple of the standout sequences are those in which Samuel looks at Book in a way that immediately signifies that he's seen something important when he sees McFee's photograph and another is when Book and Rachel dance together in a barn to Sam Cooke's What A Wonderful World. The power to convey their thoughts and feelings so clearly in this way is very touching at times and also testifies strongly to the quality of the acting.The differences between the worlds that Book and Rachel inhabit couldn't be greater as the Amish reside in rural surroundings and live a quiet nonviolent existence in which it's normal for everyone to help everyone else. These people embrace old fashioned values and don't use modern conveniences such as cars and refrigerators etc. By contrast Book's existence as a city cop is far less serene and regularly brings him into contact with violence corruption and various other forms of errant human behaviour.Witness with its interesting characters its absorbing story of murder corruption and doomed love and its marvellous acting performances is tremendously enjoyable to watch and leaves a lasting impression.".

I have spent tons of time in Philadelphia so seeing the Amish walking about especially at Reading Market downtown is believable these are generally the more liberalminded Amish. And a scene where a guy is brutally stabbed in a bathroom is very believable for Philly I've personally witnessed 6 or 7 only this year alone.

So what is Ford to do now that he realizes that he and the boy are both about to be killed to protect this criminal empire? Yep he and the kid and the hot mom head back to Lancaster Countyto the socalled 'Amish Country' to hide out among the good honest folk.The film gets kudos for very good acting a nicely relaxed film style and a great story with a very exciting ending.

The story involves a police captain named John Book. He obtains a child witness for the homicide of a police officer but then discovers that other officers were involved in the crime. After being attacked and suffering a bullet wound he flees into the countryside and submerges into the Amish community.Harrison Ford does a great job as John Book. He has a charismatic and likable personality that suits him perfectly for the role. The Amish characters all look very natural and authentic. I felt that the grandfather made an especially powerful character. The rival officers acted by Josef Sommer and Danny Glover take a back seat for most of the film but are solid characters as well.The cinematography of the film is excellent. An example of good filming easily comes to mind the segment where the Amish people construct a building. This part made me understand their ambitions. The steady camera pans of the countryside with a good musical score are also effective. It really felt like the images pulled me into their world.Witness succeeds where it matters in creating another world that we rarely imagine throughout our own lives and allowing us to experience this world as if we were part of it. The crime drama aspect took a back seat and served more as a contrast than anything else. A worthy view for audiences of any kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Witness' was Harrison Ford's first starring mainstream hit drama after the Star Wars trilogy two Indiana Jones flicks and of course 'Blade Runner.' It showed he could carry a conventional story in this case a cop thriller in an unusual setting outside the scifiaction genres and launched a movie career that by some accounts is the most successful ever. Samuel Lapp Lucas Haas a young Amish boy is on a rare trip to the big city Philadelphia with his mother Rachel Kelly McGillis. There he is the sole witness to a brutal murder and both he and Rachel are detained by police officer John Book Ford for questioning. This leads Book to uncover massive corruption in the police department and he himself is almost killed for discovering it which leads the three of them back to the Amish community where Book hides out while recovering from his gunshot wound and trying to figure out what to do next. Beyond the inspired novelty of having a crime thriller largely set among the Pennsylvania Amish 'Witness' is memorable for several noteworthy performances. Lucas Haas like Heather O'Rourke in 'Poltergeist' is one of those child actors who is almost too endearing for words not only angelfaced but a natural and believable performer. As Rachel Kelly McGillis has one of her best roles and gives it a multilayered interpretation. One can sense just below the surface a resentment in her at her lot in life as an Amish woman. Rachel dutifully goes through the motions required by her position but it is obvious she is forever wondering what it would be like to live in the outside world. Or in Book's case to bring him in to live in hers. And Harrison Ford gives another of those performances where you wonder where the actor ends and the character begins. Book and Rachel build up a subtle rapport where thoughts and feelings are simply understood rather than openly expressed. They even manage a lowkey teasing kind of backandforth not easy when they are under the constant scrutiny of the town elders and in fact just about all of the other Amish. 'Witness' provides a glimpse into Amish society that seems genuine and welldetailed. They are portrayed as industrious selfsacrificing extreme pacifists who live apart from the outside world the world of the 'English' as they call everyone else regardless of background. Along with these admirable qualities it is also suggested that they can be smallminded gossipy and somewhat smug and defensive about their beliefs and way of life. When one considers the cloistered confined life they lead this shouldn't be surprising one might compare the Amish village to any small American town where everyone knows everyone else and people are forever talking behind each other's back. An interesting subplot in all this is how the Amish's pacifism comes into play when faced with violence. It is obviously a deeplyheld belief that some will find admirable and others unfathomable. At one point Samuel's grandfather attempts to explain to him why they feel the way they do using Book's gun as a reference since it epitomizes the evil of taking another's life. The grandfather asks Samuel if he would kill anyone and the boy responds I would only kill the bad man. Then the old man asks how Samuel can know who is bad and who isn't. The boy responds I can see what they do. I have seen it. So the question that hangs in the air is does Samuel become corrupted from what he's seen or has he simply been exposed to the real world and become better able to deal with it even at his young age? It is a question that 'Witness' doesn't attempt to resolve and in this case the ambiguity adds depth to a very thoughtful and satisfying movie.".

Also you really cannot classify this as thriller for the entire film because the middle portion is a haunting study on a group of peaceful people living away from technology. Harrison Ford gets out of his action movies to have one of the best roles of his career playing John Book.Peter Weir's film is about a hardnosed detective named John Book who investigates a murder that a small Amish boy witnessed. Thanks to some betrayal John is forced to live with the Amish and away from being a cop he forbiddenly falls in love with Rachel a beautiful Amish woman.As mentioned before Harrison gives one of his better roles and is full of heartfelt emotion. Kelly McGillis in her second ever movie rises to great heights with her shy performance. I also find it ironic how Danny Glover plays a villain who murders cops right before his famed Lethal Weapon series.Overall Witness is a beautifully shot film that has some intense scenes especially in the beginning and the end. We get to meet a group of people that stay away from society. The music by Maurice Jarre is wonderful and fits well with the themes of the movie. I find it funny how an awardwinning thriller like this was released in February. I rate this film 910.".

This film is so much more than the crimelegal drama that I had imagined it to be.The directing cinematography screenplay and acting are all wonderfully executed. The contrast between the overt aggressive world of police and murder investigations in the city with the subdued understated world of the Amish is exceptionally well portrayed.Harrison Ford does a fine job in his role. The single most beautiful performance though is Kelly McGillis. As other reviews have noted she does not have an excess of spoken dialog but her physical acting in particular her eyes and face is incredibly evocative and moving. If anyone should have gotten a nomination it should have been her. Watching her play this role was a revelation to me. One also has to credit the great performance of the thenveryyoung Lukas Haas. His impressive turn may be as much a true key to this film's success as any other single element. The rest of the characters are wellcast themselves.I greatly admired the ending to this film. I think that it speaks to Peter Weir's directatorial sensibilities. In the hands of a lesser director it could have been far more clichd but far less powerful. I was nearly thirty years late seeing WITNESS but I think that it is a timelessly poignant example of excellent storytelling.".

They part company in a rather disgusted huff but he's soon visited by her three brothers low class members of a local crime family who inform him of her family lineage and forcibly encourage him to pursue the relationship with their sister...or else!Meanwhile the relationship proceed in fits and starts with neither Daesuh or Jinkyung aware of the behindthescenes machinations that are drawing them ever closer to true love.Highconcept if conventional story is somewhat undermined by an uninvolving sidestory detailing older brother Park Sangwook's attempts to woo a pretty schoolteacher as well as the increasingly ubiquitous need in Korean gangster comedies to have a nasty rival gang with which the good guys are forced to wage bloody baseballbatswinging war this time at a dance club and climactic family event. The situational humour shines through though particularly in a scene where Daesuh's parents meet their soontobe inlaws in another where Jinkyung confronts Daesuh's sneaky exgirlfriend and in various vignettes in which the three brothers go to great lengths to create ideal romantic situations to help further the relationship. Overall an enjoyably cute comedy with notunexpected sidesteps into moderate violence and an overly contrived climax but also an interesting take on the common Korean filmic theme of constructed relationships hardly surprising once supposes in a country where arranged marriages were for many years the normessentially this film and many like it simply dress up oldschool thinking in new clothing but with a winning winkwink sensibility. This was the top domestic movie of 2002. Beware the Hong Kong DVD release which deletes a substantial amount of footage. I give it a 7.".

They part company in a rather disgusted huff but he's soon visited by her three brothers low class members of a local crime family who inform him of her family lineage and forcibly encourage him to pursue the relationship with their sister...or else!Meanwhile the relationship proceed in fits and starts with neither Daesuh or Jinkyung aware of the behindthescenes machinations that are drawing them ever closer to true love.Highconcept if conventional story is somewhat undermined by an uninvolving sidestory detailing older brother Park Sangwook's attempts to woo a pretty schoolteacher as well as the increasingly ubiquitous need in Korean gangster comedies to have a nasty rival gang with which the good guys are forced to wage bloody baseballbatswinging war this time at a dance club and climactic family event. The situational humour shines through though particularly in a scene where Daesuh's parents meet their soontobe inlaws in another where Jinkyung confronts Daesuh's sneaky exgirlfriend and in various vignettes in which the three brothers go to great lengths to create ideal romantic situations to help further the relationship. Overall an enjoyably cute comedy with notunexpected sidesteps into moderate violence and an overly contrived climax but also an interesting take on the common Korean filmic theme of constructed relationships hardly surprising once supposes in a country where arranged marriages were for many years the normessentially this film and many like it simply dress up oldschool thinking in new clothing but with a winning winkwink sensibility. This was the top domestic movie of 2002. Beware the Hong Kong DVD release which deletes a substantial amount of footage. I give it a 7.";

Brian Thibodeau has a pretty good synapse of the story. Geek is forced to see more in a gangster princess. It's quite amusing and the language is a bit rough which I think adds to the humor of the situation Daesuh finds himself in.The side bit of the eldest mob brother is pretty ridiculous but without it the movie would lose a lot of appeal and we'd not get to know the characters as well. I absolutely love it. In my heart I want to give it a really high mark but I have to be realistic. Unlike western romantic comedies there are no public displays of affection and yet you still get so much out of the film. I'd say it's almost an 8 in my book.. but this is my favorite genre  upbeat with a bit of romance not too much thought involved for the viewer and the possibility of a happy ending ".

Upon discovering her new neighbor's dislike for food 301 makes it her mission to make 302 eat and enjoy her delectable meals. This leads to a very twisted relationship between the two women as well as an exploration into the nasty experiences that influenced their current relationships with food.This Korean film is a cinematic oddity that is definitely a unique viewing experience. It is filled with rather disgusting visuals of food preparation vegetarians this is a warning!. The closeups of people gorging on various food items are bound to make anyone squeamish. The DVD I saw was full screen and the transfer appeared poor but the cinematography is great with an excellent use of vivid colors. Also the inventive set design deserves praise as most of the film takes place either in 302 very sterile librarylike apartment or 301 very sleek and vibrant restaurantlike apartment with a futuristic looking kitchen. The two lead actresses give terrific performances and it is perverse fun watching them torment each other.The story moves at a slow pace but it works. There are various interesting flashbacks that are crucial to the plot but unlike other movies with stories that are not told chronologically this timeline is not difficult to follow. However what actually happens during one of the flashbacks was a bit confusing due to the way that particular scene was filmed. This scene seemed vital to the story so I think part of this movie was lost on me. One common theme in the movie is a link between sex and food that is not completely explored but still fascinating and provoking.301302 is an interesting and original but often confusing film that I would recommend to folks interested in Asian horror cinema beyond the current popular films.

A Fascinating twist though slightly predictable but then I grew up reading Alfred Hitchcock mystery magazines and Dahl's short stories. It was fascinating to see the way it is done.I loved the lighting and I loved the gross camera closeups of peoples faces and butts..added to the repulsiveness.. Also the fact that the movie just focused on 301302 and never really went outside much. Everything was shot indoorsexcept a few scenes ..but all you see through out are just man made creations not counting the food you never see any nature around..it is all concrete and steel... For the food also she always goes to a grocery store with the aisles and aisles of food. I thought it was dark reflection on the 'life' modern man leads. Also I think the director tries to make a statement on the paradigm in which the woman is a homemaker and has nothing to do after a while. There were times in the movie like when 302 is abused by her father or when 301 has sex with her husband that I was reminded of the way sex was portrayed in Die Blechtrommel The Tin Drum....as a disgusting and a compulsive act. In summary I would highly recommend this movie....This is not a flick to pass ur time...it is a very thoughtful movie.".

For the food also she always goes to a grocery store with the aisles and aisles of food. I thought it was dark reflection on the 'life' modern man leads. Also I think the director tries to make a statement on the paradigm in which the woman is a homemaker and has nothing to do after a while. There were times in the movie like when 302 is abused by her father or when 301 has sex with her husband that I was reminded of the way sex was portrayed in Die Blechtrommel The Tin Drum....as a disgusting and a compulsive act. In summary I would highly recommend this movie....This is not a flick to pass ur time...it is a very thoughtful movie.";

This feminine touch is also evident in 301302 which goes beyond the realms of being a simple film about food. The film features a very stark portrayal of serious problems faced by its female protagonists which include both emotional as well as sexual exploitation at the hands of family members. For a film with a lot of drama the pace of 301302 is fast as various stories are merged together to advance the overall pace of the film. The sight of gourmet food in this film might induce some viewers to value food as the most important pleasure in life. However after a careful examination of the lives led by two leading ladies there would be viewers who might be forced to change their overall perspective about food and life in general.

What comes before is an absorbing and totally unique character study of two lonely people who flirt with madness and oblivion.  The director subtly peels back layers of desperation and repression with the precision of a surgeon.  Gripping terrifying and totally utterly original.  SEE IT!!!".

Two seemingly different women are thrust together in an apartment complex the machinations of one to feed the other woman with her fetishistic recipes and the other woman's need to suppress all appetite and contact with the world are brought to a boil in a powerful and disturbing climax.  What comes before is an absorbing and totally unique character study of two lonely people who flirt with madness and oblivion.  The director subtly peels back layers of desperation and repression with the precision of a surgeon.  Gripping terrifying and totally utterly original.  SEE IT!!!";

It's about two people who shut themselves off from the world and accidentally live next door very Existential as the whole flick is. By focusing on and exaggerating our strangeness and how two people over the edge can complement each other it is about sex on a much more intense and original level than any movie I have seen.More than its content it is an amazing piece of strippeddown moviemaking that I can only compare to Nolan's Following for simplicity and lowbudgetness. I suggest my students see these two on that count alone how to do something unforgettable on no budget.If you watch it for gore and twists or FX you'll waste your time.

What I was looking for on here was something about the ending because I almost thought the director was suggesting a lil' more in the last few frames. 301 is eating the last meal turns to look at the frozen head of 302 302 is now a ghost image watching 301 sleep film ends. Another reviewer above stated why is 301 looking like 302 at the end and that's where the ending throws me off. It's suggested in 1 of the flasbacks that 301 was forced to prepare a lil' girl for consumption by her gleeful stepdad at the thought of his being able to eat the young lost girl. A better ending the original ending started me thinking about was that actually 302 ate 301 then moved into her apartment as she was wishing she could just disappear the whole film.

It isn't because it nauseated or haunted me it didn't but it did deal with things no human being NEEDS to think about or watch in a film! If you aren't into vomit and cannibalism STOP READING THIS REVIEW and for goodness sake DON'T WATCH THIS FILM! While technically well made the film is despite the weirdness pretty predictable once you begin watching. You kind of figured the ending before it is revealed. But once again I wonder WHY anyone would want to make such a film?! The lady in apartment 301 just moved in and she is recently divorced. The lady in 302 is excessively withdrawn and shy and seems to suffer from Agoraphobiabeing afraid of the world and instead stays in her apartment all the time. This is a problem because the lady in 301 wants to be friendly but no matter what she tries the lady in 302 keeps her distance.After a while Ms. 301 begins cooking and bringing dishes to Ms. 302. But 302 cannot stand the smell sight or taste of ANY food and throws up after Ms. 301 leaves the food. Every time Ms. 301 brings food Ms. 302 just pitches it all in the garbage. One day Ms. 302 is taking the trash out and Ms. 301 sees all the food she's worked so hard to make is being pitched. So naturally the lady from 301 goes nuts and begins abusing Ms. 302shoving her around and forcing her to eat the old festering food. It's almost like a food rape how 301 behaves towards 302.Ms. 302 later explains why she didn't eat the food though a series of flashbacks. It seems that 302 was raped as a teen repeatedly by her father how 301 guessed this earlier in the film is a total mystery. Analytic therapists would likely appreciate how Ms. 302 has not only developed an intense phobia about having sex but about having any object enter her body including food. How she survived so long makes little sense as she can't tolerate ANYTHING to eat. Ms. 301 feels bad and says she'll try making things that won't bother 302's stomach but no matter what she tries it all is vomited.Then through flashbacks we see 301's story. She was a very happy housewife who lived to cook keep house and make passionate love to her undeserving husband. Over time he became less and less attentive and ignored all the wonderful things she did for him. So in turn her meals became more and more spectacular as she was trying to win his love through food. This was to no avail plus since he was eating less and less she put on weight eating all the food she so painstakingly made.Eventually she catches him with a floozy. He denies it but she is enraged. To punish him she takes his favorite possession their cute little doggy and serves it to him in a meal! Even in Korea this is bound to cause marital problems and this is her not so subtle way of demanding a divorce! Well considering how violent and wacky Ms. 301 is it wasn't hard to assume that somewhere along the line she'd get around to cooking Ms. 302. 302 is amazed with 301's storyespecially since the dog apparently was very tasty. So she asks Ms. 301 to cook and eat herand Ms. 301 also being insane complies.The butchering and eating sequence of the film isn't nearly as disgusting as it might have been. However even if done tastefully get it? it is such a gross an unnecessary thing to put in a film. Sure there are sick !!! out there but do we need to make films about them? Or more importantly make judgmentneutral films about them?! So the cat's out of the bag so to speak. The film is about two totally insane women and the cannibalism that concludes the movie. If you are a sick and twisted freak then this film is for you. All others beware!!!A final note This movie reminds me of the Japanese director Miike's film THE AUDITION. It too was about a sick and disturbed woman who loves to cut people to pieces. It too is not worth seeing except by maniacs.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on a recent trip to Korea and was absolutely blown away! I'm still thinking about it and trying to get my hands on a copy. Seung Woo Cho's portrayal of an autistic boy whose mother encourages him to start running is brilliant and heartbreaking. The film accurately illustrates the social and private difficulties for people with autism and their families. Based on a true story you can't help but fall in love with this boy because he's so purehearted and misunderstood by everyone even his own family members. His mother even questions her feelings about him which is something rarely shown in films. Despite the odds he becomes a champion without meaning to or wanting to and by the end of the film you are in awe of what this person accomplished. Everyone should see this film and experience the joy and agony. Korean cinema has never been so poignant! Just a warningyou might want to keep a box of tissues beside you especially for the second half of the film. If you see one foreign film this year please make it this one!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very warm and poetic film. It's about a mother's relationship with her autistic son and her insecurities regarding him about his desire to run a marathon and how that relates to his relationship with his mother and about how his running coach inadvertently helps to bring them together. It is one of the most touching films I have seen in many years. Some people have compared it to Rain Man but that's a comparison which does not stand. Firstly the selfishness of Tom Cruise character and Dustin Hoffman's overacting make Rain Man a far less touching film because the characters are far less sympathetic. There is also the crucial difference in that in Rain Man the Tom Cruise character really had no interest in his autistic brother and did not wish to really have any type of relationship with him. In Marathon however the whole film is about the problems the mother has precisely because she wants to have a relationship with her son. It is this dilemma the wanting to have a relationship and not really being able to do it which makes the film so interesting and touching.Furthermore the acting is very good the cinematography is rich but not overdone the music is very good at emphasising the poignancy of particular situations and the film has a wonderful pace neither too fast nor too slow. All in all a very enjoyable film highly recommended for anyone who wants to smile laugh cry and generally feel happy.".

Alive and preferably dead or Sundance Cassidy and Butch the Kid is just a mildly amusing action comedy Western  about on the level of a lesser BambinoBud Spencer  TritinityTerence Hill movie . Giuliano Gemma is topnotch as a likable freewheeling rogue  meanwhile taking on an ominous villain  Chris Huerta . This is a nice and funny juvenile story for Giuliano Gemma fans  as he's delightful and attractive . It packs action  fistplay  slapdash  humor with tongueincheek and is quite bemusing .

This release Vivi or Preferibilmente Morti original title or Alive or preferably dead has some cool moments and a great number of hilarious scenes  adding a wonderful Sidney Rome as the kidnapped lady in mystery . The film isn't always good  sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions  it's frankly delicious . The movie displays innumerable laughs  jokes and slapstick .

It's a coproduction SpanishItalian and  of course  shot on location in Manzanares Del Real  La Pedriza  Colmenar Viejo and Madrid surroundings  that is well photographed in Eastmancolor by Manuel Rojas  though a perfect remastering is necessary because of the filmcopy is washedout . There are many fine technicians and professional assistant direction and decent production design by Antonio Corts  a magnificent scenario on the villages  ranch  an spectacular assault on a train and barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and fine sets . The musician Gianni Ferrio Spaghetti Western's usual composes an agreeable soundtrack and well conducted and splendid leitmotif  it's full of enjoyable sounds and lively score  including catching ballads . The motion picture written by Ennio Flaiano was middlingly directed by Duccio Tessari . This Italian writerfilmmaker Duccio Tessari so consistently mixed the good with the mediocre that it became quite impossible to know what to expect from him next .

	schema:headline " An amusing piffle";
	schema:reviewBody "The premise here is that two estranged brothers must spend six peaceful months together in order to inherit 300000 from a rich uncle. This premise however is merely an excuse to put the two brothers into a series of comic adventures in the American West  circa early 1900s. While none of these adventures is original or memorable they combine to produce an easygoing spaghetti western which never takes itself too seriously and which therefore qualifies as a pleasant timekiller. Incidentally the movie's Italian title translates as Alive or Preferably Dead. The American title shamelessly tries to capitalize on another film's success but it has nothing to do with the famous characters portrayed by Paul Newman and Robert Redford. This movie is helped by the fact that the two brothers and they actually look like brothers are played by such handsome and agreeable actors as Giuliano Gemma and Nino Benvenuti. Gemma billed as John Wade for American audiences got his start wearing nothing but a towel in 1959's BenHur when he appeared as one of the muscular Roman athletes who observe Messala placing a bet with the Shiek on the outcome of the chariot race. Benvenuti here billed as Robert Neuman first achieved fame as a boxer in Rome's 1960 Olympics. Despite being personable and goodlooking he only appeared in two movies. Not surprisingly opportunities are found to show off these hunks' physiques by stripping them to the waist. Gemma is shown sitting in a tub taking a bubble bath while Benvenuti sheds his shirt when he chops a load of firewood. Both men are also shirtless when they're tortured by the Bad Guys who apparently poke burning sticks into their chests. Alas both the American theatrical release and the videotape release drastically cut this torture scene. The two brothers are shown tied up and threatened but then the action jumps forward. The brothers now have burn marks on their chests but no torture was actually shown.Sydne Rome billed here as Karen Blake makes a spunky and appealing heroine but at the end of the movie one realizes she's just been added to the proceedings to persuade viewers that the two brothers  appearances to the contrary  are really straight.November 2007 update Having viewed a DVD of this movie under its Italian title some new comments are in order. This Italian version is longer and more detailed than the American version known as Sundance Cassidy and Butch the Kid. It contains the complete torture scene which turns out to be quite different than expected. The two brothers stripped to the waist are laid faceup on the floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The bad guy approaches with a smoldering stick taken from a nearby fireplace but does not as expected poke it into the brothers' chests. Instead he uses it to draw a smudgy line across the floor. Then he tells his gangmembers they can throw hot pennies at the brothers but they cannot step across the line. The gangmembers reach into the fireplace with their gloved hands scoop up hot coins and gleefully toss them at the brothers' bare chests. The brothers squirm and writhe trying to avoid the scorching missiles but some still hit their targets. Then a distraction occurs the brothers manage to free themselves with no more damage than a few burn marks on their chests. It's puzzling why the American prints cut most of this scene since it's not especially violent and is played more for comic than sadistic effect. The beginning of the movie also varies from the Italian to the Englishlanguage print. The Italian version begins with a scene back East in which Monty Mulligan leaves a Christmas party fights off four streetthugs intent on robbing him and then encounters four more men who demand that he repays his gambling debts. Monty's unable to do so but is saved by the arrival of a messenger from a lawyer's office. The scene then shifts to this office where the lawyer reads to Monty details of his uncle's will. At this point the movie switches to its Wild West setting which is where the Englishlanguage prints pick up the story.".

Duccio Tessari's Vivi O Preferiblmente Morti aka Sundance Cassidy And Butch The Kid of 1969 however is certainly the worst movie I've ever seen Gemma in an utterly silly slapstickSpaghetti Western that tries to imitate the style of satirical SWs starring Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill but fails. Although the movie is amusing in some parts and certainly not a total disaster it is just too silly and not as funny as it should be and Gemma is probably the only good reason to watch it.Two estranged brothers city gambler Monty Giuliano Gemma and Wild West farmer Ted Mulligan Nino Benvenutti inherit 300.000 Dollars from their late uncle on condition that they endure to live together for six months. The two start a fight over everything and trouble begins as soon as Monty arrives in Ted's hometown...Besides Gemma the only other Spaghetti Western regular appearing in Sundance Cassidy... are Antonio Casas who should be known to lovers of the Italian Western for his appearances in The Good The Bad And The Ugly The Big Gundown Face To Face Price Of Power A Pistol For Ringo and others and Cris Huerta Navajo Joe They Call Him Holy Ghost Cemetary Without Crosses who plays the obese leader of an outlaw gang. Apart from Gemma and Casas and one kinda funny recurring gag the movie has little to offer except for very flat gags. Beautiful Sydne Rome has a supporting role but that doesn't turn the movie into a highlight either.All things considered Vivi O Preferiblmente Morti is kinda funny in some scenes and an acceptable time waster if you're looking for featherbrained entertainment but the only people I would really recommend it to are hardcorefans of Giuliano Gemma. Others watch Bud Spencer and Terence Hill flicks instead. 410".

This film Sundance and the Kid is just plain awful in everything from the acting to the screenplay. This turkey was cranked out to compete with the more original Spaghetti Western comedies with Italian actors Bud Spencer and Terence Hill such as Boot Hill They Call Me Trinity Trinity is Still My Name..etc. and also perhaps to certain extent the quality U.S. film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid with Robert Redford and Paul Newman which is recommended if you want to see a quality made comedywestern.Ironically in my opinion Italian directors made the very best westerns and the very worst westerns. On most all these Spaghetti WesternComedies everything from the title of the movie to the names of the Italian actors directors and sometimes even the production crew would change their names to American names and add awful English dubbing all designed to sound more American so it would sell better.

This is even more disappointing as it was directed by Duccio Tessari of Tony Arzenta fame and it stars Guilliano Gemma of loads of great films fame. Sometimes these tongueincheek comedies work like Run Man Run and Fistful of Lead but most seem to rely on lame slapstick that you've seen Charlie Chaplin do several hundred years previously. This one involves two brothers who hate each other but who also have to spend six months living together in order to receive an inheritance from a dead Uncle. Don't ask me why. There's a bunch of bad guys who are harassing Gemma's brother who periodically turn up throughout the film to ruin Gemma's increasingly dumb attempts at crime sprees including robbing a bank where everyone who enters the bank trips over the same stephmm.Gemma does get to show off his trapeze skills and there's an axe fight on a train that results in an entire carriage being destroyed but no one in their right mind is ever going to want to watch this unless they are obsessively watching their entire collections of Italian films. Ahem.Other comedies not being reviewed any time soon My Name is Trinity My Name is Nobody Cry! Onion Life is Tough Eh Providence Trinity is Still My Name etc etc.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not all of the slapstick works but there are more hits than misses. Frankly I think the humor and production values are better here than all but the first of Trinity westerncomedies. The English dubbing is not awful as one reviewer stated. It's actually better than in many spaghetti Westerns. I liked the attention to detail in the depiction of even minor characters like the bank employees  dishonest doctor who encases one brother in a total body cast. While I agree the American distributors were guilty of giving this film an terrible let's cash on on a better movie title I don't think seeing the prelude would have added much.The picture already seems a bit too long with a throw in the kitchen sink approach to the screen writing Then's let's have them try this and fail an then this... when a plot more focused on one or two criminal acts might have been better. I also watched this as part of the Mill Creek 20 pack mostly to get Monte Hellman's China 9 Liberty 32 and The Big Gundown I have only found one so far that was truly unwatchable Apache Blood. My main complaint is being deprived in most cases of seeing the films in the original Techniscope widescreen process similar to Superscope but invented at Technicolor's Italian lab which through setting the number of frames per inch of film higher in the camera used only half as much film as Cinemascope or Panavision did. Some complained they could see more grain in the projected image in theaters but in many cases that worked to the film's advantage contributing to a gritty washed out look. As with Superscope now called Super 35 the anamorphic squeeze was done in the lab on an optical printer enabling the directors to use normal rather than expensive anamorphic lenses in shooting these movies. Unlike Techniscope Superscope used a normal frame in the camera so did not save any film stock. The price of film stock was a large part of the cost of making feature movies back then. Now with digital video it's not an issue.".

While I agree the American distributors were guilty of giving this film an terrible let's cash on on a better movie title I don't think seeing the prelude would have added much.The picture already seems a bit too long with a throw in the kitchen sink approach to the screen writing Then's let's have them try this and fail an then this... when a plot more focused on one or two criminal acts might have been better. I also watched this as part of the Mill Creek 20 pack mostly to get Monte Hellman's China 9 Liberty 32 and The Big Gundown I have only found one so far that was truly unwatchable Apache Blood. My main complaint is being deprived in most cases of seeing the films in the original Techniscope widescreen process similar to Superscope but invented at Technicolor's Italian lab which through setting the number of frames per inch of film higher in the camera used only half as much film as Cinemascope or Panavision did. Some complained they could see more grain in the projected image in theaters but in many cases that worked to the film's advantage contributing to a gritty washed out look. As with Superscope now called Super 35 the anamorphic squeeze was done in the lab on an optical printer enabling the directors to use normal rather than expensive anamorphic lenses in shooting these movies. Unlike Techniscope Superscope used a normal frame in the camera so did not save any film stock. The price of film stock was a large part of the cost of making feature movies back then. Now with digital video it's not an issue.";

Memories of Murder isn't a fastpaced film by any means but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95 of its American counterparts.Essentially Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements yes in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny. Kangho Song and Sangkyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended.".

This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American bigcity setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally the character development The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kickboxes suspects into submission the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his offthecuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headlinestarved reporters at bay the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details and this film like all the great ones revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies.

	schema:headline " A Masterpiece that you cannot miss";
	schema:reviewBody "Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.I do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong JoonHo avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.The film begins with the first body discovered a woman strangled with her own stockings raped tightly bound and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park DuMan Song KangHo and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth that the entire local police force in fact are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you'd call a systematic investigator scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo YongGu.Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo TaeYun Kim SangKyung a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park  methodical and rational  and it takes mere moments for the two to clash clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.As the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his 'keen eye' suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong JoonHo. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve the quick hit in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn't just asking how this could happen how someone could be as evil as this killer but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in 2.0 stereo and an English dub in both 2.0 and 5.1. The English subtitles are solid clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.Memories of Murder is a minor masterpiece a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea's Alist of directing talent. It is richly detailed beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time. Don't miss it.".

A perfectly made detective film based on a real shocking murder case in S.Korea in 80's. This is a must see Korean film for everybody and this must be a real pearl for those who love detective stories because perhaps it's the best detective film ever...I give it a 1010 this film is worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since a synopsis would be redundant here I'll confine myself to praise alone.Each positive comment that precedes this is accurate. I watched this movie yesterday. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Everything taking place on screen was riveting from the simple act of walking down a dark lonely road in the rain to a wild chase by three desperate detectives. This movie held me in thrall.As a new viewer of Asian movies I try to analyze the reason I tend not to be interested in western works any longer. I finally came to the conclusion that it has to do with the accessibility of the players. They seem to be people first actors by choice and stars by the public making them so.In Memories of Murder I saw this human factor almost too painfully. By the end of the story I was in tears. Even now the mood prevails. It's been so long since these crimes took place and I don't know absolutely that they remain unsolved but I think it's the case and I think about that and how frustrating it still must be to those who worked on the case.The actors have become the people in my mind and the horrible sense of defeat that becomes palpable eventually is heartbreaking. When one relates to the inroads made on the health mental and physical of the detectives who are ultimately portrayed as tireless and completely dedicated to the case you realize that you've watched something that is historic. You have seen the probable truth.The way this movie draws you into it so that you are walking through dangerous rain with a warning shout in your throat points to the brilliance of the director and the players.It is difficult to say I love this movie just as it is hard to say I love Silence of the Lambs because love is a peculiar word to use for such fare.But yes I love it for the fact that during it I was in a small village in South Korea in a terrible era of sirens blaring military dictatorship and the hopeless pursuit of a serial killer. I landed back here in this time and place with a thud only after turning off the DVD player and going to the kitchen for a glass of water. While I was caught there mentallyI felt the desperation and I felt the defeat and the sorrow of the detectives who were essentially decent enough human beings when all was said and done.There are not many movies that can timetravel you into their present. This will do it.I most seriously recommend that you view the interviews with the director and the stars all of them are stars of a special kind in my mind in order to dispel some of the hold the story will have on you.These are incredibly interesting people and it's a sheer joy to see them smiling and peaceful. They're intelligent educated and articulate. The younger members of the cast the less seasoned are so beautiful in their desire to do it right.They definitely did it right. They were wonderful and they thanked the interviewer. How lovely that was to see.I watched the movie using the English subtitles rather than the English dubbing because I wanted the authenticity. The subtitles were very good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joonho Bong directs Memories of Murder. A police procedural the film's first act flows along conventional lines. Here a murder takes place and detective Park DooMan is assigned to the case. He's a hotshot cop hardworking and determined who thinks he can spot a criminal simply by looking into their eyes. Joonho Bong however repeatedly questions Park's abilities. Early in the film for example Park's commander points at two men at the far side of a room and asks Park to pick out the criminal. Park looks deeply into each man's eyes but before he gives his answer the director cuts to black. We assume that Park has picked the right guy.But 20 minutes into the film and our faith in Park begins to crumble. Indeed he begins to come across as a bit of an idiot. He's deeply superstitious relies on fortune tellers believes in hunches and is highly insecure.At this point the film introduces another detective. His name is Sae Yoon and he's been assigned to help Park on his case. The film's second act is thus a repetition of the first act Sae Yoon reenacting all the scenes that we just witnessed Park do. The way Park handles the film's first crime scene is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles the film's second crime scene. The way Park handles an interrogation is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles an interrogation. In seeing how a methodical clever and genuinely skilled detective like Sae Yoon handles his job the audience is forced to reconsider their views of Park. Maybe Park wasn't a hotshot cop after all. The juxtaposition between the way the two men handle the film's first two murders forces us to reevaluate our perceptions.This notion of reassessing what our eyes see is constant throughout the film. A mentally ill kid seems like a likely suspect but is actually not. A local pervert seems like the killer but is actually a caring husband. An effeminate loner may be the rapist but DNA samples prove otherwise. Detective Sae Yoon himself a by the books cop eventually becomes a violent loose cannon determined to throw away rules and regulations based on a hunch whilst Park the very cop who consults shamans and witch doctors and stages false confessions becomes the film's voice of lawabiding righteousness.And so it is the way the film's characters are constantly in a state of moral flux that makes Memories of Murder so exciting. The audience is constantly asked to look the characters in the eyes and reassess what they're seeing.But what makes the film great is its ending. If surface perceptions are inadequate then how can we truly understand another human being? If personal emotions get in the way of objective truth how can we ever trust our own acuity? And so because the criminal is never identified or caught suddenly everyone is guilty. There can be no closure because everyone police included is implicated. Watch how the director contrasts the film's first shot the innocence of a child's face with the film's final shot the retired face of detective Frank staring down the camera and directly at the audience. Frank's catch phrase look into my eyes now takes on a whole new level of meaning. He's a cop again and everyone including we the audience are now under suspicion. And so while most serial killer films end with closure or in the case of the recent Zodiac with the comfortable knowledge that our killer is now old and largely impotent Memories of Murder leaves us on a note of profound paranoia. We're left uncomfortable disturbed and everyone now seems a potential suspect. 8.510  Though it isn't brave enough to stray far from genre conventions this is a stylish engrossing film. Worth two viewings.".

I got the DVD of the movie instantly and saw it the very next day I saw Zodiac and the outcome? I have then decided that no other crimedetective movie can be as goo as this South Korean masterpiece. It is power packed Two and half hour movie with equal amounts of action and emotion.Set in the times of mid 80's the period in which the military rule imposed strict rules on the civilians a serial killer raped women and killed them. The movie follows the investigation sequences of the village policeman with the help of the police officer from Seoul. The story deepens as it goes ahead revealing a whole lot of sub plots each one telling the complexity of team work and human nature. The last scenes of the movie can set your tear glands to work.The last scene of the movie needs a special mention in which Inspector Park comes to the scene of crime after a long time and a girl approaches him and asks him what he is looking for. And she then tell that a man had been there at that place earlier before suggestively the Murderer. Inspector Park asks the kid how he looked like and the girl replies He looked Normal saying that she goes away and Inspector Park looks at the camera indicating that the killer might be one of the audience watching the movie. This scene by far is the best one I have ever seen on celluloid so far. Kudos to the director Bong Joon Ho for making a crime master piece.Note Please do not watch this movie if you do not have respect towards cinema made in other languages and also towards other countries culture and also this movie is not for people who always want a villain in the end!. Saying that I conclude saying one of the best two and a half hours you can ever spend your life is watching this movie!Cheers!".

	schema:headline " A Gritty Murder Mystery with Political and Social Overtones";
	schema:reviewBody "Memories of Murder Salinui chueok is an involving crosscultural take on the L.A. Confidential noir genre of a murder mystery with a political filter layered with elements that gritty British TV detectives have mastered from Prime Suspect on.While cowriterdirector Joonho Bong uses the conventions of the contrasting buddy cop movie sometimes simplistically for comic effect he has more social commentary on his mind than a captivating investigation into a serial killer and avoids the usual titillating gore fest.Set specifically in 1986 the film visually captures the changes in industrializing modernizing and politically restive South Korea where new dark noisy factories were sprouting up in the middle of agricultural areas. From the opening shot that could be out of Witness we see a peasant bring what looks like a city sophisticated cop to a crime scene.But that's just the start of the conflicting comparisons. We've seen enough CSIs to sympathize with him immediately as he hopelessly tries to secure the crime scene for clues despite a Keystone Copsincompetent forensics and investigative team who keep sliding into the irrigation ditch. But he starts to seem a bit of a buffoon to us as he gives more credence to gossipy tips from his girlfriend than clues from the scene and he manufactures evidence. Our sympathies are curdled even more as we see him conduct an oldfashioned coercive interrogation of a developmentally disabled suspect  and he's the good cop. Even without knowing anything about Korean law it certainly looks like they are compromising the investigation as his thug partner who is nowhere as complex as Russell Crowe's Bud White gets as out of control as a cartoonish Lethal Weapon cop and that cop never grows and develops in the story beyond being a brutality enforcer so becomes a pathetic comic figure.

	onyx:emotionText "Memories of Murder Salinui chueok is an involving crosscultural take on the L.A. Confidential noir genre of a murder mystery with a political filter layered with elements that gritty British TV detectives have mastered from Prime Suspect on.While cowriterdirector Joonho Bong uses the conventions of the contrasting buddy cop movie sometimes simplistically for comic effect he has more social commentary on his mind than a captivating investigation into a serial killer and avoids the usual titillating gore fest.Set specifically in 1986 the film visually captures the changes in industrializing modernizing and politically restive South Korea where new dark noisy factories were sprouting up in the middle of agricultural areas. From the opening shot that could be out of Witness we see a peasant bring what looks like a city sophisticated cop to a crime scene.But that's just the start of the conflicting comparisons. We've seen enough CSIs to sympathize with him immediately as he hopelessly tries to secure the crime scene for clues despite a Keystone Copsincompetent forensics and investigative team who keep sliding into the irrigation ditch. But he starts to seem a bit of a buffoon to us as he gives more credence to gossipy tips from his girlfriend than clues from the scene and he manufactures evidence. Our sympathies are curdled even more as we see him conduct an oldfashioned coercive interrogation of a developmentally disabled suspect  and he's the good cop. Even without knowing anything about Korean law it certainly looks like they are compromising the investigation as his thug partner who is nowhere as complex as Russell Crowe's Bud White gets as out of control as a cartoonish Lethal Weapon cop and that cop never grows and develops in the story beyond being a brutality enforcer so becomes a pathetic comic figure. Their complicit boss just seems ineffectual as he's clearly over his head with this kind of murder investigation.But through the background TV broadcasts of demonstrations and civil defense alerts and drills we gather that their interrogation procedures were more developed through oppressing political dissidents and forcing confessions than professional criminal detective work. Ironically they ultimately can't get the resources they need in this difficult case because of these politicallydrummed up timeconsumers especially for manpower and sophisticated forensic tools that they have to beg from the FBI.The film changes tone and settles down into an intellectual thriller as a classic big city detective is sent from Seoul and we have some of the interchanges we've seen in In the Heat of the Night and in Insomnia as the first cop now seems even more of a simpleton in his standard operating procedures of relying on his knowledge of the locals and instincts about human nature though even a fellow officer teases him about whether he can tell apart a rapist and victim's brother while the city guy is looking and listening for clues and real evidence like a Korean Dalziel and Pascoe.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen a lot of good films this year I picked this up after watching Thirst and wanting to see more of Song Kang Ho remembering him being great in the Host. However I was blown away by the fact that I never found this film earlier and while Song is excellent in it the film and nearly everything about it is flawless in execution. The story about a detective in a small countryside town who finds a serial killer yet it's the incompetencies of the police force in general and human error which leads more and more murders. As the murders continue they find themselves powerless to use whatever clues they have to find the murderer. I'll leave it at that in terms of plot as it the film beautifully pulls you in until it's frustratingly simple conclusion. The cinematography is outstanding with a haunting score worthy of the film's amazing direction. I simply cannot find the words to describe how great this film is. I rarely watch films twice and never watched a film again without getting bored. On repeated viewings you begin to appreciate the little scenes the director has put in and i didn't pick up one of the running gags until the third time though they add little to the plot but are enjoyable and fascinating as the director chooses to move at his own pace. While not perfect the quality of the film brings the smallest niggles to light and while there are only a few this film does not get the recognition it deserves in the west yet at the same time it's like a little secret that is appreciated by those who are lucky enough to find it. As with any murder and mystery you'll be looking for clues even on multiple viewings but at best you'll be grasping at straws and jumping to conclusions until the frustratingly simple ending".

	schema:reviewBody "There are only a handful of serial killer films that actually work and with the Koreanbased Memories of Murder it's evident that director Joonho Bong has done his homework.Successful examples include Seven and Silence of the Lambs a pair of films that expose their audience to grisly and suspenseful sights but all the while creating vivid characters and memorable stories. Other films like Fallen and The Bone Collector do not. What makes Memories as unforgettable and dynamic as say M is that the actors of this film are realistic the story is believable and the climax is original. You feel the apprehension of the characters you struggle to understand the killer's motives and you grimace at the way his victims are taken. Getting under your skin is what serial killer films are all about and this is no exception.In South Korea in 1986 a naked woman is found bound and gagged in a drainage ditch in a field and a pair of detectives and a special agent from Seoul has been assigned to find the murdererrapist. Their efforts are numerous in trying to track down the killer not taking anything for granted they even attempt to find clues through the help of a fortune teller and by even giving merit to the possibility that the killer may shave his pubic hair. Their crime scenes are routinely disturbed by locales key pieces of evidence are run over by tractors their forensic team is always a noshow and their only help at solving the crime thus far is a handicapped boy who may or may not be the killer. Yet with the boy in custody and the murders continuing a serial killer is indeed on the loose.The film has numerous touches of comedy that arguably helps the film numb down its depressing nature many of these comedic touches involve one of the detective's constantly jumpkicking witnesses and suspects. The detective so habitually beats any and all suspects that he made a custom bootie as to assure that his kicks won't leave any scratches. The way the film handles the humor is quite ingenious though simultaneously showing the downfall and wrongs of police justice the fallibility of investigative methods and how a homicide system works without the prevalence of DNA tests. The musical score is terrific and adds tension to every scene the camera work is topnotch and South Korea's fields and forests remain a visually scenic and eerily set landscape. The acting is genuine by everyone involved especially from Kangho Song the lead detective who sees the wrongs of the system but can only stand by and watch. The director does a fantastic job creating the mood and like all atmospheric thrillers the film is almost consistently covered with rainshadow. His uncanny ability to create suspense when nothing is visibly threatening also earns the director much praise and he makes the viewer see what the killer sees with expert detail. As the murderer lurks behind trees hides behind field stocks and picks his prey so do you and it works wonderfully. Based on the first recorded serial killer in Korean history Memories of Murder is a film not easily forgotten. With memorable visuals a haunting score and quite hilariously brutal police work the film adds realism to a very mature subject matter and succeeds brilliantly. The film was released in 2004 in limited release and most video stores do not carry it. You can get it off Netflix or any online store that sells dvds.".

The city and rural cops have to cooperate increasingly to try to capture the murderer. But the teaser as all unsolved murders remains. The witnesses are unable to help confessions are worthless and the killer runs free. The film evolves into a serious masterpiece as Park matures throughout the movie from using police brutality to dealing with the press and proper evidence. As the end the film shows a more mature Park with a family maybe moving on...but not quite he is still haunted by memories of a murder.Acting and cinematography are outstanding. It's a nice cultural peek into a rural Korea with unadorned eateries schools with outhouses and brokendown police cars.

The two local detectives quickly grab up a mentally challenged kid from the village. It was known that the lad liked the one victim.The two detectives administer some rather forceful third degree to the lad. They then get the lad to record a scripted confession. The case is solved and the two are local heroes.That is till a detective sent from Seoul arrives. This detective goes over everything and realizes the boy is not guilty. The boy is released and the local cops are less than amused with the new cop on the block.The new guy quickly shows his stuff though by going over the evidence and finding more victims. The local boys again grab up the first suspect for some country justice. Of course they are a bit too quick off the mark and this man is also innocent. The pace picks up steam as more women are added to the victim list. A woman cop helps out by pointing out all the murders happen on rainy nights and when a certain song on the radio is played that same night.The net is thrown wider and a girl who survived an attack is located. Off her somewhat cloudy description a new suspect is rounded up. This time the locals do not resort to the in your face interview tactics. They do not want anything that could foul up the court case. The man though does not break and is set free. The police do however have people tail the suspect.There is a mixup with the assignments and the tail is lost. Another dead girl is the result. On this victim there is a small bit of DNA evidence not ruined by the rain. This is sent off to the States for the FBI to examine.The evidence comes back as inconclusive. The Seoul detective knows they have the right man no matter what the evidence says. Now he goes off the dead end he intends to kill the suspect. Does he? Not saying.".

The boy is released and the local cops are less than amused with the new cop on the block.The new guy quickly shows his stuff though by going over the evidence and finding more victims. The local boys again grab up the first suspect for some country justice. Of course they are a bit too quick off the mark and this man is also innocent. The pace picks up steam as more women are added to the victim list. A woman cop helps out by pointing out all the murders happen on rainy nights and when a certain song on the radio is played that same night.The net is thrown wider and a girl who survived an attack is located. Off her somewhat cloudy description a new suspect is rounded up. This time the locals do not resort to the in your face interview tactics. They do not want anything that could foul up the court case. The man though does not break and is set free. The police do however have people tail the suspect.There is a mixup with the assignments and the tail is lost. Another dead girl is the result. On this victim there is a small bit of DNA evidence not ruined by the rain. This is sent off to the States for the FBI to examine.The evidence comes back as inconclusive. The Seoul detective knows they have the right man no matter what the evidence says. Now he goes off the dead end he intends to kill the suspect. Does he? Not saying.";

	schema:reviewBody "Memories Of Murder is a highly entertaining well grafted and nigh on perfectly designed piece of cinema about the real life killings of local village girls during the 1980s in South Korea. Memories sets out to make a serious film and not trivialise these events which it does in a very simple manner coupled with exceptional cinematography and highly idiosyncratic characters whose introductions never over shadow the films events.Memories Of Murder has its own agenda on commentating on these events making it quite clear that the social situation created in Korea at the time meant the government was too busy suppressing its own citizens to put resources into a proper investigation. And it is that which is the overriding theme throughout. There is a sense when you watch this film that the operation was completely botched. Not only did the police forces lack the necessary forces to cope with such a killer but also that the police were more concerned with finding a 'scapegoat' as is seen in the interrogation sequences. They adopted a 'any face will do' motif and they lost not only valuable time but face with the public.Memories is marked by a trio of outstanding performances by Song Kang Ho Kim Sang Kyung and Park HaeIl who each bring something unique to this creation. Their rivalry and own internal issues mean they clash with each other and must look deep within themselves for answers while yet never distracting from the film. KangHo Song provides the most intriguing of all the three detectives. At the start of the film we see he has no actual intent in catching the killer and a forced confession is enough for him to sleep easy at night as long as he thinks he's right. However he has a gift for being able to deduce whether people are telling the truth or not by looking into their eyes. The legitimacy of this 'gift' however is questioned throughout the course of the films duration even by his own family which is well done in keeping the audience hooked as we want to believe in him but don't know if we should. Detective Seo TaeYoon played by Sangkyung Kim is the enforcer of the trio a high flying heavy boot wearing hot headed time bomb. His deep seated anger issues and a a somewhat noticeable lack of refined sensibilities in policing enquiries hamper a man who in the end wishes to do good and we can still sympathise if not empathise. Roeha Kim as Detective Cho Yongkoo is the most gripping of the three as his transformation throughout the film as he delves deeper into the depraved mind of a sadistic serial killer begins to haunt him more than it does the other two. Having been sent in from Soeul he is charged with responsibility of finding this man and the toll it takes on him as a human being is remarkable. There are obviously more issues to discuss about how good this film is but the acting speaks for itself and is truly the driving force of this film and 'will' keep you watching.Memories is a wonderful film which is by no means perfect but its fusion of serial killer thriller will drama and black humour gives this all too familiar genre a refreshing new twist if Zodiac were any good this is the type of film it would be like and is more often than not provocative. It's nail biting tension provides the audience with moral qualms throughout questions over our honour our integrity and our principles. The notion of What Is Justice? rings out loud and inevitably there are only answers to be found within yourself. While some may find the ending forced I found it pleasant within the context of the film as it served its purpose to highlight the damage done to our three protagonists. Memories is a must watch film if you are a fan of Korean cinema or the genre but more importantly this is a really good film that anyone interested in film from anywhere should view and enjoy. This is one you 'will' remember.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on an actual series of murders in South Korea between the years 1986 and 1991 Bong Joonho's Memories of Murder is a well performed thoughtprovoking film about the investigation into Korea's first serial killings. The film which combines bleak reality with dark comedy is less about the actual crimes than about the emotional toll it took on the police officers investigating the case.The film opens in 1986 when South Korea was still under the control of a repressive military dictatorship. A woman's body is found in Gyunggi province in a drainage pipe in a rural area outside of Seoul raped and strangled by her own stockings. The crime scene is chaotic. Reporters and spectators mill about and a tractor rides over the area destroying footprints and other potential evidence. Local police officers Park Dooman Song Kangho and his aggressive partner Cho Yongku Kim Roeha are in charge of the investigation but are joined later by a volunteer from Seoul detective Seo Taeyoon Kim Sangkyung.The police however are preoccupied with protest demonstrations against the government and do not put the necessary manpower and resources into a proper investigation. A rivalry soon develops between the intuitive Park and the cerebral Seo. Park claims that he can detect a killer by simply looking into a suspect's eyes. Seo is more rational and scientific but both overlook crucial evidence and both do not hesitate to brutalize suspects. Although they force confessions from Baek Kwangho Park Noshik a retarded man and a man who masturbates at the crime scene they know that the confessions will not stand up in court. Showing signs of desperation they torture an eyewitness to the murders to the point where he tries to escape and is run over by a passing train.Eventually the detectives locate a suspect who admits that he requested a song heard on the radio each night a murder has been committed but not a shred of evidence is ever found. After they beat him he tells the police People know you torture innocent people.... You'll never victimize me. Memories of Murder presents a powerfully haunting picture of a society so inured to violence and repression that a serial killer is a minor annoyance. As more strangled women are found a sense of sadness and frustration begins to settle on the investigation and it becomes obvious that the police force is not prepared either by education or methodology to achieve results until the society it operates in can be purged of its authoritarian past.".

The first halfhour to hour is blackly comic slightly farcical forensic evidence destroyed by incompetence but for me the film's greatness is when its tone changes  and the borders between the two leading detectives Park  Suh become blurred until Suh breaks down.

	schema:headline " Great Entertainment With Brilliant Moments from Bong Jun Ho";
	schema:reviewBody "The Host is a film that people have been talking about a lot during its production and the teasers and posters I'd seen to date had gotten me pretty interested. So when it was announced for the Edinburgh International Film Festival this year I had to go and see it.I have to say I was more than impressed with what I saw. The Host is a film that provides something of everything from suspense to terror from drama to a little touch of comedy this film has it all. What's more surprising is that it delivers all of them very well and provides great entertainment on the way.The opening of the film is perhaps one of the strongest I've seen. Starting with introductions to some of the main characters we instantly get a feel for who they are and what they are about all the time with a healthy amount of humour. The first appearance of the creature is viewed quite satirically or rather the peoples attitude and car crash mentality is.Then when it races through a busy park attacking people it's probably the best portrayal of group blind panic I've seen and coupled with some excellent edge of your seat and distressing scenes. The shot of the girl standing in shock is one of the most disturbing scenes you'll witness it's not something you'd expect to happen in a typical film and it's indicative of scenes to come.Throughout the film you'll be toyed with there are the usual straightforward scares and one so effective I leapt out of my seat. There are also moments like the opening one at the park where the unexpected happens and you really do get a surprise at the direction the story has just taken.There are other similar incredibly strong moments that will hit you with a shock and they seem out of place and going against what you believe should be happening. I felt myself looking at the screen in surprise thinking That's not fair! and that's a great response to illicit.The frequent humour is an aspect of the story that is really well handled it never detracts from other areas of the story and often helps to relax a tense or distressing moment in order for the filmmakers to return to the situation and build it up again. Sneaky devils.One of the oddest moments is when the family are mourning wildly in the school hall this begins sadly and slowly building in your uncomfortableness and sadness. Then something strange happens they just manage to tip the performance into humour just enough to lighten the situation and raise a few sniggers. Then photographers and film crews descend and we're presented with an interesting social commentary yet you're still feeling the humour of the moment and just coming out from the sadness of the family. It's all wonderfully woven together.The leads are good particularly the young girl Park Hyunseo played by Ahsung Ko who is very convincing and strong in character. At times the emotions she shows are so natural and believable you'll find yourself caught up in her scenes.The other characters continually walk that fine line between comedic and serious performances. Each of them have their flaws which are shown throughout the film but in the end each get their chance to redeem themselves and sometimes they get multiple chances often they need them too.That raises another interesting aspect instead of following a standard route with the characters their development follows the unusual turns of the film itself and we're treated to surprises and failures when we don't really expect them. Indeed you could almost say that these characters are more human than many fully focused dramatic character based films.The creature effects in this film are quite superb. It has weight and a natural organic movement. So often CGI creatures will appear to run over the ground or not properly interact and collide with real life objects here though every effort has been made to address this and it works superbly.I don't believe I'm spoiling anything about the movie when I say that the ending seems slightly flat against the amount of entertainment that the rest of the film has managed to deliver. It wraps everything up incredibly neatly with each character having had their shot at redemption. Yet it was a little too neatly tied up for me although it didn't detract from anything else the film gave.I'd recommend this film even for those not interested in Asian Horror for this can't be classed alongside what you would expect from a typical Asian Horror indeed there's not even a lot of horror. This is a suspenseful thriller drama comedy you're getting the idea. It's great entertainment with some brilliant moments of shock and terror. Well worth watching.".

Each of them have their flaws which are shown throughout the film but in the end each get their chance to redeem themselves and sometimes they get multiple chances often they need them too.That raises another interesting aspect instead of following a standard route with the characters their development follows the unusual turns of the film itself and we're treated to surprises and failures when we don't really expect them. Indeed you could almost say that these characters are more human than many fully focused dramatic character based films.The creature effects in this film are quite superb. It has weight and a natural organic movement. So often CGI creatures will appear to run over the ground or not properly interact and collide with real life objects here though every effort has been made to address this and it works superbly.I don't believe I'm spoiling anything about the movie when I say that the ending seems slightly flat against the amount of entertainment that the rest of the film has managed to deliver. It wraps everything up incredibly neatly with each character having had their shot at redemption. Yet it was a little too neatly tied up for me although it didn't detract from anything else the film gave.I'd recommend this film even for those not interested in Asian Horror for this can't be classed alongside what you would expect from a typical Asian Horror indeed there's not even a lot of horror. This is a suspenseful thriller drama comedy you're getting the idea. It's great entertainment with some brilliant moments of shock and terror. Well worth watching.";

Comedy with pathos just like real life refusing to fit neatly into categories...very clever film making. Even with the alleged fear of subtitles I would think there was a massive audience for this film amongst English speaking audiences...if only they would be given the chance to see it.

	schema:reviewBody "What else is there to say? The Host elicits every feeling every sense of urgency dread sadness and happiness with ease. And somehow it manages to cram all of that into the first fifthteen minutes. After that it speeds along and doesn't let up. I was with it till the end laughing when I was supposed to crying and even cheering. It is one of those rare films that blends all the respective genres into one with an almost scary simplicity. I shouldn't be surprised it is from writer and director Joon Ho Bong whose last films the equally brilliant Memories of Murder and the excellent black comedy Barking Dogs Never Bite featured a similar feeling. How does the man do it? Like with his other films particularly Memories of Murder he manages to break the conventions of the genre by frequently poking fun at the rather stale monster genre and by taking a fresh appealing perspective. It's funny at all the right moments and even in moments when you feel you shouldn't be laughing you cant help but laugh. It's full of vibrantly realized characters who each have their moment that make you laugh at the ridiculousness or gasp at the coolness. It is written with care and love the pace never stagnates and the dialogue is never forced. The CG monster effects are nice and appropriately unrealistic in appearance. Perhaps too unconventional for American audiences but it really works in the context of the films rather serious yet quirky atmosphere. The acting is excellent Kang HoSong continues to impress star in the making Ahsung Ko gives a very good first performance and the rest of the cast give great performances. All managing the frequent dips into serious and comical and even both at the same time.The Host is a brilliant brilliant film. I'm so pleased I had the pleasure of seeing it at the cinemas the way it deserves to be seen. Despite fitting into a rather common genre The Host is an original. It is a unique and refreshing film full of charming characters awesome action sequences and even an emotional poignancy that weaves itself into the film at the most appropriate of times.The Host is undoubtedly my favourite film of the year and one of the most entertaining films I have seen in recent years. If you like your films to be highly enjoyable but also smart and even emotional you will love what The Host has to offer.".

I'm not a fan of the majority of the modern day Asian horror output due to dull yet immensely popular films such as The Ring Dark Water and The Grudge. The Host however is a film that truly deserves the praise lauded upon it. While the premise is not all that original mutated monsters from all different countries have been terrorising our screens for decades the style and execution of it is and that is what makes the film brilliant. Not only is the direction stunning the film beautiful and the central monster well designed the way that Joonho Bong goes about telling this story is what really sets the film apart. On the surface The Host is the story of a mutated squid monster that emerges from the Han River. However beneath that it's actually the story of the Park family who find themselves at odds with the Government after the youngest daughter is kidnapped by the monster. They're being held in quarantine and decide to break out to track down their missing loved one...On the whole I'm not a big fan of CGI but I can't complain too much here. The monster is really well designed and doesn't look like any other screen monster that I've seen. The animation of it is excellent too and the creature does almost feel like it's alive! As mentioned the main meat of the film comes in the form of the story of the Park family who have lost their loved one. The characters are all well thought out and clearly defined and director Joonho Bong does an excellent job of ensuring that we care about them and about the central story. The monster appears several times throughout the film though it's neither under or over used and the story of the family is at least as interesting as the monster itself. There's also a deeper point on display although it doesn't have quite as much meat as was maybe intended. The two messages I could pick out were a warning message against pollution the monster was created by chemicals being dumped in the river and another about Government control. The central scene is the one that sees the monster first appear from the river and The Host never really tops that sequence but regardless of that this is the best monster movie I've seen in years and not even the downer ending could wipe a smile off my face when it finished. Don't miss this one!".

The audience was very attentive and the reception given to the movie was justly big applause. The animatronic effects have been done scrupulously well and viewers can look forward to being enthralled by the skills of those who made the monster. We got the print which had come straight from Cannes and apparently the film opened just two days before we saw it in Auckland. There is no doubt that this movie will go on to do very big business wherever people appreciate great horror films. My inclination to rate it 1010 was tempered only by a little doubt about the pacing of some sequences but it is certainly worth 910. Look out for when it comes to a theater near you.".

There they had the special effects the huge lizard and the allstar cast. But there was a hollowness even in the better or funnier moments. Here the filmmaker is more focused on putting just the right hint of satire and message behind material that actually works with the bigger picture. It's a story with its focus kept small even amid the virus outbreak scares and protests by the masses one is reminded of SARS and other disasters in Asia's recent memory not just Korea or China. It's about a family that becomes torn through this huge fishmonster crawling out of the water and killingtaking people back to his sort of sewerlair. The amazing thing too is how entertaining it is and the line between comedy and tragedy and melodrama and genuine excitement and terror for better or worse ends up making The Host something that should keep cultmovie fans captivated.After expository scenes showing how pouring chemicals can lead to a massive mutation mistake we're introduced to Park Gangdu the very talented Song KangHo who is a bit of a lazy guy running his business not that well though with a daughter he cares for. This all changes when the monster comes upon the scene that being one of the very best parts of the film and the daughter is taken away from him. He thinks he's seen the worst now and the whole family grieves this is another of the scenes that successfully skates against a horrible thing like losing a child and delivering it in absurd ways only to discover at least to Gangdu that she lives via a call from a cell phone. The focus is now set for the rest of the film find the sewer she's at and rescue her. If only people could calm down about this socalled virus outbreak.The scenes with the family and all of the actors involved are really the strongest scenes showcasing each one's talents and strengths the grandfather character played by Hiebong Byeon is one of the best. It all leads up to a powerhouse climax involving noxious chemicals and facing down the beast for good. The weaker aspects including an intriguing but underdeveloped bit of political and social satire involving the control and fear and such instilled in the public are not too deterring as luck would have it. The creature is also a marvel as something that is of course not looking like much of something that's real but as a visual effect it works much much better than in the monster movies of recent years. It's believable in the unbelievable sense and there's even a couple of true shocks that come out from its quasiindeterminable physical makeup. The Host is above all else though a Bmovie and Bong JoonHo knows this like it's nobody's business. This is why the film works even when it doesn't completely and it's always a fun ride in both the ridiculous and catastrophic putting a good grin on my face for more than half of the picture.".

The special effects are excellent the characters are believable and it is one movie well worth watching even if it is in a different language.

The special effects are excellent the characters are believable and it is one movie well worth watching even if it is in a different language.

	schema:headline " One crazy horror comedy drama sociopolitical allegory";
	schema:reviewBody "The Host is as deceptive and intriguing as its title there's currently a 6page thread in the discussion board and we still haven't figured it out. The movie can be taken as a straightforward monster flick a dark comedy a sentimental drama or a rich sociopolitical allegory.For the sake of this review let's approach it as more than an actioncomedyhorror flick and let's assume it's a deeper allegory. There's definitely a lot of symbolism lots of cultural references and outright satire for you to munch on. I think that's what makes this seeminglyordinary monster flick into a powerful film.Right in the first scene the director sets the tone with a caricature of Western U.S. muddling. Like the excellent Korean film Welcome to Dongmakgol released a year earlier this film is not exactly complimentary toward America so if that irritates you you might want to skip this. But when you consider all the 80s Hollywood flicks that painted Russia as a villain I guess it's fair enough that the USA should take its lumps.I did want to add that the director takes a diplomatic approach mocking the American establishment while indirectly praising the American individual. He does this by including an American tourist who's really cool. So in other words his criticisms are not onesided.The plot is twodimensional but the symbolic implications are profound. The story is about a monster that terrorizes the banks of the Han River and grabs a young girl prompting her bumbling family to lead a rescue effort with no help from the Korean authorities. Some say that the monster represents Western imperialism. It could represent a figurative attack on Korean culture autonomy and sovereignty. Or it could even be taken literally to represent environmental terrors caused by American apathy.Don't worry the USA isn't the only target here. There are some pretty good jabs at the Korean authorities too insinuating in a way that's both entertaining and irritating that the Korean government is apathetic  hopeless. So much for Korea's new democracy says one character at one point in the film. Some critics point out interesting parallels  allusions to the 1980 Gwangju Uprising where the Korean Government botched the whole situation killing  wounding hundreds at a student protest. Everyone is fair game in a dark satire like this. In that respect it reminded me of the excellent Veerhoven scifi satires Starship Troopers and Robocop.Like all good satires there's a nice amount of comedy to remind us not to take everything at face value. The bumbling family provides some great laughs in the first half and certain scenes in the hospital are reminiscent of the sarcastic masterpiece Brazil with its merciless mockery of all institutional powers. The scene where they're looking for a virus in a guy's head is both riotously hilarious and profoundly disturbing.I did want to mention one thing in case you're wondering. No the audience isn't supposed to feel sympathy for the monster not like in King Kong. I was actually surprised at that in a good way because the director didn't stray from his message with any gratuitous sentimentality. Normally I'm not a fan of killer animal flicks Jaws etc because I usually find myself siding with the animals more readily than the humans. But this film managed to avoid all sympathies since the monster itself is a product of human idiocy which is explained in the first scene.Well I've just thrown a bunch of ideas at you and I don't claim any of them to be absolute. But the point is that this seeminglyordinary horror flick is so much more. It's entirely up to you how you want to see it. Like I said up front you can just see it as a straightforward monster flick but I think if you read deeper into the parallels with current Korean society you'll get a whole lot more out of this.".

	schema:headline " The Host";
	schema:reviewBody "The Host is by far one of the best monster movies in years. The movie follows a bumbling young father GangDo Park and his family. The story starts like every monster movie everything is calm and uneventful business as usual you might say. When a mutated fish creature comes along the river bank and begins killing anyone in its path. Amidst all of the confusion GangDo's daughter Hyunseo is picked up by the monster and dragged back to the sewer. The story then turns into a search for Hyunseo. GangDo and his family evade the authorities and use all the money they have to desperately continue their quest.The reason I picked up this movie in the first place is because the box said that it was on par with Jaws. I found this hard to believe but the monster in The Host is the one of the most cinematically pleasing CG creations in recent years and is probably the most original looking monster since Alien. It was legitimately scary looking and had a very unique style of moving that set it apart from previous monsters. Another strength of this monster is how well the CG is done. It does not just look like some computer generated figure spliced into live action footage. It looks like it belongs in the shot. The monster also has enough on screen time to make the movie suspenseful. The movie keeps the viewer wanting to see more of the monster while at the same time keeping them satisfied with the number of appearances.The Park family does a pretty good job of keeping the audience entertained while the monster is off screen. The relationship that GangDo shares with his father college man brother and professional archer sister maintains a balance of drama and humor that the audience can appreciate. This dynamic seems strange but the movie makes it work. You start to really feel like these people are family. The best thing about these characters is that you are not disappointed when they are on the screen. Some monster movies seem to get kind of boring when the monster is off screen Godzilla 1998.The weakest thing about this movie as it is with most foreign films is the English translation and dubbing. After a while it becomes bearable but in the beginning it sounds absolutely awful. I don't say this very often because like many Americans I hate reading subtitles. But I think this one time I would have made the exception because the voice acting was just terrible. They just didn't seem to fit the characters very well. The dialogue in some scenes is very awkward as well. Some of the English translation just sounds out of place. This happens a lot with language barriers however and sometimes it just cannot be helped. If you want to watch something that is not meant to be in your language you've just got to go with what you get.I started off saying that this is one of the best monster movies in years and it is. It's not perfect but what monster movie is? It has some flaws but the originality of the monster and the simplicity of the plot makes this movie very easy to follow and worth watching at the very least. It is pretty good for what it is. The whole monster terrorizing an Asian town seems like it has been done a million times because it has but this movie has some new things to offer. Would I call this movie on par with Jaws? I wouldn't personally but it is definitely better than some of the cheesy messes that monster movies have made in the past.".

	schema:headline " Severely disappointing this movie hardly deserves it's mountain of praise.";
	schema:reviewBody "What this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately with disjointed storytelling frustrating plotholes and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly the greatest monster movie ever. Let's start with the good stuff comedy acting and special effects. From the getgo this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. The opening scene  the monster's origin  is campy and quick paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. The pacing is fast which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. With in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why' 'where' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action. In this the movie delivers.After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced the lazy son and his precocious little girl kind grandfather and talented sister aunt and of course the monster. The characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. The monster it's self looks great alien yet familiar  kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. The effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings.' Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd slipping on surfaces crushing and eating those in it's path. When the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. Plotlines are introduced then abandoned characters change their position for no apparent reason and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. As for the comedy let me say this I'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. However as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years still here I'd like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average whiteguy. That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny but to me weren't.  SPOILER For example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced  a brother  and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. This competition is at it's core funny two brothers who dislike eachother so much they even compete at a funeral  it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy. This subtle slapstick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl.  END SPOILER Then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. Finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character but you'd expect some comment to that nature. Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anticlimax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you why even bring it up in the first place? This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. Of course introducing new and greater problems is a timetested story telling tradition but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if you get several stories each only explained 20 of the way and in the end the parts never converge to complete the whole.Again I'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' Maybe its in Korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. Maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on everypage but never finishes one. Maybe it's OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.".

Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd slipping on surfaces crushing and eating those in it's path. When the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. Plotlines are introduced then abandoned characters change their position for no apparent reason and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. As for the comedy let me say this I'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. However as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years still here I'd like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average whiteguy. That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny but to me weren't.  SPOILER For example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced  a brother  and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. This competition is at it's core funny two brothers who dislike eachother so much they even compete at a funeral  it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy. This subtle slapstick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl.  END SPOILER Then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. Finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character but you'd expect some comment to that nature. Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anticlimax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you why even bring it up in the first place? This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. Of course introducing new and greater problems is a timetested story telling tradition but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if you get several stories each only explained 20 of the way and in the end the parts never converge to complete the whole.Again I'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' Maybe its in Korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. Maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on everypage but never finishes one. Maybe it's OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.";

The youngest member of the Park family is snatched by the beast and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the beast's latest meal.Firstly I love monster movies Mutated bears oversized alligators packs of ravening Komodo dragons the whole lot. Creature features are my favourite kind of Horror film. So I really wanted to like The Host but it wasn't to be. There were three major problems with itThe first can be seen with a quick look at it's IMDb pageGenre Action  Comedy  Drama  Fantasy  Horror  SciFi  ThrillerToo many damned genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy and yet was too light hearted to have any real message though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. Antipollution antiAmerican or antigovernment. The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mishmash with all the other styles.Secondly after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. The central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of Korea and America apparently do nothing. And that's it they just wander about occasionally hitting one another presumably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action made my attention wander and apparently it did the same for the director as whole plot threads go unresolved a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten about and is never resolved.And lastly the film is clumsily political. It paints the Americans as being stupid and evil but gives us no American characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant asking his boss the coroner not to pour chemicals into the Han river. The American coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. As well as being racist it's lazy filmmaking and there is no excuse for that.On the plus side the monster is good kind of a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are quite cool and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the film. Some of which remind me strangely of the way Firefly was filmed shuddering cameras out of focus shots etc.There is also a nice scene at the end where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. It's nighttime and snow is falling the streetlamp is giving out a cold light but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.Overall I was really disappointed by this film. I'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick and instead I get some pseudopoliticalhorrorcomedy lite. Looking at the comments on IMDb I can't help but think that if this had been a US production it would have been slated. Just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. There have been some great movies out of Korea in recent years The vengeance trilogy and Brotherhood for example but this certainly isn't one of them. For once I'm in favour of a remake. Tighten up the directing improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. As it is it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.".

The only thing I don't like about this movie is the ending which is pretty typical Koreanstyle but I'll keep that a secret if you've watched many Korean movies you'll get what I mean.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has already been much hyped because everyone is wondering what the Koreans saw in it to make it a resounding box office smash. So does it live up to expectations? Yes in a different way. What I'll include below will be suitable more for a post viewing read although most will probably have some prior knowledge about the movie from its trailers and poster. If you don't mind mild spoilers you can proceed until the part where I'll warn you about something major.Watching this film will make you laugh at its comedic moments feel a tinge of sadness in others and it might make you cry or pound your heart with suspense and will even satisfy the action movie lovers with some sequences. It's like a big pot of rojak  different ingredients mashed together blended perfectly into a 2 hour long journey of pure entertainment with serious messages.At the heart of it is a tale about family. Here given its genre there's no allempowered super being or man's man who goes on a one man crusade against the beast. It's about what an ordinary family doing the extraordinary by digging deep and finding strength from within. The portrayal by the lead actors are quite believable as you feel their pain frustrations and idiosyncrasies as they go about trying to achieve their mission despite the odds. One thing's for sure family ties run deep with emphasis on unity not individuality.There're some key observations made about the human condition how naturally curious we are when we spot things not normally seen instinctively whipping out cameras to take pictures and how we innocently provoke without realizing. Not too subtle jibes are made at how bumbling authorities are and on the pompousness of the US forces in assuming control over the situation sidestepping what they probably know as the real cause with a presentation of a smokescreen.Here's where the major spoilers beginThe monster!! I absolutely have to blabber about it! I was half expecting Godzilla pounding through the streets of Seoul and pulverizing buildings to a pulp. But wait! The Host came up with something pretty refreshing  this monster is midget! if compared to conventional notions of what a monster would be. Herein lies one of the breakdowns in genre but tenacity and nastiness is not measured on size alone  it's menacing and merciless when the time calls for it.The creation of the monster came from a fictionalized imagining of a real life scenario gone wrong with regards to the lack of respect to the environment and on toxic pollution. If Godzilla was created in the nuclear age to highlight its dangers then this being was created because of mankind's preference for the easy way out  through the kitchen sink.The bugger looked beautifully ugly but thanks to its excellent special effects teams one of which is WETA yeah THAT WETA it moves with slick grace and agility I would even say it swaggers stylishly It is so realistic that never for a moment you'll think you're watching a cheesy monster flick even though rubber suits are nostalgic. Major spoilers end The music is yet another plus point as it brought out the mood and plays with your emotions as well. The sound department has its work cut out in designing a unique roar and you'll feel terrorized as if you're there on location as the creature rampages. For good measure you might want to stay until the end of the credits for a little easter egg and especially if you're watching it in a hall outfitted with a decent surround sound system.All in all two words Highly recommended. Goes into my shortlist of movie of the year too!P.S. I don't know why but I was swearing at some parts of the movie eg.  RUN!! together with another group of strangers. We were having a hellishly good fun time during the screening. Awesome!".

Major spoilers end The music is yet another plus point as it brought out the mood and plays with your emotions as well. The sound department has its work cut out in designing a unique roar and you'll feel terrorized as if you're there on location as the creature rampages. For good measure you might want to stay until the end of the credits for a little easter egg and especially if you're watching it in a hall outfitted with a decent surround sound system.All in all two words Highly recommended. Goes into my shortlist of movie of the year too!P.S. I don't know why but I was swearing at some parts of the movie eg.  RUN!! together with another group of strangers. We were having a hellishly good fun time during the screening. Awesome!";

This movie breaks the trend. The monster that comes out of the Han River is actually there you hear it breathe you see in run and people interact with it.As the story lays itself out it tells the audience this is not simply a monster movie where heroes kill the monster and save the day. Very emotional and psychotic themes are displayed. This movie even goes on to criticize the current social issues of Korea the exclusion of people in poverty from society.Gwoemul meaning monster in the Korean language is unlike anything else people have seen. This monster has no name like Godzilla or King Kong. It's just monster. You can really never figure out what this monster is. And it is also a poor sacrifice of modern society.This movie will please you no matter what. It is for both the brains and the fun. Funny sequences put in just at the right time relieve you when there is too much tension that builds up. Emotional scenes are cleverly done and will grasp your feelings for characters. And the monster the Gwoemul will shock you. You better hold onto that popcorn tight and have a box of Kleenex ready...".

The region 2 Korean  French audio 5.1 looked good so I rented it... Back when that was still a thing. First this is not Hero nor is it a wuxia or wirework driven martial arts film. This is a Historical action film and despite the prowesses of its heroes Musa's violence is realistic and brutal. It is a very clever menonamission flick with interesting balance and variety within the team with echoes of Seven Samurai. Where things take an even more pleasant turn are in the interesting portrayal of our characters a borderline unlikable hero or so he seems at first and princess great nobility in the lower ranks and a surprisingly likable and charismatic villain if indeed you can call him that.In production value terms this can compete with anything Hollywood churns out and the technical credits from editing to earthy cinematography are all excellent. Fastshutter action made popular by Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator is put to brutal use here and there is a fine balance of chaotic individual moments and interesting strategies something that would later be explored in John Woo's Red Cliff. This film procures that very rare delight of watching a film and knowing exactly where all the money effort and care went because it is all up there on screen and for once equally distributed performances included.

With the rise of the famous Ming Dynasty in China and the waning days of the Mongols the Korean emperor was eager to formalize ties with the new Chinese government.  This is the story of one of the those diplomatic missions.This is an epic film shoot over 9000 miles of China's northern region. Covering plains prairies forests deserts and coastline.  The cinematography is beautiful.Though this is a Korean film it utilizes the famous Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi who portrays a kidnapped daughter of the Chinese Emperor.Throughout most of the film the Korean warriors speak Korean.  The Princess and the Chinese villagers speak Mandarin.  Interestingly the Mongols also speak Mandarin to each other historically inaccurate but Mongols don't go to movies these days. Some of the Koreans can also speak Mandarin. This is accurate since the educated Koreans of the time could read write and speak Chinese.  This film is subtitled in English.This is a grand story of honor sacrifice and overcoming overwhelming odds. The Korean warriors must fight the larger forces of the Mongols.

There's sweeping landcapes a crossdesert ordeal competition between villains and heros 'stagecoach' chases abandoned and defended forts and 'cavalry' charges. These as well as a strong sense of a manhavingtodo whataManhastodo combine to create familiarity to those who know such films as for instance The Alamo and Commanche Station. That's not to say that Musa has no originality or is not strongly rooted within Korean national cinema. It contains a number of striking set pieces  notably the several pitched battle scenes multiple characterisation as well as some insight into the various power struggles which make up midfourteenth century Asian history.

Its good to see a film too in which the ubiquitous wire work and over the top gymnastics beloved by some Eastern action directors is conspicuous by its absence. Its also one where the director relies less on extreme camera angles and special effects to create visual drama than on the regular ebb and flow of dramatic editing. Perhaps because of this 'naturalness' the battle scenes are consistently exciting and involving. They are also staged in enough different locales to make them varied viewing each time. A standout is a desperate confrontation amongst trees where the director takes full advantage of foliage cover confusion and events within the frame to create some real martial suspense.The HK disc I saw was generally excellent with occasional errors in subtitle grammar as well as the odd compression problem onscreen blur usually during horizontal tracking movements. All told though the cheap price of this disk makes it an excellent buy and I strongly recommend it  and the film.".

There's sweeping landcapes a crossdesert ordeal competition between villains and heros 'stagecoach' chases abandoned and defended forts and 'cavalry' charges.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it was nearly a year ago that I came across the website and first started anticipating the movie eagerly. The site contained lots of stills from the movie throughout and every single one of them was utterly beautiful like it had been painted to perfection rather than captured in motion. It seemed unreasonable to expect the whole movie to look that good but I was pretty sure that it was going to be impressive. With so much anticipation and hope for a movie it seems almost inevitable that you are going to be disappointed when you finally see it. All the more surprise then that MUSA meets and surpasses my expectations in every way!First things first yes... it really does look that good! All the way through . Like Zhang Yimou's SHANGHAI TRIAD practically every frame is beautifully composed and rendered and could easily hang on a gallery wall somewhere. There wasn't a single shot that I could imagine looking better than it did. The production design is incredible the locations stunning the special effects groundbreaking the gore. I can't imagine how much time and money must have gone into its production let alone talent and dedication.MUSA is epic in the word's biggest sense  I couldn't help thinking of Homer's ILIAD and ODDYSEY in many parts and those are basically the two stories that the word 'epic' was invented for. It makes Gladiator Crouching Tiger etc look positively inconsequential. The movie is also made with an attention to detail that is remarkable. It is certainly the most convincing evocation of relatively ancient times that I have seen. You will really believe that you've been transported back to 400 something AD China where Zhang Ziyi happens to be a princess and Yu Rong Guang a Mongol general. I really felt Yes this is what life was like back then. This is how things looked this is how people behaved.Despite the epic nature of the story the central focus is always on a smallish cast of characters each of whom is very well conceived and developed throughout the movie's course. I'd guess there's about 15 major characters in the story and a significant cast of minor characters. The performances are all superb  I'm pretty sure the actors themselves were quite convinced they really were their characters. The believability is enhanced by the costuming makeup and I guess just good casting  all the different factions involved in the story totally look the part.No epic would be complete without battle scenes and MUSA has quite a few. These are all stunningly choreographed and filmed not in a HK style like Bichunmoo but in a completely real style. Beautifully shot of course but the men fight like skilled soldiers really would I'm sure and get woundedkilled equally convincingly. The special effects of arrows and blades penetrating flesh are sometimes shockingly convincing. This might be disturbing to some but it isn't played for titillation  it just adds to the gravity of the experience. It may be a little conspicuous that the heroes all manage to dispatch many times their own body weight in enemies but you've got to give them some leeway for narrative convention .There is a lot of planning involved in the battles of a military nature and this is also very convincing and fascinating. Almost as large a part of the process as the actual getting down to it with the weapons. A very believable insight into how battles were waged in the days when a bow  arrow was as hitech as weaponry got.Hmmm... is there any aspect of the movie I haven't gushed praise over yet? A nod to the soundtrack I guess  good very fitting. Sound effects in the battles are excellent. Ummm... and the lighting is really good too .A cursory nod must be made to the films flaws as well though lest I leave the reader with expectations of total perfection. The main flaw is that the movie wanders rather too far into melodrama  a little cliche towards the end. It would probably be kind of cheesy except that it's all so well done you can't get too upset with it .".

That the real enemy is sometimes on the same side.There are a lot of small characters and everyone gets enough screen time to make us care about them sometimes even more than the main characters.A special mention deserves the numerous war scenes.  Using a slow motion first person shots quick editing and almost every camera trick you could imagine you will feel in the middle of the battlefield and a very scary one .  The blood and violence are much more realistic than BLACK HAWK DOWN or WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS and the impression created is more than those two plus any other recent war related.In brief as far as I know this movie did not get a cinema release but you can find it in EBAY or in some special video stores.

The story of love and honour set against an epic journey is one that even I'll admit to have found to moving and captivating.Real comments aside the only reason 'Musa' came to my attention was because it is an action movie and features Mr. Iron Monkey himself Rongguang Yu. A far cry from the sometimes very intense martial arts movies that Rongguang Yu is usually in 'Musa' is a bloody depiction of war. No character flies around using magical kungfu but they can still swing a weapon around and look really cool while doing it.I really can't say much about 'Musa' that hasn't already been said. It may have a limited appeal  its long violent and dramatic  but well recommended to anyone who can sit through two and a half of drama and violence. Fantastic  1010".

	schema:headline " Captivating visuals certainly worth a look";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd never heard of this movie until my buddy Eric rented it that Blockbuster carries it is I guess a good sign. Part Crouching Tiger  part Saving Private Ryan  with just a smidgen of Hidden Fortress and an echo of Xenophon Musa is a highly enjoyable movie.The movie begins in 1375 with a failed delegation from Korea to the Ming dynasty. Led by General Choi Jung Jinmo Ju the delegation become prisoners of the Ming being led off to exile when the Mongols strike. Suddenly finding themselves free the delegation decides to rescue the captive Ming princess Ziyi Zhang of Crouching Tiger fame who travels with the Mongols. When they succeed naturally the Mongols want her back and thus begins an arduous trek across the desert culminating in a Road Warrioresque fight at a battered old castle where the survivors hole up against their much more mobile but lesscivilized attackers.Musa has action in spades some of it exceptionally grisly every archery attack is cause for dozens of shots of gruesome impalings. The battles are tense and tautly filmed and feel more dangerous than most combats of this type. We eschew the beautiful martial arts style so prevalent in many Hong Kong films for a grittier and far more realistic if a bit bloody style here.  But what Musa also possesses is atmosphere the locations and the cinematography are topnotch from the boundless deserts to the brokendown castle by the sea. Musa does an excellent job of selling the world it is set in.The costumes help with this as well. Not since Brotherhood of the Wolf have I seen such elaborate and effective costuming the armor and such here was even more intricate and characterintensive than Last Samurai which is saying something. Each character has his own particular look is easily told apart from the others and costuming is ultimately an extension of character which to me has always been the whole point. These are some of the best period costumes you'll see anywhere.The acting is all pretty good though it tends to come from the George Lucas school of faster more intense.' One facet I did like is that no one is perfect the general is a bit of a jerk his loyal retainer Ganam JeongHak Park while a mighty warrior lacks the ability to really think for himself the princess is spoiled the slaveturnedwarrior Yeosol Woosung Jung is selfless but headstrong and so on. Even the Mongols come across as human if a bit savage which having done the research I can attest is more or less pretty accurate.Musa isn't for everyone due to the violence. But it's a very well done period piece with wonderful visuals that certainly captivates the viewer. It's as good or better than any of the historical epics Hollywood has released in the past few years with the exception of The Last Samurai and from a costuming and cinematography sense is very much worth your while to see. Just don't bother tracking this down if you're a little squeamish that's all.".

Part Crouching Tiger  part Saving Private Ryan  with just a smidgen of Hidden Fortress and an echo of Xenophon Musa is a highly enjoyable movie.The movie begins in 1375 with a failed delegation from Korea to the Ming dynasty. Led by General Choi Jung Jinmo Ju the delegation become prisoners of the Ming being led off to exile when the Mongols strike. Suddenly finding themselves free the delegation decides to rescue the captive Ming princess Ziyi Zhang of Crouching Tiger fame who travels with the Mongols. When they succeed naturally the Mongols want her back and thus begins an arduous trek across the desert culminating in a Road Warrioresque fight at a battered old castle where the survivors hole up against their much more mobile but lesscivilized attackers.Musa has action in spades some of it exceptionally grisly every archery attack is cause for dozens of shots of gruesome impalings. The battles are tense and tautly filmed and feel more dangerous than most combats of this type. We eschew the beautiful martial arts style so prevalent in many Hong Kong films for a grittier and far more realistic if a bit bloody style here.  But what Musa also possesses is atmosphere the locations and the cinematography are topnotch from the boundless deserts to the brokendown castle by the sea. Musa does an excellent job of selling the world it is set in.The costumes help with this as well. Not since Brotherhood of the Wolf have I seen such elaborate and effective costuming the armor and such here was even more intricate and characterintensive than Last Samurai which is saying something. Each character has his own particular look is easily told apart from the others and costuming is ultimately an extension of character which to me has always been the whole point. These are some of the best period costumes you'll see anywhere.The acting is all pretty good though it tends to come from the George Lucas school of faster more intense.' One facet I did like is that no one is perfect the general is a bit of a jerk his loyal retainer Ganam JeongHak Park while a mighty warrior lacks the ability to really think for himself the princess is spoiled the slaveturnedwarrior Yeosol Woosung Jung is selfless but headstrong and so on. Even the Mongols come across as human if a bit savage which having done the research I can attest is more or less pretty accurate.Musa isn't for everyone due to the violence. But it's a very well done period piece with wonderful visuals that certainly captivates the viewer. It's as good or better than any of the historical epics Hollywood has released in the past few years with the exception of The Last Samurai and from a costuming and cinematography sense is very much worth your while to see. Just don't bother tracking this down if you're a little squeamish that's all.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is a nothing like a good epic film. Here is a fine entry to the genre from South Korea a nation that doesn't normally make these sort of films. Film in China and staring the beautiful Zhang Ziyi it had potential.Set in 1374 relations between Korea and the Ming Dynasty in China are at a low. The Koreans send a diplomatic mission to resort their relationship led by General ChoiJung Joo Jinmo. However when arriving in a city he team are captured and exiled from China. Left for dead in the desert their run into a Mongol army party which have captured Princess Buyong Zhang Ziyi. The Korean party save her and hope to return her to Emperor saving their mission. Within the party is Yeosol Jung Woosung a recently freed slave who was loyal to his master and excellent fighter with a spear. He and the Princess have an attraction to each other. After freeing the Princess the Mongols are upset. There were hoping to use her as a bargaining chip against the Ming's China. They chase the Koreans and destroy countryside villages to get her back.The story and plot are simply and believable within the context of the film always good signs. Within the group many of characters and relationships are developed especially Yeosol the General the Princess and Jinlip the veteran of the group. Even the main bad guy has some nobility about him. The costumes and weaponry are excellently done. The warfare was brutal and shows woman and children getting killed something that rarely happens in Hollywood films. The film is deliciously violence. My only real problem with the film which lets it down is the action. It is good that the action is violence but it is so overly edited and the shakycam make it difficult to follow. If the action was better then the would have been even better.If you enjoy films like the Lord of the Rings trilogy Gladiator Conan the Barbarian and Red Cliff you will like this film.".

Here in New Zealand Musa was shown as part of Beck's Incredible Film Festival 2002. It was the second Korean movie I've watched in my entire life. Having said that the movie shed some light into Korean history of which I knew only a little.Suffice it to say that the movie was set in 14th century China during the rise of the Ming Dynasty. It tells the story of a diplomatic delegation from the kingdom of Koryo Korea which is  accused of espionage and sent to exile by the chinese kingdom. The movie follows the journey of this delegation from exile to their home country and what transpire in that process. That would include lots of medieval fights internal disputes symbolic characterizations beautiful native sceneries great costumes and 'correct' interpretation of cultural identities between the warring groups ie. chinese koreans mongols arabs etc..The movie flows smoothly due to a good direction and professional filmingediting the narration intrigues you to know what comes next. The battle scenes especially the solo fights by Yeosol were excitingly choreographed and realistically executed.I've read that Kim Sungsu the director paid tribute to the late John Ford through the embodiment of the character Yeosol Jung Woosung. He has this jingoistic attitude shoot first ask later.And let's not forget the heartracing caravan chasing scene which reminded me of classic Western and colossal movies.Furthermore I find that the gory and bloody war scenes were reminiscence of Kurosawa's jidaigeki films. In fact the graphic violence surpasses that of Braveheart's although Musa is not as romanticized as the former eventhough it is more idealized. The film has to be because it is basically about the essence of a warrior. So moral messages and historical interpretations were not the purpose of the movie but rather what makes a warrior.SPOILERSThe Chinese character of Musa is read as 'samurai' in Japanese.And if you understand the 'message' of the movie than you would also understand the values of a warriorsamurai valiant courage virtues honour obligation loyalty and selfsacrifice. Princess Bu Yong Zhang Ziyi who in the movie is the main reason of all the disputes then becomes a narration tool a stimulant for all the problems that in the end require the culmination of the aforementioned values so that the problem can be solved. As such the movie is closed appropriately with a sad but gloriousAt the last battle in the Clay Fortress the Korean delegation fights to its last strength only to find out that their trap has failed against the Mongols.Sgt.

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of previous commenter's who look down on the film seem to have no idea what the significance of the story is about. The story and characters seem to be be fleeting changing from one position to the other. But the movie does this to portray the turmoil the envoy goes through.Faced with a decision to either run for their lives or save a princess the envoy decides to do what they believe is honorable. But while doing so they face many hardships. By showing how the characters faced and developed through these hardships is very realistic in my opinion. After having half your envoy decimated by others wouldn't you falter a bit in your decision to follow the dangerous path. It would have been so easy to just give up the princess and run away. But through it all they decided to go for honor. And that's what the story is all about.The acting was welldone in general. I was most disappointed with Zhang ZiYi's and the general of the Korean envoy's performance and I most enjoyed Yu Rong Guang's and several of the lesser Korean actors' performances. The general of the Yuan army showed a lot of mixed emotions as the Mongols went through much turmoil as well. And the lower soldiers of the Korean envoy were great at displaying their emotions. Historically the costumes and weapons were accurate.And this is a Korean movie not a Chinese movie as some believe. It is a movie about a Korean envoy sent to China on diplomatic relations back in the 14th century. The cinematography was wonderful. The beginning scenes when the envoy is in the desert is truly awesome. It really felt like the desert was vast and thoughts of crossing it were ludicrous. I don't think this movie is really comparable to Kurosawa's samurai films. They are different. Kurosawa's samurai films always had a central character who basically never changed throughout the movie. I think Musa did not have as strong a centralized character. And the characters all went through transformations. But like I said I believe that characters wavering and faltering are more realistic than the thought of a superhero who never changes from his ways. These people were not comic book characters. They were realistic.But it doesn't mean one film is any greater than another just because of that.Musa was enjoyable. I thought it was very well done. I honestly don't think Braveheart or Gladiator were any better than this movie. Braveheart and Gladiator had the similar strong centralized lead character while Musa didn't. But like I said it doesn't mean they were any better. 810".

It is a movie about a Korean envoy sent to China on diplomatic relations back in the 14th century. The cinematography was wonderful. The beginning scenes when the envoy is in the desert is truly awesome. It really felt like the desert was vast and thoughts of crossing it were ludicrous. I don't think this movie is really comparable to Kurosawa's samurai films. They are different. Kurosawa's samurai films always had a central character who basically never changed throughout the movie. I think Musa did not have as strong a centralized character. And the characters all went through transformations. But like I said I believe that characters wavering and faltering are more realistic than the thought of a superhero who never changes from his ways. These people were not comic book characters. They were realistic.But it doesn't mean one film is any greater than another just because of that.Musa was enjoyable. I thought it was very well done. I honestly don't think Braveheart or Gladiator were any better than this movie. Braveheart and Gladiator had the similar strong centralized lead character while Musa didn't. But like I said it doesn't mean they were any better. 810";

This movie kicks butt! This is not a wirefu heavy martial arts pic. While this does have some martial arts in it there is no outlandish wirefu that really turns me off! Haven't we had enough of that? This has the elements of an American Western epic rather than than overthetop Hong Kong cinema sword play that is just eye candy more than anything...I have a great appreciation for historical epics and this one left me more satisfied than Braveheart and Gladiator did. The reason being is that there is more than one hero to care about. And there is a spoiled rotten princess who gets treated as such. I liked how she didn't always get her way. The journey these heroes and nonheroes take through the desert kept me guessing and dying to see what would happen next. There are many pleasant surprises! I leached on to these warriors and the film makers made me want to stick with them and not miss a thing! This blows away Chinese chop socky cinema which pales in comparison after watching this epic. Outstanding performances especially by the archer! This archer played by Sung Kee is incredibly awesome!! He made Orlando Bloom's archer in LOTR look like a pansy! I really believed these guys were for real..it's that realistic! The cinematography is jawdropping and the story...just go rent it now!!!!!".

	schema:headline " Excellent Korean swordplay epic";
	schema:reviewBody "I do like a good historical epic and it's a truth that nobody makes them quite like they do in Asia. Over the past decade the genre has flourished since the success of CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON and while I don't like that particular film very much I've absolutely adored some of the others that have followed. These titles include HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS and CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER. As a viewer I'm always drawn slightly away from the wuxia genre I'm no big fan of the wire work you see in these movies in favour of the grittier more realistic genre films like THE WARLORDS. MUSA is such a film a Korean epic that focuses on realism and crucial believability throughout.In essence it's a familiar story about a group of highly skilled and diverse warriors attempting to protect a princess while battling an evil general and his small army on their tale. Some say it's like Kurosawa with the superficial similarities to SEVEN SAMURAI on show. I disagree. MUSA is a firmly modern actionfocused epic which is all about the battles and the swordplay and anyone who thinks otherwise is mistaken. The good news is that these scenes are tremendous veering on the right side in terms of the editing which is fast but allows you to actually see what's going on. The battle choreography is stupendous and there's all manner of fighting involved. There's a particular emphasis on cool weaponry highpowered bows a massive spear and also on the wounds inflicted by these cruel weapons. This ain't PGfare it's one of the bloodiest historical epics out there and I'm still trying to figure out how they achieved the brilliant arrowintheneck special effects.It's a rare film that succeeds through action alone but there's far more to MUSA than just that. The simple journey storyline allows for plenty of character arcs and development and it's refreshing to see a film where characters aren't as clear cut as you might expect. People make mistakes and people die because of those mistakes but these flawed characters are all the more gripping because of that. My favourite is a case in point Joo Jinmo's general who's a truly noble good guy despite the errors of judgement he sometimes makes. The rest of the cast don't disappoint either and Zhang Ziyi is particularly good in a role that allows her to take a break from the martial arts for once.There are three main backdrops to the unfolding story and each of them seems fresh and unique. The first is a shifting desert landscape the second an extensive woodland and the third a ruined castle on the coast. There's a particular emphasis on the visual scenes and the costumes look stunning. Despite a long running time this is engaging throughout building up to a classic climax in which many of the good guys die bloodily and heroically. As a film MUSA blows SEVEN SWORDS clean out of the water.".

Led by brash and unrefined general ChoiJung Joo Jinmo the leftover band of warriors comes across Mongolian troops who have managed to kidnap a Chinese Ming Princess Buyong Zhang Ziyi. The troops which include a silent slave Yeosol Jung Woosung with mastery at polearm and a veteran archer DaeJung Ahn Sungki decide to retrieve the princess thus reclaiming their honour and fulfilling their envoy.Still a relatively fresh trend in Asian cinema Musa is in no way inferior to Chinese or Japanese period drama. Featuring a high degree of historical accuracy in period costumes props as well as settings it manages to feel nouvelle even after 10 years and is vastly superior to the more contrived current onslaught of big budget historic extravaganzas. Abundant in detail every shot is to be glamorously inhaled although lacking the poetry of for example Hero instead going for a roughclad sense of realism with a slight overexuberance in gore. Still strikingly beautiful despite the more restrained set pieces Musa manages to weave a strong tale which is devoid of clichs attentive to detail and able to convey emotion.Thus a truly epic tale which despite its limitations in historic scale of significance delivers dramaturgy and suspense coupled with a tale of honour dedication and heroism despite all odds in true legend fashion. Despite the relatively large cast many characters are well fleshed out especially in regards to their specific frailties. None of the characters are flawless heroes and each of them is prone to mistakes susceptible to weakness but nonetheless manage to come out victorious. There is no easy division into good  evil more a collision of goals and the ultimate decisions which these entail. Such are also the battle scenes which are bloody and relatively unpredictable as to the outcome or death toll albeit a certain degree of needless pathos is afforded to the deaths of certain key characters. Despite a bit of wanton melodrama which does however serve to flesh out characters Musa proved surprisingly effective and memorable.".

Not girlish and not clownish to start with.There are at least two different types of historicalpseudohistorical dramas in Asian cinema. Type one beautiful with lots of CGI andor wirework very romantic and sentimental with a bit of sexuality Crouching Tiger Hero Seven Swords etc.. Type two gritty violent dark very reserved concerning CGI and wires with minimum or even none female sentimentality and sexual innuendoes err... please help me with the titles. This film is definitely of the second type.Well forget it. I am just trying to pass for a generalizing scholar of the lowest degree. To put it in plain words the first time I saw a few scenes out of the whole movie I got amazed. This movie contains realistic and physically exhausting stunts. It has taciturn and tough characters submerged into a wild deadly race. And it does not try to squeeze tears out of soft viewers' hearts by any means. It all gripped me instantly. When I bought the DVD I was still not very sure thinking that maybe only some parts of this epic were good. Now after watching the whole movie from top to toe I can write a comment and sign my opinion.If Seven Swords disillusioned me greatly this one got right into my personal favourites. The strangest thing is that I don't know any of the actorsactresses there is no Mr Jackie Chan or Mr Sammo Hung no Mr Donnie Yen or Mr Jet Lee but what they are doing without overthetop choreography is real magic that can get into the heart. Now I am even thinking about rerating of the other epic films which were given the highest marks on my IMDb list.The transient nature of the movie has the power to enchant the viewer. A lasting stare full of hatred a loving gaze a powerful and very wisely used slowmotion a long take representing a man running fast towards the overturned fourwheeler a swift almost unnoticeable move of the fighter which results in a grisly death of the opponent extensive use of gestures and face expressions instead of usual blahblahblah absence of superhuman powers and other nonsense so widely used in martial arts epics a very engaging music theme cruel battles the reason for which may appear absolutely unimportant to the modern audience charismatic characters on both sides etc. All this makes up a unique film. I can't explain why this massacre happens but I can feel why. This film is a kind of magic. Magic from the mighty East.I would definitely say Thank you I am 100 satisfied with Your film to every woman and man who are behind this production. Good job. Let the other glossy epics rest in their cosy places on IMDb top 250 to hell with them  this one is on my personal top 100 list.In simple words my opinion is the following Seven Swords sucks while Musa rocks. Musa is a poetical hymn to the creating power of selfdenial and to the deepest human feelings. It is realistic and heavenly at the same time.There should be something wrong with the film. It can't be perfect can it? Well maybe the last song when the credits are rolling already does not sound very right. But it is a minor complaint that does not spoil the film to me.If only Korea were producing only this kind of cinema... Unfortunately there exists disgusting Oldboy which is also on the top IMDb list. Shameful. And I totally agree with another reviewer that Braveheart is nowhere near this mastery.My favourite epic drama. 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Musa offers very little new to the genre of historical action epics it manages to be more entertaining than most of its ilk. It's rather difficult to explain why it is so though.Film's story is quite thin and despite its connections to real history it mostly acts only as very straightforward device to take characters from one battle to the next. Characters are pretty much your typical collection of stereotypes proud and insecure general snobby princess humble and noble veteran captain and of course the honorable and brooding hero. If you've seen a few of these movies before you'll know exactly what's going to happen in this one.Acting is quite good though some of the characters give little space for expressing anything beyond their caricature traits. Action sequences are very well made and enjoyably bloody. I must emphasize the fact that fights in Musa are not the massive battles between armies like in Braveheart but skirmishes comprising few dozen people at most I don't find this necessarily bad but it makes me wonder the budget of 60M.Cinematography is generally beautiful but I could have lived without some of the most clichd slow motions like the ones during the final battle. Score is rather bland and the song during the ending credits fits the movie amazingly poorly.What else? Well despite my partially negative review I actually enjoyed the movie. It's way above the Gladiator and about as good as Braveheart comparing it to movies that seem to appear in most of the reviews anyway. 710".

I must emphasize the fact that fights in Musa are not the massive battles between armies like in Braveheart but skirmishes comprising few dozen people at most I don't find this necessarily bad but it makes me wonder the budget of 60M.Cinematography is generally beautiful but I could have lived without some of the most clichd slow motions like the ones during the final battle. Score is rather bland and the song during the ending credits fits the movie amazingly poorly.What else? Well despite my partially negative review I actually enjoyed the movie. It's way above the Gladiator and about as good as Braveheart comparing it to movies that seem to appear in most of the reviews anyway. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is disappointing.  Jung WooSung plays the same character the lonely fighter once again and it's not cool any more.  If he wants to continue his career he has to take some different  characters from now on. Choi Jung's character is laughable even though it's not supposed to be. He wants to control his troop but they never listen to him so one night he says I'm going my own way you guys go your own. Don't anybody follow me or I'll kill him in a lonely heroic way and leaves the troop. Of course no one follows him but next morning they find him fallen out of the horse and passed out about 100 M away from their camp. Zhang ZiYi doesn't look as hot as in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. All the princess does is to whine through the whole movie and causes other innocent people to be slaughtered. The monk always tries to teach other people but he is rather annoying than wise. Ahn SungKi gives the best performance as the warmhearted archer. The spectacle is one of the best in Korean films. Unlike Hong Kong martial art films the action scenes are also realistic but they are too long so I got bored later. The idea of this film is original and the cinematography is wonderful. If it had a better script Musa could have been a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Death Bell was a sleeper hit in the summer of 2008 so it is no surprise that the producers would attempt a sequel to cash in on the popularity of the first movie. But even the most diehard fans of the lowbudget original would probably be disappointed by this classic case of 'sequelitis' as Death Bell 2 essentially rehashes the same premise with a different group of actors and substitutes gore for any kind of genuine horror.Just as its predecessor this is about a bunch of elite highschool students who discover themselves the targets of a mysterious slasher while back in school during the holidays cramming for their college entrance exams. Of course given the demise of most of the characters from the first movie there is no relation cast or characterwise between the two films.Not that it matters really director Yoo Sun Dong wastes little time in setting up the events leading up to that fateful night over which the subsequent killings unfold including a prelude which tells of the death of the school's champion swimmer Taeyeon Yoon Seung Ah whose vengeful spirit is but one of the red herrings the movie uses later on to distract you from the identity of the killer.Indeed when Taeyeon turns out to be one of the most fleshedout characters in the movie you can guess how little time effort or interest Yoo has in letting his audience get to know the other hapless teens. This only means that one probably feels little for any of the characters as they meet their demise but again the purported highlight of the movie as was the original is its numerous gory killings.Yet aside from one that takes place along the school corridor with the killer riding a motorbike with metal spokes on its wheels the death traps lack the ingenuity that gorehounds would have already seen in Saw. Yoo also exhibits none of the dexterity in pacing and editing that his predecessor's director Chang had and these scenes of carnage hardly excite or thrill. And no dumping copious amounts of blood on screen isn't going to satisfy audiences already desensitised from the Saws and Hostels of Hollywood.What ultimately saves the movie is its intriguing whodunit which throws suspicion on the culpability of some of Taeyeon's fellow students in her death. The trio of screenwriters Lee GongJoo Lee JeongHwa and Park HyeMin spend considerably more time and thought on this in the second half of the movie and their attempt to find motive and motivation behind these killings turns out more compelling than one would expect. Ditto for the surprisingly heartfelt ending which reaffirms that the dead don't always return just for vengeance.Still if the final reveal lacks surprise it is no thanks to Yoo's directorial ineptness clearly evident right from the start by his inability to build any sort of suspense in the story or engineer some clever inventive kills to hold his audience's attention. Never mind that Death Bell 2 recycles its material from the original what's most inexcusable is how it manages to do so even worse than its predecessor did.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a concept that to inherit the legacy of a successful movie and make a second part of the movie and call it a sequel or prequel. Usually it is very difficult to make a good second movie because the new ideas have been seen before and probably the main characters are repeated as well. If you have a movie with a lot of material to talk about Godfather 2 or the sequel is very long way from the original so you can introduce new materials terminator 2 you may repeat the success. If you make the later parts of the movie very near the time of original eventually they will just look all the same such as Saw series. However it is OK if you are a fan and people will follow whatever the story it was linking from before.There are some really bad sequel movies like 'the return of living dead' movies the series has no linkage whatsoever but it does not matter. Every movie has different theme and they were all low budget movie anyway nobody really cares about them. I would say they are failures but not extremely bad cases.Now to the main topic Gosa 2 is a movie with absolute no linkage to its predecessor. They both have about the same cast of characters just with the name changed. Several new ways of killing people but they are all similar. It is about murdering revenge and supernatural which is exactly the same tone as the first movie. Even the main actress they again have chosen a singeractress to take the leading role. I never understand why they do that. There are zero new surprising elements zero new ideas and even the characters are noninteresting. OK yeah I was praising in the first movie they had a pure school girl for a change which is a fresher from watching models all the time in Western horror movies now they added a model who is not even nude just in swimming suit and got killed after couple scenes in a brutal killing movie.If you have not watch Gosa 1 I guess you may find this movie interesting. If you watch either one of them don't watch another one. They are just the same movie repeated with different actors.6 stars if you have not watch Gosa 1 2 stars if you did. Average 4 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great deal of viewers will pan The Clearing for being too not down to the point an intelligent suspense thriller about a wealthy man Redford kidnapped by an angry exemployee Dafoe and held for ransom until the rich business owner's wife Mirren pays the price. Although The Clearing is creatively put together I just doesn't get right down to the point. What you expect it to be is a kidnapping thriller but it turns into mostly a big discussion between Redford's character and Dafoe's character. Not that that is an insult to the film their discussions are very carefully and skillfully written it is just that we are expecting this movie to go places it doesn't go.The other half of the film consists of Mirren's character dealing with the F.B.I. and the kidnapper to get back her beloved husband. Her part of the film also consists of her chats with her two grown up children played by Laurel Canyon's Alessandro Nivola and Soul Survivor's Melissa Sagemiller who are visiting from out of town to comfort their mother in her time of need. The scenes of dialogue between Mirren and her son are very engrossing due mostly to the fact that Nivola is a great actor. However the scenes of dialogue between Mirren and her daughter are perhaps the most tedious parts of the film due mainly to the fact that Sagemiller is not a good actress and unfortunately we get to see more of the scenes between Mirren and her daughter then scenes with Mirren and her son. The most intriguing of Mirren's interactions of the film is that of her and the F.B.I. agent in charge of getting back her husband played by Matt Craven in one of his very best roles. In a whole The Clearing is a film about interactions rather than actions.The most rewarding element of Pierre Jan Brugge's The Clearing is perhaps the acting. All three leads are pitch perfect in their roles with talent to spare. Robert Redford gives us another great performance that was long awaited. Willem Dafoe is priceless and the meticulous and spooky kidnapper. I think Dafoe's role is the most interesting out of the bunch but maybe unintentionally. In the hostage scenes with Dafoe and Redford you're supposed to pay close attention to Redford's stories but Dafoe's reactions to the stories turn out to be way more interesting. I think the best performance in The Clearing which may be honored with an Oscar or at least Golden Globe nomination is Helen Mirren as the intensely worried housewife of Robert Redford. She reels you into to feeling her emotions about this horrible and stressful situation. It takes real talent for an actress to do it but it takes even more talent for an actress to do this without opening her mouth. That is what Helen Mirren achieves in this film among many others she's been featured in over the years.The ending of The Clearing is very disappointing. Although it's realistic and not hokey it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. In the last fifteen minutes of the movie they lead you down the garden path into believing everything will be made clear at the end and don't go through with it. The ending of the film will sit with you better a day after you've seen the picture then it will two seconds after the credits start rolling. You'll realize this was a smart unexpected way to end it and that it was okay to not add everything up because in real life not everything always adds up. I think the people who would be most disappointed in The Clearing are those who watch a lot of television during the week. The reason being is that on television everything is neatly put together in a package and there are no loose ends in the final moments but on film that doesn't always happen. I think film scholars would appreciate The Clearing substantially more than then the general public.In closing this is a good not great but good film from first time filmmaker Pierre Jan Brugee. Brugee does a sensational job for his first picture and presents himself like he's been doing filmmaking all his life. He is a very bold filmmaker with a lot of confidence that I'd like to see more of in the nottodistant future. review written 81604 Grade B screened at AMC Deer Valley 30 Phoenix Arizona".

	schema:reviewBody "Wayne and Eileen Hayes appear to be the ideal couple. They have a successful business live in a wealthy Pittsburgh suburb and have two welladjusted grown children. But when Wayne is kidnapped at gunpoint and held for ransom by a former employee cracks in their armor begin to show. Based on the kidnapping of a Dutch industrialist Pieter Jan Brugge's The Clearing shows two different takes on the American dream. Robert Redford plays Wayne a selfmade carrental executive who has become emotionally estranged from his wife and children. Willem Dafoe plays Arnold Mack an unemployed man who sees himself as a failure and is unable to handle the success of his onetime employer. The film tells parallel stories that operate in different time frames a unique device that deepens the puzzle. One thread revolves around Wayne handcuffed and held at gunpoint by Arnold being led through an area near the Great Smoky Mountains. The other revolves around Eileen Helen Mirren and her interactions with FBI investigator Ray Fuller Matt Craven who has set up his unit as a control center inside the Hayes home while the couple's children look on.Redford is outstanding as the intense business tycoon and Mirren gives one of her best performances portraying a tightly controlled suburbanite wife who refuses to panic even when her husband misses a dinner party she told him to be on time for. She keeps going even when it is obvious that something has gone wrong  swimming in her pool holding a birthday party for her grandchild and waiting before calling the police because she thinks that her husband may have left her. Eileen discovers through the FBI search of phone records that her husband has continued seeing another woman a relationship he'd told her was broken off. She visits Wayne's mistress Wendy Crewson and retains her composure showing emotion only in the way that she purses her lips. Always selfassured she wants to know only where their trysts had taken place and what gifts he had brought her.As Wayne and his abductor walk through the forest they engage in conversations about their lives and about opportunity in America. Wayne says that he made himself what he is today and that Arnold had the same opportunity but failed. Both play a catandmouse game but treat each other with grudging respect and it is clear that they've both paid a price. Wayne admits that his he has lost the love of his wife because of his overindulgence in his work and the lack of attention he paid to his children. He tells Arnold I love my wife... we have two beautiful kids and I'm just getting to know them. The Clearing is a quiet thoughtful film that slowly builds suspense that is not released until the very end. Although there are some contrivances in the plot the acting is superb throughout and the film works as a psychological thriller a meditation on loss and regret and a character study of two flawed but loving people who have forgotten how to express their joy in living.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Redford is an icon. From the same DNA strand as Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood younger viewers might not be as versed as to their contributions over the past fifty years of film. In fact when I asked a just 20something person at the office about Mr. Redford I got films like The Last Castle Spy Games and The Horse Whisperer as their reference to the name. No Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. No The Candidate and I won't even begin to explain the bewildered expression I received when I mentioned All The President's Men. Based on this ignorance the word sounds a lot stronger than it is intended I don't expect to see the character driven The Clearing burning up the box office figures when it is released amongst a host of summer blockbusters. With it's three main stars being in their 40's 50's and 60's I expect that younger audiences might prefer some strange movie about a radioactive spider bitten school boy that opens the same weekend.The Clearing is a story about a successful businessman Wayne Redford who is kidnapped by down on his luck Arnold Mack Willem Dafoe and held for a ransom of 10 million in a secluded forest. Motive being solely money and a second chance at life Arnold toys with Wayne's wife Eileen Helen Mirren and the F.B.I. sending them clues and cryptic instructions in efforts to secure his bounty. Like most kidnapping films the movie can only end one of two ways really and don't expect that to be revealed here. The Clearing is not the first kidnapping movie and will be far from the last. Sometimes it is done well Man on Fire sometimes bad Proof of Life and most times Hollywood and test audiences determine the ending or the amount of drama they will allow their leading cast to perform Ransom. That is why The Clearing was wellrefreshing. As a small independent film The Clearing doesn't have to answer to the harsh brass that sway their approach based on night vision goggles in darkened theaters. It can tell a story the way the filmmaker intended raw intense and without all the loose ends tied up like a front of the tree Christmas present. Instead director Pieter Jan Brugge can let his actors do what they do best and wow us with the way they work a camera and capture an audience using a look or a sneer. Pieter assembled the perfect cast for his directorial debut. Dafoe is subtle as the kidnapping brainchild but he is also able to project a vulnerability that could have been awfully laughable in the hands of a lesser actor. Redford coming off two paycheck roles in Spy Game and The Last Castle is equally convincing as a man flawed in character and without excuses. When Wayne is confronted about his infidelity he doesn't try to skirt the issue and there are no attempts to justify the action. Instead his deep blue eyes are able to relay back to the audience that of a man who wishes things could have been different and who seems genuinely concerned about the hurt he may have caused others.But maybe the best acting within the films running time is in the performance of Helen Mirren. Having to deal with the uncertainty of her husband the confrontation with his mistress and an F.B.I. agent that tends to cause more harm than benefit Mirren projects a woman of strength and stamina that is believable in her actions and in her approach to finding a fitting conclusion to the complex ordeal. Handling the situation with class and grace yet frequently in panic over the possibilities Mirren gives what is undoubtedly her strongest on screen performance in the past 10 years.It was a bit of a surprise in 2004 when The Clearing appeared at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Not that it isn't the type of film that these festivals build their foundations upon but the fact that this was the first starring vehicle for Redford to be shown at the festival to which he created. Looking at his last 10 or so role choices a better selection could not have been made.So for any of you younger folk that might find themselves to the end of this review do yourself a favor and start to amass a viewing catalog that will include Redford Newman and Eastwood while we still have time to enjoy their continued efforts. These great men might never be equaled. Heck you don't expect one day to see an Adam Sandler Salad Dressing do you?".

The Clearing is a drama with two story lines moving along in parallel. There is interesting dialogue building up to an uncertain climax. The Clearing held my interest and developed suspense. With an only 90 minute running time I kept wondering how they were going to wrap everything up. And that is the strength of this movie. It is not formulaic. You will not guess the ending.

	schema:reviewBody "The Clearing is a taut suspenseful kidnapping story. But the tension is primarily ratcheted up not by action but what we learn what stuff each of the characters is made of particularly as to how superbly Helen Mirren and Willem Dafoe surround Robert Redford. Ironically Mirren's husband Taylor Hackford directed a more muddled take on a very similar story line in Proof of Life which couldn't decide if it was an action movie or a drama. Here firsttime writer Justin Haythe and director Pieter Jan Brugge are more focused even while playing a few tricks on the viewer with timeshifting Rashomon rewinds though there are a couple of questionable holes in the story as it takes surprising directions.It's a relief to finally see Redford in a role fitting his age with an ageappropriate spouse and adult children including Alessandro Nivola not playing his usual sensual snake. It's nice to see Mirren get to play an attractive rich matron who can carry off nice clothes and hair styles as she usually hides herself in her roles.".

Ironically Mirren's husband Taylor Hackford directed a more muddled take on a very similar story line in Proof of Life which couldn't decide if it was an action movie or a drama. Here firsttime writer Justin Haythe and director Pieter Jan Brugge are more focused even while playing a few tricks on the viewer with timeshifting Rashomon rewinds though there are a couple of questionable holes in the story as it takes surprising directions.It's a relief to finally see Redford in a role fitting his age with an ageappropriate spouse and adult children including Alessandro Nivola not playing his usual sensual snake. It's nice to see Mirren get to play an attractive rich matron who can carry off nice clothes and hair styles as she usually hides herself in her roles.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was hands down the biggest surprise of a film that I have encountered in a very long time. I had to watch this film twice to fully understand and appreciate the value placed behind it. The Clearing was one of those films that didn't do well at the boxoffice so people didn't bother seeing it when it was released on video. I must admit I was one of them. I thought Redford and Dafoe doing another classic kidnapping film would be just another canister in the Hollywood recycling bin but I was wrong  actually I was dead wrong. This film brought more than just a kidnapping caper to the table it brought some family drama the unbreakable bond between husband and wife and the idea of the American Dream as told by two ends of the spectrum. I can see why this film didn't do well with the brainwashed by actionadventure crowd because there actually needed to be some thinking involved to truly appreciate this captivating film.To begin this is not a linear story. I loved this. It kept me guessing throughout the entire film as to what was happening to Redford's character while the drama at home continued to build. Here we have the events happening to Redford going on in real time and how the pressures of the immediate threat are being handled but then you have the family struggle which is taking place over several days to show how easily something like this can devastate and ravish a family. This also allowed us to become more emotionally attached to Redford's family as well as to Redford himself. Strangely I found myself equally attached to Willem Dafoe's character due to my experience living in the middle of the income line. There seemed to be some honesty and truth in the banter between Redford and Dafoe that I honestly never saw coming. Here we had two humans out in nature discussing life and death as if this was their final moments on the planet. We had front row seats with the ability to hear how these two grown men handled the stress of their day to day activities and how we could somehow relate.This was a film about relating about understanding the pressures that these individual people were experiencing. Redford was perfect as this tired father who lusts for life but just doesn't quite show it until the final moments are settling in. Dafoe should have won an Oscar for his role in this film as a very humble kidnapper who takes pride in what he is doing as well as does it with the highest amount of kindness in his heart. He does it for his wife. This brings a smile on my face to say but this is a film about wives. Each of these men are going through life to ensure that their wife stays happy and in love with them. Dafoe thinks it can happen by having enough money so his wife will not work Redford sees it too late and reminds his wife of a happy time in their marriage. It is sad from one married man to another it is a very personal and touching story about the woman that is your soul mate. Then as if director Pieter Jan Brugge didn't stab our hearts enough he gives us this expanded look at Redford's family and the inner struggles they are facing with not knowing if their father is alive.What is so interesting about this is that before this event took place there was not much of a family dynamic going on in Redford's house. They were stale and strangely this horrific event brought them closer together than imagined. We get to see the unparalleled emotion behind Helen Mirren that I have not seen in a very long time. If she would not have done this film than Charlotte Rampling would have equally been as good  in fact I kept thinking of her in this role and how skilled she would have been. Don't get me wrong Mirren was perfect but Rampling would have been perfection.Add to this mix some beautiful cinematography that adds to both the tension and beauty of the story. Some of the scenes with Dafoe and Redford in the woods were so crisp and bold that I thought I was right there in the woods with them. The way that Pieter Jan Brugge doesn't keep the camera directly on our actors just builds more tension and more excitement along the way. I thought this was a brilliant film that should have received more attention than what was given to it. I realize that some will find it slow and methodical but I found it this stunning portrait of the American family and American dream bundled up in the strangest of forms a kidnapping film. There was definitely some creativity at work here and the final product shows us that! Grade  out of ".

Here he gives a striking performance of a man who stares death in the face as contemplates his life. Both Redford and Mirren are ably assisted by Willem Dafoe as a kidnapper a man who lives in a house full of disappointed people. This isn't a happy film yet it doesn't leave one in despair because two people though separated are able to find each other again. The pace is on the slow side  rather the pace isn't pushed.

Yet for the enjoyment of a movie one requires a believable plot some pacing and editing and a feeling of involvement. In The Clearing what starts out as an intriguing mystery with a kidnapping and unknown motives turns into a slow draggy pointless exercise. Nothing much really happens and the socalled characterdriven angles as expressed by the director in his commentary really don't add up to much.Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does his best trying to engage and outwit Willem Dafoe. Dafoe brings a bit of nuance to his character insofar as one can feel somewhat sympathetic towards him. It's unfortunate that Dafoe has been typecast as a villain he's gone into the Christopher Walken Hall of Fame of Typecasting.Wendy Crewson is usually good but her character's entry into the movie was brief and contrived and I was wondering why they even bothered to introduce her character. By far the biggest waste of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's commentary all I heard was how fabulous a talent she is. I agree she's a great actress. Then why was she not used properly? Only towards the climax of this movie does she get to show herself but by then the viewer has quit caring.Too bad I liked parts of this movie but as another reviewer wrote once you're halfway in you know the film is not going to get much better.".

Ha ha. Well that confirms what most people know of the L.A. Times. For those of you who believe that and haven't seen it I won't spoil it with more of the gigantic holes in this story particularly at the end. The fact is it's an insult to anyone with intelligence.Anyway you can't fool all the people all the time as critics have yet to figure out. Here is another film they touted that justifiably bombed at the box office and video store.";

Take a kidnapping let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man deliver the money make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to 95 minutes you got your Clearing movie.

It makes no sense has absolutely ZERO action and has only one hint of being a thriller which is when Redford's wife drops off the ransom and turns back to look for her husband.

Mirren is one of the best in a generation of aging female stars slowly losing her glamor looks in the youth years but achieving a maturity and deepness only a great actress has. One of her best roles was in a BBC TV series where she played the role of the chief detective in a macho police environment. I am mentioning this because her acting in the 'Clearing' is good to the same extent and that maybe because of her because the film inherits something of the quality of the BBC series.'The Clearing' is a psychological thriller and action movie fans will be disappointed because not too much happens and what happens is not too original. A successful businessman Redford is kidnapped by a former coworker Willem Dafoe whose life was much less lucky and successful. The story splits immediately between the agony of the wife Mirren and of the rest of the family waiting for signs of life coping with the FBI investigation and agonizing around the ransom demands and the traumatic experience of the kidnap and relationship being built between the kidnapped and the kidnapper. It's after a while that you realize that the apparent parallel plans happen at different time paces. The true relation that builds in the movie is between the kidnapped man and his wife who are together only shortly at the beginning their love being given a new birth by the traumatic events.It may be that the end of the film is somehow melodramatic and too much on the expected side relative to the tension built previously by the apparently parallel story lines. This makes the film an experience that is not too exciting but still satisfying if you like well acted psychological thrillers. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.".

The intimate shots of him and his wife the estimable Helen Mirren 'Calendar Girls' almost 60 and lessaged than her outdoorsman leading man help support the theme about what disruption can do to challenge the love of two people regardless of their wealth and personal crises.'The Clearing' is a gardenvariety kidnap movie whose distinctions are its splendid photography by Denis Lenoir 'Demonlover' and actorly moments between Redford and his captor played by Willem Dafoe 'Spiderman 2'. Dafoe plays the standard 'outsider' who changes things much as Sergei Lopez did in the almostabduction 'With a Friend Like Harry' except that 'Clearing' lacks the tension of 'Harry' and is formulaic and emotionless reflecting the refined and restrained husband and wife. 'Ransom' 'Proof of Life' and 'Man on Fire' further show how difficult it is to make successful abduction films.As the 'action' moves to the conclusion a sentiment about the riches of love saves the film from imitating most madeforTV movies 'If you love me I have everything' Redford exclaims in the denouement. The couple's observable worldly wealth is the litmus for their inner wealth and the latter is the winner. Until the 'clearing' of their life down to its essentials they cannot know what 'everything' is. However it takes a determined kidnapper to clear the decks. The couple fulfills the definition of what Lawrence K. Frank described in maturation as 'relinquishing rejecting of what has been painfully learned in order to establish a new and replacing pattern.' It's just that this kidnapper is determined to keep that replacement time short. 'The Clearing' is not worth the ransom of a box office ticket if you are interested in a creative kidnapping film for the firstrate acting and cinematography it can be tolerable.".

Manion is defended by Paul Biegler James Stewart a humble smalltown lawyer and recently deposed district attorney. During the course of interviews Biegler discovers that Manion is violently possessive and jealous and also that his wife has a reputation for flirting with other men. Biegler realizes that the prosecution will try to make the court believe that Laura had been drunk and was picked up by the bartender and then Her husband killed him and beat her up when he discovered they had been together.

	schema:reviewBody "Anatomy of an excellent movieBegin with an extremely tight and well written script from the novel by the same name. While reportedly the story is based on a reallife case it is nevertheless a timeless story almost biblical presenting ageold questions of human conflicts and human dilemmas. Add to that a sensational cast starting of course with the leads Jimmy Stewart George C. Scott Lee Remick and Ben Gazarra but also the rest of the cast filled as it is with numerous accomplished and veteran stage actors and radio performers from days of yore. Character parts played by actors Arthur O'Connell Eve Arden Ken Lynch Joseph Kearns and Howard McNear. Someone paid careful attention to the casting for this film.Perhaps the most masterful stroke as far as casting goes was the casting Joseph Welch as the judge. Welch was an experienced and renowned lawyer in real life. Welch turns in a very good and a very believable performance.With the collision of those elements a great script and a great cast adding Otto Preminger as director an overseer who knew exactly what to do with it all you then have a very fine film.More than any other movie or play including modern day presentations like the television series Law  Order this 1959 movie Anatomy of a Murder even though it is now 46 years old is by far the most realistic and technically accurate courtroom drama ever produced. The conduct of the trial the examination of the witnesses the colloquy and bantering back and forth between the lawyers and between the lawyers and the judge is spoton. Every bit of it. Every question from the lawyers every objection every ruling by the judge every admonishment from the judge and the testimony of the witnesses every bit of it is realistic and believable lines that were accurately written with care and then flawlessly delivered.Beyond the technical accuracies of the legal proceedings some other aspects of the overall story were also spot on. The ambiguous ambivalence of lawyers their motivations their ethics their relative honesty. Nothing is all black or all white. Shades of gray abound. Legal cases as sport. Being a good lawyer means pushing the envelope too far bending the rules until you're told to stop. Not for justice. No not that. To win. That's why. To win. Then sanctimoniously telling themselves that the system really works better this way. The movie accurately captures the fact that reallife legal cases are very often comprised of upside down Alice in Wonderland features. Innocent people are guilty and guilty people are innocent. Good is bad and bad is good. Everything is relative. Some call it cynicism. Others cynically call it realism. Anatomy of a Murder captures all of these and more.I've read the criticism that Lee Remick was not believable that as an actress she failed at nailing the portrayal of how a true rape victim would appear and behave and that her character Laura Manion just didn't seem to have the proper affect nor strike the right emotional chord of a woman who had been raped. All I can say is that such criticism misses a humongous part of the point. It is almost mindboggling that there are viewers out there who after viewing this film somehow managed to miss it. Let me clear it up we the viewers WERE SUPPOSED to have serious doubts about whether Laura Manion had actually been raped. The question of whether she was really raped or not is central to the plot and story line. That's why Lee Remick played the part the way she did. And then in turn it was part of the story for the Jimmy Stewart character Paul Biegler to recognize this problem and the problem that it presented to his defense. He worried that the jury would see it and would also doubt that she had been raped and so that's why he propped her up in court dressed up all prim and proper with a hat over her voluptuously cascading hair and with hornedrim glasses. So yes Lee Remick nailed it. Bull's eye.Speaking of Lee Remick some say that this was the movie that put Lee Remick on the map. She was stunningly beautiful here at the ripe young age of 24. Even though the film is in black and white her red hair blue eyes and porcelain skin still manage to jump right off the screen and out at you. Has any other actress ever played the role of the beautiful and sexy lady looking to get laid any better than Lee Remick? It was a woman she reprised several times in her career sometimes with greater subtlety and understatement than others. This was her first rendition of it and it may have been the best.Anatomy of a Murder is a very complex movie with multitudes of layers and texturing where much is deftly explored but precious little is resolved. It's a movie that leaves you thinking and wondering. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Gray Anatomy";
	schema:reviewBody "Anatomy Of a Murder is probably Otto Preminger's best film. It's certainly my favorite. Adapted from a novel by Robert Traver it tells the story of a lawyer in northern Michigan and his defense of a particularly surly and violent murderer. As is always the case with Preminger scenes are filmed mostly with all the characters present in the frame. There is no crosscutting to speak of which is to say the drama plays out with the assorted characters confronting one another or at any rate with one another and the effect is one of surprising warmth and good feeling in the movie's cosier scenes which for once enhance rather than detract from the drama. I would have been quite happy to have spent much more time in lawyer Biegler's house and study with its books old furniture and broken typewriter but alas this is a murder case so one has to get down to businss.The question of whether the defendant an army officer was temporarily insane is in fact insane or is merely putting on a good show is never fully resolved. The lawyer is by no means perfect. He's a little lazy though he gets over it. One senses he's cheap. He enjoys his shabby genteel bachelor's life and isn't always responsive to the needs of his secretary who would like to get paid more regularly. In the end he proves far more dedicated and brilliant than we might have first imagined him to be but the fly in the buttermilk is that the better he gets the more complicated the case becomes and the more ambiguous everything gets the more he finds out about his client and the man he killed. In this respect the movie is a masterpiece of ambiguity. Beautifully shot on location in black and white it is more gray than anything else. Morally gray. No one is quite what he appears to be at first. And people change or rather we learn more about them. The bartender at the resort where his boss was killed at first comes off as a jerk in time he comes to seem more of a jerk. Then he seems maybe not so bad after all and then he's a jerk once more but a jerk we understand. The lawyer's assistant an onagain offagain recovering alcoholic is also a mixed bag. He is dogged but sloppy and always or so it appears on the verge of breakdown. Or at least this is how Arthur O'Connell plays him. The prosecuting attorney is a dolt but he is aided by a legal bigwig the state has brought in but this hotshot is no match for the cunning country lawyer. The defendant's wife who 'started the whole thing' is gorgeous sexy and provocative. She makes a play for her husband's lawyer but he doesn't bite. One wonders about her. And one wonders about the marriage she and her hottempered spouse really have and whether it will last.This is a very sophisticated and adult movie for 1959 or for that matter today. The location filming greatly enhances the mood chilly and very upper midwestern. Yet indoors one feels different and the tone is often playful. The actors are superb. James Stewart is gritty lovable homespun physically slow and mentally quick and for all the familiarity there is about his screen persona out of character that is in character he manages continually to surprise and delight. He was a true actor. Ben Gazzara is very Method actorish which suits him well in his role as the volatile military man. Lee Remick is stunning as his wife and one can well imagine a man killing for her many times over. She is also a good actress. George C. Scott plays the state's bulldog prosecutor well though he's an acquired taste at best. His hamminess contrasts with Stewart's folksy naturalism in interesting ways not ungermane to the plot but he is outacted and outclassed by the old pro he is presumably upstaging in this film.".

He enjoys his shabby genteel bachelor's life and isn't always responsive to the needs of his secretary who would like to get paid more regularly. In the end he proves far more dedicated and brilliant than we might have first imagined him to be but the fly in the buttermilk is that the better he gets the more complicated the case becomes and the more ambiguous everything gets the more he finds out about his client and the man he killed. In this respect the movie is a masterpiece of ambiguity. Beautifully shot on location in black and white it is more gray than anything else. Morally gray. No one is quite what he appears to be at first. And people change or rather we learn more about them. The bartender at the resort where his boss was killed at first comes off as a jerk in time he comes to seem more of a jerk. Then he seems maybe not so bad after all and then he's a jerk once more but a jerk we understand. The lawyer's assistant an onagain offagain recovering alcoholic is also a mixed bag. He is dogged but sloppy and always or so it appears on the verge of breakdown. Or at least this is how Arthur O'Connell plays him. The prosecuting attorney is a dolt but he is aided by a legal bigwig the state has brought in but this hotshot is no match for the cunning country lawyer. The defendant's wife who 'started the whole thing' is gorgeous sexy and provocative. She makes a play for her husband's lawyer but he doesn't bite. One wonders about her. And one wonders about the marriage she and her hottempered spouse really have and whether it will last.This is a very sophisticated and adult movie for 1959 or for that matter today. The location filming greatly enhances the mood chilly and very upper midwestern. Yet indoors one feels different and the tone is often playful. The actors are superb. James Stewart is gritty lovable homespun physically slow and mentally quick and for all the familiarity there is about his screen persona out of character that is in character he manages continually to surprise and delight. He was a true actor. Ben Gazzara is very Method actorish which suits him well in his role as the volatile military man. Lee Remick is stunning as his wife and one can well imagine a man killing for her many times over. She is also a good actress. George C. Scott plays the state's bulldog prosecutor well though he's an acquired taste at best. His hamminess contrasts with Stewart's folksy naturalism in interesting ways not ungermane to the plot but he is outacted and outclassed by the old pro he is presumably upstaging in this film.";

I became aware of the following information while attending Northern Michigan University in Marquette MI over a few tall drinks with John D. Volker the author years ago.This great courtroom drama is set in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. To be more specific the cities of Marquette Negaunee and Ishpeming and the village of Big Bay and is based on a true murder case that took place there. The names of the cities and people are changed in the movie but it is filmed on the same locations that the murder case took place. The screenplay was written by John D. Volker who wrote his novels under the pen name Robert Travers and was based on his first novel. He was from Ishpeming Iron City in the movie and a Michigan Supreme Court Justice when he reviewed the appeal of this case and turned it into a detailed novel and then screenplay. The movie is given an extra dose of authenticity by using the unique people of the Upper Peninsula as extras and in minor roles. The point of all this historical information is that along with a hard hitting realistic style by director Otto Premenger great score by Duke Ellington plus top notch true to life performances by the excellent cast Jimmy Stewart Ben Gazara Lee Remick George C. Scott et.al this black and white film is more reality than fiction and being aware of this adds to impact of this psychological courtroom drama. This is a true human experience written by an author from the area directly from the original court transcripts filmed where it happened in a style that fits the subject matter where it actually happened with a cast that really knows what they are doing. If you like ripped from reality courtroom dramas does it get better?".

The script is sharp cool and meticulous the direction and cinematography both effective and completely unobtrusive and the famous jazz score adds quite a bit to the film as a whole.Although we can't help rooting for Stewart as the film progresses it seems more and more likely that Remick is lying through her teeth and Gazzara is as guilty as sinbut the film balances its elements in such a way as to achieve a disturbing ambiguity that continues right through to the end. If you expect a courtroom thriller with sudden revelations and twists you'll likely be disappointed in ANATOMY OF A MURDER but if you want a thoughtprovoking take on the law you'd be hard pressed to find one better.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to think of any film that can surpass Otto Preminger's superb courtroom drama. Having seen this film countless times now I'm hooked each time I see it. Usually I find most courtroom dramas not all that fascinating. Most of them work up to the point they enter the courtroom after which most of the sparkle disappears. That's definitely not the case in this film. The writing is just as riveting I don't think it's dated and in a way every film is dated as it was back then and the film is greatly boosted by a fantastic cast led by Stewart in perhaps the best role of his career and that says something. It's a long film 160 min but I never even notice the lengthy running time. It could go on for two hours more as far as I'm concerned.The film is set in Thunder Bay in Northern Michigan a town that lives mainly of tourism and the nearby army base. Stewart plays Paul Biegler an easygoing small town Michigan lawyer at the dawn of his career who likes to spend his spare time going fishing and play a tune on the piano once in a while to relax himself. One day he is called by a young woman Lee Remick to defend the case of her husband an army lieutenant Ben Gazzara who is accused of murdering the rapist of his beautiful seductive wife. He decides to take the case but the prosecution calls in reinforcements from Lansing in the person of bigcity prosecutor George C. Scott who claims it's a case of cold blooded murder. The unfolding of the story with captivating new insights after each new witness and several surprising twists and turns will have you glued to your seat. The courtroom theatrics are outrageous and they would probably never be allowed in a real courtroom as the two lawyers try everything even the lowest tricks in the book to make their case. The crossexaminations are riveting and at times very funny. Preminger mainly uses long takes without too much crosscutting and closeups and in every take there's something droll like the courtroom scene where George C. Scott continuously tries to block the view between Stewart and Remick when he questions her on the stand. Strangely enough when Stewart bursts out in protest about this behaviour it becomes even funnier when the two lawyers start bickering at each other in high fashion.Arthur O'Connell is simply fantastic as Stewart's alcoholic sidekick and Eve Arden is equally memorable as his cynical lacetongued secretary hoping to receive her longdue paycheck with this case. Reallife judge Joseph N. Welch is a marvel to watch in his role as Judge Weaver. Welch got most famous in real life because he stood up against communist witch hunter senator McCarthy during the Army hearings and told him on live television Have you no sense of decency sir?Duke Ellington provided the score and also makes a brief appearance behind the piano in a nightly bar scene.This is as good as it gets extremely well written superbly acted directed scored every minute of it is supremely entertaining. A completely winning combination. Camera Obscura  1010".

	schema:headline " Classy courtroom drama that trades on it's cynical edge";
	schema:reviewBody "Lawyer Paul Biegler takes the case of Lt. Manion who killed a man after he discovered he had raped his wife Laura.  Biegler realises that the cards are not all in his favour and begins to ensure that the facts are spun in his favour as much as possible during the trial.This film caused a stir back when it was released  supposedly over the dialogue that contained words not used before in a motion picture.  However it was more likely that the furore was over the cynical view of the legal profession that the film has.  The story is good but if you're looking for a John Grisham type film with shouting and ridiculous twists in the final reel then you're in the wrong place.  What we have here is a clever interesting story that moves slowly  focusing on Biegler rather than twists and turns in the actual plot.Biegler is sort of clean cut but he seems like a real lawyer  he twists facts and prompts lies in order to improve his case.  The various tricks and theatrical shenanigans during the trail are also well observed.  The characters are all interesting with only the judge seeming like a dull stereotype.James Stewart is excellent and helps make the shifty lawyer more likeable and relatable.  Remick is excellent as the flirtatious Laura while Gazzara is cool as the accused.  George C Scott doesn't have much to do but does well anyway.Overall a very enjoyable courtroom thriller  it lacks the fireworks of modern legal dramas but has a nice cynical edge to it that shows it isn't as in awe of the law as Grisham is.".

Biegler realises that the cards are not all in his favour and begins to ensure that the facts are spun in his favour as much as possible during the trial.This film caused a stir back when it was released  supposedly over the dialogue that contained words not used before in a motion picture.  However it was more likely that the furore was over the cynical view of the legal profession that the film has.

It works admirably both as a story and as a portrayal of the workings of the law. It avoids the labored dramatics and contrived resolutions in which so many movies of the genre indulge and it also declines to shy away from pointing out the more illconceived features of the legal system.From his first scene James Stewart pulls the viewer right into the world of lawyer Paul Biegler. It takes little time before you come to know him and to get a pretty good idea of what his life is like. His scenes with Arthur O'Connell work well in rounding out the picture. The two are neither heroic nor brilliant but simply sympathetic and believable.Into Biegler's world then come the characters played by Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick a married couple with more than their share of faults. By making them less than ideal clients the movie takes a chance on losing the audience's sympathy but it adds credibility and complexity to the story. Both roles are played well  again it seems as if you know a lot more about them than is specifically stated.When George C. Scott enters the picture he adds yet another dimension. His character arrives at just the right time to complicate the plot and his legal skirmishing with Stewart makes some dry material come to life in an interesting way. Eve Arden also has some good moments and her character is used in just the right amount to add some amusement without causing a distraction from the main story. It's also interesting to see Joseph Welch as the judge and his portrayal works well enough.Otto Preminger holds everything together nicely with the right amount of detail and a pace that keeps the story moving steadily. The result is a very nice contrast to the many runofthe mill legalcourtroom movies that present such an idealized view of the justice system. It maintains a careful balance making clear the flaws and unpleasant realities of the system yet never taking cheap shots either. And it's also an interesting and involved story one of the most carefullycrafted of its kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of Preminger's films haven't aged well but this one still works thanks mostly to the casting of Jimmy Stewart and Geroge C Scott. Stewart much like Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men commands the stage. He's an iconic actor and every moment he's on screen tingles with a sort of fun electricity.But the problem with old crime films and courtroom dramas is that they've now been done to death. Every TV show from Law and Order to Columbo has squeezed the life out of the genre. Most of these TV shows offer far cleverer scripts.Anatomy of a Murder still packs a punch though. It's filled with a nice sense of sexuality a riveting trial scene and some pretty risqu dialogue. The script which focuses on rape sexual assault and abuse was very daring at the time. Preminger even sly acknowledges that his film was uncomfortably near to violating the Production Code by having his characters debate the proper way of referring to a pair of panties in court. Is this allowed they ask or is it going over the top? The plot is the usual murder mystery fare but there's a nice sense of ambiguity. Nothing is clearly resolved and the moral waters are very murky. In the end we aren't quite sure whether justice has actually been served.Premminger  usually a very flat director  maneuvers his camera with skill during the courtroom sequences juggling angles and making the most of the small spaces. Architecturally it's not as brilliant as what Lumet did in 12 Angry Men but it's still pretty entertaining.But the film's real star is Jimmy Stewart. Stewart plays the usual country lawyer archetype but though he appears easy going he reveals some impressive fangs when challenged. It's a far cry from Capra's smalltown lawyers. Issues are never clearcut characters are always morally ambiguous and everyone seems to have a nasty streak.7.510  I generally don't like Otto Preminger but this film held my interest. It's not as good as Lumet's 12 Angry Men or The Verdict but it still works thanks largely to the ever reliable Jimmy Stewart.".

Nor was it a movie with the compelling issue ploughing story line like To Kill a Mockingbird. At the same time it lacked historical interest but the incredibly dramatised realism of Judgement at Nuremberg. Instead I thought a film with a two and a half hour run time and I hate sitting in front of movies running longer than two hours as it is!I found it but it took me a while to realise the one great asset this movie had. Jimmy Stewart.Without a doubt this engrossing movie about rape murder and law evoked memories of a Jimmy Stewart seen twenty years earlier in Mr Smith Goes to Washington. The small town humble idealised man who triumphs over the hard headed city men. In a sense almost the It's a Wonderful Life of 1959 with no angels no attempted suicides no wonderful sentimental reminding message of what life is about. One of the best things about the movie is the Duke Ellington score. The brass jazz sounds against the actual darkness of the plot completely and totally surprised me it being so different to the usual dark sombre tones screeching string instruments trying to stir suspense in the audience.Supporting cast is great. Lee Remick Eve Arden Arthur O'Connell and George C. Scott all put in great performances. But I enjoyed Jimmy very much as the fisherman lively wise cracking lawyer. Otto Preminger directed Laura fifteen years earlier. Seems a bit like similar plot lines. Beautiful woman caught up in murder men lusting after beautiful woman continual plot turns and all the rest. But Preminger directed this film well. What did I find by the end? I found some of the the sarcastic suspense in Jimmy and the film similar to Billy Wilder's Witness for the Prosecution. The drama was just as alive as it was with Judgement at Nuremberg. I found myself pulled in as much as I was with To Kill a Mockingbird. In short I really recommend this film to everyone who enjoys a few thrills and suspense.In fact I liked it so much I'm going to read the book.Rating 910".

Yes of course it takes liberties with the law but it also admits to many of the courtroom tacticstheatrics that are still in use today and admitted to them at a time when people still liked to think of the law as a noble profession.The performances in this movie are incredible  Jimmy Stewart is the very picture of subtle humor and cynicism. Lee Remick and Ben Gazzara are perfect. But I'd like to point out two oftoverlooked performances that really shine. Arthur O'Connell's portrayal of Parnell develops beautifully over the course of the film as he comes to believe in himself again. My favorite character is Maida played by Eve Arden. She's wry she's funny she mothers Paul and Parnell and it's clear to everybody that not only couldn't they survive without her but she's also the smartest one of them all.I could spend a great deal of time on territory others have covered  the soundtrack the filmmaking the courtroom scenes the performances. But instead I'll focus on my favorite thing. The story is my favorite. Not because it was groundbreaking or shocking  but because of its point of view. Everything you see and know in the movie is through the eyes of Paul Biegler. Through the entire courtroom battle all the interviews with the Lt. and with Laura Manion every strategy scene straight through to the end you only know what Biegler knows.  You never see the usual flashback scene to what really happened that night and it would cheapen the film if you did. Biegler never knows if the outcome of the film is the right one or if anyone told the truth at all. This same POV means that you never see any aspect of the events that lead to the trial  the murder the alleged rape etc. Nor does the viewer ever meet Barney Quill thus never allowing the viewer to base an opinion of the events on Quill's character  just the same way as Paul  Biegler cannot.That POV aspect is the thing that makes this film my favorite of all time. It's why I've seen it dozens of times spent a year tracking down the videotape before they rereleased it and have the poster hanging in my living room.  See it. Trust me.".

It had the amazing Jimmy Stewart. It also had that great sound track provided by Duke Ellington. But never the less I couldn't help but feeling kind of board. Maybe it was because the film was completely the opposite of what I expected. With a title like Anatomy of a Murder and Jimmy Stewart Star of many Hitchcock classics I thought it was show us well A MURDER. Instead the film picks up a few days after the event it self and is just a trial movie from start to finish. This still could have been the makings of a good movie. Stewart defending an innocent man with huge amounts of evidence stacked against him would have been a good way to go even if not a very original trial movie. Instead they have a some sleazy Jerk named Manion who lives in a mobile home and is unkind and unappreciative of his gorgeous wife. Manion shot a bar owner with a dozen witnesses because the guy had raped his wife. This  was obviously not a good thing of the bar owner to do but Manion kills the bar owner hours after the event because he says I have the unwritten law on my side. So he thought he could do it in cold blood and get off scot free. So Jimmy tells Manion he can only get of if he actually committed the murder while insane. So Manion fabricates a lie that he went temporarily insane. Manion goes to see an army psychiatrist to add some weight his lie. He lies to the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist says Manion had an unavoidable urge to kill the man.  The rest of this overly long movie is the trial. In which Jimmy calls up a bunch of witnesses in order make the jury somehow thing that this dirt bag deserves to not be punished for his crime.  Then at the end of the movie 160 of the longest and most boring minutes of my life later Manion is declared Not Guilty by a jury that has been lied to immensely. Then Masion Repays Jimmy Stewart by.............Driving off in his Mobile home with his wife with out paying Stewart a dime. He leaves' Stewart a note I had an unavoidable urge' to leave. Masion may have Committed a felony by lying under oath during his trail but at least he can joke about it.  Besides what is the reason they made this film? To teach us that you can abuse the legal system in order to not be punished for your crimes? All and all the movie is pretty slow and boring and pointless. if you like Jimmy Stewart and want to see him in a movie were a your actually get to SEE a murder instead of just hearing about it for two hours and 40 minutes see the brilliant Hitchcock film Rope'.".

James Stewart gives a wonderful performance as a brilliant smalltown lawyer a cross between Perry Mason and Ben Matlock. The courtroom duels between Stewart and prosecutor George C. Scott are wonderful. A very young Lee Remick is excellent as the sexstarved tramp of a wife to Ben Gazzara  a precursor to today's Desperate Housewives perhaps? In addition the film is directed by the legendary Otto Preminger best known to those of my generation as Mr. Freeze on the old BATMAN show. So why isn't this film better known? The answer is simple  the ending is terrible. You keep waiting and waiting for all the loose ends all the characters all the drama to be wrapped up in one slambang finale a la WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. Sadly none of this occurs. This film left me feeling empty and cheated. I guess it is never a waste of time to spend almost 3 hours watching Jimmy Stewart at his midcareer best but this was a oneshot deal for me. I won't watch it again and do not recommend it  unless you turn it off right before the end and just imagine what COULD have happened.".

Reminds me of Orson Welles' movie with Vivian Leigh and I wasn't crazy about the sound in that one either. And speaking of the music it's so obvious that Jimmy Stewart is miming at the piano. He isn't even trying. Music is just the beginning of misses for this movie tho.2 It's never entirely clear what happened. I have to surmise that Lieutenant Manion struck his wife out of jealousy that she'd returned home having been with the bar owner and presumably Manion killed him as part of that same rage but it's not clear to me that this is true. Therefore it's not really clear to me what this movie is about. I prefer the ambiguity of the Big Sleep which was already pretty ambiguous before a series of edits made it almost indiscernable. The diff is that in the Big Sleep I felt like even if I didn't understand the exact turn of events the characters were deeper and there was more to grab onto.3 Parnell's character is pedantic and tiresome and only grows more so by the end with his oration about juries4 It's not clear to me how the prosecution failed to expose Manion's poor character to the jury. The prosecution barely asked him any questions save two. Manion should have been grilled. He should have been induced into a fit of anger and the prosecution should have been able to clearly link it to his violent feelings for his wife. There relationship was a sham and it's surprising to me that the prosecution couldn't reveal that.5 I don't understand the pivotal scene where Mary Pilant admits finding white panties. Exactly what would torn panties be doing in the laundry? I can think of two reasons 1 her father put them therebecause he had done nothing wrong or 2 someone else put them there as a frame. The prosecution did not pursue either idea carefully enough.6 Jimmy Stewart had a whole fridge full of fish. Was his intention to throw a buffet because fish only keeps 23 days in a fridge.So these are just things off the top of my head but there were more inconsistencies which bugged me. I'd say this film was not carefully planned. However it does have Jimmy Stewart and George Scott in it. Murry Hamilton was also a strong point. There are some things going for this film but it's too hastily conceived to be one of my favorites. Still I watch it from time to time.".

	schema:headline " Completely overrated";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't see the point of a movie that goes to great lengths to tell a story that says nothing. When you have the money to give attention to great production values and employ a topnotch cast why would you waste it on a pointless story? I was only mildly entertained by this film mostly thanks to Jimmy Stewart and his asperusual impeccable acting but when the ending came and there was no payoff I found that what little entertainment present was not satisfying enough to make up for it.Good ol' Jimmy Stewart is Paul Biegler a lawyer that was recently ousted from his position as district attorney by some younger blood. Biegler comes upon the case of Lt. Manion Ben Gazzara accused of murdering the man that raped his wife Lee Remick and Biegler hesitant at first decides to take it defending Manion with an insanity plea. This insanity plea could have led to some good drama indicting the justice system as containing too many loopholes for guilty men. Instead the movie continues the story without focusing on this and misses the chance to make the point.Here at the beginning the movie shows promise. The actors prove to be very good from the very start. Stewart who was often unjustly accused of lacking versatility is actually quite different from the George Bailey everyone knows the difference in Stewart's characters is always subtle but it's there nonetheless and he received an Oscar nomination for his subtlety. Here he seems weathered and jaded but still goodnatured and sensible. Lee Remick begins the movie wonderfully as a carefree femme fatale who doesn't properly react to her husband's incarceration. The scenes between Remick and Stewart are the best in the movie as she flirts with him and seemingly looks to seduce him however the film doesn't follow through on this as with so many other things. Halfway through the movie the script seems to forget that Stewart and Remick had such good chemistry and removes from our sight any juicy scenes with the two of them.The trial part of the movie is entertaining enough even though it falls into the clich of overly loud laughter from the court audience whenever the judge or attorney makes a joke but it still left me longing for more. George C. Scott who was nominated for an Academy Award inexplicably adds barely anything to the movie. Scott is definitely a great actor see Patton but he's greatly underused here as the lawyer the district attorney brings in to help with the case. All he manages to get across is that his character is a snob.And then at the end of the trial the ruling is given and that's that. Is it too much to expect something more from a movie? I understand there are movies that are made specifically for entertainment but this is not one of them there is nothing so entertaining here to rest an entire movie on it. I know it's adapted from a novel so I don't really know if the author of the book is to blame or the filmmakers but it doesn't really matter who's to blame the movie still isn't good.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't see the point of a movie that goes to great lengths to tell a story that says nothing. When you have the money to give attention to great production values and employ a topnotch cast why would you waste it on a pointless story? I was only mildly entertained by this film mostly thanks to Jimmy Stewart and his asperusual impeccable acting but when the ending came and there was no payoff I found that what little entertainment present was not satisfying enough to make up for it.Good ol' Jimmy Stewart is Paul Biegler a lawyer that was recently ousted from his position as district attorney by some younger blood. Biegler comes upon the case of Lt. Manion Ben Gazzara accused of murdering the man that raped his wife Lee Remick and Biegler hesitant at first decides to take it defending Manion with an insanity plea. This insanity plea could have led to some good drama indicting the justice system as containing too many loopholes for guilty men. Instead the movie continues the story without focusing on this and misses the chance to make the point.Here at the beginning the movie shows promise. The actors prove to be very good from the very start. Stewart who was often unjustly accused of lacking versatility is actually quite different from the George Bailey everyone knows the difference in Stewart's characters is always subtle but it's there nonetheless and he received an Oscar nomination for his subtlety. Here he seems weathered and jaded but still goodnatured and sensible. Lee Remick begins the movie wonderfully as a carefree femme fatale who doesn't properly react to her husband's incarceration. The scenes between Remick and Stewart are the best in the movie as she flirts with him and seemingly looks to seduce him however the film doesn't follow through on this as with so many other things. Halfway through the movie the script seems to forget that Stewart and Remick had such good chemistry and removes from our sight any juicy scenes with the two of them.The trial part of the movie is entertaining enough even though it falls into the clich of overly loud laughter from the court audience whenever the judge or attorney makes a joke but it still left me longing for more.

	schema:reviewBody "ANATOMY OF A MURDER was Otto Preminger's attempt to relate a subject hinted about in motion pictures but rarely gone into great detail. The subject was rape and it's consequences and how the rape victim frequently found herself under attack in our law courts when the issues of the case hinged on her moral innocence or guilt.The story takes place in the upper peninsula of Michigan near a resort town. There is a military base nearby and Ben Gazzara is a lieutenant there married to Lee Remick. It is the second marriage for both of them. Remick is extraordinary pretty and her best features are highlighted by the tight fitting casual clothes she wears. She also is aware of how attractive she is to other men than her husband.One night while Gazzara is sleeping after dinner Remick goes to the local bar for some fun austensibly drinking and playing pinball. She is playing it with the bar owner who subsequently gives her a car ride home. Except for her pet dog nobody witnesses what happens in the car  her story is that the man raped her twice and she ran home and told her husband. Gazzara one hour later goes to the bar and shoots the owner five times.Was there a rape? The police made a cursory examination and find that while there are some signs of a struggle there is no trace of sperm. Remick's panties are missing but they may just have been hidden by her. She did have some bruises including one of her eye but they could be due to a beating from anyone else. Gazzara is arrested and charged with the murder. And Remick calls in Jimmy Stewart.He was the former District Attorney for the town but has been recently defeated after ten years of service. His staff consists of Eve Arden and when he sober Arthur O'Connor. Stewart has handled prosecutions and has never handled any criminal defense. He would not only face the current District Attorney Brooks West but an additional big city prosecutor George C. Scott  in his first major movie role. Stewart finds that aside from the ironclad case the prosecution has the lack of evidence conclusively showing a rape and the time issue of one hour between said rape and the killing prevent him putting forward a defense of temporary insanity. He also finds that both Gazzara and Remick are difficult figures to fit into a respectable couple image for what he has to do.There had been plenty of first rate courtroom dramas in previous years in the movies such as THE STORY ON PAGE ONE and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION but nothing had been so carefully shown as this case was. The tactics of both defense and prosecution are demonstrated with the careful maneuvering of questions and answers and the attempt to probe for weaknesses in each other's cases. And Scott's crossexamination of Remick bringing out her somewhat promiscuous character reminds us of what usually happened and still does in rape cases. The character of the wise judge in the case was played by Joseph Welch the Boston legal whiz who smashed Senator Joseph McCarthy to kindling very quietly and with dignity in 1954 at the ArmyMcCarthy hearings on television. Here in his only movie role Judge Welch shows the same courtly calm and dignity that adds to the sense of reality of the film.Well acted and directed this film has to be on anyone's list of top ten court room films.".

The early scenes of Berlin in the 1920's are notable for a glimpse of the times and that they were shot on location. The plot is moralistic but not without intrigue. It's also very interesting to see a young Dietrich before the meticulous attention to her glamorous look in American films. I searched for many years to find any copy of Cafe Electric as a diehard fan who wanted to see everything she was ever in before finding a DVD available from forgottenfilms.net. There are no special features or even scene selection but the musical score and English titles are very good. Cafe Electric is a must see for those interested in silent films of the '20's and especially Marlene Dietrich fans.".

However the most telling difference that irremediably separates both is this Austrians drink coffee and Germans drink beer. Having in mind such important and transcendental facts the film Caf Elektric 1927 will then be comprehensible for any silent audience. The picture was directed by Herr Gustav Ucicky one of the most important and versatile Austrian film pioneers and depicts a trilateral and troublesome relationship connected in different ways and with Vienna as the background.Frau Erni Gttlinger  Frau Marlene Dietrich  is a spoiled rich girl daughter of a very important construction entrepreneur  Herr Fritz Alberti  and she becomes terribly attracted to a pickpocket Herr Fredl  Herr Willi Forst . Herr Max Stger  Herr Igo Sym  is a young engineer who works for Herr Gttlinger who does not focus exclusively on his construction business when a young frulein  Frau Anny Cotti  is around. Meanwhile Frau Hansi  Frau Nina Vanna  an old friend of Herr Fredl enjoys the Vienna night life though not in the same way as Frau Paula a prostitute  Vera Salvotti . For many silent film connoisseurs this film is a special one due to the fact that Frau Marlene Dietrichin her pre icon days is in it but her part is unremarkable and less striking in comparison to Frau Nina Vanna as Hansi und Frau Vera Salvotti whose performance as a not so young streetwalker who knows the years are catching up with her is especially effective.In the male roles Herr Willy Forst has probably the most clichd one performing the quintessential man without a heart who exploits women for money  hmmm this Herr Graf can hear the bells . More interesting is Herr Fritz Alberti as Herr Gttlinger a more subtle wicked character an old man who enjoys seducing bad young girls those bells are ringing again perhaps not unlike his foolish daughter.In the background is the Caf Elektric a nightclub in Austrian parameters and which has nothing in common with the Germans cabarets natrlich!!... The atmosphere is wicked and shapes the evolution and personal circumstances of the characters. Herr Ucicky does particularly well with these indoor nightlife scenes but of course includes charming exteriors of Vienna as well.Although the last part of the film is lost some title cards explains the missing scenes what remains is certainly very interesting and attractive a combination of fiction and hyperrealism the kind of picture that this Herr Graf likes so much. And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must drink a decaffeinated coffee with some drops of whiskey.".

	schema:reviewBody "After what she considered a lack lustre beginning to her movie career Marlene Dietrich returned to the stage where she accepted the role of the wise cracking chorus girl Rubie in the Berlin production of Broadway the sensational George Abbott play that had already taken the real Broadway by storm. When the play reached Vienna it's star Willi Forst was engaged to make the movie Cafe Elektric and at his urging Marlene was given one of the female leads in this strong drama. She made such a favourable impression in her flashy role with both audiences and critics that she was soon being compared to Greta Garbo.Fast stepping Erni Dietrich is the daughter of a construction tycoon who moves in pretty fast circles himself. She makes the acquaintance of Ferdl Forst a debonair man of the streets who makes his living from women's generosity money. At an up market coffee house when he engages Erni in a sensuous Black Bottom dance they both want to meet again. The other side of the coin is the Cafe Elektric  a low cafe where the underworld can meet the elite and it is there Ferdl likes to hang out. Meanwhile Hansi I don't know anything about beautiful Nina Vanna but she looks like a fetching Bebe Daniels Ferdl's old flame has made her own conquest  it is Max Igo Sym who has been jilted by Erni and has gone to the Cafe Elektric to drown his sorrows. This is the decadent Vienna of the 1920s nothing is left to the imagination. When Ferdl takes Erni to his room for a late night coffee breakfast shows Erni putting on her stockings!! Unfortunately Ferdl sees her only as another woman he can sponge off and she is happy to oblige  even to stealing from her father!! She thinks she is sophisticated but compared to the denizens of the Cafe Elektric she is a babe in the wood!! Ferdl thinks he and Hansi should team up again but Hansi thinks she has found with Max her true love!!Things come to a head one night at the cafe  Erni has stolen a ring from her father Fredl has given the ring to Hansi who is then confronted by Erni's father about the ring she is wearing and seeing Ferdl with Erni she immediately points him out as the thief. Oddly enough Fredl and Erni disappear from the movie and the story takes up the struggle of Max and Hansi who marry but find only hardship and poverty due to Max's inability to find employment. The last reel is missing but there is a general wrap up of the story to show that it ends on a far more hopeful note than the depressing end of the last reel.Cafe Elektric also introduced Gustav Ucicky as an exciting new director unfortunately with blatant propaganda movies like Morgenrot 1933 and Fluchtlinge 1933 he quickly became a top director for Hitler and the National Socialist Party. Even more chilling was the life led by Igo Sym who although he lived in Poland collaborated with the Gestapo and betrayed many celebrities who were trying to live incognito. He was eventually caught by the Polish underground and executed in his apartment in 1941.".

	onyx:emotionText "After what she considered a lack lustre beginning to her movie career Marlene Dietrich returned to the stage where she accepted the role of the wise cracking chorus girl Rubie in the Berlin production of Broadway the sensational George Abbott play that had already taken the real Broadway by storm. When the play reached Vienna it's star Willi Forst was engaged to make the movie Cafe Elektric and at his urging Marlene was given one of the female leads in this strong drama. She made such a favourable impression in her flashy role with both audiences and critics that she was soon being compared to Greta Garbo.Fast stepping Erni Dietrich is the daughter of a construction tycoon who moves in pretty fast circles himself. She makes the acquaintance of Ferdl Forst a debonair man of the streets who makes his living from women's generosity money. At an up market coffee house when he engages Erni in a sensuous Black Bottom dance they both want to meet again. The other side of the coin is the Cafe Elektric  a low cafe where the underworld can meet the elite and it is there Ferdl likes to hang out. Meanwhile Hansi I don't know anything about beautiful Nina Vanna but she looks like a fetching Bebe Daniels Ferdl's old flame has made her own conquest  it is Max Igo Sym who has been jilted by Erni and has gone to the Cafe Elektric to drown his sorrows. This is the decadent Vienna of the 1920s nothing is left to the imagination. When Ferdl takes Erni to his room for a late night coffee breakfast shows Erni putting on her stockings!! Unfortunately Ferdl sees her only as another woman he can sponge off and she is happy to oblige  even to stealing from her father!! She thinks she is sophisticated but compared to the denizens of the Cafe Elektric she is a babe in the wood!! Ferdl thinks he and Hansi should team up again but Hansi thinks she has found with Max her true love!!Things come to a head one night at the cafe  Erni has stolen a ring from her father Fredl has given the ring to Hansi who is then confronted by Erni's father about the ring she is wearing and seeing Ferdl with Erni she immediately points him out as the thief.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Probably number two on my mental list. The cast is superb. I can't imagine anyone else filling the parts more perfectly. The imagery and the very way the movie is presented is a work of art. It's like art imitating life imitating art. There is also musical treats for one Delibes The Flower Duet from his opera Lakme! From my Taoist perspective this movie reflects the wisdom of letting life happen instead of trying to aggressively make it happen. When Polly tried to be something she was not meant to be the results were disastrous. When she finally realized her inner nature was not a weakness but her strength she triumphed! Mary Joseph was the catalyst that made Polly finally begin to realize she was not some freak by defending the photo on the floor and clarifying her own relationship with Gabrielle. It was especially interesting when Polly and Gabrielle were chatting about relationships and society during one of Polly's dreams. The Freudian quote reflects a wisdom that has been lost in time but still very valid and true. This movie also mirrors the disconnect and lovehate relationships between artists and art critics. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under 30 unless you are the old soul type or somewhat intellectual. Otherwise you won't get it and there's no special effects graphic violence or steamy sex. The insight and wisdom required to understand a movie such as this comes mostly with age. I have also known people that have acquired such insight via LSD as I probably did but I DO NOT RECOMMEND that route! The reasons why are because it's 40 years too late Timothy Leary is dead and without such a guide as he the side effects from an illegally or poorly manufactured drug would be dangerous and deadly!".

She's lonely too and this detail is wonderfully depicted in a scene which shows her preparing some food and eating by herself with only her cat as company. Her hobby is photography and she hopes that her boss will like her photographs with heartbreaking results when Gabrielle tells her without knowing that they're Polly's that her photos are trite made flesh. The pain she feels will speak volumes to anyone who fancied himherself an artist only to face the scorn or disinterest of others. However the truthfulness of this moment is slightly marred by the ending in which Gabrielle seems to realize that her photos are indeed good this seems like too much of a tackedon happy ending. Gabrielle's character is not so well delineated although it's quite poignant to see a person who is fascinated by and knows a lot about art and yet knows that she has no talent herself.".

It is a clever movie that tells an original story about a unique character who takes quirkiness to a new and quite charming level. The film utilizes the main character Polly's odd dreams to foreshadow and explain events throughout its 81 minuet running. Although some may find it to be too complicated or think that it makes no sense a closer look reveals many creative and clever elements that can help one better understand the film and its characters. Some such elements are Polly's first dream which in about a minuet manages to foreshadow the entire film and the film's final scene which demonstrates that Gabrielle has come to realize that aging does not take away from beauty thanks to Polly. The film also shows its aptitude for symbolism in the names of certain locations namely the Church Gallery. The art gallery's name represents Polly's worship as one could call it of Gabrielle and the world of art. Despite all of this I've Heard the Mermaids Signing only grossed 1408491 in the box office far less than the 597th most grossing movie of all time Collateral which made 100003492. I believe that a movie with such a creative plot and with characters that are extremely relatable and lovable deserves to be much higher on the list. A list I feel I should point out that it didn't even make. Saying that this film is underappreciated is a massive understatement.".

	schema:headline " A perfect blend of comedy clever plotting and character study";
	schema:reviewBody "Even the funniest movies eventually stop making me laugh after I've watched them enough times that the humor no longer surprises me. A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often I start noticing its depth and insight. For me no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as Groundhog Day which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.Superficially this film belongs roughly in the same genre as All of Me and Liar Liar comedies in which a character becomes the victim of some weird supernatural fate and must adapt to the insane logic of the situation. But Steve Martin and Jim Carrey are geniuses of physical comedy whereas Bill Murray specializes in understatement. I can't imagine any other approach having worked for this film where the world is going crazy around Phil the weatherman Murray's hardedged character who keeps his emotions bottled up. What makes the initial scenes in which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is the mounting panic in his demeanor even as he tries to act like everything's normal. All he can think of to say is I may be having a problem. Uh no kidding. Throughout the rest of the film he'll deliver similarly muted lines to describe his situation like My years are not advancing as fast as you might think. It's striking that a man who has all the time in the world would choose his words so carefully but it reflects a wellconceived screenplay.In this comedy the laughs are reinforced by repetition. The absurdity of Phil discovering that he's repeating the same day is funny enough but every time that alarm clock goes off and the radio starts playing I Got You Babe and Phil goes through the same motions and meets the same people and then goes out into the street to be accosted by the same annoying high school buddy Phiiiil? I laugh again because I'm reminded how funny it was the first time around. People who didn't like this film I've met one or two emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated. I sort of understand that complaint since jokes repeated over and over usually fail miserably. Groundhog Day however works uniquely well because the situation gets increasingly absurd and Phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails to pass.The film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent the entire hourandahalf showing Phil meeting the same people and doing the same things time and again. The fact that Groundhog Day avoids this fate is one of its more striking qualities since most highconcept comedies of this sort fall apart in the third act. Groundhog Day is a rare example of one that completely follows through with its premise leading from the initial situation logically to the ending. Only the Jeopardy scene feels like a skit that could have appeared anywhere. But this scene actually is placed wisely it occurs when Phil is becoming increasingly bored and lethargic and it is used to separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports.It is in the middle centering on Phil's attempts to seduce Rita when the film reveals itself to be more than just a comedy. The underlying implication of these scenes is that Phil's powers are less important than he thinks they are. He probably could have done the same things such as his exploits with Nancy under ordinary circumstances without the hocus pocus. In the end his powers don't matter because Rita is too smart and sees right through him. She may not understand the full supernatural implications of what he's doing but she senses that he's somehow manipulating the situation. Phil may think he's a god but he isn't allpowerful.Phil's character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe the situation would force him to look inward. Because he loves such a sincere woman as Rita the only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it. The change he undergoes isn't an implausible leap for he maintains many of the same basic character traits he had at the beginning even though he becomes kinder and more caring. Earlier Rita says that egocentrism is Phil's defining characteristic and indeed he doesn't stop being egocentric at the end he merely learns to channel the egocentrism in a positive direction.I have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off. Murray is not the only comic actor to have proved himself capable of dramatic depth but he's one of the few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous and serious side into the same character. And he's a master at conveying complex emotions through an apparent deadpan. When his delivery sounds stilted in this film the effect is intentional for he's playing a man whose life has become a script.Though this film has a serious message it is still quintessentially a comedy. But it's a comedy that uses psychological exploration of a fascinating character to make its point. After the laughter has worn down Groundhog Day turns out to be one of the richest and deepest films I've ever seen.".

I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings like reliving Groundhog Day I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable and as you laugh your way along the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.Check the IMDb listings for this film's awards look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.The acting was terrific and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film. But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools but it ought to be.    ON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City. When you hit it right those things last.I found that quote in a story on Ramis' death. The story curiously did not mention Groundhog Day. If there is any film to serve as a fitting memorial for Harold Ramis it must be Groundhog Day. A totally perfect script perfectly executed. He hit it right and when will he get the recognition he deserved decades ago?".

	schema:reviewBody "In Harold Ramis's Groundhog Day 1993 an intriguing comedy about repeating the past Bill Murray is Phil Connors an arrogantly selfcentered and cynical TV weatherman sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude. I love this movie  not only it is one of the best most original clever and funniest comedies I've seen it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance when Gods want to punish a mean arrogant SOB they would not take his sanity away  they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing? Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes and it was very convincing. 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Often you hear the adage It is just a film. Well for most times it is true. But on rarest of rare occasions it isn't. This was one of them. Like a great piece literature painting poetry speech it has the capacity to change the way you feel and think. It is the biggest compliment I can pay to a film. I rank Groundhog Day with Seventh Seal Wild Strawberries Waking Life Synecdoche New York Tokyo Story Ikiru as one of the moves that has the capacity to change.It is anything but a preachy film as the intro to the review might suggest. In fact it an extremely entertaining and funny film with one of the best performances ever by Bill Murray. The plot revolves around a weather man Bill Murray is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting rat as he calls it. This is his fourth year on the story and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again and again and again. First he uses this to his advantage then comes the realization that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place seeing the same people do the same thing every day.The challenge here for the makers was in terms of screenplay editing and performances. Bear in mind that the loops Bill Murray's character goes through might become redundant for the audience after a while. This is where the genius of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray comes into play who seem to introduce a novelty factor with every shot of the same sequence. I couldn't think of any actor other than Murray who could have pulled this one off.It is a movie likely to deceive you in its effortless narrative and casual comic tone. Yes it is funny but make no mistake about it it is a film with a strong philosophical undertone. This is a quality that separates Groundhog from rest of the movies with similar intent. It tells you what it intends to on your terms. It deals with the questions that bother us for a better part of our lives i.e. meaning of life purpose of life existentialism death god but never preaches nor propels any propaganda. But by the end of it you know that something has changed something you didn't see coming has happened. And then you watch it again only to realize the moment of Epiphany that eluded you the first time.Every time I am down or losing perspective this is the movie that eases everything and makes me ask a simple question What is important?. One of the absolute great films of the 90s but more than just a film for me.".

Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person during the course of the film and learns to love the town in which he felt he was trapped in. The chemistry with MacDowell's character of Rita is wonderful. It's a great film and to my mind the best comedy no perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.".

Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person during the course of the film and learns to love the town in which he felt he was trapped in. The chemistry with MacDowell's character of Rita is wonderful. It's a great film and to my mind the best comedy no perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bill Murray plays Phil Connors a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't it's spring.Well the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely desolate forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new managererr womanager who goes with Phil to the event along with Chris Elliot the cameraman. Phil reports they tape it it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather the roads have all been closed leaving only one option Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So Phil heads back to his cheery hotel and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of dejavu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh he dies all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes Groundhog Day so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie but the truth is I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smartalecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale A Christmas Story which is ironic because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called Scrooged. Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb I'msmarterthanyou face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But as this story teaches us having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Harold Ramis director of Analyze This star of Stripes directed Groundhog Day. Bill and he are old pals and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audiencecatching tale.Another thing that is great about Groundhog Day is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness but Groundhog Day does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck never have bought a Ferarri etc. Phil does what WE would do and that is one importance aspect of Groundhog Day. I would never rob an armored truck but if I was stuck living the same day over and over it would do no harm to take the cash  it would be back in the truck in the morning! So I might do that. although my conscience would still get in the way. There was a little comedy with John Candy named Delirious. It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good and pretty interesting there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any  and every thing and he didn't do them. I think that's where Groundhog Day steps in filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature  in other words I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the powers. And that's exactly what Phil does in Groundhog Day. And that is why among other things it is one of my favorites.55 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "This one is a winner in almost all respects a kind of comic Twilight Zone episode that never quits.  Murray has had roles in which he does nothing funny but seems to stand around waiting for laughs anyway wearing a goofy expectant smile as in Stripes.  But not here.  This is probably his best role.  He may still have the goofy expression but this time the laughs arrive on time.The movie excells at three levels.One is the overall conception the comic theme itself.  Murray a sarcastic and sadistic weatherman finds himself stuck in a small dreary town in Pennsylvania with two colleagues one of them Andie MacDowell his producer. They cover the local Groundhog Day celebration then find themselves unable to leave because of a blizzard.  The next morning Murray wakes up to find that it's the same Groundhog Day all over again.  And the next morning too. And so on ad almost infinitum.  So far so good.  A nice concept but it could go either way depending on how it's handled.  In fact it's handled very well.  What could have been a onegag movie that ran out of steam after the first quarter hour turns instead into a neatly logical progression of plot and character development.  Murray of course is the centerpiece of the tale and it is his changes that occupy our attention the other roles although well done are mostly there to provide reflections on Murray's moral evolution.  Andie MacDowell wardrobed in slacks white blouse and checked vest and done up with long fluffy curly black hair looks radiantly appealing.Murray's reaction discovering that he is now living Day Two is one of a terrible anxiety.  He manages to get this across effectively even though it is tinged with his own brand of distant amusement.  On Day Three he is depressed and gets drunk.  On Day Four he realizes that tomorrow will have no consequences and tests this hypothesis by breaking all of the rules of traffic.  As the days pass he plans to seduce MacDowell and he implements his plan cleverly discovering more and more about her  her favorite drink her favorite toast the kind of man she is looking for.  He has so much time on his hands that he learns to play the piano expertly because MacDowell likes men who play instruments.  His scheme seems to be working but no matter how perfect his playacting he simply cannot get her into bed in one single day  and every day he must start over with her from scratch. Twelve years of Catholic school speaking she tells him. Eventually however he comes to realize that he really DOES care for her because after all he's gotten to know her quite well with the passage of time although she doesn't know it.  When he undergoes this epiphany he goes about doing good no longer just acting nice but actually BEING nice whether it advances his desire to get her in the sack or not.  Obliquely indirectly it works without his having intended it to.  She falls for him and they live happily ever after.  That's the overall conception and it's very well handled.Level Two is the script the dialogue and this too is superior.  How many movies can throw in a handfull of quotes from Sir Walter Scott and people of that ilk  one quote is in French  without making a contemporary audience used to MTV squirm?  And winter slumbering in the open ground wears upon his smiling face a dream of spring.  And it isn't just stuck into the script it fits into the scene and is an appropriate comment on the plot.  But more than that the lines are not only intelligent but sometimes very witty.  Just a few examples that come to mind.On Day Two I believe Murray is sitting in a bowling alley with two local drunks bemoaning his fate.  He once spent a beautiful day in the Carribean with a gorgeous girl.  They drank pina coladas.  They watched the sun go down and then they made love like two otters.  Why couldn't he be stuck in THAT day instead of this one?  How would you feel he asks his pals if you woke up every morning and it was the same awful day and nothing you ever did made the slightest difference because nothing meant anything?  One of the drunks glumly replies  That about sums it up.On Day Three Murray and MacDowell are sitting in the Tip Top Cafe and he has a huge tray of fattening food in front of him.  He lights a cigaretteand stuffs whippedcream pastries into his mouth.  MacDowell  I hate to see a man of your advanced years destroying himself.  Murray  Maybe they're not advancing as fast as you think.Last example from dialogue somewhere down the time line after he's begun worming his way into her affections  Murray and MacDowell are walking along at night in the snow her arm through his and she tells him Thank you for a very nice day.  It's the kind of day that could never be planned. Murray  Well  it CAN be planned but it takes a lot of work.The third level at which the movie works is very simply the actual small bits of business that the actors involve themselves in.  Ramis the director plays the doctor who checks out Xrays of Murray's skull to see if there's any pathology.  Ramis stares at the photos and says No clots no tumors no aneurysms  at least as far as I can see then he turns around and squints tightly and rapidly three time in a row.  Who thinks up something like that?  And Murray takes a girl to a Clint Eastwood movie and does an expert impression of Eastwood from the Man With No Name costume to the voice.  When he turns his back and speaks it sounds exactly like Eastwood.  There are running gags about things like innocentlooking but bottomless puddles in the gutter.  I know that some of these things sound old but they are so well realized here that we can forget their age. They seem born anew just like Murray.There is one danger in a story like this that the movie skirts neatly. The romance between Murray and MacDowell had more been made of it could easily have turned cloying.  That's what happens to Jack London's characters in The Sea Wolf.  You've got to handle this carefully because as we all know comedy in itself is of no significance.  How many comedies win academy awards?  The movie has to be about something deeper of course and the sort of logic that comes to that conclusions must also come to the conclusion that the audience consists of an unwashed horde of semimoronic dolts who must have the seriousness pounded into their heads with a sixteenpound sledge hammer.  The problem is deftly avoided in Groundhog Day.  The romance is funny more often than not.  And during the moments when it isn't played for laughs it advances our understanding of the changes in Murray's character.  And MacDowell looks angelic enough that Murray's growing feelings for her are believable.  I should also mention the use of appropriate musical numbers on the track.  The Pennsylvania Polka is used as punctuation throughout.  Midway through the movie we get Ray Charles' You Don't Know Me underlining the uncertainty of the romance. By the end we have an even more romantic theme from Rachmaninoff that begins in sincerity and ends in a jolly jazzedup version.This is one of the best comedies of the last ten or fifteen years including The In Laws and The Freshman and My Cousin Vinny.  Before that there were Love at First Bite and Murder by Death.  Pure comedies successful ones come along rarely.".

How would you feel he asks his pals if you woke up every morning and it was the same awful day and nothing you ever did made the slightest difference because nothing meant anything?  One of the drunks glumly replies  That about sums it up.On Day Three Murray and MacDowell are sitting in the Tip Top Cafe and he has a huge tray of fattening food in front of him.  He lights a cigaretteand stuffs whippedcream pastries into his mouth.  MacDowell  I hate to see a man of your advanced years destroying himself.  Murray  Maybe they're not advancing as fast as you think.Last example from dialogue somewhere down the time line after he's begun worming his way into her affections  Murray and MacDowell are walking along at night in the snow her arm through his and she tells him Thank you for a very nice day.  It's the kind of day that could never be planned. Murray  Well  it CAN be planned but it takes a lot of work.The third level at which the movie works is very simply the actual small bits of business that the actors involve themselves in.  Ramis the director plays the doctor who checks out Xrays of Murray's skull to see if there's any pathology.  Ramis stares at the photos and says No clots no tumors no aneurysms  at least as far as I can see then he turns around and squints tightly and rapidly three time in a row.  Who thinks up something like that?  And Murray takes a girl to a Clint Eastwood movie and does an expert impression of Eastwood from the Man With No Name costume to the voice.  When he turns his back and speaks it sounds exactly like Eastwood.  There are running gags about things like innocentlooking but bottomless puddles in the gutter.  I know that some of these things sound old but they are so well realized here that we can forget their age. They seem born anew just like Murray.There is one danger in a story like this that the movie skirts neatly. The romance between Murray and MacDowell had more been made of it could easily have turned cloying.  That's what happens to Jack London's characters in The Sea Wolf.  You've got to handle this carefully because as we all know comedy in itself is of no significance.  How many comedies win academy awards?  The movie has to be about something deeper of course and the sort of logic that comes to that conclusions must also come to the conclusion that the audience consists of an unwashed horde of semimoronic dolts who must have the seriousness pounded into their heads with a sixteenpound sledge hammer.  The problem is deftly avoided in Groundhog Day.  The romance is funny more often than not.  And during the moments when it isn't played for laughs it advances our understanding of the changes in Murray's character.  And MacDowell looks angelic enough that Murray's growing feelings for her are believable.  I should also mention the use of appropriate musical numbers on the track.  The Pennsylvania Polka is used as punctuation throughout.  Midway through the movie we get Ray Charles' You Don't Know Me underlining the uncertainty of the romance. By the end we have an even more romantic theme from Rachmaninoff that begins in sincerity and ends in a jolly jazzedup version.This is one of the best comedies of the last ten or fifteen years including The In Laws and The Freshman and My Cousin Vinny.  Before that there were Love at First Bite and Murder by Death.  Pure comedies successful ones come along rarely.";

The following day he awakes and lives exactly the same day again but he is the only one to realize it. It is like this the next days again and again! What should Phil do to stop this? Maybe an improvement of his personality would be the wisest solution.You can easily imagine what a filmmaker like Frank Capra would have done with such a topic but Harold Ramis managed very well and he signs here his most beautiful success to date and one of the finest comedies of the nineties. The main strength of Groundhog Day comes from a strong and inventive screenplay which enables Bill Murray to go through all the different states which is logical because if tomorrow is the same day anything goes for him! The script also draws its comical force from the repetition. This process gives delightful sequences notably in the first part of the movie. You have to see Murray live the same day again faced with the same situations and as he despises people it can only make the spectator laugh. Moreover Ramis described his main character by mocking at him a little.Of course the evolution followed by Murray is a little predictable scornful at the beginning he will succeed in becoming nice at the end of the film and in finding love with Rita and you easily guess the message that Ramis tries to put across. But it remains nevertheless warm and deeply humane. However that may be the director gave us a pleasant sometimes funny sometimes moving movie to watch. And it is one of Bill Murray's best performances fair never bombastic. What more could you ask from him?".

	schema:reviewBody "Groundhog Day was a Harold RamisDanny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it myself included liked it and smiled on their way out of the theater. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar and the film is often played on that day in midwinter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring. Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century. Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis cowriter of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous grosscomedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus. That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.I read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis. He's Chicago born Jew with no religious training. He is a Hollywood director actor and comedy scriptwriter presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station. Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest nonsecular religious experience in American Cinema. The fact that Rabbi's Ministers and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.There are so many classic comedy bits lines to remember and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning. Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again. Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior. Every man is trapped by his wiring. Then sometimes maybe because of a catastrophic event a religious insight or an intelligent evaluation there is an epiphany. We can't be sure how the application of intelligence talent or luck can establish great work but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog.".

	schema:reviewBody "Groundhog Day is Bill Murray's serious movie. Along with Andie McDowell they make great chemistry. Phil is the wisecracking weatherman who thinks he is too good for everyone else. He is in PUNXSUTAWNEY Pa to do a newscast and wishes he were just about anywhere else. They get snowed in have to spend the night and the next morning at 6AM the fun begins.It is groundhog day again! He goes out sees all the same people doing and saying all the same things. To everyone else this is the only time they have lived this particular day. But for Phil it is the second time. In fact every morning thereafter he awakes at 6AM to exactly the same music the same day it looks like it will be for eternity.January 2007 Just watched it yet again it never gets old. punFeb 2 2009  Groundhog Day  I just watched it again. Never gets old!!Feb 4 2010  Two days late. But never better I even saw some things that escaped me the first several times. CAUTIONSPOILERSAt first Phil takes the repeat days to deal in funny or cruel ways with others he knows he will meet. He knows everything will be wiped clean and he can start fresh the next day. No one but he will remember what happened the prior day. After a while he gets depressed at the thought of being sentenced to an eternity of living the same day so he tries to kill himself. Jumping off a building taking a bath with a toaster driving a car off a cliff getting into the path of a truck. He succeeds each time however when 6AM comes the next day he's back in his bed Groundhog Day again and his daily cycle starts again. And eventually he decides to go ahead and try to make good use of his situation.So he takes on new hobbies. He becomes expert at ice sculpture medicine pianoplaying poetry and a number of others. He comes to know all the people in town not only their names but also intimate details of their lives. The film never hints at how many times he relives the same day. However to gain all the proficiencies he did it must have been several hundred. Perhaps even in the thousands. But that detail doesn't matter.As he becomes more and more charming he decides to try and seduce his producer played by McDowell. Each day he gets a bit farther only to show off as the real jerk that he is then is slapped and snubbed. But each day since he is the only one who remembers he gets a bit further. However he is destined to never get the girl unless he really changes and he doesn't realize this.In the last 14 of the film he has become a truly changed man. He helps people because it is the right thing to do. He is humble about his successes and it is this change that ultimately attracts the woman of his dreams and which gets him out of the seemingly endless cycle of replaying Groundhog Day.And that in a nutshell is what the film is all about. In a unique way  the replay of a day  it is a commentary on the need to be true and pure in our intentions to be able to get out of our rut and make any meaningful contribution to this world. I rate it 10 and is one of my favorite movies of all time.".

I'm just watching it again and I felt it necessary to review this film as the effect has not only not faded away but actually made the jokes more powerful  as I grasp on them differently more fully. Bill Murry's jerk character is so hilarious and original and his lines are so funny that you cannot resist liking him. On the other hand Andy's angelic curly haired innocent face opposes this brut.I think one of the smartest ideas is that the setting is pure and simple it could be anywhere BUT nowhere important. Of course it is important for our character to get stuck in the middle of nowhere  as of course it wouldn't come as a curse to spend every day on a nice island or a big city. Here monotomy hits us hard. And here comes the maturity people in their 30s 40s can easily get the metaphor that 'every day looks the same'. We work sleep eat .... and what else? Something is missing right? It takes an eternity to realize that there are more important things human relations remembering who we are what makes us happy  and the full capacity of love. This deeper message is nicely wrapped in a funny storytelling and even more hilarious actions. I don't think we have to simplify it for a bad man becoming good more virtous but rather waking up from his own 'groundhog' sleep a sleep in which he has been spending most of his life....Have fun and don't be afraid of your own shadow".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS It's almost unheard of for a piece of comedy genius to also be so deeply meaningful and philosophical. Yet in 1993's Groundhog Day writer Danny Rubin has created something very special. Hilarious at times and often quite deep this film is deservedly praised by everyone who sees it.Phil Connors Bill Murray is an arrogant news reader. Travelling to Puxatony to witness the world famous Groundhog Day Connors finds himself repeating this day over and over. With none of his actions affecting his life Connors firstly experiments with life before realising that he could well be stuck repeating this same day for eternity.This light hearted comedy is perhaps Bill Murray's finest performance. Going through a renaissance of sorts since the Millennium Murray has evolved into a much more serious actor. Deservedly Oscar nominated for Lost In Translation 2004 Murray is at his funniest all these years back in 1993. Rude and self obsessed to begin with the transformation of Murray's character is pure genius as he relives the same day continuously until he learns the error of his ways and wins the girl played surprisingly well by Andie MacDowell.The social commentary of this film is absolutely superb. The way Connors is able to often deceive others with prior knowledge is superb. As most notably is the way that Andie MacDowell's Rita can so magically change her opinion of Phil the second that she finds out that he plays an instrument. Rita is actually just as superficial as Connors and truthfully it would be brilliant to see how well the two coped over the following few months after the film ended.Personally the finest Philosophical story about this film is the death of the old homeless guy. Irrelevant of how Connors acts this man always dies at the same point of the day. As the doctor says 'it was just his time'. This quote is brilliant because it suggests that however we live our lives when we are due to die we are due to die. This is one of the most important most powerful messages of the film and it is delivered with subtlety and beauty. Full marks to director Harold Ramis for this one five minute period of skill.It's easy to over think the intelligence of Groundhog Day. Yes first and foremost it is a comedy but it is also incredibly easy to see more depth in a generally simple comedy. So as a comedy let us consider it's main points. Well firstly it is a hilarious piece of work which is well written and adequately shot. Secondly it is brilliantly acted by everyone involved including the usually awful Andie MacDowell. Finally it is a feel good story which leaves you with a smile on your face. So whether you think of the film as being deep or whether you view it as a simple romantic comedy it is perfect on either level. It is genuinely an excellent film.Brilliant on so many levels Groundhog Day is one of the finest romantic comedies of all time. Daft but entertaining it features a great performance by Bill Murray as well as a potentially deep message. All in all it's just a superb entertaining film and it should be watched at all costs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bill Murray is without a doubt one of my favourite comedians. His deadpan laid back attitude always makes him a hoot to watch. That was one of the reasons why Ghostbusters was such a success. But Groundhog Day has got to be his best comedy since because this ingenious Harold Ramis film is tailor made for Bill Murray's talents.Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors. A selfish cynical and sarcastic man he is not one of the easiest people in the world to like. Every February 2nd he travels to Punxsutawney P.A. to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival. Legend has it if the groundhog also called Phil sees a shadow it won't be an early Spring.This is an event Phil hates and he can't stand the town. This year he goes there with his cameraman Larry Chris Elliot whom he insults every chance he gets and his new producer Rita Andie MacDowell. Phil falls in love with Rita but can't open up to her in that way and comes off as arrogant to her.This marks his fourth visit to Punxsatawney and after Phil the groundhog predicts that Winter won't be ending anytime soon this year Phil can't wait to leave town. But a blizzard unexpectedly strands Phil Rita and Larry and they are forced to spend another night in Punxatawney.When Phil wakes up the next morning he's got a real freaky sense of deja vu. His clock radio is blaring out I Got You Babe the DJs are saying the exact same shtick as yesterday and when he looks out the window people are getting ready to go out. It's Groundhog Day all over again.Everyone else doesn't seem to notice and to them everything is perfectly normal. What is wonderful about this film is the way it explores every possible angle to Phil's situation and covers such a wide spectrum of emotion. From being initially baffled to exploiting it for his own gain depression suicide acceptance and finally selfreflection.Despite the repetition of this neverending day it surprisingly never becomes boring. Although the situations may be the same you know Bill Murray is going to do something slightly different with it. His reactions are priceless and he experiments in a variety of different ways.An example is when he runs into an old high school friend Ned Ryerson Stephen Tobolowsky. An insurance salesman who is ingratiating persistent and extremely annoying. Someone you can't wait to get away from. After a couple of times Phil punches Ned and then much later embraces him to Ned's horror. Stephen Tobolowsky is perfect as Ned and nobody else could have done the performance as well.I like the part when Phil has different ways of destroying the clock radio from knocking it off the table to hurling it to the floor. That's understandable if you had to wake up to I Got You Babe every single morning. Harold Ramis clearly wanted to be as inventive as possible with this comedy to keep the viewers interest which he certainly did.Phil's various suicide attempts are a highlight in a morbid way because he goes through every death imaginable to try to break this time warp. Unsuccessfully of course.The main focus of the film is Phil's attempts to get it on with Rita. But she is not the kind of person who just wants to get into bed with someone unlike Phil. Although he does learn things about Rita he just can't seem to make it work with her. But eventually Phil gradually realises his shortcomings and begins to change things about himself.Phil learns to appreciate life more and begins to care a great deal for the people of Punxatawney. One of my favourite scenes is when he tries to save a homeless man from dying of old age. But every day he still dies no matter what Phil's efforts.The film does have a happy ending but it doesn't feel contrived the way Scrooged was. You are genuinely happy for Phil when he finally wakes up to a Groundhog Day with Rita who loves him in return. Wisely we never find out what was causing the time warp. It adds to the charm of this film. Any attempt to explain it would have cheapened the impact.This will always be one of my favourite films and the wonderful range of quirky characters ensure you will always be entertained. Harold Ramis showed a capacity for storytelling on a par with Frank Capra giving us a benign story about how you can improve yourself today for a better tomorrow.Groundhog Day is a timeless film.".

	schema:reviewBody "1993 was a wonderful movie year. 2 movie masterpieces stand out today from it Schindler's list and Groundhog day. Personally I always loved the second one more. Groundhog day is a perfect example why Bill Murray will always be a superior actor than the Oscar darlings Tom Hanks and Spencer Tracy. He plays Phil whom thanks to a time distortion  a day repeating itself again and again  gets away with stealing money committing suicide 20 times sleeping with local girls without consequences and finding out everyones deepest secrets. The story is so subtle that you may at first think its just a comedy. But once you think about it you will realize how almost every problem from life is contained in it. Most noticeable the one about how people will make the same mistakes again and again until they change. And that's what's all about change. Once when Phil changes himself the world changes finally too. He is a grown man but childish in his persona. That's why thanks to the time distortion he ages psychologically until he finally becomes a real man not a spoiled kid. This is an extreme satire about life. Think about it. Its about the imprisoned human spirit crying for a change a difference. Phil became an individual the only person on Earth that has selfconsciousness. At that moment all other characters just became puppets. You can also regard it as a parody of Totalitarian regimes  Phil is the only person that does something different than the others and that's why he is misunderstood . Plus the explanation for the mysterious time distortion is never given. It's shown more like something as natural as the weather something that just happened.The only great film the director Harold Ramis ever made Groundhog day was until recently the highest marked Murray film on the site rottentomatoes.com with extremely high average grade of 8.110. Lost in translation beat it with 8.410 but quite frankly it was overrated. If there was any justice Groundhog day should have won Oscars and Golden Globes for the best picture script and the main actor. But alas since Murray was underrated for so long its finally time he gets overrated for once!You just have to love him when he is in the studio doing a weather forecast In California there is going to be a big heat tomorrow and gang fights and too high real estate prizes too. Oh what's this? A cold front is coming up! Fuuuu blows the clouds on the screen. The only flaw is that some better director could have directed it more radical and extreme than Ramis but if we love Frank Capra we must love this symbolic story about the triumph of emotions over cold cynicism.Grade 1010".

The only flaw is that some better director could have directed it more radical and extreme than Ramis but if we love Frank Capra we must love this symbolic story about the triumph of emotions over cold cynicism.Grade 1010";

Two young entrepreneurs from Warsaw wanted to start up manufacturing of Italian scooters in Poland but they needed money in order to get things going. After the bank refused to provide them with a loan they thought their whole plan would never work out.  Then Stefan met an old friend of his Gerard and things changed drastically.  At first Gerard promised that he would help them out financially with a loan.  The two young soontobe businessmen were excited about this prospect yet they later decided that he was asking for too much share in their future profits and dropped the proposal.  This is where things took a turn for the worse.  Gerard started harassing them for the money that he never lent them saying that he was already too far into the negotiation process to back out.  Everyday it got worse as Adam and Stefan found out that Gerard was obviously a member of the mafia.  He tormented and threatened them to the point where they did not know what to do.  They knew the police was helpless because they couldn't even provide the law enforcers with the man's last name and what charges could they file against him without any evidence?  As this is a true story it must have its real life consequences.  The two men Adam and Stefan are currently in jail with sentences for 20 years imprisonment eachhow did this happen you might ask? Watch the movie to find out.  This film is primarily about right and wrong choices about what one will do when under pressure without a straightforward way out without hope.  This movie is one after which the audience will leave the cinema and talk about for weeks.  It deals with real places real life people and the atmosphere that director Kszysztof Krauze has captured is eerie and enthralling.  The acting is magnificent and the camera work makes it look very realistic.  I personally recommend this movie to everyone who wants a moviegoing experience that they will remember for a long time.  But be warned this is by no means a film for the fainthearted.".

He tells Gerard his business plan and Gerard offers to get a buyer.However the deal doesn't work. Yet Gerard keeps harassing the two friends to recover his costs.Realities dawn slowly adding to the mild suspense of the film. The acting is top class as the two friends face unusual and unexpected situations and try to come out of them unharmed.This is an atmospheric cold movie. The least it would do is to make you think.

But even more unnerving is that it's based on a true story read about Sawomir Sikora and Artur Bryliski. It sounds as though the movie is also an allusion to Poland's rapid transition to a market economy in the 1990s which was essentially a shock doctrine. But moreover anyone could make the mistake that these men make in an attempt to get rich.I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but it's a good cautionary tale about moneymaking schemes that spin out of control. If your aim is simply to get rich expect some bad things to happen. The Gordon Gekko types may idolize greed but what's it done for the rest of us?".

The beginning of the film is shocking some of the crimes that Mademoiselle commits are horribly disturbing and emotionally shaking especially the scenes where she cruses the eggs and poisoned the animals oh my she is evil indeed. Even her more petty crimes seem horrifying probably due to the wicked expression on Moreau's face and the emotional consequences on the logger and his son. To me the film is quite harrowing for it's time the ending is absolutely devastating. Overall a superb film I would place it in with the Psychodramas classics arthouse or suspense.

	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with nuns singing as they climb a hill. But any similarity with the Sound of Music stops there. Jeanne Moreau is evil incarnate. Like the exgirlfriend that is love and light to everyone she meets. But only you know the truth! She is lovely. She is beautiful. She wanders the hillside like Aphrodite blessing the ground on which she walks. Each carefully observed detail of the countryside is there in her natural and engaging charm and heightened by use of natural sound only. Gentle and sensitive. The sort of person everyone wants to know. Do we fall in love with her in the first few minutes? She picks up some birds' eggs and gently crushes them. What? Some mistake n'est ce pas? Did we really see that? Have you ever refused to believe an awful thing because a person 'couldn't possibly be bad'? A friend a lover a spouse even. Or the upstanding member of a community. A politician? The velvet glove. Kennedy  Vietnam. Gandhi  bloody Partition. Catholic Church  Spanish Inquisition. The superspin smile. The wellmeaning malice. The invincible persona of goodness. And in the dark it conceals what we refuse to believe.Am I too harsh  all over some eggs? The waterlock she opens girlishly. The lighted cigarette by which things burn. Is it wrong of us to suspect her childlike innocence? See her soft lips! See her run to help you in need! Comfort you. Always there for those less fortunate.Mademoiselle works as a typist at the police station and also as a schoolteacher. Both respectable jobs. She's an upstanding new member of the rural hamlet where things go mysteriously wrong. A chaste girl of course. Except when she's having sex  but if she doesn't get caught does it 'count'? She sweetly tells the children stories of Gilles de Rais. How brazen for wellread viewers!.Apart from the femmefataleinoverdrive aspect of this film it is also visually satisfying in every possible way. Rampant openair sex  in a thunderstorm  has never looked so good or so convincing. Natural sound creates more atmosphere than an added soundtrack ever could. Dramatically it has the longdrawn out obsessiontension of a Lady Chatterley What is it with these woodcutters?? but with much more finely chiselled characters. While Moreau's poisoned chalice has similarities with her role in Diary of a Chambermaid this Mademoiselle is altogether more accessible more extreme more downright nasty.Some may find fault with the artistic overstatement. Or the fact that a cast of many nationalities has to somehow be made to gel. If you are turned off by the tone of it you may even find it preposterous. But let it work its magic. Director Richardson is most ambitiously at his height of 'British New Wave' and masterstorymaker Jean Genet shines. Moreau is a monstrously formidable force. Mademoiselle is one of the most dedicated portrayals of female malice ever brought to screen. It is the femme fatale made real and without any puritanical comeuppance to relegate her to the realms of noir fantasy.David Watkin's The Devils Chariots of Fire Out of Africa dreamlike photography icily dramatises the charged eroticism. The Panavision lenses drool over the bodiceripping element the fiercely animalistic sex. Fellow director Richard Lester once described it to Steven Soderberg saying Mademoiselle was the most beautiful blackandwhite film I have ever ever seen . . . they were using different stocks which had different flare factors and different qualities of the way the blacks and greys played for each scene. You were choosing stock to make something look great. It was very experimental. It has also been described as black and white widescreen noir making effective use of the large frame often placing the characters right or left at the limits of our vision.Some critics have gone as far as to suggest that Mademoiselle is demonically possessed. The other view is that it portrays the havoc caused by repressed passions and in which the church is complicit. This latter more reasonable view is supported by a careful reading of the film. The hypocrisy of the clergy is also hinted at in moments of humour. Some are called to a life of suffering says the priest sententiously. To which the hardworking old peasant woman retorts You seem to forget that I make your bed! Whatever your feelings it does give a whole new meaning to the phrase Come when I whistle.".

In all its Cinemascope glory this is a breathtaking film incredibly photographed and directed. And there are some incredible touches in the telling of this story.My problems with this film derive from a few things 1. though the goal of this film is to build a dark and compelling yarn of the simple banality of evil there are ways that you can read this film that really undo that goal especially as it pertains to the female character at the center of the drama and the way we're ultimately encouraged to view the impetus of her rage 2. the town ends up being a shadow character which is effective in some ways but it is also unsettling.No question this is an important film that should be seen.7.5".

And there are some incredible touches in the telling of this story.My problems with this film derive from a few things 1. though the goal of this film is to build a dark and compelling yarn of the simple banality of evil there are ways that you can read this film that really undo that goal especially as it pertains to the female character at the center of the drama and the way we're ultimately encouraged to view the impetus of her rage 2. the town ends up being a shadow character which is effective in some ways but it is also unsettling.No question this is an important film that should be seen.7.5";

	schema:reviewBody "The legendary Jeanne Moreau stars as Mademoiselle a school teacher filled with repressed sexual urges in a small French village. She finds ways to vent her desires mostly through arson and other destructive acts.Mademoiselle seems like a film that desperately wants to be profound. It seems like a film that wants to say something about repressing desires and the insignificance of mankind against nature. For the most part it fails. It is unclear whether Mademoiselle's violent actions are the product of sexual desire or simple sadism. She sets fires and opens floodgates but is it a sexual urge? Not really she just seems to get a kick out of watching the townspeople scramble to save their lives and possessions.And while the film is directed with an interesting visual flair that does often capture the beauty of nature quite well it never really achieves a level of Leanesquire glory or magnificence. Sure it's pretty to look at but what's the point? The acting is also sorely lacking. Ettore Manni who plays Mademoiselle's and everyone else's sexual interest is just not very good. He often unleashes these boisterous laughs and every time I cringed. It's not even a little bit convincing. Even the usually wonderful Moreau fails to impress here. Her performance just feels hollow. As she has proved in the past that she can be very good I blame director Tony Richardson who unlike someone like Franois Truffaut or Louis Malle clearly doesn't grasp what Moreau is capable of.That's not to say Mademoiselle is a failure. There are several deeply disturbing moments one in particular involving a rabbit. The film seems to be trying to say that all human beings can be monsters at times and we take out our suppressed aggression on whatever innocence may be around us. Still the film seems to lack a core of genuine emotional depth and therefore lacks resonance. It doesn't help that it tends to move along at a remarkably slow pace which causes it to try the viewer's patience at times.However I would probably give Mademoiselle a mild recommendation if for nothing besides the attractive visuals and the fact that it contains Jeanne Moreau.".

Several say that it's the frustrated sexual desire for woodman Ettore Manni that leads to Jeanne Moreau's spate of secret violence against the town but it's worth noting that the first fire set is accidental. I think it's more horrifying to think how arbitrary sociopathic behavior may be that it may exist in all of us and small turns of events turn her into a monster. The malevolence in her eyes is frightening as is her cruelty to his son in her classroom and we see how cruelty begets cruelty as he dashes a rabbit repeatedly against the ground after an incident with her. That's one thing to beware of in the film there is more than one scene of what appears to be actual cruelty to animals. There is also sexual humiliation  kissing boots crawling on the ground and getting spit on before being kissed  in a sequence that drags on over multiple scenes far too long towards the end. The film simply tries too hard to makes its point sometimes with silly obvious symbolism for example him unwrapping his snake and having her stroke it. Director Tony Richardson with screen writing from Marguerite Duras based on a story by Jean Genet certainly creates an image with this film it's just not all that pleasant. On the positive side he does capture several wonderful shots mostly outdoors. It's as if he saying nature is beautiful man is not. I also loved seeing Jeanne Moreau who is fantastic.".

A number of action films have been set here but this is the first to make an outright reference to a classic western that I've seen. While taking off from Leone's The Good The Bad and The Ugly this film goes in it's own direction although the mix of horses trains motorcycles Chinese and Western costumes and some very odd characters makes this film resemble the Mad Max films more than anything else. An extended chase scene towards the end really seems influenced by the George Miller films.Influences aside the ingenuity in crafting the action scenes in this film makes it a joy to watch. Photography is great. The lead actors are good and the story while a little daft is easy to follow for the most part.The music is good but nowhere near the Leone films. The violence is typical for Korean action and might be a little hard to watch at times. Long but pure fun for the most part. This is probably the best action film I've seen in a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is fantastic exhilarating and fun. High dramatic art it is not.It's a movie about a chase for treasure and it holds onto that and never forgets. In the pursuit of creating a chase everything is crafted carefully. The cinematography is breathtaking with huge elaborate sets that are used to their fullest. Most of the stunts and effects are real CGI being kept to a minimum. It is an action movie with actual action instead of pixels a rarity in movies from the past 10 years. Stunning candy for all the senses it gets your adrenaline pumping! As far as acting goes it is excellent. Korean comic actor Song KangHo fills the Weird role of TaeGoo pulling off a combination of humanity and quirkiness. Lee ByungHun is the 'bad' character brutal and insane as gangster ChangYi. Filling out the main three is Jung WooSon as the cool collected and more than a little arrogant bounty hunter DoWon. While Jung is eclipsed by the other two his character ultimately became my favorite during the climax. The supporting cast is nonetooshabby either playing everything from military dropouts to ninjas all well. Particularly entertaining are the leaders of a group of Manchurian gangsters who watch insanity take place and calmly discuss it from horseback.Now while the acting is good...there is not a lot of it. I don't think anyone is going to try to pretend this is a characterdriven piece. It could have been maybe but it wasn't try to be. It was trying to be fun. There is enough character development so that when the climax rolls around after two madcap hours of amazing action you care that the characters lives are being threatened. That's...all.But the action is extremely well done with a heartpounding score that makes it all the well fun. For entertainment you aren't going to get much more welldone for this. Supremely fun with scenes shot with people horses cars and real pyrotechnics in the middle of the Gobi desert too much CGI and spectacle just becomes yawnworthy I often fun. So get the DVD get some popcorn turn the sound WAY up and prepare for a beautifullycrafted action movie. Not for a complex characterdriven masterpiece.".

It really does have the feel of a western and the three main characters are all very interesting in their own right. The story is a simple one  three men  and their cronies are after a treasure map and they will do anything to get hold of it. The minus points of this film are that its half an hour too long and that at times it's to frenetic. Because of the constant action you get a little bombarded with it after a while.

The camera and hence the audience are everywhere this side that side above below and even in the smoke from the engine. Previously there has been some set up to accompany the credits and then we are away. This film does not let up so if it is not nonstop action you are after you had best avoid. For all sensible folk this is a mind blowing exercise in action cinema. Loud violent and stunningly shot this is awe inspiring stuff and with a comic edge too. I spent half the time with my mouth agape and rest with a broad smile.

It is surprisingly difficult to find big Korean releases with English subtitles so seeing JinWoon Kim's new film which i have been looking forward to for well over a year was a pleasant experience. Unfortunately everyone in the west will have to wait a little longer...As with all of JinWoon Kim's films i have very little criticism to give this film from its fantastic and totally relentless action opening to the suspenseful ending i was completely entertained.The cast as expected from three of South Korea's most most talented actors were superb with in my opinion exceptionally notable roles from Lee Byun Hun and Song KangHo. Lee Byung Hyun pulls off a villain superbly and fills this role with style and terror without fault. Song KangHo in my opinion is the main force of the film pulling it along with humour and perhaps the most interesting story as the film progresses. WooSung Jung plays his 'good' role well but feels like the character with least depth. The film contains fantastic makeup and costume design notably in my eyes Lee Byung Hun's character who looked fantastic and the on screen presence of this smart darkly dressed character set against the sandy desert was stunning.The cinematography in this film was superb with plenty of great flying panoramic desert shots high octane action camera maneuvers fast cuts and perfect editing as expected from the director of such fantastic actionthriller films.The soundtrack is fun and reminiscent of old western films with a new modern twist to keep things up to pace. Although the story has been noted as being weak the film really does not offer itself as an in depth period drama in the first place. The film is exactly what it calls for... Fun fast and funny entertainment and what you can expect from some of the finest noted stars and workforce in South Korean cinema.".

He also sends a hired killer the Bad after the agent to steal the map so that he can get paid and keep the map. Unfortunately the map is stolen when a bandit the weird robs the train. Meanwhile a bounty hunter the good gets caught up in the mix.I'd try to explain more but it would reveal too much and take up too much time. Nominal homage to the Clint EastwoodSergio Leone films this is a huge epic film that never stops moving. Its one long chase as the three leads dance around each other as well have to contend with Chinese and Russian Bandits the Japanese and other interested parties. The film just goes and goes and goes as the revelations come fast a furious. And its all done to a catchy flamenco score.The problem for me is that the plot for as convoluted as it gets is much too threadbare to sustain so much motion. The plot is basically get the map while we learn a bit about the characters but not so much that the never ending chase and blood bath is really allowed to pause. It has enough motion for easily fifteen other films. In all honesty I looked at the clock at one point and was shocked that the film wasn't even half over. I was exhausted. To put it another way the problem is that the film pretty much is form over content and had the film not spun out so many bits that go really nowhere I wouldn't have minded the frenetic pace but as it stands now the film seems to be promising more of a pay off then it gives us. I was going is that it? at the end. I do understand the map is purely an excuse for the action the MacGuffin of this film but at the same time the film shades in details that are never finished This isn't to say that film isn't spectacular. The set pieces are great and the action is amazing the opening train sequence is one of the best train sequences on film. The film was filmed to beautifully use the wide screen so the idea that this is going to be seen on a small TV is frightening and don't even mention pan and scan. You really need to see this as big as possible to really enjoy it.I like the film I don't love it. I can recommend the film but at the same time I wish it was better. If you can get past the plot problems and just concentrate on the action you're going to have a great time.Between 6 and 7 out of 10".

He's more arrogant than Bad but we're supposed to dislike him so that's good too. Not surprisingly it's Kangho Song as the Weird who steals the show. He runs through this movie like a chicken or a turkey with its head cut off but never misses a beat. He's having a good time and makes sure that we do too.

The sets and props really added to the movie's visual appeal.The actors particularly Lee ByungHun. All three actors were pretty good in their roles and Jung WooSung looked ridiculously good looking but Lee really shined in his new change of role. There was a strength in his eyes that almost literally jumped off the screen and his character was chillingly convincing.Did I mention Jung WooSung was hot? I'm a heterosexual guy in his 20's but even I couldn't deny how ridiculously good looking he was. Despite all of his character's insane ridiculous stunts which I for those of you who understand Korean would like the refer to as gaepom I eventually ended up with the same conclusion Man that guy look COOL!The action scenes were pretty decent as well. Had to put that in.Then there's the bad ...It's complete lack of plot. I mean it not much plot.I'm kind of tired of seeing Song GangHo in the same role AGAIN! I mean I know the guy's a decent actor and he really did a good job in his role but didn't we see this guy in the The Host?!Violence does not equal comedy!! Not saying that the movie is really violent but ... Ugh you'll get what I mean after watching the movie.Which leads me to my weird overall impression of the movieI'm quite PERPLEXED. I was pleased while watching the movie and the film is rather enjoyable to watch but leaving the theater I was sort of like Um... okay... An odd WEIRD feeling of satisfaction mixed with a sense of being robbed.To give you a sense of what it was like it's kind of like a Western Korean version of Pirates of the Caribbean. There's a lot of action nice characters cool setting rather enjoyable but you leave the theater a bit perplexed. And while PotC leaves you perplexed and confused because of its abundance of plot The Good the Bad and The Weird leaves you perplexed and confused because of its lack there of.To sum it up I think it's a decent funtowatch movie Nice effort to say the least!. Good to kill time or just watch on a Friday night. But if you want something more serious or concrete I'd recommend something else.".

	schema:headline " The Good the Bad the Weird";
	schema:reviewBody "Offkilter Korean neowestern The Good the Bad the Weird is a frenetic genre mashup packed with visceral loopy violence. That isn't a complement so much as it is a description. Suffice it to say if you're into a modernist freewheeling foreign take on Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly with cartoony characters and outrageous action you're going to have a blast if you're looking for a substantive or meditative reflection on the period or the original film you're in the wrong line.Personally I'm caught between the two perspectives. I appreciate the pure Peckinpah punch of the gunplay but was in equal parts bored and bewildered by the overall film. Perhaps the principal flaw in writerdirector Jiwoon Kim's script is that he indulges in too much of a good thing. His action sequences are a lot of fun and the berstylized retromodern aesthetic delivers bizarre and inventive visuals like a gunslinger in a deepsea diving helmet.But the deafening sound effects and quick cutting style wear thin if not appropriately paced and The Good the Bad the Weird is almost relentless in its drag race to the final showdown. I'm loathe to draw a comparison to Transformers here but Kim proves that even good action has a threshold and there are times in his film where it's easy to let your eyes glaze over.In its more quiet moments the story a very loose retelling of The Good the Bad and the Ugly follows a band of misfit thieves who come into possession of a treasure map sought by both Chinese thugs and the Japanese military. What's maybe most interesting about the film is seeing the conventions chronology and geography of the western customized to fit eastern ideology and China's Taklimakan desert stands in for Manchuria circa 1940.The tone is played as loose as the history however and Kim is never bogged down by self seriousness or the oftstringent requirements of a period piece. The Good the Bad the Weird is closer to a gleeful Kill Bill in tone than South Korea's own operatic ultraviolent Oldboy and benefits from it. Kim easily leapfrogs from hardhitting shootouts to charming comedy a phenomenon that has everything to do with his incredible cast. Each of the title characters Park Dowon Good Park Changyi Bad and Yoon Taegoo Weird brings with him a distinct tonal octave that lends the film some muchneeded variety. My lone gripe in this department is that it would have been nice to get to know them a little bit better. As it stands their rifles seem to have far more to say.And for many that won't be an issue. I've no question that there exists a very appreciative audience for this filmI'm just not it. Nevertheless I'm only too happy to report that everything basically works. The cinematography is frequently gorgeous the performances are stellar and the action is kineticThere's just too much of it. By the end of the twohour engagement what should be a satisfying visceral finale comes off as extravagant hoopla.As viewers we shouldn't be conditioned to expect nonstop action because once you pass the threshold there's a diminishing return on adrenaline impressive as any sequence that follows may be. The Good The Bad The Weird gets all its forward momentum right but could benefit from applying the brakes more frequently. Then again maybe that reckless pace is what made it such a fast fun ride to begin with.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh the sweet irony. What would this world be without the acerbic poignant scathing realization irony offers? A less interesting place for sure. Take Jiwoon Kim's new insert traditional Korean food western action movie for example. The illadvised title immediately reveals everything that is wrong with it.Whereas Sergio Leone's THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY is a similar sprawling western adventure from which Jiwoon Kim freely borrows it still has a masterful story behind its quirks and eccentricities that holds it together. Kim's GBW lifts the plot from Leone's movie wholesale yet forgets to mould it into a story worth the celluloid it's printed on. When the loud explosions quick cutting and dangerous acrobatics stop for a moment the silence becomes deafening. And while GBU will remain a staggering classic GBW will be sooner tossed away for the next collage of things blowing up and stuntmen jumping from high places that Hollywood will serve us.The titular three broadly sketched as the strong silent type the coldhearted bastard and the bumbling fool respectively are all after a map that reveals the location of hidden treasure somewhere in Manchuria. Set in early 20th century east Asia GBW crossreferences the genre world of the American western with then contemporary historical setting something that in theory should resemble the spaghetti western but instead comes off as a tad on the Hollywood side of things.GBW hovers in the middle a thinly plotted pastiche that goes on for too long a step upward from your runofthemill action blockbuster on the strength of exotic locale alone. Mildly interesting at first until you realize it's a onetrick pony. The opening and preclimax large action scenes are quite good but the middle sags and drags painfully. Easily the most impressive action scene takes place in the desert and involves the Japanese Imperial army bandits and some more bandits all chasing after a motorbike. The astonishing panoramas of the army bombing the desert that recall Sergei Bondarchuk's epic WATERLOO are a pleasure to be hold.I see a lot of people praising this film not for what it is but for what it's not a Hollywood blockbuster however if we're quick to scoff at the sight of another mindless airheaded superhero blockbuster if we refuse to be dazzled by dramatically vapid spectacles that make up for their waferthin story and absent characterization by staging bigger louder and more CGIladen scenes of things blowing up and buff guys posing for the camera I don't see any reason why we should take them from South Koreans in the name of 'foreign cinema'  even when they're presented in the form of homage or perhaps more so in those cases as Kim shows no understanding of Leone's cinema. I'm sorry to say I ended up disliking this movie as much as I was looking forward to it. And finally why didn't anybody tell Kim that GBU spoof titles stopped being cool 20 years ago?".

	schema:headline " The Entertaining The Admirable and The Down Right Frustrating";
	schema:reviewBody "With a film title such as this it is unavoidable that JiWoon Kim's latest foray will be compared to Sergio Leone's epic masterpiece that is The Good The Bad and The Ugly and while the comparison is not entirely necessary to write a critique without bringing it up is ignoring the obvious. In 2005 JiWoon Kim released the highly lauded and severely engaging film A Bittersweet Life in which he took the reformed gangster plot device and twisted it wonderfully to create an intelligent actionthriller. It is evident that in the aftermath of his unprecedented international success JiWoon Kim was given free reign to create any film of his choosing spawning the genesis to his latest endeavour The Good The Bad and The Weird.We all have films that we classify as being in our top ten or even top five films that speak to us on a level that we are so incredibly immersed within the story being told that we connect on a subconscious level to create unbound admiration. JiWoon Kim has a passion for the spaghetti western and climax to the Man With No Name trilogy The Good The Bad and The Ugly and with his free license has not intended to copy parody or pastiche Leone's creation but to attempt to create an Easternised Western using the forementioned film as a template. Inevitably the director has had to update the story and transplant the time line for a completely new audience and to maintain historical plausibility which is admirable but his nature as an action film director proves to be the films Achilles heel.To say there is little plot in this film is to say there is too much for after the films introductory and satisfactory skirmish the story descends into the chase of a map which is about as flimsy as the glue that allegedly holds the plot together. The story hops gleefully and unashamedly from one action scene to the next and while the criticisms that the sequences are fifteen minutes in excess of what they should be are accurate it is the overwhelming lack of perspective or objective that infuriates the viewer. It is all well and good having a twenty minute battle royale in the middle of a desert incorporating all the warring factions within the story but to have nothing more than a simply cut and one of the protagonists to be miles away in complete isolation without one of the hundreds chasing him in sight is nonsensical and irritating. Perhaps though the most frustrating is the lack of development in the three most important pieces of this puzzle. For example Woosung Jung who plays The Good has studied the Clint Eastwood films thoroughly mimicking his stance tone and style in his attempt to recreate the feel of his character yet lacks the aura and gravitas of Eastwood to pull off the antihero role sufficiently. Not simply this but at this stage in Leone's trilogy the Man With No Name while still fixated with obtaining his fortune had softened as an individual making it easier for the audience to connect with him come the final confrontation. With Jiwoo Kim's version it is unintentionally the case that the character traits of all three interchange at varying junctures making it nigh on impossible to sympathise enough with one individual character to make us care about the film in anything more than two hours of mind numbing action.As not to completely eviscerate the film there are notable plus points which must be mentioned as the score overlaying the film is perfect for a film of this sort carrying along the action elements with a slight undertone of Morriconne's iconic creation. Jiwoon Kim shows he is still a director worth worrying over as there are some luscious landscapes in his rich and vivid cinematography showing he knows how to capture a film while Kangho Song shows his versatility as he adds zany charm to a list of roles which include his undoubtedly iconic revenge driven Park Dongjin in Chanwook Park's Sympathy For Mr Vengeance. These noted exemptions aside one cannot help but feel that The Good The Bad and The Weird is an ultimately hollow experience a concept which had all the tools to be a success yet escapes into the comfort of an action genre all too frequently. It leaves me personally wishing Jiwoon Kim would have shown the characteristics of his earlier work A Bittersweet Life and taken the arguably more pretentious but the more rewarding route of jettisoning some action and slowing the pace of the story down so as to allow the characters the time to develop and flourish and not be the mere cutout clichs that they occasionally turn out to be. What sums this film up perfectly is its ending sequence which utilises the same dramatic tension that Leone so wonderfully created before shattering that illusion and choosing the most clichd ridiculous and unfortunately laughable of all the available alternate endings. The Good The Bad And The Weird goes down in history as of 2009 as being the most expensive South Korean film made yet if Hollywood has taught us anything it is that bigger and more expensive does not always mean better. While The Good The Bad And The Weird is unintelligibly watchable you do wonder if this or another of South Korea's plethora of talented directors could have created a grander cinematic experience for a few dollars less.".

It leaves me personally wishing Jiwoon Kim would have shown the characteristics of his earlier work A Bittersweet Life and taken the arguably more pretentious but the more rewarding route of jettisoning some action and slowing the pace of the story down so as to allow the characters the time to develop and flourish and not be the mere cutout clichs that they occasionally turn out to be. What sums this film up perfectly is its ending sequence which utilises the same dramatic tension that Leone so wonderfully created before shattering that illusion and choosing the most clichd ridiculous and unfortunately laughable of all the available alternate endings. The Good The Bad And The Weird goes down in history as of 2009 as being the most expensive South Korean film made yet if Hollywood has taught us anything it is that bigger and more expensive does not always mean better. While The Good The Bad And The Weird is unintelligibly watchable you do wonder if this or another of South Korea's plethora of talented directors could have created a grander cinematic experience for a few dollars less.";

This movie manages to encompass I think many genres of film. It is an action film it is a comedy and without spoiling the plotI hate people who do that it is a thriller.Many action films nowadays seem to have some sort of maiden or romance in the movie this has managed to pull off action but without what I can say the clich of romance.Your mouth will be opened in awe many a time while watching this movie and I think that if fans will get their parents and friends to watch it it can be a leader in getting people into foreign films. As was the case with one of my mates.The Cinematography is mind blowing and brings you up close to the action at times blood hits the screen the camera almost crashes as a guy falls off a horse and the angles and movement is so amazing like I mentioned from up close to up and above.The movie has managed to infuse comedic and action sequences in at the same time you'll be watching it high octane action butI know I promised you'll laugh as the character Yoon Tae GooWeird is being shot in the head while wearing an old divers helmet. The fight sequences are the same great but also funny.What is great that a lot of Hollywood does do is that the movie doesn't hold back. The HitmanThe Bad is portrayed superbly realisticas is all the characters acting without mercy or regard a very brutal character the thing is you see all the grotesqueness of him and the movie people being stabbed blood splattering gunshots a realistic movie.What really got me was the soundtrack this has to be the first movie that I've ever watched which made me get blown away by the soundtrack the music which greatly varies from modern hip hop like sounds to old sounding music is expertly placed into the right places and aids in the enjoyment and WOW factor of the movie.I've read in shock that people have put that the movie lacks a plot or that it is very small. This is not true its not a intensely complex but it is by no means simple. I won't go into it because I would only ruin it for you but what I can say is that the progression of the story is fantastic there is never a part that lasts too long or is a filler and isn't needed it progresses amazingly and the story is good. You will definitely enjoy the ending I can guarantee that.Overall I have to say you have to see this movie and get everyone you know to see this movie. The excuse but I would rather watch a movie than read subtitles is NOT an excuse for this movie you can watch and read at the same time if not watch the movie Visually stunning anyway. This film will definitely get people who don't watch foreign movies to not be so closed off and should get more people watching more foreign films if not Korean.1010".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Good The Bad The Weird";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not difficult to see why The Good The Bad The Weird is number 1 at the Korean box office this year given that the titular roles are handed over to some of the heartthrobs such as Lee Byunghun and Jung Woosung. But the real scene stealer here is Song Kangho as The Weird Yoon Taegoo with some of the best lines and given the moral ambiguity of his character rather than being the Good Park Dowon Jung and the Bad Park Changi Lee which is cast in stone simply endears himself to the audience and not to mention the extended screen time devoted to him too.But those aside this film trounces plenty and I mean plenty of bland generic action adventure types cooked up by Hollywood in recent times and having a Korean flavour in what would essentially be a Western it adds plenty of spice to a genre that most wouldn't want to touch with a ten foot pole. The storyline's pretty straightforward with everyone the titular characters the Japanese army the Korean freedom fighters and plenty of rival Manchurian gangsters after a treasure map that points to some age old Chinese dynasty goodies buried deep within some desert land in Manchuria and having the map stolen and in the possession of The Weird this makes it one hell of a chase movie from start to finish offering plenty of set action sequences from massive chases to aweinspiring gun play.The references and inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti western The Good The Bad and The Ugly is undeniable but this is its own movie. Making its debut at the Cannes Film Festival director Kim Jiwoon crafts a tale that is full of riproaring fun finding some good balance between comedy and stylized action. It tries though to plant many elements and characters into the story but these are rather forgettable as the spotlight falls firmly upon our titular three. Positive elements of the movie include the excellent cinematography and camera work which packages the action scenes like a video game offering the audience a close up third person perspective following through the characters in their execution of maneuvers and moves while the eclectic soundtrack is just plain music to the ears.Jung Woosung perhaps got the shortest straw of the trio with his limited screen time devoted to looking good and cool with his double barelled shotgun. As The Good bounty hunter he's requested by the group of Korean freedom fighters to assist them in the retrieval of the map which also gives him an opportunity to apprehend The Bad. His character doesn't say much or do much other than to dispatch the bad guys and frankly speaking he falls squarely into the strong and silent mold for the movie.Lee Byunghun on the other hand in reuniting with the director since their A Bittersweet Life days brings forth quite convincingly his role as the chief baddie. Ruthless and highly skilled he doesn't flinch an eyelid when dishing out punishment and has through this role told the world that he can be equally adept at being the bad guy. Kudos go to the makeup artist in trying to make him look really nasty with plenty of facial scars that try to disguise his naturally good looks. Female fans in the audience looking for eye candy would be gleefully happy to note that he was sans shirt in one scene and I thought it'd put to shame plenty of guys out there when they see Lee's rockhard sixpack time to hit the gym guys!But in all honesty this film firmly belongs to pudgy looking Song Kangho for his charismatic role as The Weird. The first Korean film that I ever watched in the cinemas was Shiri and Song had a memorable supporting role to play there. From then on I've become a fan of his and followed Song through his roles in Park Chanwook's Joint Security Area Bong Joonho's Memories of Murder and The Host and Lee Changdong's Secret Sunshine. Having seen him backstage last year when he won Best Actor for his role in The Host at the inaugural Asian Film Awards in Hong Kong was nothing but a thrill. Here he singlehandedly stole the show from the other two pretty boys with his sheer presence and I felt that he'd probably had a field day with this free spirited role.With well designed action designed to exhilarate and being cheeky without qualms The Good The Bad The Weird deserves to be highly recommended with its fusion of gun play knife play and comedy in large doses despite some forgivable inconsistencies. The last act did seem quite indulgent in trying to achieve spectacle that it might have become a little repetitive but the finale face off more than makes up for this minor disturbance to a very enjoyable movie.".

The story is different than the original there is some homage to A Fistful of Dynamite also . Instead of focusing on the Good this time is the Weird who gets protagonism though Eli Wallach carried most of the original movie too. There is a map really a MacGuffin  after which the three main characters plus other thieves opium dealers and Japanese army are after thus becoming an spectacular and very violent chase over Manchuria. There is some political innuendo about Korean freedom but never flights too high. Aside from the nonspot action with bullets knives hammers and a little of martial arts the cinematography is outstanding. There are takes requiring craftsmanship and preparation that recent USA movies only do through computer generated imagery but almost never with cameras. This quality makes the action far more believable and involving. The acting is very good. Most of the movie is carried by Kangho Song The Host as The Weird but Byunghun Lee as The Bad creates a very interesting psycho Woosung Jung as The Good gets what he can with an underwritten character and the rest of the cast if above average far from the overacting in typical Oriental movies. In brief pure entertainment and if you have problem with subtitles do not worry because dialogs are of little importance here.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Good the Bad the Weird is a film that by its own title says 'there's something extra here' that there might be another twist on what Leone's masterpiece brought to us in film. From JiWoon Kim director of the acclaimed Tale of Two Sisters one would also think his first foray into an action spectacle would be bugf insane. But as it turns out this is really just another action movie nothing too 'weird' enough about it the 'Weird' character isn't even that weird more just scum along the lines of his inspiration of Tuco in GBU. Is this a bad thing? Not at all. It's a respectable sometimes even really thrilling and alive action western that could be described as a noodlewestern with its setting in Manchuria and featuring Korean Chinese and Japanese players in a setting with basically the same general plot of Leone's film except this time featuring a treasure map with an undetermined amount of fortune and set in the 1930's.While it did shoot short of being really great and original  it's setting and variation on the characters is really the only change that Kim's homage to spaghetti westerns goes it's a lot of fun seeing how the characters get where they go and how the setpieces do function as best they can. The opening train sequence has a lot of verve and some humor more people in the screening were laughing out loud than I was but it was always amusing and there's one particular chase sequence out in the desert when 'Weird' a very good Kangho Song is driving in his cart from an entire army and tons of bandits all firing guns some machine variety and put to the 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood' cover that was featured in Kill Bill Vol. 1. This is at the least a real breathtaker where Kim just says 'f it' and goes all out with propelling the action forward with anybody getting in the way trampled underfoot.The film also boasts a few other goodies. One of these is the performance of 'The Bad' Park Changyi who has a very crazed look in his eyes every other moment and is purported to be a notorious fingerchopper with his victims. His work makes it constantly watchable whenever he's on screen. And as mentioned the actor Kangho Song who we previously saw as the Priest in Park's 'Thirst' is tough as nails and goofy as hell in his part of the Weird. The other main player Woosung Jung as 'The Good' is more the straight man less a badass than Clint Eastwood but more subtle and with a more obscure and interesting backstory that is only revealed in snippets. While Kim definitely verges from the usual Mexican standoff just a bit in the climax there's at least a sense of real love for his source material of The Good the Bad and the Ugly and action westerns in general.If only it could be a little more well weird. It's certainly no Sukyiaki Western Django but if you're hankering for some bloody western fun and shameless action and characterizations and a little jazz to boot it gets good marks on all counts.".

It's certainly no Sukyiaki Western Django but if you're hankering for some bloody western fun and shameless action and characterizations and a little jazz to boot it gets good marks on all counts.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say I'm the greatest fan of the Western maybe I watched too many in my youth they were the only films on TV in those days. I do however like a good Spaghetti Western. So to come across a South Korean Spaghettistyle Western I was more than intrigued. Here's a very short summary and then my thoughts.It's all about a treasure map Park Changyi the Bad is sent to steal it but is beaten to the punch by Yoon Taegoo the Weird. At the same time bounty hunter Park Dowon the Good is out to get both of them. Throw into the mix a gang of bandits and the Japanese army all against the backdrop of the 1940's war in Manchuria and you've got a pretty good powder keg ready to go off. I won't go too much into the plot it's pretty long and involved but needless to say there's plenty of excitement along the way to the place marked 'X' on the treasure map.This is a very well made film with really excellent fight scenes shootouts and chases all expertly done. I also liked the soundtrack the music fitted the pictures perfectly in most instances. Great performances from all three of the major cast Kangho Song as Yoon Taegoo  The Weird Byunghun Lee as Park Changyi  The Bad and Woosung Jung as Park Dowon  The Good.The plot was quite involved and a bit dialogue heavy I felt which for a foreign language film isn't exactly an advantage. But if you can stick with the subtitles you are rewarded with a pretty good story. There are several plot holes in it so it's not perfect by any means but it is still very entertaining with a few comic moments thrown in for fun. Over all it's certainly a different take on the Spaghetti Western it has the look and the feel but with a bit of South Korean spice. Recommended.My score 7.110".

I found it all incredibly lame and dull. There's simply no continuity of action. It's like taking random words from a novel and mixing them up.

It's a crime comedy reminding me of an indie 'Analyze This' type but its main category should be drama. It was boring in some parts and you might not want to watch the whole movie in one sitting.

It's a crime comedy reminding me of an indie 'Analyze This' type but its main category should be drama. It was boring in some parts and you might not want to watch the whole movie in one sitting. Over all I say it was a good movie to help Bullock on her way but if she wasn't in it I might have never bought the movie.";

Sandra Bullock has a very small role one and a half scenes to be exact but the video exploits her fame by plastering her name and face on the cover as if this was a one woman show.  Since the only interest in this film is Sandra Bullock I will limit my review to her performance. In Wrestling Ernest Hemingway Demolition Man Speed and While You Were Sleeping Sandra Bullock became America's darling the girlnextdoor. In her flops she playedplays tough New Yaaaawkers cute but not great. This is one of those characterizations.  However in her primary scene she strips down to some Frederick's of Hollywood lingerie to three input her boyfriend.  She looks pretty good doing it which is quite a task considering she never removes her undies which we have already seen as not being crotchless.  It's silly that the film makers chose to keep them clothed.  In full dryhumping motion Sandra Bullock still does something for me.  Rewind and rewind and have fun.  Don't bother with the rest of the flick I fastforwarded it and the second Bullock appearance is no more than a walk on.".

Steve Bucemi pops up briefly and good as always. i would say give this movie a couple of tries as i bought this for the 3rd time after throwing it in the trash twice it grows on you. the music score is perfect.

My memory is of them saying that this is a disjointed feature that has nothing to do with reality. In the sex with panties on scene some even assume that his impression is true that it is full sex. I do find all that reassuring. There are some things that should not be broadcast. Except the comments did not say this it is just my memory of them. This is a low budget story about a man who has had success as a professional writer of books and articles. In some key ways he has managed to start off okay. I sank at the basic education stage. Age 30 and he sinks. His abilities for work have become unreal. His girl leaves him and leaves the new expensive lingerie on the floor next to him. He does not even realise that the break up sex missed out on a certain detail. I prefer this to be considered as an unreal feature. I have no objections to noone else loving this story. I have qualms about the bullock heading off to mostly nice twisty pretzel roles after Speed as for me these early works with her are the down to earth bobcat. YaYa. Best to leave the bobcat behind. Me and the Mob is way too unreal in some ways. The stories and his informer if one has not been tied up in such ways then I have to assume that one will get a rather misleading idea of the reality there one will get an outsider's view. At least this is a sympathetic outsider's view.  Childhood religion. We are accountable for each of our perceived mistakes. Unless we have not blown it on forgiveness of course. I say perceived as even foreigners and cows and debarked dogs could get accountability in our town once upon a time. SPOILERS Two If By Sea 1996 aka Stolen Hearts. I find the first few minutes of that the parts in the car to be demonstrating what a masterwork is about. The song written and partly sung by an aging Irish man. I probably got the aging wrong as it does not sound it it just sounds mature and is placed in a way that shows maturity by the director. Haunted but not blatantly and crudely symbolic. Apart from the painting of course. And the cat. Bobcat. A couple who are heading for a romance weekend on an island getting there by cars then train then boat. Except they are haunted and making mistakes. Escalating trouble. There is bobcat after Speed. YaYa. Bobcat with a bigger production budget if with a need to hide skin.  For me there is something potentially distasteful about these stories. But I find that these manage to avoid the most blatant mistakes and come up with something worthwhile. True Me and the Mob should not be revisited all that often occasionally definitely yes. Early Bullock is okay to me.".

This PaellaSpaghetti Western is filled with action  thrills  horse riding  intrigue  betrayal and crossfire . This RavioliPaella Western packs violence  shootouts  high bodycount and it's fast moving and some moments genuinely entertaining if you can avoid thinking too much . It contains bits of campy and refreshing events with turns and twists . Nice acting by Gilbert Roland as a rogue thief sporting an iron hand instead of a wooden leg  he starred some Spaghetti such as Sonora Goldseekers  Johnny Hamlet and Any Gun Can Play . Richard Harrison's performance in the movie is a bit wooden for the role of such an interesting character  but the fantastic performance by the always great Folco Lulli and sympathetic Roberto Camardiel save the show . Furthermore  a motley group of usual SpanishItalian secondaries such as Luis Barboo  Xan das Bolas  Jose Sacristan  Ennio Girolami  Raf Baldassarre  among others .

Strong and robust Richard Harrison was a magnificent muscleman .

Frustrated at not being able to secure meatier roles in America  Harrison jumped at the chance when offered the first character in 1961 The Invincible Gladiator  which was filming in Europe along with his greatest success The seven Spartans. He wound up settling in Italy for the next two decades. His lead role of course immediately typed him as another Herculean type and to avoid being penned in too much as a muscle man he sought characters in routine spaghetti westerns as Texas the red  Gringo Reverendo Colt  Joe Dakota  even the main role from For a fistful of dollars was offered to Richard Harrison  but he turned down and explaining  Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing Fistful of Dollars and recommending Clint Eastwood for the part .

In a conflict with outlaws he gets killed and a little boy and a stranger without a gun get hold of it.

Gilbert Roland and Richard Harrison together with a mixed bunch including the outlaws are able to entertain the viewer and deliver both a good performance. There are a lot of nice and wild landscape shots and the score has at least average quality. On the downside there is a certain lack of credibility in more than one situation.

A kid and a peaceful man eventually get a hold of the map and once again the bandit is taking them to the location when more double crossing happens. There are several major plot holes with this film including the fact that bandits keep being used even though the characters know very well that this is just going to lead to trouble.

Another problem is that the film is very poorly made and comes off looking incredibly ugly with some very bad camerawork. Some of the tracking shots in this thing are beyond bad. Even with all that said the film does have a few good moments and that includes one scene where a woman is being attacked by the bandit so she breaks a lantern over his head. Gilbert Roland iron hand and all is very good and keeps the film moving. Carlo Savina's music score is certainly the highlight of the film.".

Several other people want the treasure too like Juan Chasquisdo Gilbert Roland but likely for less noble purposes. The story's supposedly based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island which I've never read.Between God the Devil and a Winchester has the limitations of most Spaghetti Westerns like dubious dubbing awkward editing laughable sound effects and caricatures rather than characters. But if you can look beyond these flaws it has several attributes like the noble Harrison as the protagonist which is in contrast to the amoral characters caricatures typical of Italian oaters.The first act takes place at a Western Inn and is highlighted by the stunning Dominique Boschero as Marta. Dominique is so breathtaking she's almost worth the price of admission unfortunately she's removed from the story by the end of the first act. Roland as Chasquisdo is memorable if for no other reason than the iron gauntlet on one hand.The next two acts involve searching for and finding the treasure and aren't as good as the opening act. For one there are a few nighttime sequences that are too dark to tell what's happening. But the ending is decent and satisfying. Too bad they omitted Marta from the last two acts.The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Spain.GRADE C".

	schema:reviewBody "Several problems plague this overlong tedious flick. For one it takes an ideal premise and draws it out interminably as to make it excruciating. Also your protagonists are a motley poorlyrendered bunch for the most part.The story is a basic rework of TREASURE ISLAND. Transpose a literary classic to a new genre I get it. Should be fun right? A boy whose family runs a boarding house discovers a treasure map hidden by a traveling bounty hunter. The boy along with his own old uncle a dapper caballero and a wandering preacher set out across the mountains to find the gold. They must fight off a gang of roving bandits as well as their own paranoia and suspicions of each other. The story seems to take forever to get started and once the crew gets started on their trek to find the treasure nothing really happens for the next hour til the inevitable showdown.An actionadventure film like this that centers around a little boy is going to rise and fall on the performance of the boy and here young Humberto Sempere as Tony is sniveling wideeyed unlikeable. Plus he is voiced in a shrill broad manner by an obviously adult female actor. That alone kills the vibe of the flick from the getgo. Similarly the boy's uncle is given a goofy characterization which is truly grating. Among the other leads is the blankfaced American Richard Harrison as Pat the Preacher who has very limited Chuck Norrisesque range and who doesn't even show up until 30 minutes into the show. The best of the cast is the superclassy mucho macho Gilbert Roland. Imagine the Dos Equis Guy with a pencilthin John Watersstyle mustache and a gaudy vest that's him! Roland is dignified and sympathetic in all his parts and to this one he brings subtle shadings to a shady gunslinger that is at heart a decent man.Aside from Roland's performance the other part of the film I enjoyed is the initial setup featuring bounty killer Folco Lulli coming into town scoping out his next mark killing an informant and an outlaw along the way. Lulli's character however is killed off pretty quickly setting the scene for annoying Tony to find the map and begin the main thrust of the pic's story.Maybe the original Italian cut of this film favors the actors better than the English dub but even if that's so you'd still have to deal with the tedious pacing and lack of action. For the English dub anyway I call it a generous 510 stars.".

For starters there is far less action than you might think. Most of the movie is devoted to the characters engaged in boring chat. The actors seem to be trying but the unbelievably actionless plot leaves them pretty much helpless and unable to do much. And while Richard Harrison is prominently billed for some reason he is put on the backburner for the most part while the less famous actors are given more to do.

	schema:reviewBody "A good solid 70's western of the revenge formula with one vital refreshing story point a woman pursuing those who did her wrong. And she's not just any old cowgirl as you may have noticed from the cast list. If the plot as a whole is not one of the most original the great cast does give a good reason to see this movie. Raquel Welch does what she can in the bit limited role and she does it fine. Three western icons of Elam Borgnine and Martin make a bunch of villains that is at the same time one of the most revolting and tracelessly funny. If you have liked them in earlier westerns of Peckinpah and Kennedy you get mostly the same great treatment here. Martin especially always ends up stealing the show as the most dangerous idiot in the west ever. Robert Culp gives a good performance as a bounty hunter and killer with a piece of heart still left and a sensible head. And for Christopher Lee fans like me here he is noteworthy as always and apparently in his only western role of all the countless movie roles he has made. A pretty small role actually but it can't keep a great actor down.The strong influences of Peckinpah and spaghetti westerns are pretty obvious and mix together surprisingly well. The plot could have deserved a bit more development but it gives fairly good enjoyment as it is if you enjoy westerns in general. I consider this one of the better films from director Kennedy.".

It's just a masterful look at a small little piece of the old west.Others have mentioned how funny the bad guys are in this flick.  Well Strother Martin certainly does his usual comic turns but the three villains are FAR from humorous. They are rapists after all.    Martin's foolishness is used only to make us further dislike the three desperados.  This is not a comedy at all it's a serious story along the lines of Once Upon A Time In the West.The real key to this movie is Culp and the character he was lucky enough toplay.  His reserved spectacled bounty hunter is magnetic and quite unique. You can't take your eyes off of him even when Raquel is in the same scene.And Welch is also amazing in this.  I wouldn't be surprised if this is her personal favorite role of all time.   If you get a chance to see this don't miss it.  You'll either hate it or love it.

	schema:headline " Interesting and unusual western drama";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this again after more than 30 years and was prepared for a campy laughable Westernparody as so many from the Spaghetti Western Era are...especially anything at all starring camp queen Raquel Welch. I was rather pleasantly surprised. Yes there are campy moments but overall this is an interesting movie especially for the early 70s when the western genre was going into a long hibernation.The worst or campiest elements are the feministsexploitation aspects...on one hand Hannie Caulder wants us to take this story about a woman in the Old West seriously Hannie is raped and takes revenge into her own hands and on the other it wants to show us Raquel Welch very sexy and Playboy foldoutish in a short poncho and nothing else. Raquel was and is a tremendously beautiful woman but in an extremely period way  and that period was naturally the early 70s! Her artfully highlighted main of long straight hair and heavy eye makeup false eyelashes! don't look like anything remotely believable from the 1880s. I mention the poncho because it forms a very iconic image of Ms. Welch  almost as famous as her animal skin bikini from 1 Million BC  and it's so obviously meant to be titillating since we are intended to think she is totally naked underneath this skimpy garment and while riding a horse...OUCH. Later on Hannie acquires a pair of very very tight deerskin trousers also absurd for a woman of that era. Let's just make this clear  in the 19th century women absolutely never ever wore pants or men's clothing. Period.Putting that aside though the storyline is intriguing. Hannie's husband is killed and she is raped by a gang of sleazy thugs Strother Martin Ernest Borgnine etc. who burn down her cabin and all her possessions. She is rescued by Thomas Price a bounty hunter played by Robert Culp. This is an unexpected turn by Culp I Spy and a very nice one  he's extremely appealing and makes for a different sort of romantic hero especially with his glasses. After some initial coldness he warms up to Hannie and helps her on her mission of revenge while warning her of it's ultimate futility. Culp  Welch are not a romantic pair you'd expect and maybe because of that it really works. From the standpoint of the 21st century I don't feel the overall plot gives enough weight to the rape as a catalyst for Hannie's actions. It's a horrific rape and presented as such but then Hannie is encouraged to forget about it and find happiness with Thomas Price. Anyone who has ever lived through a rape or studied the aftereffects of such an experience recognizes this as a naive and simplistic solution. Also Hannie seems overly dependent on Price to teach her and do everything for her and only comes into her own in the last 20 minutes of the film.Still and all how often do you see a Western with a strong interesting female protagonist? NOT VERY. Even good modern Westerns such as Unforgiven or Open Range feature very passive females in traditional roles such as prostitute or schoolmarm. Hannie Caulder is actually ABOUT a female character and her experiences and as such it's a rare bird.It would be very interesting to see this remade today with a little less cheesecake Raquel in her poncho and a little more psychological awareness of a rape victim's emotional state. At any rate it kept me interested throughout and compared to other westerns of it's period I think Hannie Caulder is above average. Look for Christopher Lee in a rare nonhorror cameo as a gun maker.".

Superb widescreen photography cinematography by Edward Scaife camerawork by John Harris beautiful scenery and soaring music by Ken Thorne only add to the fun factor. Welch is quite easy to watch and Culp in one of his best ever roles is excellent as the reluctant teacher. Diana Dors is wasted in a nothing role as a madame but there's still great curiosity value in seeing Sir Christopher Lee here as he plays Bailey the kindly gunsmith who lives out in the middle of nowhere his performance is wonderful. Look also for Aldo Sambrell uncredited as a Mexican soldier and Stephen Boyd who has perhaps the most interesting role in the entire movie as the mysterious and ultimately helpful preacher. He utters not a word yet has an undeniable presence.A jaunty pace and generous doses of the red stuff help to make this a solid visceral entertainment. Quotable dialogue includes the gem There are no hard women only soft men. Clocking in at a trim 86 minutes Hannie Caulder doesn't overstay its welcome or ever get too draggy. It's sexy violent and a real hoot and one of the influences on Quentin Tarantino's pair of Kill Bill films.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:headline " An American spaghetti western with a gender reversal";
	schema:reviewBody "By 1971 the ripples the spaghetti western movement were in full effect in both sides of the Atlantic and Hannie Caulder is definitely a product of those times and the progeny of the films of Leone Corbucci or Parolini more than the traditional oaters of John Ford or Anthony Mann. It's evident in the bloody gunshots the sexual violence and the way the revenge plot unfolds.Undoubtedly part of the genre revisionism that turned the western upside down in the early 70's is the genre reversal tactics that director Burt Kennedy employs. We had seen a woman adopting a traditionally masculine role in the bossy nononsense guntotting saloon owner Joan Crawford played in Johnny Guitar. Hannie Caulder however takes a different approach and adopts almost verbatim the narrative skeleton of a typical spaghetti western  the antihero traumatized by a past event looking for revenge. Then proceeds to cast the beautiful Raquel Welch and her tanned well toned thighs in a role that in Italy would have been exclusive to the likes of Franco Nero Anthony Steffen or Maurizio Merli.Three bank robbers on the run from the Mexican Federales stop in a horse station kill the owner rape the wife burn the place down and leave her to die. A passing bounty hunter takes the wife under his wing and travels with her to Mexico to meet a gun maker that used to work for the Confederates. It's there that the typical training part of the antiheroine takes place and where she makes the turn from a wounded animal to a woman coming to terms with the path of revenge she has chosen.

	onyx:emotionText "By 1971 the ripples the spaghetti western movement were in full effect in both sides of the Atlantic and Hannie Caulder is definitely a product of those times and the progeny of the films of Leone Corbucci or Parolini more than the traditional oaters of John Ford or Anthony Mann. It's evident in the bloody gunshots the sexual violence and the way the revenge plot unfolds.Undoubtedly part of the genre revisionism that turned the western upside down in the early 70's is the genre reversal tactics that director Burt Kennedy employs. We had seen a woman adopting a traditionally masculine role in the bossy nononsense guntotting saloon owner Joan Crawford played in Johnny Guitar. Hannie Caulder however takes a different approach and adopts almost verbatim the narrative skeleton of a typical spaghetti western  the antihero traumatized by a past event looking for revenge. Then proceeds to cast the beautiful Raquel Welch and her tanned well toned thighs in a role that in Italy would have been exclusive to the likes of Franco Nero Anthony Steffen or Maurizio Merli.Three bank robbers on the run from the Mexican Federales stop in a horse station kill the owner rape the wife burn the place down and leave her to die. A passing bounty hunter takes the wife under his wing and travels with her to Mexico to meet a gun maker that used to work for the Confederates. It's there that the typical training part of the antiheroine takes place and where she makes the turn from a wounded animal to a woman coming to terms with the path of revenge she has chosen. By the end of the movie Hannie Caulder has transformed to a gutsy smart and wisecracking antiheroine and in no uncertain terms has embodied the angel of death aspect of the blackclad antiheroes of the spaghetti western  which is also evident in the final fight that takes place in the middle of a sandstorm.A major asset of the film is the cast.

	schema:headline " Roast Beef Western";
	schema:reviewBody "The sixties brought us the Spaghetti Western and the Paella Western and Hannie Caulder from the early years of the following decade is a rare example of a Britishmade Roast Beef Western. Although it was shot on location in Spain and all the main roles are played by Americans two British actors Christopher Lee and Diana Dors appear in cameos it was made by Tigon British Film Productions normally thought of as Hammer's main rivals in the British horror market. It formed part of a deal between Tigon and Curtwel the production company run by Raquel Welch and her then husband Patrick Curtis a deal which was also responsible for the horror film The Sorcerers. Despite Curtwel's involvement with The Sorcerers Raquel did not appear in that film.Jim Caulder a settler in a remote part of the West is murdered by the Clemens Brothers three notorious outlaws. The brothers then proceed to steal Caulder's horses set fire to his house and viciously rape and beat his beautiful young wife Hannie leaving her for dead. Hannie however has survived and swears revenge on the brothers. She meets a bounty hunter named Thomas Luther Price the two become lovers and Price agrees to teach her how to shoot like a professional gunfighter.Like a number of earlier Westerns The Naked Spur is an example which comes to mind Hannie Caulder is essentially an examination of the ethics of revenge. Some films of this nature take the conventional view that two wrongs do not make a right and that it is wrong to take the law into one's own hands such films generally end with the hero forswearing his quest for revenge. This viewpoint is here rather surprisingly expressed by Price who tries to dissuade Hannie from killing for revenge. His arguments are twofold. Firstly he is afraid that Hannie with whom he has fallen in love might be killed herself. Secondly he warns her that taking revenge will change her forever. Win or lose you lose. Hannie however rejects these arguments. She tells Price that she wants to be changed forever that she does not want to remain the defeated humiliated woman that she is now. The implication is that Hannie can only achieve psychological closure by getting justice for the death of her husband and for her own violation and that as the official channels of law enforcement are closed to her the local sheriff is far too cowardly to take on the bad guys she has no choice but to become her own avenger. Raquel Welch's time as a major Hollywood star was relatively brief lasting roughly between 1966 and 1976 and because of her sex symbol reputation she was offered plenty of roles which were designed to show off her face and figure more than her acting talents. Hannie Caulder however is one of her finest performances. Westerns with a female protagonist were comparatively rare Joan Crawford's role in Johnny Guitar was one of the few exceptions and even that film bore the name of a male character. Women in Westerns were often meant to be the peacemakers such as Grace Kelly in High Noon but Raquel makes Hannie into a superbly iconic avenging angel the incarnation of justice in an unjust world. Robert Culp is also good as Price. With his spectacles greying beard and soft voice he appears a mildmannered character but appearances can be deceptive. As a professional bountyhunter he is happy to admit that he kills men for money. Can you think of a better reason? His surname Price like that of Clint Eastwood's Munny in Unforgiven suggests that he is a man for hire. And yet he is also a man capable of strong emotions shown in his feelings for Hannie. There is also a good cameo from Lee as Bailey the gunsmith whom Price hires to build a custommade revolver for Hannie. Burt Kennedy acted both as director and as scriptwriter and seems to have been more proficient in the former department than in the latter. The film is well directed but there are a number of faults with the plot and with the characterisation. The mysterious character known as The Preacher is never well integrated into the story despite the important part he plays in one key scene and we never learn why he should have got involved. More importantly the way in which the Clemens brothers are portrayed adversely affects the film. The reviewer who described them as the Three Stooges transformed into murderous psychopaths had it about right. On the one hand we are supposed to accept them as dangerous criminals and they do manage to kill several people in the course of the film. On the other hand the sense of danger which they pose is constantly being undermined because Kennedy cannot resist the temptation to send them up and treat them as figures of fun hopelessly incompetent and forever bickering with each other. In one scene they use too much explosive while blowing open a safe with the result that they destroy all the money inside. Hannie Caulder is one of a number of decent Westerns made during the twilight years of the genre in the early seventies. Very few were to be made in the latter years of that decade. It could however have been a better one had the heroine been confronted with adversaries more worthy of her steel. 710".

The character of Hannie Caulder is kept to a minimum  she barely says a word Robert Culp's bounty hunter is a good likable character who gets most of the dialogue. The film surprised me as it killed off one of it's leading character's which you don't see too often although it's not perfect as there are pacing problem's with the middle third of it being a tad dull you never find out who the man in black is or what his motives are along with never discovering why that gang of Mexicans attack the gunmaker  anyone who has seen Hannie Caulder will know what I'm talking about. Overall though I' say this is a neat little Western with a commendably dark exploitative edge when it's not trying to be a comedy.Director Kennedy does a good job unfortunately I was forced to watch a hideously grainy scratched to buggery blown up pan and scan version which frankly looked horrible where only the opening  closing credits were letterboxed at it's correct ratio of 2351  I can only imagine how much better the film looks presented that way throughout. Set in America  Mexico it was actually shot in Spain which would have been cheaper for a British based company like Tigon. It looks nice enough with good period detail  some decent shoot outs  action. There's some gory gunshot wounds  a fairly explicit rape which is just about graphic enough to get it's point across without slipping into pure unnecessary exploitation. For those wondering Raquel Welch does not get naked in this film at any stage.Technically the film is fine with decent enough production values good sets costumes  period detail although it does use the dayfornight process on a few occasions which I never like. The acting is pretty good by a strong cast including Diana Dors  an unusual role for Christopher Lee Welch looks nice enough but isn't much of an actress so maybe it's a good thing she doesn't have to say a lot.Hannie Caulder is a neat raperevenge Western that has some oddball comedy moments in it as well it's a mixture that doesn't always work perfectly but it's entertaining all the same  definitely worth a watch preferably in it's original widescreen ratio if at all possible.

Robert Culp with a selflessness that we wish could be taken for granted in the real world wants to teach Raquel Welch how to use a gun.  But just a moment we need a suitable gun for a woman so let's go to the gunsmith and watch as the gun is manufactured.  What other movie ever thought to tip its hat respectfully to the craft of gunsmithing?  Kennedy seems like Chaucer capable of conveying enthusiasm about everything he sees.".

Robert Culp with a selflessness that we wish could be taken for granted in the real world wants to teach Raquel Welch how to use a gun.  But just a moment we need a suitable gun for a woman so let's go to the gunsmith and watch as the gun is manufactured.  What other movie ever thought to tip its hat respectfully to the craft of gunsmithing?  Kennedy seems like Chaucer capable of conveying enthusiasm about everything he sees.";

I don't think it was nearly as gritty as it was meant to be. When characters say things like You're a hard woman Hannie Caulder I felt like they could have done more to show how hard she had become rather than just point it out with dialog. Also there was a little bit of forced sentimentality and some illplaced comic relief that felt almost slapsticky.This is just nitpicking however. It was very satisfying and watchable at least for one viewing. Raquel Welch who I probably know best from her guest appearance on Seinfeld was very striking as the damaged frontier woman. A lot of people seem to really like the character that helps train her as a gunfighter. I found him more functional to the story than interesting. Christopher Lee had a cameo that had me asking if it was really him. And there was one unresolved plot point in that as far as I could tell they never explained who the mystery man in black was. If you are in the mood for a lighter easytowatch western this should go down nice. Just don't expect the depth of say Once Upon A Time...".

	schema:reviewBody "TITLE HANNIE CAULDER opened in theaters on July 1 1971 and the movie took 85 minutes to watch. Hannie Caulder is a 1971 Western movie starring Raquel Welch Ernest Borgnine and Robert Culp.SUMMARY The movie opens with Clemens Brothers riding into a Mexican Town and riding up to the bank. Across the dirt road is the Mexican Freda's sleeping and taking a break. As the Clemens Brothers are trying to rob the bank one of the tellers pulls a handle that rings a bell. All hell breaks loose a gunfight starts and the Clemens brothers head out of town with the Mexican Army after them. The Clemens Brothers come across Hannie Caulder her husband and their farm. Hannie Husband confronts the Clemens Brothers and he is shot and kill. One of the Clemens goes into the house to fine some food when he comes across Hannie himself. The Clemens Brothers each take their turn with Hannie raping her repeatedly. Then after they have their fun they torch the place and leave Hannie for dead. Hannie makes it out only to fine her husband dead down by the stable that use to hold their horses. Hannie buries her husband and with only a blanket starts walking. Hannie comes to and old Mexican Farm with a well when a Bounty Hunter confronts her name Thomas Price. Hannie knocks Price out with the barrel of his rifle starts to leave only to change her mind and stays with him. Hannie takes Prices revolver and starts practicing to shoot. Hannie ask Price if he would teach her how to use a gun and he says no and leaves. However Hannie follows him and while she is sleeping she starts having nightmares about what those three animals did to her. Hannie wakes up in tears and Price asks her how many where there and she tells him 3. What about your husband and Hannie tell him his dead. Therefore after hearing her story Price agrees to help her and her to see Christopher Lee who is a blacksmith and make Hannie a special gun. QUESTIONS Why did the Clemens brothers attack Hannie Caulder? Why did they leave her for dead? How far did Hannie walk before she came across the farm? Who showed up at lee place? What did the person want? Who else showed up at Lee place? What did they want? Where did Price and Hannie go after they were finish at Lee place? MY THOUGHTS I thought this movie was fantastic. I thought that the three actors who played the role of the Clemens Brothers did a very good job. Robert Culp also did a good job playing the role of the gunfighter. However this movie was about one person and one person only. Raquel Welch! Her role as Hannie Caulder was excellent. When she came out of the fire all she had on was a blanket. Then they turned around and designed the blanket into a Mexican pullover which made her more beautiful. Raquel Welch displayed her beauty and her talents with any problems what so ever. Based on Raquel Beauty and Talent alone I give this movie the highest amount of weasel stars I can give and that are 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Revenge movies have been a staple for decades now. The story set up is nearly identical in all someone is wronged and they seek revenge on the person who did wrong against them. While that story can be set up in a single sentence it is the meat of the story wrapped around it that makes either a good film or a bad one. Add to that the performances direction and technical aspects of a movie and you have more that makes it good or bad. HANNIE CAULDER is a better film than anticipated.Raquel Welch burst upon the movie scene as a sexy bombshell a woman known for her looks only. If she could act that was just a plus to most studios. Her back to back hits with 1000000 YEARS B.C. and FANTASTIC VOYAGE secured her more mainstream roles than she'd had up to that point. While her looks helped her move her career forward they also limited what studios were willing to put her in. But her acting abilities helped her get better roles and more leads such as this one.The film opens in the old west with Welch as the title character forced to watch her husband killed by a group of men and raped by all three. The Clemons brothers Emmett Ernest Borgnine Frank Jack Elam and Rufus Strother Martin burn down her house and head out leaving her to die but Hannie is tougher than they realized. Setting out to find help she is rescued by a lone rider.Fortunately for her the man is Thomas Luther Price Robert Culp a bounty hunter who knows how to handle a gun. At first Price is unsympathetic to Hannie's decision to seek revenge telling her it will solve nothing. He eventually is persuaded to teach her how to shoot and aids her in her quest for vengeance. As the two pursue the Clemons brothers they begin to feel an attraction to one another something that may not end well once they catch up to their prey.The movie offers a nice combination of western and revenge picture with a touch of humor tossed in. Odd that humor would play a part in a movie with the themes of rape and revenge but it's there. The humor is found in the characters of the Clemons brothers a complete bungling trio who end up with more failed plans than you can count. Their constant bickering and failures don't make them sympathetic characters though as Hannie relives the rape over and over in her mind. While this is a disgusting act to deal with in any film here it is shown to be brutal and yet not so revealing as to offend the more sensitive. Director Burt Kennedy takes the high road in not giving us more details than we need.HANNIE CAULDER doesn't add much new to either the western or raperevenge genres but it does tell the tale in a wellcrafted manner. The script the photography the direction the acting all combine to present us with a movie that is interesting and builds up a sense of anticipation waiting for the final confrontation that is bound to happen. Best of all the movie shows that Welch could actually act. Some may fault her for looking gorgeous in this film but I would say don't fault her fault a studio system that was bent on making sure that was the focus of the film. Even the original poster shots emphasized that. But Welch does a great job here as does Culp an often overlooked actor who deserved more credit.This new bluray release comes from Olive Films and is part of their Signature Series. Unlike most Olive releases there are extras included here that are of some interests. They include an audio commentary by western expert and director Alex Cox WALKER REPO MAN Exploitation or Redemption an examination of raperevenge movies by film scholar Ben Sher A Very British Horror Studio which is an interview with Sir Christopher Frayling on the history of Tigon Studios and an essay by film critic Kim Morgan.Wellmade with a new high definition digital restoration this is a must have for western fans as well as Welch fans. The movie looks great and aside from the distasteful notion of rape is an entertaining film as well. Olive deserves kudos for the pains they took with this movie. It's worth adding to your collection.".

Some plot spoilers ahead. Well the robbery of the DHSS office to the beat of Ace Of Spades is a great one as is the sequence where Spider and his boss cycle through the countryside while Orgasmatron plays in the background. I find it so amusing that radio stations here claim to know what driving music is when Motrhead has never made it into their playlists. Then again you sort of expect this kind of stupidity from radio stations these days. Another favourite of mine is the dinner party where we get to see all of Motrhead as they play Doctor Rock. Check out Rik Mayall dancing in the crowd it's a riot.Main star Lanah Pellay takes hamfisted acting to a whole new level when hesheit and friends take over the restaurant subtly known as Bards before the gang change the name to Eat The Rich. Bards can I help you? is now my favourite way to answer a phone. There has never been a funnier way to answer the phone in fact. If you ever go to a restaurant where one of the main menu items is Manager With Chips whatever you do don't order that one. All in all I give Eat The Rich six out of ten. It is crude it is crass it is exceptionally vulgar but it's the funniest thing I've seen about fine dining.".

At the time my first two thoughts were What the Hell is this? and then This looks like something to watch! Three years later I stumbled across a VHS copy of it in a bargain bin of Record Theater and snapped it up for 2. Being cheap it's one of those rare occasions where I figured that I got more than my money's worth. This film is truly different. It constantly flips between well constructed and paced scenes to a variety of cheap countryside scenes that connected a lot of the main characters. It feels like they ran short of money and spent a day filming a lot of quick scenes to try and make the movie fit together. Now don't let that stop you from watching it and many of the scenes are unforgettable but the film does slow down every time the action shifts out of London. If you can get through that and Jimmy's annoying jokes then you'll see a film that really is unlike any other I've come across.".

At the time my first two thoughts were What the Hell is this? and then This looks like something to watch! Three years later I stumbled across a VHS copy of it in a bargain bin of Record Theater and snapped it up for 2. Being cheap it's one of those rare occasions where I figured that I got more than my money's worth. This film is truly different. It constantly flips between well constructed and paced scenes to a variety of cheap countryside scenes that connected a lot of the main characters. It feels like they ran short of money and spent a day filming a lot of quick scenes to try and make the movie fit together. Now don't let that stop you from watching it and many of the scenes are unforgettable but the film does slow down every time the action shifts out of London. If you can get through that and Jimmy's annoying jokes then you'll see a film that really is unlike any other I've come across.";

This movie was meant to have a better script and they obviously fubbed it up. Don't tell me that they were well capable of telling an intriguing and coherent story but opted for cinematic surrealism instead. I've made movies myself and I know fully well how they got to be so intriguingly offbeat and charmingly eccentric.

The plot was flimsy and fumbled with very strange pacing and the whole thing felt like it was going nowhere. For reasons unknown most of the Comic Strip regulars only appear in fleeting cameos and whilst fun to see make little impact having no real material to work with. None of the leads are well known for being comic actors and handled their roles pretty poorly unable to wring any laughs from the weak script.It felt like the writers came up with the idea of yuppies eating themselves again not a particularly innovative allegory for the 80s since we saw it in 'The Cook the Thief...' and the cannibalism angle also in 'Consuming Passions' and then put the absolute minimum effort into crafting a plot around that conceit. To cap it off the whole thing looked dirt cheap.It gets 2 stars for the enjoyable array of cameos and the Motorhead soundtrack.Do yourself a favour and watch some of Peter Richardson's better Comic Strip films.

The superstitious sailors were terrified by what was really childish mischievous fun.When the ship put into Tampico where the Captain hoped to leave them behined with the local Madame played by Lila Kedrova who seemed to have taken acting lessons from Carmen Miranda the children were spruced up and returned to their clean clothes and with their hair combed.  As the crew member doing the grooming explained the Captain wants you to look your best for the ladies.  What ladies? asked the children.  Under his breath the seaman muttered You'll find out.  Of course the local ladies were the ladies of ill repute in a Godforsaken part of the Carribean where anything goes and the law would never set foot.The beauty of the film is that it rises above the mawkish semtimentally that it could have fallen into.  The Captain Chavez takes to the young girl Emily who is as feisty as they come and she and the other children take to him.  A Victorian version of the Stockholm syndrome where the captives idenity with their captors.The story is a tragedy as the pirates who after all were simply making a living in the only way they knew. It wasn't even a profitable living just a traditional but dying occupation.  Suddenly they were stuck with some illdisciplined little English children travelling to England to be paced in English boarding schools and civilised  and neither side really understood the other.

Anthony Quinn and James Coburn were brilliant lovable rogues and the main little girl was someone my kids could identify with. Gert Frobe as the Dutch sea captain was memorable and the English cast director Alexander Mackendrick and the screenwriters should be commended for creating a superb example of the art of cinema.  I have but one sad comment Why isn't this film available on videotape or disk or at least on cable?".

Of course there is a bit of artistic license but the makeup of the crew the scenes at the Port of Tampico and the general feel of the film make it good fare considering the constraints put on motion pictures in the year it was made. Many things implied and understood behind the PGrated facade of most scenes. The acting I found very good the actors showed their contempt inhumanity decency evil etc. the facial expressions and acting of the madam in Tampico shows the ugliness behind the gilded facade beautifully without having to talk down to the audience. Overall a very pleasant surprise for me and I won't miss this one the next time it's on.".

Didn't remember the other actors and actresses except that I really liked the girl who ended up in the courtroom. I loved the theme song but don't know if it's any more available than the movie.  It says something like  When man is young and certain of what he wants to be.....Then fate brings a love to him that hangs him high from the gallow's tree my friend high from the gallow's tree. Does anyone know who sang this ballad?  I can't remember the rest of the words. Anyway I agree with everyone else  It's a shame High Wind is not available to us on video or somewhere.

It even features a brief appearance by Gert Frobe of Goldfinger fame.Despite the presence of young children and pirates it's definitely not a children's movie. There are dark undertones and some surprisingly adult themes. Quinn and Coburn give first rate performances as pirates who inadvertently kidnap a group of British children on their way back to Great Britain from Jamaica after a storm...but this film belongs to Deborah Baxter. Her performance as the feisty Emily is absolutely mesmerizing. It's hard to imagine she only made two movies she plays Teddy Roosevelt's daughter in The Wind and The Lion. Her acting seems well beyond her years. I guarantee it's a performance that will stick with you long after the final credits.I highly recommend this film.".

That said the film's very lowkey nature might not win it much approval among actionfilm fans...Curiously enough half the film is actually spoken in Spanish without the benefit of English subtitles!  and while it tends to wander because of this also gives the proceedings a welcome air of fullblooded vividness! Anthony Quinn is his usual largerthanlife self but his befuddled interaction with the kids endears him to viewers even more here. James Coburn is very amusing as Quinn's secondincommand who can't speak a word of Spanish and is often at a loss as to what is going on around him though I would have liked some form of an explanation as to his incongruous presence there. Dennis Price has a notable cameo towards the very end as a solicitor leeringly prying into the children's 'experience' with the pirates while guest star Gert Frobe only appears in one crucial scene as a wounded Dutch captain but who eventually has a huge bearing on the plot resolution the film also features Nigel Davenport as the children's father and Lila Kedrova as a 'tavernkeeper'.The opening hurricane sequence  which gives the film and the novel it is based on its title  is extremely well done though the climactic courtroom sequence and its outcome the willful execution of the pirates is rather too rushed to be as effective as it needs to be. The antics of the children of English and Spanish origins are fun to watch  but Deborah Baxter leaves the best impression as she is the one to bond most with Quinn. Larry Adler's lovely score subtly accentuates Douglas Slocombe's colorful widescreen imagery.Alexander Mackendrick was an AmericanbornScotlandbred director who made his name at Britain's famed Ealing Studios and went on to have a very brief but often brilliant career this was actually his penultimate work. Incidentally the two films of his I've yet to watch  MANDY 1952 and SAMMY GOING SOUTH 1963  also feature children as their protagonists.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie as a child and it had made such an impact on me that I never forgot it or the haunting theme song. I'd long since forgotten the title so I was utterly thrilled when I happened to turn the AMC channel on and they were playing it  30 years after it was in theaters! It wasn't until after the two main actors passed away that this movie was FINALLY released to the public  around 40 years AFTER it was made. I do not know if it was due to some rights conflict or that maybe they didn't want it released due to the original story that dealt with a very 'inappropriate relationship' between the childcharacter Emily and the Captain. This relationship is displayed far more subtly in the movie most likely to make it a bit more familyfriendly however the book was far from being a familyfriendly novel. The book and movie are thankfully and EXTREMELY different in demeanor and focus. The author's focus appeared to be more with a notion of an innate evil within children where he presents them as being cunning manipulative knowledgefilled demonlike creatures rather then innocentminded youths. A couple of examples of the differences in demeanor between the book and the movie In the book it is the Captains righthand man Zac who takes the eldest darkhaired girl by brutal force and keeps her as his  uh  female. When she becomes a lifeless emotionless shell he simply throws her overboard into the sea. In the movie it is the girl who takes notice to a crew member and no one is taken by force or repeatedly raped or thrown to the sharks. At the end of the movie Emily is confused by what occurred on board with the battle they were involved with where the other ships Captain was murdered in Captain Chavez's quarters where Emily was. She very innocently grievously and mistakenly says something that sends her beloved Captain and his crew to the gallows. In the book she did it on purpose with malicious intent. It's like two completely different stories.I would much rather watch this wonderful and exciting movie then to ever again read the dark novel that this came from. The acting is completely superb even among the children. I have watched it several times and I will again.".

Anthony Quinn tenders the character of Chavez captain of a pirate ship of whole cloth we always believe in Chavez and find him a worthwhile study. We have loved like himwhether it was a cuddly little animal or a neat person in our world awhilefor no reason other than that the loved delights us. While the love itself is pure it can bring on trouble. This is demonstrated in both the film story line and the film's history the latter being that the film has been basically closeted  perhaps due to society's discomfort with a grownman'saffectionforalittlegirl story line. Debra Baxter as Emily is a total charmer realistically skinnier while unparented at sea.The tale evolves around her character a 10yearold English kid raised in Jamaica and now being shipped with her siblings and another family to the mother land to be reared out of her heathen ways.While Chavez's gang invades their ship the children as always in their own world explore the pirate vessel and are still aboard when the clueless pirates take off. They are discovered and the pirates want to chunk them on the next island or worse but Chavez insists the kids stay until they get to a safe port.The crew mutinees the kids are saved but Emily thinks she has committed a deed she will be punished for. An excellant dramatization of the potency of the untamed internal value system aptly including society's outsiderbadmen as a frame of reference. It's a movie to chew over and think about. Children of both sexes enjoy it again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler alert This is a wonderful if somewhat disturbing kids film. I'd heard a lot about it and am a huge fan of the great Alexander Mackendrick so I bought the DVD and it certainly didn't let me down. It's definitely one out of the box though because while it has an adventurous tone and concept it has its fair share of grim moments  when the drunk monkey falls to its death brilliantly and blackly capping the kind of moment that would be found in a Disney film I knew I was in for something unusual. I can't think of another kids movie that goes into the kind of territory that this one does. Its main theme seems to be about the transition from the innocent childhood world into the murky dangerous and complex adult world. It's a rare kids film indeed where one of the young boys dies in a tragic accident and the main pirate character whom we and the kids have grown to love meets his ultimate fate on the gallows. I love the fact that the makers didn't shy away from sugar coating the world the kids have dropped into and the fact that something bad may happen to them at any point and their baffled slightly uncomprehending reaction to their new world adds a level of tension and unexpected pathos to the proceedings. The direction and cinematography are tremendous the film was shot by the great Dougie Slocombe and the kids are astonishing. How Mackendrick managed to get the performances that he did is amazing and it's a shame that Deborah Baxter as Emily didn't go on to do more movies. The final shot where the model ship is floating away across a pond in a London park is a brilliant and moving image to suggest that Emily's childhood is over and forever drifting away from her. This is highly recommended and it's a shame it isn't more widely known.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Quinn is the captain of a pirate ship in the middle 1600s. The ship and its crew loot a British passenger ship. Half a dozen young kids mostly British board the victim ship accidentally sail away aboard the pirate ship. Quinn a drunken and pediculous lout comes eventually to care about the children in his own crude way before a British Naval steamship capture him and his superstitious crew and rescue the kids who are by this time wearing tattered clothing and are filthy.The two central roles are those of Anthony Quinn and Deborah Baxter as one of the children. Quinn does his usual reliable number  Zorba the Greek with edginess. He's dashing around the deck in his bare feet shouting orders in Spanish slapping impertinent seamen about the head.But Deborah Baxter's role is important. And she's magnetic. It's worth speculating why this should be so but the answer isn't too flattering to the gentlemen in the audience. She was nine years old when this film was released. She's not striking beautiful  no porcelain doll like Brooke Shields in Pretty Baby. There is nevertheless something extremely appealing about her appearance and demeanor. Please I'm no pedophile. I find older women more likable for all the reasons given by Benjamin Franklin.But Deborah Baxter prepubescent though she may be combines her juvenile vulnerability with a clearly seductive quality which Quinn's character the writers and director Alexander MacKendrick all recognize and put to use in the story. It mocks our sensibilities to deny it. Jenny Agutter was about fourteen when she made Walkabout and Sue Lyon fourteen when she was Kubrick's Lolita. Not that Quinn's pirate captain necessarily realizes what's up. He's clearly embarrassed at one point at which he finds himself having to pin Baxter down to the deck hovering above her the crew chuckling because the position is suggestive. It's also clear that by the end Quinn's desire to help and protect her has eclipsed any sexual feelings he might have felt.She's a decent actress too for a young girl. Her confusion at the climactic trial puts a definite period at the end of Quinn's career. And she turned quite beautiful in the next few years. That's why she was cast as Teddy Roosevelt's daughter in The Wind and the Lion. Her character in that film Alice Roosevelt Longworth was a nononsense woman who lived into a candid late old age and died just one or two decades ago. You know the song Alice Blue Gown? She's the Alice. I loved Quinn. People accuse him of overacting yet it fits the part of a selfindulgent nottoobright pirate captain huffing and puffing always on the edge of hysteria. It's not really Zorba we see on the screen. It's Zampano from Fellini's La Strada. A brute but one who comes to have civilized feelings after all.".

	schema:headline " Tragicomedy results when befuddled pirates forced into role of babysitters to stranded children";
	schema:reviewBody "Superb adaptation of Richard Hughes' novel about a group of British children being sent home to England from Jamaica and inadvertently ending up as uninvited guests aboard a pirate ship. Set in the period of about 1880 much humor arises from the proper Victorian English children's fascination with their reluctant babysitters. The crew of scalawags is made up of various Latin American and African men with most of their conversation in untranslated Spanish. The irony of the unexpected situation is due to two factors the kids' parents had sent them home because their mother was appalled at the way they were growing up wild and uncivilized absorbing the voodoo superstitions and folk tales of the islanders instead of being raised as proper English children. The other factor was that the inept pirates had not realized that the children had snuck on board the pirate ship seeing it as a great adventure and the buccaneers had sailed away with no idea that the kids were shut in the ship's hold having totally forgotten about them.Anthony Quinn is marvelous in a great comic role as the unwilling father figure to the curious and innocent bunch of kids he's been stuck with. The sight of Quinn chasing some young English children around the ship hollering  Hey give me back my hat! while his crew laughs uproariously is truly funny. James Coburn is the voice of reason as a sly articulate pirate who stands between the bumbling captain and his restless crew.

One of the older boys sneaks ashoreand is enjoying the sight of rowdy behavior in the street from the vantage point of a high window but he suddenly falls and is killed. The tragic situation is made worse by the news that English patrol vessels are looking for them because it is mistakenly believed that they murdered the children after the kids didn't return to their outward bound ship and the English captain and crew assumed the worst.No more of the plot will be revealed here except to say that an unpredictable series of events causes disaster for all involved. The very ending is one of the most poignant scenes I've ever seen in any film.Direction acting shipboard scenes period detail scriptcinematography are all excellent. The children are totally believable with a standout performance by Deborah Baxter as Emily. This is a wonderful film that should be watched over and over again.

	onyx:emotionText "Superb adaptation of Richard Hughes' novel about a group of British children being sent home to England from Jamaica and inadvertently ending up as uninvited guests aboard a pirate ship. Set in the period of about 1880 much humor arises from the proper Victorian English children's fascination with their reluctant babysitters. The crew of scalawags is made up of various Latin American and African men with most of their conversation in untranslated Spanish. The irony of the unexpected situation is due to two factors the kids' parents had sent them home because their mother was appalled at the way they were growing up wild and uncivilized absorbing the voodoo superstitions and folk tales of the islanders instead of being raised as proper English children. The other factor was that the inept pirates had not realized that the children had snuck on board the pirate ship seeing it as a great adventure and the buccaneers had sailed away with no idea that the kids were shut in the ship's hold having totally forgotten about them.Anthony Quinn is marvelous in a great comic role as the unwilling father figure to the curious and innocent bunch of kids he's been stuck with.

It stars Anthony Quinn James Coburn Deborah Baxter Lila Kedrova Martin Amis Dennis Price and Nigel Davenport. Music is by Larry Adler with the song High on a Gallows Tree song by Mike LeRoy and cinematography is by Douglas Slocombe. Out of 20th Century Fox it's a DeLuxe ColorCinemaScope production.When a hurricane hits the isle of Jamaica in 1870 the Thornton family seek refuge in the basement. Here they discover the servants and workers performing a voodoo ceremony to ward off evil spirits. Horrified Mrs Thornton decides to send the children and their two friends back to England to be educated away from what she deems savagery. However during the voyage the youngsters are mistakenly taken captive by pirates an event that will change forever the lives of captives and capturers alike.He's afraid he says that kids bring bad luck...Richard Hughes' source novel was a one time part of the scholastic curriculum at Blighty seats of learning back in the day the thematics of such a literary work no doubt inducing many a beardy teacher into lecturing over drive. Alexander Mackendrick's film adaptation manages to retain the literary feel whilst also entertaining by way of its intrigue. In many ways it's an odd film a blend of pirates and children on board a ship screams out as something Disneyesque in make up but it really isn't in any shape or form a frothy swash buckler movie. The pirates led by Quinn's wonderfully full of gusto Chavez are more human by motives and mannerisms around them the children are realistic they are not afraid why would they be since they have not been taught that Pirates are bad? The youngsters merely see their stay with the bluff n ruff crew as an extended adventure.Their spirit is infectious and Emily an impressive Baxter has a particularly beguiling effect on Chavez but his right hand man Zac Coburn effectively mannered senses trouble and it's not long before the crew begin to fret about the lasting implications of the children being on board. We just know that something bad is going to come out of this unlikely coupling of youth and pirates and it's then for the last third of the movie that Hughes' literary themes start to tumble out of the screen. Emotional and psychological twangs are neatly etched into the narrative by the ever astute Mackendrick and a quandary surfaces by way of the innocence of youth it's power which when confronted by guilt creates a moral void that closes the picture though not the novel on an edgy note.Film looks great with Slocombe's Scope photography out of the top draw and Adler's score carries with it an ethereal quality that befits the haunting like nature of the story. Fox's Region 1 DVD release is double sided giving a choice of full frame or widescreen for those with big televisions the only way to see it is in widescreen but the print is far from pristine. On release the film was met with much indifference many were not sure what they had just watched or were simply just upset at not getting a swash buckling adventure yarn. That uneasy reception goes some way to explaining why the film is largely forgotten and since over the years it has hardly ever been shown on television it's certainly unseen. It deserves more exposure very well put together all told and definitely a picture that is strong in narrative as it puts human qualities firmly under the microscope. 810".

This is thumpingly enjoyable entertainment even with dare I mention them? 'subtitles.' In less than two hours you will feel that you've known Mum and Dad eldest son Albert grungy sister Fleur romantic bro' Raphael all your life. Cos now you know theirs.Blood ties and facts are only one of the ways we relate. Usually the really important bits are a single moment incident or word. Bits that affect everything else. Bits that define people to you in ways words can't. Intimacies or misunderstandings. Hard decisions taken when you disagree with those you love.Powered by a wonderfully crossChannel soundtrack The First Day of the Rest of Your Life is fast and funny. And never flippant. A film for intelligent teenagers who still like to get wasted. For parents struggling to bond. For those in relationships and those struggling to connect. It's not often I feel I can recommend a film to nearly everyone I know barring subtitles allegies. But I'll stick my neck out and say this is one.It's a symphonic comedy. Of finding yourself alone in the midst of those who love you. Taking pride in yourself even if noone remembers. Of finally getting through to someone. It could almost be the thinking feelgood film of the year if it wasn't in French maybe they'll dub it for America?? To get such a complex mix right is masterpiece of modern editing. But the filmmakers have also been astutely conscious of the need to define key experiences in terms audiences can relate to rather than just the way they are experienced by the characters. A love of grunge and praying at Jim Morrison's grave for instance does not translate into inflicting Nirvana and the Doors on us. Rather music is used in classic style to communicate feelings.Or Bowie Time  He's waiting in the wings . . .His script is you and me boy There are plenty of senseless things in the First Day of the Rest of Your Life. Believe me  air guitar has never looked so cool. But there are enough really cool heartwarming moments to make it more than worth your ticket price. It doesn't hit the intellectual selfawareness heights about dysfunctional families that it is capable of  life death trust and infidelity burying your dog nicotine patches feng shui confiscated joints premature ejaculation and facelifts  none of this matters and yet it does. And as polished allround entertainment this film is fairly hard to beat. If you disagree maybe be you're taking life too seriously and not seriously enough. Sometimes it's hard as every film critic knows. To just stop analysing long enough to smell the grass. In literary terms it amounts to Mrs Dalloway buying the flowers herself.".

Cos now you know theirs.Blood ties and facts are only one of the ways we relate. Usually the really important bits are a single moment incident or word. Bits that affect everything else. Bits that define people to you in ways words can't. Intimacies or misunderstandings. Hard decisions taken when you disagree with those you love.Powered by a wonderfully crossChannel soundtrack The First Day of the Rest of Your Life is fast and funny. And never flippant. A film for intelligent teenagers who still like to get wasted. For parents struggling to bond. For those in relationships and those struggling to connect. It's not often I feel I can recommend a film to nearly everyone I know barring subtitles allegies. But I'll stick my neck out and say this is one.It's a symphonic comedy. Of finding yourself alone in the midst of those who love you. Taking pride in yourself even if noone remembers. Of finally getting through to someone. It could almost be the thinking feelgood film of the year if it wasn't in French maybe they'll dub it for America?? To get such a complex mix right is masterpiece of modern editing. But the filmmakers have also been astutely conscious of the need to define key experiences in terms audiences can relate to rather than just the way they are experienced by the characters. A love of grunge and praying at Jim Morrison's grave for instance does not translate into inflicting Nirvana and the Doors on us. Rather music is used in classic style to communicate feelings.Or Bowie Time  He's waiting in the wings . . .His script is you and me boy There are plenty of senseless things in the First Day of the Rest of Your Life. Believe me  air guitar has never looked so cool. But there are enough really cool heartwarming moments to make it more than worth your ticket price. It doesn't hit the intellectual selfawareness heights about dysfunctional families that it is capable of  life death trust and infidelity burying your dog nicotine patches feng shui confiscated joints premature ejaculation and facelifts  none of this matters and yet it does. And as polished allround entertainment this film is fairly hard to beat. If you disagree maybe be you're taking life too seriously and not seriously enough. Sometimes it's hard as every film critic knows. To just stop analysing long enough to smell the grass. In literary terms it amounts to Mrs Dalloway buying the flowers herself.";

Today I saw Toy Story 3 not a bad instalment in the franchise but nothing special with my 9year old daughter and as we came out of the auditorium I looked around and saw ads for 1 an animated dog flick for kids 2 a standard blockbuster CGIfest all shot in blue and 3 a loadsofexplosions bog standard actioner. Why is noone making films about reality anymore? Are the lives of real people no longer worth considering? Why is Hollywood producing such a deluge of crap these days? La Premier Jour de la Reste de ma Vie tells the story of a family by way of a few individual days over the course of c15 years. Don't expect any contrived pivotal moments of misunderstanding  this film is above that. It shows the conflicts between family members and the frustration and bitterness yet attempts to demonstrate how these rifts came about. It also shows how people learn from the failures of their parents and how they try not to repeat them. Look up the poem This be the Lesson by Philip Larkin for how important this is...It is also about love the bonds of family redemption nostalgia and if the final scene doesn't have tears pissing from your eyes then you have no heart.".

Bizarrely though there's one message that seems rather twisted you can only really enjoy yourself if you smoke something with a bit of kick in it! OK..I'll go try that...How their lives pan out can be a tad predictable because this has been done before. But this movie rolls with so much panache drama nostalgia a superb soundtrack and lots of humour. In fact I laughed out loud a few times. The performances are uniformly excellent especially the actor playing the father.

However I don't want to make the film sound heavy or preachy. It remains light and real and the only heaviness is the dramatically impactful incidents which evolve from these well sketched dynamics. Besides the musical me was delighted by a perfect scene from the late 70's which had me reflecting that I had not played air guitar with quite such lan and enthusiasm since exactly that time. Also note the plot line that follows one of the male brothers frustrating failure to follow through on a truly kismetic introduced love interest. Superb light but deep film about what carelessly inattentive parenting can do to all those or that's the joke isn't it?  uninvolved with the result. Depths left unexplored in The Movie Show.

This film combines both nostalgia and regret into one well paced film that contains great acting magnificent direction and a swell soundtrack. A french film alas some may consider it to be overrated if they have never experienced nostalgia. The ones who have experienced nostalgia however will absolutely love this film. Whoever this director is I'm going to look for some more films that he directed because this was absolutely stunning.

This film displays nostalgia of our good times of the times we missed the times we loved and the times we cherished. It also deals however with the times we hated the times we were embarrassed and the times that were bad. This film combines both nostalgia and regret into one well paced film that contains great acting magnificent direction and a swell soundtrack. A french film alas some may consider it to be overrated if they have never experienced nostalgia. The ones who have experienced nostalgia however will absolutely love this film. Whoever this director is I'm going to look for some more films that he directed because this was absolutely stunning. A spectacular experience that will make you feel with the characters with pain and nostalgia. I will not give anything else away. 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Duvals a French family is closely examined during five key days of their lives. The father Robert a taxi driver and his wife Marie Jeanne enjoy the kind of life most people would envy. They seem to be solid middle class trying to do the best for their three children Raphael Albert and Fleur. Over a twelve year span the family is shown at different points in their lives. Earlier as the film credits roll we are given glimpses of the family pictures about their time together the crisis and the happiness. Meeting the members will take the full length of the film that reflects the time in which the action happens. Robert is a placid man with his best intentions for providing for the family. Unfortunately Robert never really got to know his wineloving father well. He never can tell him about it because the old man dies while all dressed up for his grandson's wedding.MarieJeanne with all her good intentions and the family's best interest at hand suffers from what could only be described as a generation gap. She does not really understand Fleur her young daughter's attitude toward life. Only by taking a peek at Fleur's diary does she get an idea what she is all about her insecurities as well as the way she perceives a life her mother never had. Director Remi Benzancon looks into this family with such a perception that results into a film that while it's basic premise is the family he questions its purpose in our society. The changing times influence the way the members of the Duval clan change. As the children mature and get on their own the original bond is there although seldom questioned until tragedy intervenes something that brings all of them together in a bond that was never broken.Good acting in general was achieved by the director. Jacques Gamblin is Robert Duval the father. Zabou Breitman makes a wonderful MarieJeanne. Young Deborah Francois is a surprise in the film as the troubled Fleur. MarcAndre Grondin and Pio Marmai appear as Raphael and Albert. Old timer Roger Dumas is seen as the grandfather.A life affirming tribute to the family as a unit.".

However this was a movie in which he wasn't really allowed to reveal his range of acting skills and is largely a disposable movie which will probably be long forgotten in years to come.This movie essentially fits in to the current Korean fad for 'romantic comedies' with added inspiration from the U.S. series Sex and The City. In fact I couldn't really see why this movie wasn't just made as a TV production rather than wasting good money as a movie format. The lead actor played by Lee Byung Hun plays around with 3 sisters of very differing personalities. We get to see him pair up again with the actress Choi Ji Woo who plays one of the sisters. Previously Lee Byung Hun had starred in the highly successful TV drama series Beautiful Days with Choi Ji Woo. In that drama series Choi Ji Woo played a very quiet ailing angelic figure. It was therefore quite surprising to see her play a comic role in Everybody Has A Secret so well. As a result I thought Choi Ji Woo's character was the strongest in the whole movie and not only that but even perhaps the ONLY personality in the movie. Everyone else was a rather twodimensional cut out figure. I felt I couldn't really care about the fate of any of them overall. In fact by the end no character has achieved anything worthy of note. I couldn't even possibly remember any of the character's names too. That says a lot for the impact of the film.I think this is only a movie for diehard Lee Byung Hun fans or for someone who desperately needs to get through a rainy afternoon. It's purely an excuse to ogle at him for an hour or two. It's not a movie about acting standards. Anyone who knows Lee Byung Hun's reputation amongst Koreans as a 'player' will start to wonder how much they see on screen might ironically be some reflection of Lee Byung Hun's real life. That was the only thought that remained with me after the movie finished.".

I guess it's happened before as most of the people know this Godzillalike beast by his first name Yongary. Anyways Yongary destroys a bunch of buildings killing a bunch of people I assume and ravages the Korean oil refineries using the blowtorch in his mouth. We find out that he was only causing this ruckus because his tummy was growling yes our boy Yongary was hungry. That pretty much covers most of the movie other than a scene where he starts to dance which makes it all worth watching not really.";

The scientist and his obnoxious but likable 9 year old sidekick soon discover that nuclear testing in the Mid east have awaken the legendary monster Yongary and he's heading straight for Seoul!After making quick work of the army and airforce Yongary who looks like a close relative to Godzilla heads for an oil refinery and starts to drink the oil! Having followed Yongary to the refinery through the sewers the kid aims his static gun at the beast and he starts to dance to what sounds like surf music!Before long the monster is on the rampage again.To the uninitiated this might seem like a Japanese monster movie. Although it does borrow heavilly from Godzilla this film has its own unique feel. The FX are reminiscent of Tsubarayas work and the directional style is pure Honda but thats not a bad thing.Even though Yongary is a man in a monster suit it is fairly well done The FX do run hot and cold. The prerequisites city stomping is good but you can see the blowtorch in Yongarys mouth as well as the 3rd wheel undert the jeep before the rear section gets blown away. It is amazing that these goofs were not edited from the movie. The end is kind of out of character with the rest of the film but you will feel sorry for Yongary.Far from being Bergman or Kurosawa the film does have its moments The spaced out patrons at the club and the street evangelist yelling repent repent are priceless.This is like the old channel 9 moviein the New York areathat they used to show at midnight on Saturdays in the late 60s and early 70s. Great fun for fans of the genre. How can you NOT like a movie like this?".

	schema:reviewBody "1967 the year Japanese audiences came face to face with Gamera vs. Gyaos and Son of Godzilla. However Korea was also releasing a kaiju flick that year Yongary Monster From the Deep. Following in the line of King Kong Godzilla Gorgo and Gamera Yongary emerges to wreak havoc on mankind. The monster looks like your average dinosaur nice and fearsome quite obviously a Ceratosaurus. Oddly enough as opposed to most monster movies there are a significant number of people who choose to die as the monster approaches. Another plus is that the miniatures look pretty awesome in this one.Like Gorgo and Gamera this movie gets a kick out of throwing a child into the plot. I can't say I care for him but it's still nothing compared to other tortures I've been subjugated to like Gamera vs. Guiron of 1969. The characters here aren't too developed but there's some nice comedy between them. At one point a plan is forged and a government official remarks If it can save just one life it'll be worth it. Wow if only governments in the real world acted on such polices right? I will say though the scene where Yongary is killed is something akin to the 1933 King Kong death atop the Empire State Building. You actually feel for the poor dancing dinosaur even though if it is a tad less elegant. Yongary is poisoned like a giant rat even ends up pissing blood what a way to go.A lot of what we see here is familiar but it's all in good fun. I find this film better than the new Yongary film a.k.a. Reptilian.".

	onyx:emotionText "1967 the year Japanese audiences came face to face with Gamera vs. Gyaos and Son of Godzilla. However Korea was also releasing a kaiju flick that year Yongary Monster From the Deep. Following in the line of King Kong Godzilla Gorgo and Gamera Yongary emerges to wreak havoc on mankind. The monster looks like your average dinosaur nice and fearsome quite obviously a Ceratosaurus. Oddly enough as opposed to most monster movies there are a significant number of people who choose to die as the monster approaches. Another plus is that the miniatures look pretty awesome in this one.Like Gorgo and Gamera this movie gets a kick out of throwing a child into the plot. I can't say I care for him but it's still nothing compared to other tortures I've been subjugated to like Gamera vs. Guiron of 1969. The characters here aren't too developed but there's some nice comedy between them. At one point a plan is forged and a government official remarks If it can save just one life it'll be worth it. Wow if only governments in the real world acted on such polices right? I will say though the scene where Yongary is killed is something akin to the 1933 King Kong death atop the Empire State Building. You actually feel for the poor dancing dinosaur even though if it is a tad less elegant. Yongary is poisoned like a giant rat even ends up pissing blood what a way to go.A lot of what we see here is familiar but it's all in good fun. I find this film better than the new Yongary film a.k.a. Reptilian.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yongary Monster from the Deep is another entry on a nearly endless list of lowbudget giant monster films that owe their inspiration and creation to the two most popular movie monsters of Asia Godzilla and Gamera. The monster Yongary has characteristics similar to both of these monster icons. The thing is that Yongary makes his film debut in a film that is very cheap dull and oftentimes unintentionally funny. And the moments that were intentionally funny are mostly just painful to look at.Yongary as you can imagine was represented by a man in a rubber suit. The suit I'm afraid to say is a very poor effort. It isn't bulky like Godzilla but in fact very slender like the Trex costumes of some particular lowbudget American dinosaurs movies. When viewed from the side Yongary doesn't look halfbad. But since we most commonly see him from the front he mostly looks pretty bad. Too skinny too humanlike too unrealistic. There are many other revealing aspects to the poor special effects. Yongary like Gamera can breathe and literally inhale fire. Whenever he does either one of these you can see the nozzle in the back of his mouth and his tongue just seems to disappear. And what's also funny? Yongary is prone to feeling itchy and also likes to dance. Yes dance.The human characters are dull and uninteresting mostly annoying as you would expect. Dubbing for once wasn't halfbad. Like Gamera Yongary has a child character who idolizes him. But I think this character just smiled too much. Even when he talks about how Yongary wasn't a bad monster he just smiles. If Yongary is facing danger instead of being angry the kid still smiles. There is also a sense of stupidity with these characters. Such as what's the point to sending a man in a rocket into space to observe a nuclear explosion? One can easily see and observe from a safe distance on Earth. And also there's a moment where the characters argue about missiles to attack Yongary with and say the missiles could be too dangerous to the city to use. But when they are used the missiles don't seem to cause much for an explosion. Missiles fired by jets later on which are much smaller and less destructive seem to cause greater damage.Bottom line Yongary Monster of the Deep is a movie that is worth looking at. But do not expect much from it. It is better than other lowbudget Godzillarip offs such as The X from Outer Space but is still not all that impressive of a film.".

There are a few times where it seems to die only for us to unfortunately find out it's just going to give us more movie. It's dumb how they try to make it sympathetic but then admit they have to kill it. I can literally easily see the tube inside the monster's mouth where the fire comes out! That might have been a deliberate part of the monster as it looked too cheesy to even be fake.

This time the monster is in Korea not Japan and Yongary comes out of the ground just as an enormous earthquake is continuing to devastate the whole country. The hero is a young kid originally seen with some sort of gun that flashes a light and makes its victims itch horribly in this case his own sister and her fiance. Later he gets the oversized reptile to itch and dance at the time making you think that you're in the middle of the Itchy and Scratchy Show ironically with rock music in the background. There's a strange brief sequence showing partying Koreans getting wasted not realizing the danger outside approaching but that's never even seen again making me wonder if the editor cut out the wrong footage. Even with obvious models the effects are pretty good although kids today spoiled by computer technology and graphics are going to realize it's all phony. So if you want a few laughs with some bad English dubbing and a reminder of what didn't necessarily come from Hollywood even though this ended up in a sequence of the 1982 documentary It Came From Hollywood check this out. This is marked interestingly enough as having been released by American International Television but for some reason it's in widescreen giving the impression that some drivein or second rate theater somewhere must have shown it.".

I watched this one for fortyfive minutes until the end! It wasn't the genius cinematography or the vivid special effects that drew me in sense my sarcasm? but it was the epic story. From what I saw a boy Echu saw the monster drinking oil and asked himself in overdub Why would a monster want to drink oil? That line alone made me giggle. The boy tells his Uncle Elu I hope I'm spelling these names right about the monster and conveniently Elu is a scientist. He begins constructing a formula containing ammonia which makes the monster go crazy and Elu proposes to drop it from his toy helicopter onto the guy in the reject Godzilla suit making the equivillent of 17 an hour for this film. It takes twenty minutes to get a reaction from the monster and all he does is swish his tail around angrily. At closing they manage to drop enough chemicals on the monster so that is falls into the lake and begins bleeding tomato juice oddly enough. But before the anamatronic eyes closed for good the boy asks Uncle do we really have to kill him? and the uncle explains to the boy the dangers of having a 70 foot lizard walking around Seoul randomly smashing buildings and growling. Nothing however could prepare me for what I laughed at so hard that I nearly peed myself. When the monster breathed fire it was easy to see the valve pumping out the flames at the back of the monster's throat. My mom and I had a hoot. But later when little Echu is watching the monster by himself the monsters horn starts glowing and  yes it begins to dance! Surf music is heard as Echu cries He's dancing! and the monster boogies down. I can be quoted as saying That's the best thing I've seen all year! through my tears of laughter. Well best thing I'd seen all day anyway.So there you have it. If you get a chance to watch this movie I suggest you take it and be prepared for a howling good time.

Yongary a giant reptilian monster OR generates earthquake with a mobile epicenter that travels to Korea where it awakens creates? the creature Yongary's origins are unclear. Once in Korea the firebreathing kaiju proceeds to destroy cities shrug off mankind's puny weapons and drink fueloil to sustain itself. All the while the beast is being observed by a young boy who becomes key in devising a successful strategy to destroy the colossus. Throw in a ridiculous gimmick like an 'itch ray' a monster who dances or maybe it's the itch ray or the ammonia bath that is unclear as well horrible acting admittedly I was watching a dubbed version an annoying child in a lead role a disjointed and incoherent plot and secondrate special effects and you end up with this bottomofthebarrel Korean Godzilla knockoff. The titular monster which looks a bit like an emaciated Godzilla with a glowing horn on its snout both breathes fire during which its tongue seems to disappear and emits some kind of energybeam from the aforementioned horn that is accurate and powerful enough to slice attacking fighterjets in half. Despite this impressive weaponry the scientisthero takes his girlfriend her friend and her little brother in the helicopter that is going hover above the behemoth and drizzle it with ammonia which it does not like in the least. And the final insult to the viewer if they have not suffered enough watching the film through to the climax there is a tedious epilogue before the film mercifully fades to black. I have low expectations of and high tolerances for monster movies but Yongary Monster from the Deep is pretty awful. Apparently the original Korean version has been lost although there seem to be undubbed versions online so we may never know if it was as bad as the Western release I watched. For hardcore kaiju fans only unless you can find the MST3K annotated version which may appeal to a broader audience.".

I remembered it being a cheap poor Godzilla knockoff  and that's exactly what it is. Other than the horn on the nose the creature designs are almost identical. Even the plots are similar with Yongary going on a rampage through Seoul similar to Godzilla's rampage through Tokyo. But that's where the similarities between Yondary and Godzilla end. First compared with Yongary Godzilla looks incredible. It may be a man in a rubber suit but the Godzilla design is so much better than Yongary. Yongary looks exactly like what it is  a man in a rubber suit. The Godzilla design is much fuller and more interesting to look at. The eyes though always a weakness with Godzilla are a million times better and more expressive than Yongary. And Godzilla's roar destroys what little noise Yongary makes. Other aspects of the films where Yongary fails tone music plot action miniatures acting interesting characters and on and on. In fact I cannot think of a single area where Yongary beats Godzilla. To make matters worse it's boring. There is absolutely no tension. At no time is the menace that's so palpable in other monster movies present in Yongary. If all that weren't bad enough the dance scene with the annoying kid and Yongary should be enough to put anyone off Yongary. In the end not only do I find Yongary a poor example of a kaiju it's a poor film regardless of how you classify it.".

	schema:headline " Schizophrenic Rampaging Monster Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Now HERE is an odd egg to say the least. I must admit that I had confused YONGRAY with REPTILLICUS a Danish made Giant Rampaging Monster flick and was overjoyed when I found it on a new 3 DVD Public Domain Market wonder from St. Clair Ent. called GIANT MONSTERS containing most of the PDM Gamera films the requisite GIANT GILA MONSTER a couple others I have not heard of WARNING FROM SPACE anyone??. REPTILLICUS stands out in my memory not only because someone swiped my old prerecord of it a few years back but because it was a stop animation European made monster flick and not some guy in a suit pummeling models. YONGRAY amusingly turned out to be something totally different and one of the strangest viewing experiences of this type I can recall. YONGRAY  or Yongaree as he is called in the film  is a South Korean made ditty that was filmed on such a low budget that you can see the tin seams on the windup model tanks used in the big battle scenes. YONGRAY is some sort of beast of legend who is awakened from his slumbers underground by the side effects of South Korean space program tests talk about odd coincidences with real life ... and the first quarter of the film is actually a THUNDERBIRDS worthy display of model rocketry  assorted technologies as our hero  a maverick Korean astronaut  is sent into space on a reconaissance mission which serves no real purpose other than to awaken Yongray. And like his cousin Hedorah the Smog Monster Yongray feeds off our industrialized petrochemicals  their waste namely gasoline and other fuel oils. As he seeks to chow down on various refinery tanks stuff gets blown up real good the Korean Army steps in and efforts are made to kill the beast before that aerosol can they used to simulate his fire breath explodes  kills a stage technician. Half of the fun in the film IS how ultralow budget and somewhat shoddy it looks. Endearing is the word I think. YONGRAY has an endearing immediacy too it sort of like Ed Wood doing Godzilla but with what for him would have been actual money.So far so good but one of the odd aspects of the film is it's ambivalence towards Yongray as a character himself who is on one hand a rampaging juggernaut of destruction but on the other hand is lovable  strikes up a predictably annoying bond of friendship with an annoying 9 year old tyke annoyingly written into the script for the sole purpose of annoying anyone watching older than say 12. But this does treat us to the odd sight of the supposedly sky scraper sized Yongray dancing to Korean surf rock with the kid who sort of kinda sticks up for poor Yongray when the South Korean Army starts spewing a chemical weapons solution at it and eventually KILL Yongray in a scene that can only be described as pathetic meaning that it inspired pity within the viewers present during the screening here FOR Yongray. We were rooting for him but no. Spew enough orange gunk and he is meat getting cold.The Korean cast then stands around laughing about it with these creepy canned dubbed laugh tracks  especially creepy when the annoying tyke announces that he liked Yongray that Yongray was his friend and that when he grows up he wants to be a biochemist. Laugh laugh laugh and there is poor Yongray lying dead in a mucky polluted river now only about as big as a tractor trailer Yongray's physical scale changes dramatically in relation to the sets from scene to scene and his tail twitching painfully in the toxin polluted water that killed him. Are we having fun yet??Don't get me wrong I LOVE this movie. It is twice as cool as REPTILLICUS with bizarrely translated dialog cunning use of models interesting use of color schemes and YONGRAY!! who's creature costume design looks more like a guy in a suit than any other Asiandepicted monster I can think of even King Kong. I like the way technology is used in the film the fact that our central hero figure is an astronaut who's special skills are never really explained other than that he can pilot a spacecraft though how that would help the Earth defeat a Giant Rampaging Monster is beyond me and enjoy the quasifuturist 1967 era production design. There is even a party scene with characters getting totally wasted in a bar This is a movie with a split personality disorder unsure of just what it wants us to get out of it but very enthused about showing us the works nonetheless.But I cannot get around how sad it is that Yongray had to be killed off the pathetic and presumably environmentally destructive way he is killed and the fact that the on screen characters feel good about it all even though we in the audience do not. Unless you are some kind of a sick Nazi I guess How can you cheer for stupid humans poisoning to death a goofy lookin' monster who likes surf rock? In the words of the annoying kid Just because Yongray did terrible things and killed all of those people that doesn't mean he was bad or a monster.Amen to that 710UPDATE 91707 YONGARY has been released by MGM on a beautiful remastered Region 1 DVD struck from a fantastic widescreen transfer. Give your bargain bin DVD version to someone who might not otherwise bother this new version is a sign of PROGRESS.".

Film starts out with a Korean astronaut on his honeymoon but is called back to work to man a rocket for some such reason. While up in space there are massive earthquakes rocking the country and it turns out to be the legendary monster that has caused them. The monster crawls out of the ground and starts kicking over buildings and breathing fire! Of course there is a little kid that is running around and noticing things about the monster that he relates back to his sisters boyfriend that is a scientist. The kid gives him information that ultimately will be the creatures demise. Yes its a silly movie with horrible special effects and just a guy in a rubber suit but aside from a couple of dumb scenes this is a film that stays within a boundary of decency. The dumb scenes are when the jets attack the monster they fly right into him! Nice flying!! And of course the monster dance! What was the point of having the monster get up and dance? Anyone? SPOILER ALERT The ending to the film is really kind of sad and the characters show some compassion to a dying monster. As the helicopter keeps dropping a chemical powder on the monster and he dies the little boy tells them to stop. I don't remember ever seeing that in a monster film before. And watching the monster die a slow death was not like other films. In most films you cheer the conclusion but here with the monster bleeding and twitching it becomes painful to witness. Not a bad film of its type. You definitely laugh at parts but by the end you have stopped laughing. In their own little way they showed they were different from the giant monster films from Japan.".

She received her first screen kiss in fact from costar Robert Taylor  not bad but then this is Elizabeth Taylor we're talking about.The stars and supporting players including a very young Honor Blackman aren't the problem. For me the script and therefore the character actions are questionable. Elizabeth is supposed to be passionately in love with her new husband as well as insecure and naive. On learning Taylor a British officer is a Communist she grows up fast. We're told. We really don't see it nor are we given an idea of how much time has passed to give her an opportunity to reach this new maturity. We're supposed to believe he was unable to stave her off with some tall story? Also for a superficial young woman interested in redecorating her house she certainly is suddenly a very committed patriot. As for Robert Taylor a man who's been involved with the party for so many years would certainly have known the trouble he'd be in for failing to carry out orders and how bad it would look to beg for help and make excuses. Come on.There's nothing wrong with the acting and Elizabeth Taylor is dazzlingly beautiful though in my opinion it will be a couple of more years before her beauty truly is at its height. But she certainly performs her adult role well. Robert Taylor is appropriately dashing and menacing with his widow's peak something my mother always mentioned about him in full prominence. They certainly made a beautiful couple. But in Conspirator alas they're not meant to be.".

	schema:headline " The first time the two great film Taylors were together";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of the antiCommunist films of the 1940s  1950s are crap. No doubt about that. Thrown together they had preposterous plots emanating from the Kremlin to sap our national resources or strength. For example one film has Lee Marvin heading a major atomic spy ring outside a missile range from a hamburgerhash stand! The best films of the period dealing with communist threats were the science fiction films like THE THING or THEM wherein the monster was a symbol for the threat to Americans from an alien source. Occasionally a semidocumentary might attract attention but not much.Oddly enough this early movie was somewhat above average. First it correctly looked at our wartime friend and partner England as a possible source of leakage. This turned out to be somewhat true but the Rosenberg Case would soon show homegrown spy rings existed as well. Secondly it showed something usually ignored or rendered minor in most of these films. Here it is developed into the issue who are you going to show greater loyalty to the Communist Party or your naive spouse?What I really like about CONSPIRATOR is that Robert Taylor plays the central figure  whom American and British audiences were to hiss at. He had tackled a few ambiguous characters before World War II most notably William Bonney in BILLY THE KID but that screenplay like Darryl Zanuck's film of JESSIE JAMES whitewashed a great deal of the bad out of the central character. But after the war MGM treated Taylor now a seasoned leading star of theirs to a wider variety of parts including more villainous characters. Think of him in the somewhat earlier UNDERCURRENT with Kate Hepburn and Robert Mitchum. Both of these films could not have been made with Taylor in the 1930s.I also sort of enjoy the idea that Taylor a friendly but sincere witness for the H.U.A.C subcommittee against Communist infiltration into the movie industry actually did this film. It is his only chance to show what he thought of a Communist agent and his interpretation and the screenplay's show he saw them as naive fools.Also it is the first time in his career that Taylor starred with the only female star of his rank or higher with the same last name Elizabeth Taylor. Just leaving such films as NATIONAL VELVET LITTLE WOMEN and LIFE WITH FATHER she finally came of age here as a young bride. In some ways I have always felt that Ms Taylor's glorious beauty was at a pristine height in films of the early 1950s like this one or FATHER OF THE BRIDE. Here she is in love with her dashing wartime hero husband whom she gradually realizes is not as heroic for England as she thought though he would disagree  witness his scene telling her about how he has joined one of the great causes of all time!.The film follows their courtship their marriage and the discovery of his treason by her. The issue of course is whether or not he will be turned in by her or will he love her enough to withstand pressure by his Kremlin bosses to errr...eradicate his error totally.The film as mentioned in another recent review is above average. Taylor does play this English Col. Redl of an earlier war in a different country  but serving another Russia as a man torn apart but refusing to acknowledge his error of judgment. In fact his final decision puts to stop to any type of acknowledgment. The one flaw in this film is similar to the later wretched ROGUE'S MARCH with Peter Lawford and Leo G. Carroll. The omnipotence of the British Secret Service in ferreting out traitors is shown at the taleend. I may add that in 1949 that Secret Service MR5 contained such patriots as Burgess McClean and Philby. Yeah they really would have been watching Taylor closely!".

Her youthfulness helped because in Conspirator the part called for Liz to be young and somewhat naive. She's not too much older in the film than her real age. And the role calls for the young American visitor to London staying with Lord Wilfrid HydeWhite Marie Ney and their daughter Honor Blackman. At a ball Liz can't take her eyes off officer Robert Taylor as neither could half the American female population. In a whirlwind courtship they're married. Taylor is identified as 31 in the film and in fact he wasn't too much older being 38 when he was making Conspirator.Taylor had played British before no one minded his distinct American speech pattern in Waterloo Bridge. And it's not a hindrance in Conspirator either.Not long after they're married Liz discovers her husband has been a Communist agent for years. As for Bob his marriage did not meet with party approval and he takes heat for it. And when she threatens to turn him in Bob's given a choice it's Liz or the party.Conspirator is a sincere antiCommunist film not a piece of Cold War junk like some of what was coming out of studios like RKO. The film itself was prophetic because a few years later Donald MacLean and Guy Burgess would be caught and exposed after that Kim Philby and long after he was dead Sir Anthony Blunt the famous fourth man in that subversive ring. The problem with Conspirator is the lack of definition of Robert Taylor's character we get bits and pieces about an Irish mother a forbidding English father stuff that might make him question loyalty to king and country. But it's never really fleshed out in the script and Taylor never got a handle on his character.Liz however really shows the promise she had as an adult actress. Two years later she was in A Place In The Sun and after that her career was assured.Honor Blackman the future Pussy Galore was five years older than Elizabeth Taylor but had made far fewer films. She was only in the third year of a career that's still going strong. She also does a very good job as Liz's wise young friend who just happens to be keeping company with one of Taylor messmates Robert Flemyng.Conspirator was shot over in MGM's British studio with its two American stars and a cast of players from the UK's cinema.

His portrayal was far from onedimensional and his anguish regarding his ideology and instinct for selfpreservation versus his love for his wife was very credible. Elizabeth Taylor was lovely as always. The camera loves her and her fullhead shots are indeed memorable. Her motivations were not entirely clear though. For example it wasn't clear considering her apolitical mindset why she thought her husband was so despicable for being a spy. But then again the paranoia of the times would have made such introspection unnecessary.The supporting cast was also very good with a special mention for Honor Blackman who always lends a touch of class to anything she's in.

	schema:reviewBody "Melinda Greyton Elizabeth Taylor is visiting England from America and meets Major Michael Curragh Robert Taylor at a fancy ball. It's a case of love at first sight for both and they end up married. First you have to set aside the discomfort of the age difference between the two. Elizabeth was 17 when this was made playing an 18 year old and Robert was 38 playing a 31 year old. It's not really that much of a problem. There's no real scenes of intimacy  or even much of affection  between them but you certainly notice it. The story revolves around Melinda becoming gradually suspicious of some of her new husband's activities and finally discovering that he's actually a communist and a Soviet spy feeding information to Moscow about British and American defence plans. The movie then deals with the consequences of her discovery for them both.As spy capers go it's not especially thrilling. It's actually rather slow paced and the story itself isn't all that riveting. In the first half of the movie really all that we glean is that being a member of the Communist Party is a real drag on your personal life. But both Taylors put on performances that make it worth watching. Elizabeth  in what seems to have been her first adult role  did a fine job portraying Melinda's evolution from a naive and innocent young girl who's completely smitten by Curragh to a more worldly woman who's suspicious of and even frightened by Curragh. She had a much more illustrious career to come but this certainly shows her potential as an actress. Robert was effective in showing what were essentially the two different sides of Curragh  the romantic and sometimes even playful man who fell so easily in love and the hardened communist agent whose love for his young bride was second to his devotion to his ideology. Robert did a good job of showing Curragh as a man torn between those two loyalties and his portrayal of a communist agent was somewhat ironic given that he himself was virulently anticommunist who helped out socalled reds in the movie business to the House UnAmerican Activities Committee.Conspirator certainly isn't a classic spy film but it does do a reasonably effective job of building albeit somewhat slowly to its eventual climax. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Silver Chalice director Victor Saville's tepid Cold War espionage thriller Conspirator casts Robert Taylor as veteran British Guards officer who has fallen hopelessly in love with an impressionable 18year old American girl played by Elizabeth Taylor. This lackluster spy saga cannot conjure up a shred of credibility and one can only hope that Humphrey Slater's novel that Gerald Fairlie and Sally Benson adapted was infinitely superior for what passes on screen. Ironically the American born Taylor plays an Englishman while the English born Elizabeth was cast as an American. Unfortunately none of this irony permeated the film. She is a giddy young lady who meets Major Michael Curragh at a ball and falls for his 'ferociously good looks but Curragh doesn't realize that his Soviet handlers oppose his marital plans. Curragh insists that he can lead a splitexistence but his handlers warn him that a spy cannot have a wife who will interfere with his activities. Initially Melinda Greyton Elizabeth Taylor believes that she can convince Michael to resign from the party. Michael's Soviet superior Radek Karel Stepanek orders the major to do away with his wife. As it turns out Melinda has her beliefs that her husband is a traitor. Naturally Michael struggles to explain his lifelong participation in the Party. He lies to her at first that he has cut himself off from the Party but Melinda learns that he has lied to her. Eventually during a holiday duck hunt Michael tries to kill her but he cannot bring himself to murder him. Melinda can only tolerate so much treachery and she goes to the authorities. Michael realizes the desperate predicament that he can gotten himself into and shoots himself rather than be taken into custody. The irony is that Michael's military superiors had caught of whiff of his seditious activities and were using him. They plead with Melinda to say that her husband committed suicide.The characters in Conspirator are hopelessly nave about themselves. Michael has abandoned all sense of propriety and hoped that he could keep Melinda from learning anything about his nocturnal activities. Michael's handlers sent postcards of the old London Bridge when they wanted him to report to them with any useful information. Robert Taylor delivers a fine performance as a man caught between to political ideologies and at odds with his young wife. Elizabeth Taylor is appropriately paranoid about her husband after he appears to accidentally shoot her during the duck hunt. Future James Bond actress Honor Blackman plays Melinda's best friend. Saville keeps the actionas improbable as it isflowing throughout this 87minute yarn. Conspirator was shot on location in the United Kingdom. Altogether Robert Taylor is wasted as a lowprofile Communist. No surprises enliven this forgettable epic.".

Fear of the communists in Hollywood in the late 1940's saw the witchhunt of McCarthyism and one of those who allegedly named names was hunky actor Robert Taylor. Here he plays an actual communist spy who marries an American girl Elizabeth Taylor in her first leading lady role then panics as he realizes her natural curiosity will lead her discover the truth about him. This seems like a great idea for a romantic drama sort of a Gaslight with a political touch as he tries to keep her under wraps and his secret safe. But it goes down ordinary paths as he learns from his Russian comrades that the only way out is murder which could have lead this to be more suspenseful than it is.The other major problem is that the two Taylors have absolutely no chemistry. Their first of two pairings they aren't just of two different age groups they have absolutely different mindsets and it is obvious that the young Liz is still a girl even if she is one of the most striking ever to walk on this planet. Her actions indicate immaturity not in a bad way but she is still juvenile in nature and certainly not a candidate for marriage. He seems smart enough to realize this so why this ends up at the alter makes no sense. Their playful marital scenes are more embarrassing than romantic. By the time she made A Place in the Sun two years later she was much more ready for adult romance and had a much more appropriate screen partner to have it with.Marjorie Fielding is truly amusing as the elder Taylor's mischievous aunt a crispy old broad who announces for all to hear that she is wearing a wig to cover her baldness. Her brief appearance marks one of the few times that the film wakes up to be actually amusing. That only happens otherwise when Wilfred Hyde White is on screen he of course being most remembered as Colonel Pickering in the movie version of My Fair Lady 15 years later. There is really no motivation mentioned for Robert Taylor's character to be so into communism other than how he discovered a most bold new lifestyle when he was younger. This takes away the credibility of the plot that after such a war as World War II he would betray his own country and smuggle secrets to the Russians even if it was done in a most ingenious way.".

While none of them were especially subtle films like My Son John and I Married a Communist were dandy entertainmentwith their occasionally over the top scripts and exciting fight between the forces of freedom and Communism. However after seeing Conspirator I must say that this is one of the dullest and most illogical films in the genre.The film begins with young Elizabeth only 17 at the time becoming infatuated with the mature and handsome Robert Taylor age 38. While this budding romance seemed immensely creepy especially by today's standards and hard to imagine the pair eventually marry. Things seem pretty goodthough she has no idea he's a closet Communist spy.The film becomes really really stupid later when the new wife discovers that he is a dirty Red. Now you'd think that Elizabeth would contact the authoritiesafter all he's a high up officer with access to very very sensitive material. However when he tells her no one will believe her she seems to just accept this!! And later in the film when he suggests they go duck hunting...with REAL guns and bullets...she thinks nothing of going with him!!! What part of 'he's a spy' didn't she understand?! And up until he attacks her on this trip he's lied repeatedly. And what does she do? Nothing...as her character is apparently an idiot. In addition to this serious flaw the film also manages to be incredibly dullsomething you'd never expect with the topic or these top actors or from MGMTHE top studio of the day.So is it worth watching? Probably not unless you are a completist who MUST see all the films of either Taylor. Or perhaps if seeing a 38 yearold man with a 17 is your sort of kink!".

CONSPIRATOR Donnie is a courtdocumented spouse rapist cackling that no one will believe his brazen mistreatment of many other women who are keeping Putin's spin masters on the 24hour Putin TV channel working overtime. CONSPIRATOR emphasizes the need to round up and liquidate or deport all of the KGB traitors tools and enablers threatening to overrun 1900s England.

For some unclear reason he falls for her as well so they get married.The teen wife however soon learns that her perfecto husband is in fact a Soviet spy. How does she learn it? Well she finds in his pocket a typed letter saying  and I quote almost verbatim  In view of my success in obtaining secret information for the USSR I'd like to have a personal interview with the head of Soviet intelligence. I'm not kidding  the letter was not coded in any way and it had the word Soviet printed in plain language. Poor Liz finding and reading it literally blanches. Her hubby is a Russian spy! He's a traitor! It's unclear however as to why the word traitor should have any strong meaning for her  she's not from the UK but from another country altogether so she's basically a traitor herself  betraying her motherland on a whim of romance.Ah traitors This word features prominently in an earlier scene where a bunch of guys discuss intelligence matters. They are criminals! an older dude proclaims angrily. I wonder why such strong emotion concerning treason seeing as England has not been in a serious defensive war since 1760s. The only exceptions are Napoleon 1812 and Hitler 1940  and in both those cases it was Russia who saved the British ass from becoming enslaved by France and Germany. There were tons of AGGRESSIVE wars of course  but is it appropriate to talk about criminal behavior when your country's been slaughtering innocent folks all over the globe for centuries? Poor Russia in this movie is presented as a SortofEnemy while America's presented as an ally. Weird considering that Russia never ever fought England nor betrayed it crassly while the Americans both fought it and betrayed it  by signing the Declaration of Independence.The Founding Fathers of America are doubtless the biggest English traitors ever. Biggest. Traitors. Ever. Because of them Britain lost millions of miles of fabulous land trillions of pounds in money incalculable amounts of mineral resources and had its military and geopolitical prestige undermined forever. But let bygones be bygones I guess.In a conversation with friends where both husbands and wife were present Liz says contemptuously  My husbands decided to give up his career  he's gonna be a Communist instead. Everybody present thinks it's a joke on her part of course but Liz is full of venom. Those terrible commies! It doesn't bother her that she an 18yearold girl is served around the house by a lady in her midfifties  she never for a moment questions the justice of it. No one is like forcing her to serve me right? Let her eat cake or whatever. Yeah servants are great commies suck.But on the whole taking into account the time and historical circumstances when this movie was made it's a pretty decent picture with a number of effective scenes and a passable performance from ET  something that not all her movies can boast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oechu or Wae Chu according to the Toronto IFF means going out. The English title for both Toronto and Hong Kong is April Snow. It seems that director Hur Jinho has a high awareness of the seasons as the titles of his two previous movies were Christmas in August 1998 and One fine spring day 2001.To many regular viewers of Korean movies a few movies each year Christmas was their first introduction and is still considered among the best while the tombstones of those who died of boredom watching it would already be showing signs of weather erosion. Spring has mixed reviews with many considering it a setback from Christmas. April snow is sort of a comeback although it does not have the depth of Christmas in which death is the subject matter rather than a plot device.The plot of Oechu is simple. His wife and her husband who are having an affair got in an accident during their escapade and are both in a coma. Encountering at the hospital they gradually find out that their respective spouses who where college classmates have been cheating on them. Starting with understandable animosity they wind up falling in love.The key to the success of the movie is the development of the relationship between these two people which takes time and patience to render believable. With this director Hur has done a splendid job. For the critical turning point he cleverly utilizes a situation where the two attend together the funeral of a third victim of the accident a young chap. As the spouses of the careless drivers it could not be established which one was driving they obviously are met with extreme hostility from the family of the deceased. This incident creates the necessary empathy which breaks the ice between them.There are some lovemaking scenes which are more sensual than erotic. Very palpable together with the pleasure is also a sense of agony and pain. And those who think that these scenes are daring for a Korean movie have obviously not seen Happy End 1999.One scene that left me with the deepest impression was when his fatherinlaw knocks on his hotel room door while they are in the room not making love but simply enjoying being with each other. Millions of similar scenes must have been seen in movies and yet I've never seen one that moves me so deeply. There's light tension but no panic as he asks the fatherinlaw to wait a second gathers her telltale belongings and leads her gently into the bathroom and closes the door gently. He then meets the fatherinlaw at the door and suggests that they go out to lunch together. On the stairs he asks the fatherinlaw to wait downstairs saying that he has forgotten something. Back in the hotel room he opens the washroom door. She is still standing there coat in hand looking very stoic. She then turns and faces him and very mildly but reassuringly says I'm OK. The scene ends in a light affectionate embrace.This scene says so much. There is nothing that they are ashamed of or need to hide but tradition dictates that they should not be found together in his room. They face the situation together with sensible and sensitive consideration for each other.Since Lover's Concerto Son Yejin has been the most sought after young Korean actresses. Personally I think her most popular Classic 2003 is overrated. April snow is where Son has attained a breakthrough in her performance.Bae Yongjun is a victim of his own popularity as I've seen more than one criticism of his acting that reflect the writers' hatecelebrity syndrome from which I'm happily immune as I can't tell him apart from the guy next doors. The only other movie I've seen him in is Untold Scandal 2003 in which he wears a mustache and beard. In that picture he comes short not having enough maturity and charisma to play a character brought to life by John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaisons 1998. He is much better cast here in April snow as a melancholy sortof artist stage light designer particularly for concerts.One thing I must say is that you'll be hardpressed to find a better looking in a very literal sense Asian couple than this pair.".

There are many clues that lead up to this 1 At one point when InSu and SeoYoung are talking about their favorite season of the year SeoYoung says Spring and InSu says Winter. Then as a way of pleasing both of them he says that it should snow in spring. And she laughs and says Yeah like that's ever going to happen. Keep this scene in mind for later.2 When InSu tells his wife in her hospital room that her lover has died she breaks down sobbing and then you see him stepping outside her hospital room closing the door behind him while you hear his wife's sobs. That indicates that he is closing the door on his marriage and leaving it behind.3 In some versions of this movie there is a scene showing InSu briefly back together with his wife this scene was cut from the US version of the movie. However the reconciliation didn't work out and I suppose that's the reason this scene was cut as it really seems unnecessary. 4 Much later we see InSu alone in a room surrounded by boxes indicating that he has recently moved to a new place away from his wife and is now living alone.5 Finally in the middle of April Spring InSu looks up and sees the snow coming down. At the same time SeoYoung looks out the window and sees the same thing. The fact that it's snowing in Spring is a sign to both of them that their love is meant to be remember the scene I mentioned above. Then we hear the phone ring... representing InSu calling SeoYeong.6 Immediately thereafter you see a car moving and although you don't see who's inside you hear InSu's voice asking where do you want to go and you hear SeoYoung's voice responding wherever you want to go.

Hands up those of you who have used it to flirt and keep your hands there if you have an archive of secret messages stashed away in one of the electronic folders of your phone's memory. Password protection afraid of someone dear chancing upon them aren't you? Bae Yongjun geeks of the world rejoice! stars as Insu a man whose wife met with an accident. Terribly shaken he sees his spouse in the hospital intensive care unit in a comatose state. Unknowingly he meets a woman Seoyoung classic beauty Son Yejin at the ward whose husband too was involved in the same accident. Slowly they discover that their spouses were cheating behind their backs thereby giving both another blow to their emotions.I'm not really a fan of the bespectacled Bae but in this film he has demonstrated his acting prowess somewhat if not already seen by most fans in his famed TV series Winter Sonata. You see the pain of a man who has dawned upon the knowledge of being betrayed by a spouse the sadness emoting through his eyes when he reads SMS from the strayed spouse to her lover and the intolerance viewing the video clip of their tryst in a hotel room. Here's a man who had lived in a web of adulterous deceit.And in the same boat Son Yejin ever so vulnerable as the clueless housewife Seoyoung who suffers silently while awaiting for her husband to awaken from his coma. On one hand she hates him for what he has done but on the other still dutifully cares for him. And this duality and fighting of emotions for their respective spouses ring through the state of confusion both Insu and Seoyoung are in.Sure they want to seek revenge which I suppose is a normal human reaction in these circumstances but how? The other party's spouse happens to be a victim too and hereby lies the dilemma in the inability to exact sweet justice. Or can they? As they meet up more often by chance or otherwise to have someone to talk to to spend time with to have meals together each becomes the pillar of strength for the other while they seek to unravel the rationale of their spouses' illicit affair.A drunken slip of the tongue became the foreplay and it's no rocket science that they decide to express their emotions in a physical manner as promoted in the trailers. Note that I did not mention love. It doesn't seem so at this point  their body language seemed more like strangers their movements awkward. It's like for the purpose of releasing pentup anger and frustration of getting back and for the sake of getting even. Twisted weird. Love? No.But Love probably did creep in after a while. But you question if this is love out of convenience of being there for the other person just like the other is there for you in dire straits? And in an attempt to steer this controversial romance theme Two wrongs don't make a right  love borne out of an affair into more mainstream acceptance the filmmakers brought in Fate to decide  to have something identifiable between the two leads for them to make the decision on their plausible future. Hence the title.But the one scene which stood out for me is the one where the confrontation is held. There isn't a need to ask point blank questions. A side remark in passing and you'll come to understand whether it's worth burying the hatchet or not.And it's kinda back to full circle as the mobile device which destructed one side of the relationship ended up nurturing another. Such is the electronic era we live and cope in.".

Since they had to stay in a hotel while their spouses remain in comas they see each other all the time and eventually begin having their own affair. The good thing about this film is how director Jinho Hur makes this not only believable a premise but also makes it seem completely natural. However he needed good actresses to make his vision work and he found them Yongjoon Bae plays the husband of the crash victim and the quite pretty actually both are good lookingYejin Son the wife. Both take this necessarily slow moving film to a very dangerous but somehow natural place. The film has a refreshing subtlety and the film is shot beautifully great cinematography.

Things go from bad to worse when he learns that not only was his wife drunk but she was also in the company of another man. Insu's suspicions that his wife was having an affair become even stronger when he calls her workplace he thought she was away on business and learns that his wife was on vacation when the accident occurred.During this trying time Insu meets Seoyoung the young wife of his wife's lover. The two are quite repulsed by each other at first but they have to stay within each other's proximity for the time being because their spouses are at the same hospital. Seoyoung's husband is also in a coma. After recovering their respective spouse's belongings from the police station both Insu and Seoyoung learn about their spouses adulterous affair through electric devices Insu through his wife's cell phone and Seoyoung through her husband's cell phone and a camera. The couple's text messages proved their infidelity with such lines as I'm worn out from last night. With their lives torn to shreds Insu and Seoyoung reside in the same hotel and care for their comatose spouses. They begin to see each other more often outside of the hospital and of course they become affectionate for each other. However can a romance like this truly last when the danger of a spouse coming to looms? The story told in April Snow is nothing new. It is one that has been told time and time again in films and novels. However April Snow adds new blood to this prosaic theme. Filmed in muted colors the film has an air of melancholy that never lifts throughout the entire film. Aided by the beautiful soundtrack one feels like a quiet observer of the sadness Insu and Seoyoung experience when they learn of the affair and one can feel the light of hope they experience when they find joy in each other's arms. Add in a few love scenes that are erotic without showing the naughty bits April Snow while not a wonderful film by any means is a decent film that can tug at the heart strings and make one wonder how well one truly knows their significant other.".

Unfortunately however his 'largerthanlife' fame as 'Yonsama' makes it almost impossible for me at least to empathize with the character he plays which is supposed to be an ordinary man going through a life's ordeal in this movie. I couldn't help feeling very sorry about the casting choice they had to make. Throughout the movie I kept wondering what if such and such played this role anyone else would have been better for that matter. What I expected to see was a Hur Jinho film but alas...'Yonsama' overshadows it way too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "April Snow is the third film by Corean melodrama auteur Hur Jin Ho and features none other than Bae Young Jun whose turn in the popular Corean drama series Winter Sonata made him an icon of the Corean Wave exported all over Asia and sometimes further. However since I couldn't bear watching the series my only context for the Bespectacled One was his rather capable performance in the Corean adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses Untold Scandal.The story is related to both the stories for In the Mood for Love and Random Hearts in which two people come to realize that their spouses are having affairs with each other and in this shared knowledge develop a relationship with each other. While I haven't seen Random Hearts I can say that the same tensions that run through In the Mood for Love also run through April Snow but they are different movies. April Snow is definitely a Hur movie as it's primarily composed of moments of silence and watching the protagonists do what they do and seeing the subtle messages implied by how they do it.One thing that struck me while watching the relationship form between the pair was just how aware they were of the irony of their situation and how their relationship was a sort of escape for them. A strong empathy pours out between the two characters as they deal with their grief and their betrayal. But all things are not even. While the Bespectacled One's character In Ju should be the primary protagonist his performance was a little underplayed which allowed Son Ye Jin's Seo Young to capture more emotion and depth and consequently steal the focus.But the pictures were gorgeous the acting still good again Son Ye Jin really pulls it off and the way that director Hur captures it all managed to remind me just how much I like his approach to storytelling. This is a quiet melodrama that while reserved in expression can't help but leak out the grief pain and longing in the two characters. I kind of the wish that the end of the movie cut back more like In the Mood for Love does but I imagine that audiences more adapted to mainstream Hollywood fare will appreciate the degree of closure provided. While this isn't a masterwork like Hur's previous two films it is still I believe a solid entry into his filmography. Great for lovers of art films. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very quickly In the Mood for Love and Random Hearts rushed into my head while I was seeing Oechul all three talk about crossaffair between two couples.RH truly makes me feel impatient because from story to acting I find nothing impressive about it at all. ML is a refined and likable miniature that lures you to watch it again and again get closer and closer yet you may fear you get too close to it for the beauty on the screen and also the music. And this Korean affair is one that makes you think about it once in a while even without any desire to watch it again.It is an uncommon story on two ordinary lives. The story is uncommon as its English title displays April Snow we do not have much snow in springtime. Ordinary is that we have no rare figures like Congresswoman or fiction writer but ordinary people concert technician and housewife. Which probability is higher bumping into a housewife or a Congresswoman in the street? The affair is a controlled spark and unplanned sweetbitter revenge a quiet but unforgettable episode just happens to take place at a point of their lifetime. It is an unexpected affair out from an unexpected accident of a premeditated affair. Tranquillity is the specialty of the director. All though out the film serenity rules even the struggle at separation the byebye moment and the embarrassment at the husband's funeral are dealt with an uneventful presentation though their sobs for losing their love really cut one's heart.Both the endings of ML and Oechul are highly realistic in Asian culture reunites with the spouse after the doom. Marriage in conservative cultures is generally handled with a more serious grip and tolerance. The film exhibits how mature and sensible can people manage their passion in real life. Perhaps we should feel happy for the two persons in RH. They are far much luckier as their unfaithful spouses have already been deservedly killed in the accident and the leftbehinds do not have much to worry about if they decide to spend their lives together afterwards.Other works on affair like The Bridges of Madison County and Brief Encounter also sprang up my head. Robert and Francesca Alec and Laura cannot be together at the end of their lives. What different is Seoyoung and Insu have higher chance more hope to come together again because they have time and fewer constraint. After all no one can tell how long the wife can bear living with her betrayed husband with shame and guilt as attachment.".

How can I understand this movie? Is this really a melodrama? How can a movie where main male and female characters really never meet be a melodrama? Though this movie is still an absolutely heartbreaking and tearjerking love story. This movie is a quantum leap in the melodrama genre. We will probably never see a melodrama like this one again. This movie not only completely rewrites the rules of melodramas but shows that a melodrama can deliver powerful social commentary. Can a melodrama be subversive? Check it yourself. This movie is as subversive as Fight Club.Though this movie is based on 'Love Letter' a Japanese short fiction by Jiro Asada the movie is much richer in social context. Failan is the saddest movie in my living memory. I don't know how many times I have seen this film. I cry at the same parts during each viewing. The ending where Failan sang for her 'husband' is simply heartwrenching. The saddest of all is that even Failan could not save us poor souls like her husband from this cruel world. Then who can? Only death?".

	schema:reviewBody "'Failan' is the sophomore feature film of director Song Haeseong who made a big splash in 1999 with another timetwisting romance called 'Calla'. This time around he works with acclaimed Japanese novelist Jiro Asada reknowned for his bestselling novel 'Love Letter' which had been previously made into a memorable Japanese film in 1995.Song has created a stirring romantic tragedy of immense emotional wallop that it's not easily shaken. Executed with the same quiet subtlety seen in other recent Korean romances such as 'Il Mare' and 'Christmas in August' 'Failan' poignantly and convincingly illustrates the tragic missed opportunity between two illfated starcrossed lovers while eloquently showing what it means and how it feels to be in love.Despite having never met they end up giving each other the dignity and selfrespect that their lives had been missing for so long. Unfortunately the realization of what he meant to Failan comes to Kangjae comes too late leading to the film's most heartbreaking scene which is compounded by the irony of how she treasured what he quickly forgot or cast off.As the film's titular character Cheung easily does the best work of her career. Her sympathetic turn as the quiet Failan is a marvel to watch. Two of the film's more memorable sequences Failan using quickthinking to avoid being sold to a strip club and the heartwrenching first night at her new home. It is also easy to see why Choi as Cheung's love interest is one of Korea's most popular actors despite his character's slovenly appearance and boorish behavior Choi evokes sympathy for Kangjae with a nuanced performance that reveals the man's insecurity and gentle spirit.This indeed goes without saying that 'Failan' is one of the best films of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've never cried because of a movie.  I always sympathize with characters yet I never empathize.  I can never feel the true emotion.  Sure Schindler's List had amazing worksmanship but it didn't do anything for me and Grave of the Fireflies is equally as good but neither as well as pretty much any other film I've seen has made me cry.But Failan made me come pretty close.At first I was skeptical of the film.  Korean films have come a long way yet I trust their action and flashy stylish movies more then their dramas. JSA and Shiri are great Jakarta's a lot of fun and Nowhere to Hide is stylistical live manga if I've ever seen it.But Failan comes out of nowhere and makes me wonder why this didn't make it out of Korea.  It's hands down one of the best films of the last year. Storywise it avoids cliche and other traps of romantictragic films and comes out on its own.The story is simple.  A wretched bum Kang JaeMinSik Choi of Shiri fame who sells pornography and is involved in the organized crime syndicate in Inchon marries Failan Cecilia Cheung in an amazing performance a young Chinese girl abandoned and alone in the world in a marriage of convenience she gets to stay in Korea and work and he gets some cash for it.  The two never meet yet Failan is eternally grateful.The thing is though Failan is not even mentioned until 45 minutes into the story.  Until that point you're following the life of Kang Jae.  But as you soon discover both are tragic characters.  Failan is one of the most beautiful characters put onto film not just in terms of outer aesthetics but in terms of inner beauty.  She is the sweetest character I've seen in a film and that fact makes it even harder to watch.The film borders on drama and melodrama but thankfully most of it is not melodramatic.  Oh sure there's some parts where the audience scoffs but there are other parts when what is happening is so tragically beautiful that you can't help but get involved emotionally.  Thankfully most of it is subtle and not slam in your face Pay it Forward style.  What affected me was when Kang Jae was reading the letter from Failan thanking him for being the kindest person she's met.  What's said isn't long prose and if you're familiar with the Korean language the sentence structure is very simple. However the way in which the Failan's voiceover reads it is so innocent so sweet and so full of emotion that I choked up at that point.The rest of the film is equally as wonderful.  The group I saw it with 2 girls and 3 guys all in college were all equally affected.  It surprises me that Shiri conceivably a Hollywoodesque film albeit very well done gets a release in the U.S but this one doesn't.If you get a chance to see this film do not hesitate.  It took me a while to get into it as the first 45 minutes seem to have little bearing on the story but they actually do.  Beautiful acting cinematography and a story. Highly Recommended.".

In here he is like Kitano Takeshi in his seedy gangsterdon'tcare fashion but rawer and even cooler. Cynthia Chung ain't bad either she makes a good character and is very pretty but I couldn't stop wishing that she didn't do her nose like that.

Firstly I must admit what drew me to Failan was the presence of Choi MinShik in the cast. After seeing him in both Shiri and Oldboy I wanted to explore more of the career of this extraordinarily talented actor. I expected a lot from him and I was not disappointed. Nor was I disappointed with the extremely talented supporting cast. Cecilia Cheung is both charming and eminently watchable as Failan. And the rather colourful mobsters are appalling and humorous in equal amounts. The story is a slow paced one and is built heavily around character and emotion and is not made in the style of Hollywood offerings. Following Failan's experiences and the way in which others react to her story is a captivating experience which quickly pulls you in. It is a keenly observed and intimate tale that will pull at the heartstrings of anyone even the most cynical.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the top 3 if not the best Korean drama I've seen so far. I admit I was stunned by the beauty of Cecilia Cheung but even though that might have had some effect on my objectivity Failan's still a very good film. The acting performances by Cheung and especially by Choi Minsik are strong and believable.In short this is a drama of two persons Kangjae and Failan who are married with each other but never even meet. check the DVD for the details. Yet they share the same tragic fate. The saddest thing of this sad story is that you know that if the two characters would meet just once everything would turn out ok.The story is originally written by a Japanese Jiro Asada who also wrote the Japanese top hit Love letter. Even though the story in Failan is different from Love letter some resemblance can be noticed in the structure of both films. And most of all you get the same mix of sad and warm feelings in both. And that's why I really like Failan. Because even though the film is entirely sad it is also in a way warm and beautiful.Maybe a bit more focus on the Failan character instead of the smalltime crook Kangjae would be desirable. After all the emotional part of the story does not begin until the appearance of Failan.Korean film has improved enormously in the last few years. Failan is a good example and I highly recommend it. Overall rating 85.".

However after watching the film I was not only moved by her beauty of purity but much more by the magnificent story and eyeandheartcatching performances by Cheung as well as that of actor Choi MingShik.I've been aside while my girlfriend watched the movie but I did not actually got to understand what the film was talking about. And the moment I did I just could not help feeling so heartbroken that tears went down my cheeks. It was not an exaggeration of emotion that forced the tears but the feeling thrived deep in my mind found its way out through my tears. I was not only moved to feel sorry but also warm since it is a love that has never been seen elsewhere so faint between the two yet strong enough to sustain the two's lives and change their tracks of them.After the movie I've got some rational ideas to share with my friends here. We see the two Failan and KangChai. They are the most trivial parts of our world one girl with no relatives or skills to depend on to survive in a strange foreign country and a 2nd class rogue who is even thought less of by his colleagues in the gang. They did not even know each other before or well after their marriage yet at their most difficult times and ends of lives it was this love derived from imagination that told them to hang on and to realize their only proof of existence on this planet. We seek for love in our real lives yet never has been such a love seen. I guess after all we are to see and realize ourselves in every period of love and in the permanent pursue of love not our partners. And it is this selfrealization that is the uttermost meaning of human lives. However I am not criticizing this pursue as selfish conducts rather this is the most profound form of humanity.And it is for this meaning depicted so vividly and thoughtworthy I rate this movie a full 10.".

I was surprised that a movie so powerful and moving can be made by an Asian country well Korean movies IMO are the best in the world right now. and this was all before TaegukgiOldboy and so on.... The director of this movie does a fantastic job of describing ones character in Kang Jae and Failan and it made me think how sad i would be if i was in Kang Jae's place. A MUST SEE!!I admit this movie is not for everyone because it is REALLY slow and the story of both characters unfold after like 45 minutes. But if you want to see a movie that truly touches your heart then this is the movie for you. The acting is SUPERB in both Choi Min Sik and Cecilia Cheung the acting itself will move you. Plus all the other characters in this movie does a brilliant job. I don't know why this movie never got popular but it definitely deserves some media. Goes down on my Favorite top ten list of all time .".

Throughout the movie he takes punishment from the younger gangsters and also from his boss who used to be his good friend and also equal in rank. However some gangsters strived while others just lay stagnant...Kang Jae was one of the stagnant ones. Therefore Kang Jae is left to carrying out petty jobs such as running an illegal porn video ring and faking documents. On one occasion he is paid to forge marriage documents which would make him married to Failan played by the everattractive Chinese actress Cecilia Cheung. This gives Failan a visa to work in Korea. Analysis SpoilerCecilia's character is not described in nearly as much detail as Min Suk's despite the title being Failan but that is because this movie is really about Min Suk's character. I agree that a deeper look into Cecilia's character may have made the movie more emotionally charged but like I said the movie is about Kang Jae. Both characters have nearly hopeless situations. Kang Jae is finally driven to tears at reading Failan's letters because he realizes what a hopeless and worthless life he's been living. Furthermore Failan's appreciation for Kang Jae's marriage is the only proof that Kang Jae has that he has some impact on the world that he actually is important to anything. Spoiler At the end Kang Jae tells his boss his decision but he already knows what may happen when he says this. Even though Kang Jae packs up at his place at the end he has already seen that his life had an impact. Plus he already knows that if he goes home he has nothing. Great acting great movie.".

Choi Minshik is simply brilliant as the loser Gangster Kangjae and Cecilia Cheung is also wonderful as the tragic Failan.  The plot very basically involves a gangster Kangjae choi Minshik who for the price of a boat agrees to take the blame for a murder his boss committed because his boss would get about 20 years and he would only get about 10.  Then Kangjae gets news that Failan his wife is dead so Kangjae has to go to where Failan was living and act like a normal husband which is something he wasn't he married her illegally for money and had never even met her.  During the trip he discovers that Failan was in love with him because of what she thought was a kind act in marrying her.  Anyway during the trip things happen that makes Kangjae change his mind about taking the blame for his boss and he decides to quit the gangster life and go back to his home town.  The film ends with a scene which I think is one of the best endings I've ever seen.  The characters in the film are so well detailed and the directing and pacing are superb I've got it on DVD but would love to see it on the big screen so I just hope that it gets some sort of release in England and hopefully loads of other countries.  Korean movies are so strong at the moment with 'Christmas in August' 'Whispering Corridors' 'Tell Me Something' 'Nowhere to Hide' 'Art Museum by the Zoo' 'Libera Me' and others it's a shame more people don't watch them.".

I wholeheartedly disagree. It is important that Kangjae's development as a character comes quickly and seemingly out of nowhere. Without him being set up as such a despicable personality in the first half of the film the power of the film completely misses. Is his transition too unbelievable? Although under false pretenses Failan is the first and only person who has ever cared trusted and believed in Kangjae. Would this not change you? The film constantly beats on Kangjae through most of the film a role typical for Choi Minsik so this really sets up the tragedy at the end of the film  with Kangjae forever unable to fulfill his second chance.".

Without him being set up as such a despicable personality in the first half of the film the power of the film completely misses. Is his transition too unbelievable? Although under false pretenses Failan is the first and only person who has ever cared trusted and believed in Kangjae. Would this not change you? The film constantly beats on Kangjae through most of the film a role typical for Choi Minsik so this really sets up the tragedy at the end of the film  with Kangjae forever unable to fulfill his second chance.";

OK that was not a serious point but there are serious problems with this movie that gave me problems empathising with the main characters.Let me talk about the good stuff first I give 510 for the photography some good scenes and the acting is good from what i can tell without speaking the languages. It's fairly original I think obviously the girl is cute hey it's the shaolin soccer player with the 'tache! and the movie didn't really offend me until the end. So what's wrong with this movie? As I said some of its ideas about love are apparently ridiculous and this alone ruins it for me and I think will turn most viewers off. Anything else looks small really how about the clich of a nonspecific disease that's both very deadly and slow yet does nothing to hurt her appearance... intrusive music that dictates what you are supposed to be feeling but just highlighted what i wasn't feeling... numerous illogical decisions made by the characters is she really that alone?. I can look past many faults and plot holes if the main theme of a movie is engaging but this just for me sadly wasn't. When the girl died I knew this movie was a stinker. Actually there was a part near the end where he's reading her letter that I found almost nauseating and I even have a strong stomach for romance I think I gave both My Sassy Girl and Moulin Rouge 9 or 10 because behind the ridiculousness is a truth whereas I'd describe Failan the opposite way around.What is the point of being original if you're writing a love story so far outside normal human behaviour the scene in the police station sums it up nicely that it stops making any sort of sense? Really I don't think I'm being harsh here I must knock off another point for the ending... overall 410 and a recommendation to avoid unless you think you can cope with the plot idea.

	schema:reviewBody "1972 what happened there?'RPoint'  refers to a once strategically important region in an island 150 km south of HO Chi Minh city. French soldiers were fascinated by the beauty of the island upon which a leisure facility and a military hospital were built. But the area has a secret past a haunting curse untold for 30 years.1st Vietnamese War 1949 12 French soldiers who were in battle with communist guerrillas went mysteriously missing. A total of 650 people have been reported missing there without any explanation. 2nd Vietnamese War 1972 9 Korean soldiers went missing in the area. There are accounts of unexplainable radio transmissions sent by the group for 6 months requesting to be rescued.Are these freak occurrences real or not? The fact is that a gravestone which says 'No return' still stands marking the entrance of the area.

Both French and Korean soldiers have gone missing in the area known as RPoint. In 1972 when American forces were being withdrawn from Vietnam Korean troops eager to go home dreaming of returning to their family and friends baring American made gifts and earned money from their service were unexpectedly sent to RPoint on a mission which would prove fatal. Although their desire to return home was everything to them once they entered the haunted jungles of RPoint all hopes of coming back alive were lost.

	onyx:emotionText "1972 what happened there?'RPoint'  refers to a once strategically important region in an island 150 km south of HO Chi Minh city. French soldiers were fascinated by the beauty of the island upon which a leisure facility and a military hospital were built. But the area has a secret past a haunting curse untold for 30 years.1st Vietnamese War 1949 12 French soldiers who were in battle with communist guerrillas went mysteriously missing. A total of 650 people have been reported missing there without any explanation. 2nd Vietnamese War 1972 9 Korean soldiers went missing in the area. There are accounts of unexplainable radio transmissions sent by the group for 6 months requesting to be rescued.Are these freak occurrences real or not? The fact is that a gravestone which says 'No return' still stands marking the entrance of the area. In addition to this day there are reported sightings by local people of the girl who was slaughtered mercilessly a long time ago.The premise of this film is based on a story that has been passed on by oral tradition.

If you like movies such as Session 9 Deathwatch and Below you will like this one although you will have to read subtitle. The plot of this movie is very similar to the movie like Deathwatch.It is about a group of Korean soldiers sent on a mission to an island with some very bad juju going on. They are there to search for another group of Korean soldiers who have gone missing earlier. Between the Viet Cons the ghosts and the phantom American and Korean soldiers They must keep their sanity if the soldiers want to return alive.This movie is beautifully shot on location in Vietnam and Cambodia and also includes a building that will reminds you of the hospital in Session 9. The ensemble cast is very good for their roles. But I do have problem with the filmmaker portrayal of the soldiers during Vietnam war. I truly think a military adviser during the making of this film will make the soldiers more like soldiers and less like boy scouts out on a field trip.".

They are sent out to investigate the disappearance of some allied soldiers innear a ruined fort in Vietnam. Upon arrival it is obvious that the location to which they have been sent is somehow menacing and that the area might be haunted.This is by no means a Hollywood style all out horror flick and for myself this was its strength The film starts in a fairly relaxed way but subtly becomes more and more eerie as it progresses. There is no 'turning point' as such in the story where things go from bad to worse. Instead we have a sense of growing menace and foreboding. The subtlety with which this is achieved is excellent.The characters are well developed and have distinct personalities of their own rather than behaving like generic 'movie soldiers'. This helps add to the realism as collectively the platoon starts off just fine but gradually descends into a nightmare.Whilst not especially gory R point is a genuinely scary flick. There are a number of strange plot twists which keep the viewer wondering exactly where this whole thing is headed. The camera work is also good and the location has been chosen well. The area in which the story unfolds is dark deserted seemingly miles from civilisation and has an air of isolation and evil hanging over it. All in all this goes down as one of my favourite horror films a sort of blend of Apocalypse Now and Ring with an originality of its own. The film is intelligent haunting and the characters believable. All in all definitely worth watching ".

Yes you've probably seen it before in other films you know the drill a group of men cut off in a strange place where they are hunted by a seemingly supernatural force. Recent films such as the Bunker or Deathwatch cover similar territory to varying degrees of success.For most of the running time RPoint works as a good but not great thriller. There is a slowly building sense of dread as it goes on that thankfully never becomes overwhelming. It's not perfect as most of the men blend together and you really have no idea who is who. The real problem is that around an hour or so in the film starts to not make sense. Events become disjointed and there are some turns that seems out of left field. Granted this is a film that asks you to pay attention as little things early on show up later or give clues to whats going on so if you look away you may feel lost. I did look away and did feel lost.I also have reservations about the reasons for events toward the end they don't seem natural I suspect this is due to the director attempting to add more weight to the story than a straight horror film could carry. I think the attempts at allegory weaken the film and prevent it from being either a horror film or allegory.Still I do recommend the film for those people who want to see something creepy but not too scary and who don't mind it doesn't completely work to the end.".

While chasing the missing soldiers weird things happen with the rescue team.RPoint is an original scary and ambiguous journey to hell of the innermost fear of a group of soldiers. This horror movie explores the supernatural but its ambiguity allows the logical interpretation that nothing happened but the madness process of a group of stressed soldiers alone in a creepy and sacred location affected by the dark atmosphere of the spot and killing each other. An Asian horror movie is my favorite genre due to this type of intelligent screenplay that leaves the interpretation open to the viewers.

I agree with earlier posts it was reminiscent of The Shining evil location induces madness and murder.It won't appeal to everyone as we all have different tastes but I find this type of thoughtful horror far more terrifying and disturbing than the usual 'obvious' Hollywood horror  mainly because it invites you to use your imagination a scary unlimited place! instead of spelling it all out and tying up the loose ends.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a lot of promise in RPoint but very little fulfillment of any of it. I suppose the reason we don't see too many meldings of the war and supernatural horror genres is that the reality of war is infinitely more horrific than any boo! a ghost! plot line any screenwriter could cook up. That doesn't mean it's impossible to make a good warhorror movie. Still what examples I've seen in the past  The Bunker The Keep Below  have been sad disappointments relying on the genre's clichs rather than any narrative depth to evoke horror. RPoint wants to explore such depth putting a platoon of men in a situation where they question their very sanity. But ultimately it falls back on horror movie clichs  yes there's even a blackhaired ghost woman. Still there are several good scenes and enough hints at what a good movie this could have been that it's worth watching at least once for hardcore Asianhorror fans. It's the kind of movie where you sit around after it was over and talk about how awesome it would have been if only they'd done X or Y.The first half of the movie is reasonably strong. A Korean platoon in Vietnam that vanished six months before our story starts in a remote area designated RPoint has suddenly started radioing in to HQ. Another platoon is whipped together to find them. Trekking out to the eerie location they set up base camp in an abandoned mansion and begin reconning the area. Promptly weirdness starts occurring. In the best scene one soldier gets separated from his search party only to find them crossing a field...but is it them? In another a late night visit from a passing American platoon divulges some of RPoint's backstory and sets up a creepy reveal later in the film.Up to this point atmosphere is very disturbing and there is a lot of tension. Unfortunately it begins to weaken when little to no explanation is ever satisfactorily given for the weird goingson. I forget where I read it but someone once said that any genre movie can be forgiven its worst failings as long as it follows the Awesome! rule  that it has at least one knockout scene that makes you say Okay that was awesome! RPoint has no such scene.The soldiers begin fighting amongst one another but you don't really know them that well so it's hard to understand why. Most of them are onedimensional soldier stereotypes the scared rookie the guy who can't wait to get home to take his kid to the zoo so we know he's gonna die early the gruff sarge whom many of the grunts trust more than the green lieutenant so we don't feel any sense of personal stake in their fate. Worse still is the director's choice to throw in the occasional greentinted ghost POV shot. It begins early in the movie and completely wrecks the mood every time because it's such an obvious cheap horror movie device. What are we supposed to think? Ooooo scarrrrrry they're being watched from behind a tree by a ghost! Uhh sorry doesn't work. For one thing if I were a ghost...why would I hide behind a tree?Ultimately the movie just doesn't pay off. It's a shame because there are hints that with a few more rewrites this could have been a really amazing combination of the reallife horror of Platoon or Apocalypse Now and the who can you trust? themes of Body Snatchers or John Carpenter's The Thing. Watch it for yourself and I bet you come up with several better ways the story could have played out.".

The basic plot is that a platoon of Korean soldiers went missing at RPoint a former French plantation in Vietnam. A new group of soldiers is sent to investigate the disappearance after a radio message is received from the missing squad claiming they are still alive. There are two amazingly creepy scenes in it and although it owes a lot to John Carpenter's THE THING when it gets down to a few guys left it keeps up the intensity. The film is also impressive because it is an Asian horror film that made it to Korean theaters and no one has purchased the US remake rights.".

But the message also hints of a fateful end to the mission. A new mission is planned a new platoon formed. And off they go to find out whatever happened at RPoint. The area should be clear of enemies Vietcong but the platoon takes fire on their way in. The ambusher turns out to be a lone girl now fatally wounded and a few long dead corpses. Soon thereafter the platoon encounters an inscription that tells the history of the place. Supposedly this is the site of an ancient massacre on the inscription promises that those who enters and has blood on their hands will never leave. The platoon goes on though and starts the search for the lost soldiers. But something is horribly wrong. And when one of the privates in the platoon turn up dead and turns out to be one of the members of the lost platoon all is horribly wrong.Comments The movie is clearly built up as horrormovie set in war. Yet there are no enemies. And even if the movie uses sound and music in an attempt to be scary it fails miserably. First and foremost there is a huge flaw in the story In fact the story is one enormous flaw in itself. It is extremely inconsistent the whats and whys if there ever was any or if the director just wanted to play with some effects and thought that would be scary enough this is my guess is never told or revealed in the movie. In fact there are strong hints that the officers know more than we or the privates do. My guess is that director hopes this will add to the mystery but its just annoying as no new facts are ever revealed. The entire story seems to be a more or less random series of unexplained events.Second greatest flaw. My experience from the military is not big. But how those soldiers those officers got through kindergarten is beyond me. I've never seen a collection of so stupid thick and dumb people on a movie before. A few examples a No one including the officers has any idea of how many or who is in their platoon. This is shown when no one reacts when people get lost and go missing or when an extra soldier suddenly appears. In fact the commanding officer orders a soldier that is not in his platoon a soldier that is his mission to find to stand guard! b The soldiers are fighting among themselves all the time. A reason for a fight when you stand guard is that the other guard has a picture. c The soldiers do not tell anyone when they notice someone go missing. This happens when the extra soldier disappears and when one of the real soldiers run off into the forest at night. The guards only reaction a shrug and a comment well there he goes. d When searching for a missing soldier some of them refuse because they don't feel like searching for a companion. Conclusion those must be the worst soldiers ever.In fact the unexplained random effects and the extremely stupid squad stops any attempt of the movie at being scary. Mostly I felt annoyed at the bad story and the stupid squad but sometimes one of them died and I felt a little happy because I knew the movie was closer to its end. Because in addition to being inconsistent it is totally predictable. It is just a matter when they die.The movie had one last chance at redeeming itself at the end if it had presented some smart end some twist that had explained what happened and made the events understandable. But the movie showed a little surprisingly some consistency at last. Like all other parts the end failed miserably as well.To complete the failure the movie shows some good footage actually but is poorly edited and the characters show no development. The actors also contribute with a lot of bad acting.Conclusion An extremely bad not scary failed horrormovie full with questions and contradictions. Do not see. It is a complete waste of time.210".

However right from the intro Rpoint has a quiet sense of dread which slowly but steadily grows over the next one and a half hours until right before the end when all hell breaks loose. The atmosphere of the movie is superb as is the acting. Although the soldiers are rarely given much character development their growing sense of tension and paranoia is superbly paced by the director and even without the character development you end up caring for more than one of the soldiers. There is more than one genuinely creepy moment in the movie with the one standout being when one of the soldiers gets separated from his platoon but then thinks he sees them right in front of him moving cautiously forward...he follows them but we can tell that something is wrong with this platoon of soldiers that it's not his group...we wait in tension as the soldier makes his way near the group as they move forward in slow motion and right as he's almost catching up with them the group of soldiers slowly seem drop down on the long grass...and then they disappear. I know words don't do this scene justice at all...but it was one of the creepiest scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie right up there with Sadako climbing out of the television set in Ringu. In conclusion if you're into thoughtful atmospheric horror movies like Ringu and A Tale of Two Sisters this should be right up your alley. I know a lot of people in IMDb seemed to have complained that they didn't understand the movie but I thought it wasn't that hard to understand at all. All in all Rpoint is a great movie. Score another point for the Korean movie industry which keeps churning out excellent movies like Oldboy Tale of Two Sisters Failan which is not a horror movie but is beautiful nonetheless and now Rpoint. HIGHLY recommended.".

This singer is completely unknown in Brazil and I was surprised and touched hearing such beautiful interpretation of wonderful songs. Patricia Kaas herself alone makes this movie very worthwhile. It is difficult to assimilate Claudia Cardinale old but she has a great performance in the role of an unfaithful countess.

Jeremy Irons is quite good as is the French lead actress who I am not familiar with and whose singing talent is jazzy and soulful. I think there is a very French ambiance to this film although I'm not sure really what I mean when I say this. The movie takes its time in terms of hooking up the two lead characters...by the time they do meet each other albeit in kind of a far fetched way perhaps the audience knows a lot about each of them and I for one had grown to like them and was glad to see them meet up. I also liked the fact that there is a bit of mystery thrown into the storyline in the midst of them meeting. There is also a strong emotional undercurrent in this film of sadness. So if you are a Jeremy Irons fan or if you just want to see a decent contemporary story about people maneuvering middle life while still searching for themselves and love this film is possibly worth your time.".

However what I tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known French chain of hotels. The other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it's plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion.

The story of this weary master thief and a disillusioned with lovejazz singer meetingfinding common ground and falling 'for each other' is age old. However their common ground is quite unusual and a bit of a stretch but hey...it's a story. Where they meet and how the story plays out is an unexpected and interesting twist. To my mind the acting and Morrocan setting are great. Jeremy Irons is his usual cool and collected self and the lead actress suits the part beautifully...and can she sing!! The soundtrack to my mind and heart definitely steals the show.  I love bluesjazz and I found this sound track hauntingly thought provokingly absorbing.".

All the enviably relaxed pretty unnecessary characters take turns masticating the scenery with an air of weary sophistication. The whole exercise comes across like an interminably long Ralph Lauren ad. If you're past forty and believe Francophilia is the key to sophistication you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a baguette.

The whole exercise comes across like an interminably long Ralph Lauren ad. If you're past forty and believe Francophilia is the key to sophistication you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a baguette. Well if you liked this movie you probably felt smart for appreciating Godard's leaden loge de l'amour and you may even have sat through Le Divorce without cringing.";

The motley crew that we had employed were just about in the exact same 'vein' of life as these 'cons' 'crazy men' and 'criminals' that made up the perfect cast in 'Carwash'! I loved this for simple reasons it simply hit right on it.Sully Boyer the carwash owner was a perfectly in place displaced business owner complete with bad marriage and regrets of owning the wash and not making it a parking lot like his brother who could now buy and sell him. There was T.C. Theodore Chancey Talcottplayed by Franklin Ajaye who's 'hook' in the story was he was imagining that he would be a super hero named 'The Fly'. I'd be sharp sharp sharp man. No one would mess with me. Standing with Lloyd by the rag sinks. But he was also in love with Mona. The fine foxy broad who worked at the caf 'Five Spot'. With the whole 'dryer line' to dry the cars as they pulled out from the washing area. The Mexican worker who would harass his Indian friend and back and forth it would go all the while on the clock! The fighting couple with the classic Mustang to the hippie Jewish kid well versed in ghetto speak. This movie had it all. Enter Richard Pryor as the fasttalking money grabbing Rev. Daddy Rich. accompanied by the Pointer sisters! Hilarious!! The more I watch this the more astounded I am at how true to life and form these characters interact with one another. Even an ending that was serious enough to put a wellrounded effect on the out come of the plot and m.o. of the players. It showed Loni cared about a young upstart punk enough to see more in him than he himselfAckbar'Duane'could see for himself. LoniIvan Dixon's charactersimply believed in Duane. That was what Duane needed to not end up in prison. He needed someone to believe in him not use him to rob a company and go straight to prison.I recommend this highly to those who love the seventies a great comedic 'everyday' worksituation and doesn't necessarily need car chases or explosions special effects etc. Bravo.

'Car Wash' is a collective and populist film about the spirit of community. It is also a motion picture with a few symbols thrown in probably unconsciously. Since their creation cars have always been a symbol of status you are what you drive. The happygolucky car washers offer a 'de luxe' service for all they give the business a 'special touch' with their multiracial hands not only Negroes but also Chicanos and native Americans through another symbol water the classic icon of purification and universal conscience. Surrounded by a group of very well defined characters especially since they are drawn by single strokes or have very little screen time to develop psychological traits they are characterized by their actions three persons stand out Mr. B capital Abdullah revolution and Lonnie kindness. The greed and neglect of the lustful and amiable car wash owner is contrasted with the anger and resentment of the dry and humorless political activist. In the middle comes the ex convict who ultimately will settle things around the film's central issue work. We cannot forget most of the issues referred to in the film in a casual way as we normally do in daily life and related to the multiple characters love religion prostitution parenthood homosexuality social climbing class rejection money class struggle sex and above all music which is the unifying element. Norman Whitfield did such a good job that he not only established the rhythm of the action but its atmosphere tone and feel. It generates such positive energy that in the end all of the virtues that appear combined with the vices of the fast consumerist and violent urban life as well as the suffering of some of the characters come to the fore love compassion tolerance patience solidarity friendship happiness. That makes 'Car Wash' a joyful and universal parable of survival in the latter days of capitalism. And that is not an easy achievement for a little film directed by an AfricanAmerican and aimed at a very reduced population.".

That makes 'Car Wash' a joyful and universal parable of survival in the latter days of capitalism. And that is not an easy achievement for a little film directed by an AfricanAmerican and aimed at a very reduced population.";

Frank Stanley's polished sparkling cinematography Norman Whitfield's funky dynamic syncopated soul score Christopher Holmes' snappy rhythmic editing and Rose Royce's fabulously groovy classic hit theme song add further bounce and energy to the infectiously frothy playful and sprightly proceedings.

This movie is so outlandish and so cleverly done my friends and I have watched it many a time and chuckled. In fact most of my friends love this movie and could watch it many times over and they are pretty intellectual. The laughing never stops. I think the secret of the appeal is that the actors are a fine group of actors. They play the parts in a run down I think it's supposed to be run down or at least economically depressed area car wash but they are fine actors with fine comedic timing. You feel that you are taken right back there with them and life is going to be carefree forever in L.A. in 1976. Maybe it's an atmosphere that only exists in people's minds. The main girl Marsha is very pretty in a very very seventies way complete with blue eyeshadow. At the end her prince Ken comes to take her away. The soundtrack is one of the best ever set to film I have the cd though I never listen to it. The soundtrack is best listened to... in the movie. The proper angst is added with some sociological issues.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the first time I watched Car Wash as a kid on an ordinary Saturday night it instantly became one of my favorite cinematic pleasures and not in a guilty way. The film drew the 70's in my mind and made me realize that a time existed before I was born where life had a certain quality cruelly missing in our cynical years something flamboyant lively  funky! Car Wash is an exhilarating journey driven by J.B the deejay of the fictional radio station KGYS providing the musical background the soul of the film. No pun intended since the soundtrack includes disco funk and RB ballads the unique sound of AfroAmerican music encapsulating the 70's. The cast is multiracial with an AfroAmerican predominance but there's something refreshing in the way some serious issues are tackled in Car Wash despite the cheerful mood.Take Lindy's character remarkably played by Antonio Fargas. It's extremely challenging to see a homo drag played with such sophistication. When confronted to Duane aka Abdullah Bill Duke as the no pun intended again 'straight man' of the film Lindly proudly delivers one of my favorite movie lines  Honey I'm more a man than you'll ever be and more a woman than you'll ever get. The comedic aspect never deserts the film neither does the social commentary. The tormented Abdullah sounds on the surface as the group's killjoy but he mirrors the confusion of a community in quest for identity an issue the running gag involving his name humorously deal with. Abdullah's resentments are echoed by Lonnie Ivan Dixon as the cigarsmoking respected veteran of the group.Car Wash opens on a summer Friday morning where we discover the group inside the locker room. With his inseparable radio there's Hippo whose name gives a subtle hint about his size Lloyd and Floyd the two James Brownwannabe with a priceless musical entrance. T.C. aka The Fly is another engaging character in love with Mona the beautiful waitress of the neighboring restaurant. To invite Mona to JB's Disco Dance Show he must get the tickets by calling KGYS whenever he hears 'Disco Dance'. His buzzing around about his gigantic afro haircut his secret identity and his mission will provide some of the film's funniest moments.The rest of the team involves Chuco the Latino guy whom you may remember as the illfated Angel Fernandez from Scarface. With Goody the Native with the most memorable cinematic pigeared hat ever they share an amusing complicity whether they tease each other or take their revenge on Earl the foreman the one who 'doesn't get wet' as he proudly declares. And to complete the gallery Ray Vitte is Geronimo whose weird outfit equals the worthlessness of the marital advices he gives to Jack Kehoe as Scruggs the man from The Sting and Serpico with a cowboy hat. Hats and haircuts are the character's trademarks while the orange uniform is Dee Luxe Car Wash' signature besides its hilarious motto We're not responsible of you car ... which speaks a lot about the company's work ethics.These characters create a childish mood that Abdullah described as 'clown show'. His opinion is demonstrated by the constant interventions of Mr. B. who sounds mostly like a playground monitor with his classic Wash the caahs! a cigar clenched between his teeth. Mr. B. played by Sully Boyar is the fatherly type of boss keeping an eye on his workers on his Maoist potsmoker but genuinely sympathetic son Irwin who wants to be part of the working class and occasionally an eye on the feminine assets of Marsha the sexy cash register employee the only staff member who calls him Leon.Car Wash is driven by the dynamics between the characters an ingenuity of Joel Schumacher's script where we get to know people from the nature of their relationships. And at the end the character's arcs are unequally complete but the day changed one thing or two for the better like Mr B. giving a chance to Lonnie to submit his ideas to improve the service one of the films' nicest touches. But more than a car wash the place seems like a converging point in Los Angeles for the strangest visitors. As Hippo said Boy there's been some weird people.Weird is the word. A bandaged man a hysterical Lorraine Gary as 'Ms. Beverly Hills' the woman whose carsick son puking all over her made me laugh to tears a pooping dog a mad pop bottle bomber hiding a no less disgusting stuff in his 'weapon' Calvin the skateboarding brat and of course Richard Pryor as the TV evangelist 'Daddy Rich' an ambiguous character whose message is exaggeratedly revered to highlight its excesses. Still his cameo is an occasion to appreciate the Pointers aka Wilson Sisters's Believe song. The whole movie is a tribute to American Black culture incarnated by Snapper the wise shoeshine man played by Clarence Muse and I learned that the first Black American to star in a film. A fitting symbol.And the romantic touch of the film is poetically incarnated by 'Marlene' the quiet hooker who stiffs a taxi driver played by George Carlin and starts looking for an exclient named Joe while Carlin spends all the day asking people if they saw a 'big tall blonde black chick?' The female cast is delicately treated with the three M  Marlene looking for her charming prince Mona the waitress who finally accepts T.C.'s date and Marsha who gets a date with a Redford lookalike so stereotypical it's hilarious.But these stereotypes are never intended to mock but to display the everyday working class with a humorous social commentary. The plotless concept was risky but it worked because the film is so genuinely funny and the characters so endearing it immediately impacts your memories to forever associate Car Wash with an iconic disco song a sunny color orange and the delirious spirit of the 70's!".

	schema:reviewBody "An extremely underrated film that hopefully with this DVD release might finally gain some critical respect. Car Wash has somehow been lumped into the genre of wacky comedy over the years. However the seriousness in which the plot develops and the sensitivity shown to its main characters make this a well directed comedydrama or dare I say it dramedy.Everyone knows about the killer soundtrack courtesy of Rose Royce and The Pointer Sisters they smoke in this film but what will surprise many is the smart script by Joel Schumacher Batman Forever 8MM and gentle direction by Mike Schultz Cooley High. Car Wash is a fun day in the life comedy but is also an  intelligent and at times thought provoking study on work roles race relations and ultimately everyone's need to be loved.The characters are slowly revealed with an Altmanesque quality. Especially strong performances by Antonio Fargas known to most as Huggy Bear and comedian Franklyn Ajaye as the Fly a wanna be super hero that has a crush on a gorgeous seemingly unattainable woman.Richard Pryor and the Pointer Sisters take over the film at midpoint in the roles of Daddy Rich and the Wilson Sisters. This is an excellent performance by Pryor as he extolls the virtue of both god and money to the workers at the car wash. The preacher is serious in his dedication to earning that almighty dollar yet not above poking humor at the obvious conflictions he represents. A great scene and it relieves some of the drama that has been set up by the brooding Abdullah a muslim that is torn over the tensions and hypocrisies of the workplace.There are no special features added to this DVD release and that's a shame. It could benefit from some commentary with a cast including Pryor George Carlin  Professor Irwin Corey and Melanie Mayron you'd think there are some great stories on the making of Car Wash and a feature on the music would have been an obvious feature to add. Also the film is only presented in full screen no wide screen option is available.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this first during it's initial theatrical release and loved it. I've seen the chopped up TV version many times since and still love it. What amazes me is that as a silly fun comedy it won two awards at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival for Technical Grand Prize for director Michael Shultz and Best Music for Norman Whitfield. Well Whitfield is no surprise but Technical Grand Prize? It also was nominated for Cannes' Golden Palm Award. Former Motown producer Whitfield also picked up the Grammy for Best Original Score and got a Golden Globe nomination for the Theme from Car Wash. A great soundtrack from Whitfield and the group Rose Royce which gave them a 1 song and a 1 album. A great ensemble cast which includes Richard Pryor George Carlin Antonio Fargas Garrett Morris Irwin Corey Ivan Dixon Bill Duke and The Pointer Sisters when they were the original quartet. This movie is like MASH in reverse. MASH take a serious subject and fills it with zany subplots while Car Wash takes a Zany subject and fills it with serious subplots. Lonnie the excon car wash manager has seen it all but doesn't want to see the frustrated Duane who has become the radical Abdulah take a path to prison. Marlene is hooker caught up in the fast lane of drugs and prostitution in L.A. Mona is the waitress that has to put up with the car wash clowns everyday and Marsha is the office manager looking for love. Almost everybody else who works the car wash or somehow comes to it are an amazing array of offthe wall characters. Director Michael Shultz had a sting of black urban comedies in the 70's with Cooley High Which Way is Up and Car Wash. He got critically raked over the coals for directing Sgt. Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band after Car Wash and since has done mostly television directing. directorwriter Joel Schumacher wrote the screenplay who also wrote St. Elmo's Fire and The Wiz but would become better known as a director for such films as Flatliners The Lost Boys Falling Down and Phone Booth as well as St. Elmo's Fire and a couple of the Batman movies. Veteran art director Robert Clatworthy had a versatile career in all film genres and he did Car Wash at the end of his career which included the films Psycho Touch of Evil The Incredible Shrinking Man To Hell and Back and Phantom Lady. Editor Christopher Holmes did Five Easy Pieces and cinematographer Frank Stanley did Magnum Force and The Eiger Sanction. It's a great cast and crew and a fun film with lot's of great characters and music. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let the Right one In is like no other vampire movie that I have ever seen. It is smarter scarier and more nuanced. It doesn't feel like a thriller it feels like literature.The film which details the bizarre misadventures of a pair of preteen star crossed lovers one of whom is an androgynous vampire is phenomenal in almost every regard. The details of young Oskar's Kare Hedebrant life are spot on. Stuck in that incredibly painful period of postchildhood preadolescence Oskar is aware of girls but has no idea how to contend with them. He is small for his age and is brutalized by other boys as a result. He's terribly alone and collects news clips of violent crimes as a way of letting out his rage. One day a strange young girl named Eli Lina Leandersson appears on the playground. They become fast friends and things begin to look up for Oskar. Eli even innocently spends the night on occasion.Meanwhile we are privy to some things that Oskar doesn't know. As it happens Eli's caretaker is a serial killer of the most brutal order desanguinating his victims into a bucket. Soon Oskar comes to realize that his new friend is a bit more than she seemed at first.After a tragedy of shocking violence Eli is left to fend for herself trying desperately to stave off the urge to drink fresh blood while also forming a delicate new bond with Oskar.There is already a remake of Let the Right one In on the way. But don't wait for it. There is no way it could ever hope to capture the magic of the original. It's not just that this film is gorgeously shot. Not just that it is impeccably written. Not just that it is fully realized with an unmatched respect for vampire lore. It is all in the acting. Even if the producers find two amazing young actors the odds against recapturing the brilliant melancholy chemistry are astronomical.Everything about Let the Right one In is thought through. Where a more traditional horror film might have opted for endless ultra violence or else cut everything out in favor of a kiddie friendly rating. director Tomas Alfredson steers the line right down the middle. When the violence comes it is brutal and horrific but it is never dwelt upon. We are left to question what we just saw rather than see kidneys on display.Too there is a great stillness to the film. The first half of the film it mimics Oskar's stage. Stuck in between. Never moving with no hope of growth. But as things begin to change it becomes apparent that the stillness is not for Oskar but rather for Eli. Oskar will grow up change and become a man. Eli is stuck in a much more burdensome fate.And then there is the quiet understated ending. Some will find it haunting others will find it whimsical I went back and forth more than a few times. No two people will have the same understanding.This is the kind of movie people beg for. Don't miss it. This is the first time since perhaps Silence of the Lambs that a horror film had a real chance to take home some Oscar gold. And not only that it will deserve it.A".

	schema:reviewBody "Let the Right One In is at its heart a sweet comingofage story which is so unique and different that it simply defies categorization. In this Swedish film adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestselling book director Tomas Alfredson dares to mix pleasure and pain in a way that is both horrifying and tender.Let the Right One In has a storyline which although it reveals some secrets early on is best left as a surprise. So this will necessarily be one of those rare reviews in which the less said about the plot the better. 12yearolds Oskar Kare Hedebrant and Eli Lina Leandersson meet one snowy afternoon at a jungle gym in the courtyard of Oskar's housing complex outside Stockholm. Their young tender attraction for each other is apparent right from the start and we think we know where their relationship is headed. But there is a deep dark secret to be discovered here and when it's revealed the audience is both repulsed and curiously fascinated at the same time in a similar fashion as when yellow crime scene tape brings us closer rather than warning us away.The supporting cast is completely beholden to the narrative as it revolves around the adorable young couple whose performances rival the best I've ever seen for actors of that age. The innocence and vulnerability of Hedebrant's Oskar is simply a tourdeforce and he admirably carries the film on his little shoulders. Leandersson matches him scene by scene line by line and the result literally gave me chills.Production values are stellar with all technical aspects  lighting original music by Johan Soderqvist and Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography  combining in perfect synchronization to produce a Hitchockian tale that somehow brings love and light into what could have been the darkest drama imaginable.Let the Right One In was the overwhelming choice for Best Narrative Feature after its North American Premiere here at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival. It is a truly welldeserved honor. Tomas Alfredson has crafted a brilliant work of art that left me shaking my head with wonder.".

Not merely an exercise in style his film is a brilliant piece of amoral storytelling and even if some characters' actions defy any logic or common sense I don't wanna spoil any moment here but you'll know what I mean when the first revenge moment of the story happens they seem to be there just to remind you that this is just a fantasy tale but not for the little ones!. Oskar Kre Hedebrant is a 12 yearold bullied boy that befriends and develops an innocent crush on his new neighbor Eli Lina Leandersson who happens to be a vampire. What comes next is a twisted tale of revenge and pubescent love made with visual flair the swimming pool scene is already classic creative directing and impressive performances by the young pair of protagonists.Hollywood of course didn't waste time and already announced an upcoming remake for those who are too lazy to read subtitles. Most likely the remake will turn out to be PG13 in order to make more money and be filled with moral values so the prudish parents will let their kids watch the movie don't they know The Little Vampire was made years ago?. Ignore the future bomb and enjoy the original  you're in for a treat! 1010.".

It is that fact revealed in the final scene that gives the film its dark and nightmarish core the blossoming friendship we have been witness to prior to this will offer no redemption to Oskar if this is path his relationship with Eli takes.Hkan butchers boys not much older than Oskar as food for Eli. In this story where the storytelling is of the highest order so many of its darkest whispers are just that hinted and suggested at. Questions are alluded to that play on the mind but are never answered. Why does Hkan pick these victims ? presumably they are Eli's preference. What does that say about Eli's interest in Oskar ? What is Eli's true nature ? She has been twelve for a very long time but we briefly glimpse her true physical age in fact she is in late middle age roughly the same age as Hkan. Her gift to Oskar in the films last moments the brutal slaughter of his child tormentors. Entranced in her glamour this makes Oskar happy but how can this be happy or good ?And then they go off happily into the sunset Oskar presumably to be deadened to the soul destroyed husk of a person Hkan had become butchering his fellow humans to provide Eli with food. You can see why I am puzzled when people think this film is sweet. In fact its conclusion is utterly chilling Oskar has happily swapped the commonplace misery of childhood bullying for a fate that will truly be hell on earth and you know as he happily smiles in the films last shot that he doesn't have a clue.None the less it's superlative and a film I would heartily recommend. Like the greatest horror tales it succeeds by suggestion and playing on the imagination. It is also a truly great addition to the vampire cannon a thing that can be said of very few variations on Bram Stokers brilliant original.".

Everything in this film is wellmade in synchronization. This is the first film related to a vampire that I think is least connected to Vampire's teeth baring at audience all the times like other familiar horror we used to see. Other than some gory scenes in this film we can yet see some flesh and blood moment of humane Vampire. And that is truly written to the core plot.The last scene at swimming pool is totally mesmerizing and mindblowing.By the way if Sweden submits this movie to be in competition with other nominees around the world for Oscar foreignlanguage film category this year this masterpiece should win or at least be shortlisted for the final fives.10 out of 10".

It's primarily a movie about how friendship can help you find your own personal strength. Two lonely children meet and change each other's lives. The fact that one is a vampire makes the movie even more interesting and unique but it's not the most important plot detail. The cold darkness of Sweden makes the perfect backdrop for the story. It was so refreshing to see a vampire movie that doesn't rely upon cheap scares fangs and gore. The only scene I didn't enjoy involved cats with computer animated faces  it looked very stupid and out of place but this was a small disappointment in an otherwise outstanding film. I highly recommend this movie.".

It's primarily a movie about how friendship can help you find your own personal strength. Two lonely children meet and change each other's lives. The fact that one is a vampire makes the movie even more interesting and unique but it's not the most important plot detail. The cold darkness of Sweden makes the perfect backdrop for the story. It was so refreshing to see a vampire movie that doesn't rely upon cheap scares fangs and gore. The only scene I didn't enjoy involved cats with computer animated faces  it looked very stupid and out of place but this was a small disappointment in an otherwise outstanding film. I highly recommend this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "At it's worst Let the Right One In is far too subtle and slow and nothing like typical horror movies if it should be considered one. At its best its one of the better films we've seen in the last decade. As a foreign film it should see wider American distribution and publicity than any such film sinceCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Our hero here who is just twelve is so perfectly likable and so well played he is the sort of boy you'd want to raise or the sort you'd want your child to end up with. He's richly contemplative and caring lonely but not broken cool but not pretentious precocious and yet without arrogance. Who knew that he would fall for a vampire? It's a story more like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde than  The Lost Boys. It's more about asceticism and existentialism than blood and gore. I won't give any details away but this film is neither convoluted nor clich. Sure it's not amongst the best stories. It's not a formula film but it's intelligently written and doesn't start anything it doesn't conclude well not too much. Beautifully shot in a snowy and desolate Swedish town the film very much carries on a world of its own. The film as an entirety is subtle even slow. Likewise the effects are far from showy making tasteful use of CGI with kitties or watching our vampire climb seven stories. The sound does not rely on a creepy score nor attempts a hip or ambient soundtrack. Instead it successfully amplifies the sounds of its fictional and isolated universe which is far away from reality and amid somewhere in the early 1980s. For the most part we only hear what the characters or the world around them gusts of wind the brushing of teeth The Clash. Though most notable is all of the silence all of the stillness that creeps about keeping the viewer mystified and engaged.What the film does is allow adequate time for the viewer to develop a consciousness about the situation of the story. It allows us to make our own determinations without being told what to conclude. Throughout the entire movie I could only count one legitimate flaw a tiny divisive issue which I'm sure was mulled over by a brilliant director and screenwriter. It certainly won't be for everyone. It's not for those who can't read. It's not for kids. And it's not for those who can't bear nontraditional story telling. For me the film was a breath of fresh air in an increasingly tiring and rehashed film industry. At least this film is rehash of a different kind.This film should have seen a slew of Oscar nods and it seemed to me this film could have had a wide release. Nevertheless it will turn out to be a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was the main reason for my attending Frightfest in London this year and I was not disappointed. From the opening shot you realise that you are in for something special. The film is set in a very cold Sweden in the early 1980s and the writer of the novelscreenplay has confessed that it is semiautobiographical and based loosely on his own childhood. I'm guessing that the inclusion of a vampire in the story is what takes this away from being simply autobiographical.Although people are describing this as a vampire movie I cannot help but feel that this does the film something of a disservice. Does this mean that people who do not particularly like vampire movies would not necessarily go to the cinema and watch this? That would be a shame because this is a very human story. The vampire element does take a back seat to the main focus of the story which is the fascinating relationship between Oscar and Eli. These are two outcasts brought together by their miserable lives.The film is Swedish with subtitles but again don't let that put you off. The two performances by the child actors are fantastic and director Alfredson is apparently better known for comedy in Sweden and his humour is evident throughout the film. Without a doubt the best film at Frightfest 2008 there is a remake planned for 2010 but the film is near perfect just as it is so why wait? Go and see it.".

Be wary of genre classifications here to call this a mere vampire film without qualification would be a disservice. A vampire film it is but one that belongs to a very select club. Midway through I imagined the ghosts old Bela and Tod Browning hobnobbing with a Mr Bergman all three of them living up every moment of this elegant little tale of horror. With minimal special effects no flashy editing and cinematography that leaves its imprint on your mind for days Alfredson's layered film about cruelty and goodness exclusion and marginality  for both vampire and human alike  is told through the unlikely friendship of two 12yearold loners. One Oskar albinolike in his white blondness is bullied at school. The other Eli a dark unkempt and unorthodox girl vampire teaches him to stand up for himself. In the background is the strange devoted slightly bumbling Hakan Eli's human protector and blood gatherer. He strings his victims up cuts them open then siphons their blood into jerricans for Eli to drink. He passes as her father. Is he?The film has a strong physical impact. The fatigue and drudgery and anguish of Hakan's attempts to find refurbishment the confinement of Eli's agelessness I have been 12 for a long time the isolation of the dreary suburban setting in the dead of a Swedish winter  all of these are as palpable as the burden of eternity felt by Wenders' two angels watching over Berlin. The film's cadence is that of a macabre Bolero slow and tame at the beginning but relentlessly progressing louder and louder until the film starts to explode in a series of horrific scenes towards the end. Troubling questions left unresolved only add to the film's richness and depth. Eli's labia stitched shut her relationship with her protector. Why does he kill in her place?  because she is young?  to avoid a proliferation of vampires? When Eli finally has to find her own blood thus turning a bitten woman into a vampire herself the sequences that follow  the cat attack willed selfdestruction  are some of the most striking in the film frightening enough to make your heart skip a thump. There are two endings. Alfredson lures us into a false one when he circles the film back to a scene almost identical to that at the opening. But then he playfully tacks on another 10 or 15 minutes in a very different tone. At first this rattled me a bit but then I came to better terms with it and decided that after all its black humour was far from a cop out. Reviewers have predicted the film will have a solid festival and art house audience. Personally I cannot imagine any kind of filmgoer not being dazzled by this icy trip through bloodied woods and where according to the many reactions to the film a light supposedly shines through. It does and doesn't. The film may be about friendship but the relief provided by the ending is only an isolated moment in time that has resolved nothing. The future that one is left to imagine for the survivors is disturbing at best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let the right one in is just a very huge surprise and a plain beautiful movie. You can always judge how much impact a movie has when you watch the crowd in the cinema while the credits roll and in this one barely anyone dared to stand up and go... I guess they were all busy swallowing their tears because this movie is a real tearjerker.The movie is a unique mix of a vampire movie with love story and drama. The story is told in a very slow style but this just fits the story about two kids who meet at night on a playground. One is the introvert outsider Oskar who gets bullied at school and has a strange interest for knives and murder stories and the other is Eli a girl that just moved in next door to him with what we expect is her dad. Immediately when they tape the windows shut with cardboard and dad goes out at night knocking out boys to drain their blood into a bottle we know that Eli is not an ordinary child but rather a vampire that sleeps at day and only comes out at night and like she tells Oskar has been 12 years old for a very long time. From here on the relationship between the two deepens while some cracks appear between Eli and her dad who fails at providing her with blood. When Elis Dad dies after trying to find a victim for Eli she is left on her own and soon the small town finds dead people in the snow. The story how Eli became what she is now is not through flashbacks but rather through a woman that is bitten by her and survives turning into a vampire herself. The classic vampire movie elements were used in a very unique way especially the titlegiving invitation to come in. The use of special effects in this movie is brilliant ... like when the cats turn against a vampire when sensing it or the short and rough final scene when Oskar is dunked under water. Basically the story deals with the old sad story of the curse of immortality and how everything withers around the vampire except for himself. But the way this is placed in a children's environment and how Eli approaches Oskar is special. In the end the viewer is left to judge on his own... is this a heartbreaking love story is Eli using Oskar or is it both as a natural way that life demands of their fate? When thedramatic piano music fades on you are sure thinking about this and inthat way the movie is great subtle and different. The acting especially of the 2 lead children is great and the casting for Eli is beyond perfect because she has something hypnotic in her eyes that captures a lot of her character by the first time she appears on screen. I guess this is a movie not to be missed no matter if you like vampire movies or not... this should appeal to anyone in a way.".

You can always judge how much impact a movie has when you watch the crowd in the cinema while the credits roll and in this one barely anyone dared to stand up and go... I guess they were all busy swallowing their tears because this movie is a real tearjerker.The movie is a unique mix of a vampire movie with love story and drama. The story is told in a very slow style but this just fits the story about two kids who meet at night on a playground. One is the introvert outsider Oskar who gets bullied at school and has a strange interest for knives and murder stories and the other is Eli a girl that just moved in next door to him with what we expect is her dad. Immediately when they tape the windows shut with cardboard and dad goes out at night knocking out boys to drain their blood into a bottle we know that Eli is not an ordinary child but rather a vampire that sleeps at day and only comes out at night and like she tells Oskar has been 12 years old for a very long time.

	schema:reviewBody "In a nutshell the movie is not about vampires at all. Yes there is violence but it is the kind of violence which is comes across as an absolute necessity. It often feels that the violent scenes are almost apologetic in nature. This is a movie about life love and everything in between. The movie is very crisp and focused with every emotion being sharpened by the age of its characters the cinematography and pureness of the actors portrayal of their characters.All of the other reviews already mention the plot so by now you probably have a good idea of what the movie has in store for you.I just wanted to draw your attention to one detail that i have not seen mentioned in any of the reviews. I think this one detail gives the movie its greatest depth Eli's Eli is the old vampire trapped in the neveraging body of a 12 year old girl caretaker is seen by many as a serial killer or maniac which brutally slays young boys. He drains the blood of his victims and delivers it to Eli.I think everyone is dead wrong here. Eli's caretaker is the key to the whole story. He is clearly in love with her. He clearly hates murdering people but at the same time clearly hates to see Eli suffer without blood or doing the killing herself. He sacrifices himself for her.Who is he? He is a man who once fell in love as a young boy. Just like Oskar the young boy who finds friendship support and live in Eli. Perhaps he too at his young age found Eli a friend a savior and his first and only true love. Perhaps he couldn't see her murder people for blood and he decided to take care of her just like she took care of him when he couldn't stand up for himself.When he is caught he can not bare the shame. First he disfigures his own face not to allow authorities to link him to Eli and then he ends his own life knowing well that his time has ended and that Eli has found a new life and a new friend. Before his death he gives Eli his last gift  his own blood.Understanding this detail we understand the movie's ending. Oskar takes the place as the right one who now will take care of Eli until the day he dies as she continues to live on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let the Right One In 2008  The one thing I keep reading about Let the Right One In is how it's such a unique horror movie. Horror movie this horror movie that. This has left me baffled. How can you have seen the film and taken it as a horror movie? To be sure it is a supernatural drama with a few moments of thrill and fear but a horror movie? No I simply cannot refer to it as such. While I may play semantics with the critics on that issue I agree wholeheartedly that Let the Right One In is a special film.This Swedish gem is set during the blistering cold days of winter. A 12 year old boy Oskar Kare Hedebrant is at the mercy of the school bullies. He shuffles quietly around school talks softly his innocence and fears diverting his desires for revenge. He lives in an apartment complex with his mother. One day new neighbors move in. A man puts up cardboard and plastic over the windows and avoids conversation with other tenants.One night as Oskar sits outside in the playground a young girl appears hardly dressed for winter and pale as the snow itself. They talk briefly and she tells him that they cannot be friends. Yet she comes back again the next night and again they talk. Oskar goes off to visit his father who lives in a rural area. Together they enjoy themselves and Oskar finally appears happy. When he returns he continues his encounters with the girl.Her name is Eli Lina Leandersson. She never appears except during the night time. And for good reason. Although the film only slowly explicitly reveals that she is a vampire it's implicit from the early sequences. In one early scene Eli's caretaker meticulously packs his gear then goes to a nearby park where he meets then chloroforms then blood lets a passerby. He's interrupted by a dog and its owners before he can finish the job and runs off. He finds blood for her so she must not kill herself at least as often. His failures continue though and she must quench her thirst. When her caretaker is discovered he burns himself with acid to hide his identity and keep her safe. He gives himself to her as his final act now she is on her own.Although these moments of violence are quite bloody and at times graphic they're simply a necessity of the real story the relationship between Oskar and Eli. She eventually provides him with friendship maybe even love as they agree to go steady. She implores him to stand up to the bullies which he does though it may lead him to more trouble in the end. He learns she is a vampire in time as he must but he accepts this and her and finds it in himself to help her.Let the Right One In is a very quiet and patient film. It rightly focuses on the progression of friendship between Oskar and Eli first and foremost. At its heart this is a beautiful and tender contemplation. Despite its dark undertones the film never feels sinister. It retains its sweetness right down to its graphic climax.Oskar and Eli are wonderfully drawn characters. Both young actors are emphatically true to their characters making them all the more sympathetic. The director Thomas Alfredson shoots them in muted tones from their point of view instead that of an adult. He makes sparse use of music allowing the crunching of snow the grumbling of stomachs the ambient sounds of the world instead to frame the action on screen. It's a very well made film from bottom to top.Let the Right One In is a wonderfully unique picture. The movies were made to tell stories like these. I have not read the book the film is adapted from but it certainly would expand on much of what is only hinted at here. But what is included in the film needs no expansion. This is such a wonderful film as it stands in its boldness its darkness and its touching beauty.".

This tranquility subsists throughout as you observe the evolution of one of the most interesting and provocative relationships you will ever witness in film. The subtlety and yes beauty of this truly throws you off bearings of any expectation.Then suddenly in context of genre horror explodes that both redefines and extends the vampire myth. Most importantly it scares the crap out of you.The motion between these two moods really moves your emotions in ways you have not often experienced almost never in a fright fest. Innocent sweetness. Sick pleasure in revenge. Longing remembrance of first love. Amazement at so simple special effects. An almost tear inspiring bloody kiss. Many others.It all works because of the wonderful story amazing performances from two first time actors cinematography that rivals that seen in Bergman and direction that drives this amazing sense of continuity.I recently saw this film at a festival in Sarasota FL. 28 films in seven days. I've Loved You So Long The Wrestler Waltz With Bashir Slumdog Millionaire The Class among them. This film was far and away my favorite and will end up somewhere in my favorite five for the year. I think that many film snobs like me who see this will be shocking themselves as they compile their personal end of year lists. Maybe end of year awards particular considering the expectations of a genre that seldom delivers anywhere near the beauty you witness here.Not convinced yet you MUST see this film and not the likely beyond pathetic US remake already in the works. Any film that can have you weeping at closure with the decision by an innocent yet likely sociopathic little boy running away to facilitate the life of a timelessly young lonely and vicious vampire has taken you to a place almost sacred.

Early on Eli's provider kills and hangs a man up using ropes and a tree  in very bright lights with people close by. No one would do that please. Also people are dying left and right and where are the police? And why don't these survivors notify them they know who it is yet they do nothing  not really believable. Probably the more interesting aspect of the film for me was Eli's character. I got the impression she had lived a very long life as a 12 year old with no friends  just survive to kill. Then she meets Oskar who becomes a friend and a first love  something she has never experienced and slowly trusts him enough to let him in as the title says. I felt a little pity for her but she was aloof enough to not quite understand. But then you have to wonder was she doing all of this to lure Oskar to be her next provider and make him think she cares for him? This would make her a pretty cold blooded person since she thinks nothing of heading down and killing the next unsuspecting victim without so much of a tear. To me the film was good but not great and certainly not a masterpiece. It was gloomy and very slow moving and no interesting characters outside of the children.I rate this a 610 for a little originality and the use of child actors and their relationship was done fairly well yet not too cheesy. However I found Eli's character to be somewhat shallow.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Let The Right One In";
	schema:reviewBody "The cinematic vampires I've seen to date in cinemas recently have usually been the ramped up sexy versions where it's either black leather on lithe female frames or dreamy hunks to whom teenage girls would sacrifice their necks to in order to live with their lover boy forever.While the release of Twilight had made a lot of noise in the commercial theatres last year and raking in an obscene amount of money sending fangirls into a frenzy one vampire movie has been making its rounds very successfully in the film festival circuit and the accolades garnered thus far have been nothing less than stellar. Come next week you too will know why as Let The Right One In LTROI gets its deserved commercial release here.LTROI is pared down to the very basics and that in itself is a refreshing take thanks to John Ajvide Lindqvist's story and Tomas Alfredson's assured direction both confident that there's absolutely no need for artificial spices to spruce up the film. We have the need for plasma for survival the human type and not cherry ade from animals and tomatoes. Sunlight kills immediately and fiercely not to introduce some industrial light and magic moments to glitter with sparkle dust. And their condition forces them to be in isolation because killing sprees bring unwanted attention but weakness from dawn to dusk means a caretaker is never far. Find out too what the title means as I believe it's probably a step boldly taken to define certain consequences.The emotions of their two leads were relied on heavily to bring the narrative forward in what essentially is a very quiet film until feasting time. Eli Lina Leandersson arrives in a small town with her minder Hakan Per Ragnar who provides for a number moments filled with dark humour no thanks to the unfortunate situations he finds himself stuck in while preparing meals. Their neighbour is a timid boy Oskar Kare Hedebrant who has school playground politics problems because of the constant taunting from schoolmates thus coasting through his existence imagining himself fighting back for some respect but afraid to translate his bravado for real with that knife he carries around.Children are such that with a certain degree of confidence putting twotwo together you're likely to see a friendship being struck with little or no prejudice. Coming from lonely backgrounds both strike an almost immediate friendship despite Eli being able to come out only at night and some very obvious hints of her nocturnal prowess. To Oskar Eli is his first real friend who through love gives him the courage and encouragement to face up to his demons. It's a tender love story between the two even after Oskar's discovery of the true identity of his best friend. But like best friends such are secrets between themselves and nothing in the world is going to change that.It's kinda terrifying knowing that the Oskar in a way condones the killings that Eli commits and the direction here to show that is unflinching. Given the atmospherically quiet moments it magnifies every point when the hunter snacks on its prey with the patches of warm blood staining the pale white face of a child thanks also to some nifty make up and special effects where it mattered. The noisy violence is in stark contrast to its more touching moments especially if one thinks that Hakan's life is a suggestion to what Oskar's would eventually be if he so decides to follow down the same slippery slope. The toning down of pedophilia as does Eli's sexual ambiguity allows for this thought to fester.I hate to do a comparison here between a truly great genre film and one that aspired to reach its heights but I guess since many would be familiar with Twilight allow me to indulge then why LTROI makes Twilight eat sparkle dust. For starters the latter is your typical Hollywood blockbuster treatment where everything has to be explicitly shown and in verbatim. LTROI leaves it to the greatest tool you possess  your imaginative mind and that in itself accentuates the level of horror that goes unseen and giving that all round creepy feeling to it too.Twilight had a teenage angst romance that was quite childish. LTROI shows how the innocence of love could be miles more mature with its tender moments here making Bella Swan and Edward Cullen look like adults with bored sex lives. Gone too are what I deem now as nonsensical pop and rock tunes peppering the aural track and the clever use of silence i.e. knowing when to shut up served only to highlight genuine tension and impending doom. Yes LTROI is less showy but miles more effective in its storytelling craft and technique.For a genuinely satisfying vampire movie Let The Right One In nails it and deserves being Highly Recommended.P.S. Hollywood now wants to remake this. Now that's a truly terrifying thought!".

Eli Lina Leandersson arrives in a small town with her minder Hakan Per Ragnar who provides for a number moments filled with dark humour no thanks to the unfortunate situations he finds himself stuck in while preparing meals. Their neighbour is a timid boy Oskar Kare Hedebrant who has school playground politics problems because of the constant taunting from schoolmates thus coasting through his existence imagining himself fighting back for some respect but afraid to translate his bravado for real with that knife he carries around.Children are such that with a certain degree of confidence putting twotwo together you're likely to see a friendship being struck with little or no prejudice. Coming from lonely backgrounds both strike an almost immediate friendship despite Eli being able to come out only at night and some very obvious hints of her nocturnal prowess. To Oskar Eli is his first real friend who through love gives him the courage and encouragement to face up to his demons. It's a tender love story between the two even after Oskar's discovery of the true identity of his best friend. But like best friends such are secrets between themselves and nothing in the world is going to change that.It's kinda terrifying knowing that the Oskar in a way condones the killings that Eli commits and the direction here to show that is unflinching. Given the atmospherically quiet moments it magnifies every point when the hunter snacks on its prey with the patches of warm blood staining the pale white face of a child thanks also to some nifty make up and special effects where it mattered. The noisy violence is in stark contrast to its more touching moments especially if one thinks that Hakan's life is a suggestion to what Oskar's would eventually be if he so decides to follow down the same slippery slope. The toning down of pedophilia as does Eli's sexual ambiguity allows for this thought to fester.I hate to do a comparison here between a truly great genre film and one that aspired to reach its heights but I guess since many would be familiar with Twilight allow me to indulge then why LTROI makes Twilight eat sparkle dust. For starters the latter is your typical Hollywood blockbuster treatment where everything has to be explicitly shown and in verbatim. LTROI leaves it to the greatest tool you possess  your imaginative mind and that in itself accentuates the level of horror that goes unseen and giving that all round creepy feeling to it too.Twilight had a teenage angst romance that was quite childish. LTROI shows how the innocence of love could be miles more mature with its tender moments here making Bella Swan and Edward Cullen look like adults with bored sex lives. Gone too are what I deem now as nonsensical pop and rock tunes peppering the aural track and the clever use of silence i.e. knowing when to shut up served only to highlight genuine tension and impending doom. Yes LTROI is less showy but miles more effective in its storytelling craft and technique.For a genuinely satisfying vampire movie Let The Right One In nails it and deserves being Highly Recommended.P.S. Hollywood now wants to remake this. Now that's a truly terrifying thought!";

	schema:reviewBody "Thematically rich Lt Den Rtte Komma In hits refresh on the vampire genre with an interesting outlook on character and its development. Casting is accurate although out as even with the sinister events performances are played with such convincing skill that its subtext is never overshadowed. Generally moody and calm on its almost 2 hour running time audiences will be spellbound if not disinterested.Film follows the empathetic and anemic looking Oskar Kre Hedebrant desperate for friends and also revenge on bullies who mistreat him in school. Main protagonist eventually meets with the mysteriously charismatic Eli Lina Leandersson who slowly unravels herself as a character of the dark. Events transpire that further cements an unlikely friendship of sorts leading to a very bloody finale. The film is no doubt not for the squeamish as even with the abundance of tender scenes between Oskar and Eli violence is still undeniably present which is depicted in either a repulsive or comedic light.Archaic monsters have always been an allegory towards a more imminent threat like Romania's Dracula for Eastern Europeans immigrating to Western Europe threatening the economy. In Tomas Alfredson's modern twist Eli's fangs are treated as if it were of biological origins which need a treatment that may pose morality questions. Her paternal figure becomes the film's tragic core as he emphasizes the depressing lengths he would go through to sustain Eli's thirst for blood. Although played as if he was paternal further reveals later would show his function was to foreshadow the main protagonist's future removed from this micro cosmos.Also interesting is Alfredson's play on the sexual identification of the creature. All femmes become fatales in one way or another whilst male characters turn into almost bathetic who are never snapped out of a hypnotic spell. Also seen in Almodovar's Hable Con Ella technique adds a level of sophistication to the proceedings and further enriches their characterizations.As with old Hollywood's Dracula Eli is perfectly portrayed by Lina Leandersson as she not so much carry the entire film but devours the role.

Perfectly matched with Kre Hedebrant leads instantly become characters worth caring about that even the murders that conspire become a necessity.Set in Scandinavia film reminds of 30 Days of Night as it's filmed as if it never sees the sun and is forever winter. Of course this works well with the illusion of having the main character as someone who would burst into flames if UV rays touches her skin. This among others are the film's small touches that further cement the mythology on vampires and adds some more even. Cats provide a darkly hilarious spin as the film reaches 30 minutes before the credits.Lt Den Rtte Komma In is indeed an enjoyable intimate celebration of loneliness and the things that transpire from it. Setting it with a vamp angle further uplifts the thematical significance of the film although even if they exist picture doesn't pretend to be more than it actually is.

	schema:reviewBody "Let the right one in critically acclaimed is a Swedish Indielike coming of age story with a vampire thread thrown in for good measure. During its runtime which felt like it was going for a new world record we see the excruciatingly slow developing relationship between Oscar a 12 year old bullied schoolboy and Eli a much older Vampire who very convincingly passes as a 12 year old herself.Though the premise is original which at least should entertain a shade of interest the whole movie is set up to be more of a painting than an actual film. What little plot they undertook to be screened not only got lost in the superabundance of superfluous scenes it also drowned in an overall feeling of lifelessness. I got the impression that this was intentional although it boggles the mind what they felt was so interesting about the story arc that the movie could get away with the glaring lack of suspense momentum or indeed any respect for logic.This brings me to my main complaint which is that nothing in the story really made much sense to me. People are hung from trees to capture their blood brutal killings take place in plain sight in the streets galore but I didn't get the impression anyone in the movie really cared about it. No police is informed no investigation is started. Although I can imagine why the storyteller tried to follow a different path the absurdity of it was so glaring you'd think there was some hidden point to it. But there isn't. It's just plain weird and annoyingly so. Another issue I take with the film is the actingportrayal of the unsympathetic and uninvolved characters. No one acts according to the laws of human behavior it's like watching a parody of something I'm not aware even existed. Right in the beginning of the movie we see the character Oscar mimicking the stabbing of one of his school chums. He uses a tree for inspiration and mutters the words scream scream you pig!. The way he spoke these words raised a couple of eyebrows with me and the brows didn't seem comfortable to settle back down during the course of the film. I'm sorry but no one talks or acts like that. The boy either simply can't act or was instructed to behave like an autistic buffoon with an IQ to match his shoe size while saliva continuously drools from his mouth. Most of the other dim characters in the movie fare even worse and I think it's sadistic to expose an intelligent audience to this sort of nonsense.For a full length future film this movie simply lacks plot scenario and a sense of direction. I'm still completely unsure what the filmmakers set out to create here. As a coming of age type of film nothing really was added to the vast legacy this theme already laid down for us to enjoy in numerous books and films. As a vampire movie it just lacks everything that makes those movies enjoyable to those that are into that genre namely suspense and humor?. And as a slow moving Indie movie it really lacks art. The endless showing of dimly lit streets or droplets from a tap forced down by Newtonian law while being accompanied by abstruse orchestral overtures shouldn't be a point in itself. And neither should the deliberate lack of conversation be nor its replacement long tedious shots of facial expressions that try really very hard to express nothing at all.In short this film is a dud. Like a bomb that doesn't go off it just lies in the ground after a forgotten war to harmlessly corrode away into oblivion. A seemingly endless string of mindnumbing scenes built on an almost non existing plot line where suspense is replaced by predictability and out of place absurdism. 310".

	schema:headline " Profoundly sensitive and instructive movie for those with AS and without";
	schema:reviewBody "I've needed to see this movie ever since I heard about it's existence unfortunately it was not given a proper release in the UK so I had to wait for the US DVD to come out. It's a film about a relationship between a man with Asperger's Syndrome Adam and a young woman Beth. As I have Asperger's Syndrome and I heard that this movie was well made I was understandably interested. I have tended in the past to find movies and TV shows portraying autism absurd. Fortunately this was not the case here.The level of observation here was really very good small things like how Adam doesn't look at people in the face how he becomes agitated at work over comments that his boss makes that are meant to be humorous or confidence building I am used to blank stares from my performance planner when I take things the wrong way.At one point Adam trembles behind his bedroom door when he is being asked to come out to a social event from the other side pretending he is not there. I've done that myself. He reminds me of me when I was at university. Food fads is another Adam has Macaroni Cheese every night of the week. Currently I have a chicken Kiev with raw mushrooms and yellow peppers pretty much every night of the week.Although he's very talented he only managed to get the electrical engineering job he holds via his father convincing the boss to hire him. I was never able to convince anyone that I was worth hiring even though I have a degree from Oxford. After several terrible years following university I managed to get a job in an office where the head of the office was my brotherinlaw. I can do the job well and am even being promoted getting in the door is the hard part. In the UK at least employment rates for people with Asperger's Syndrome are upsettingly low. The idea of selling oneself in an interview doesn't work and when you're up against people who will bend the truth to get ahead it's really difficult. That's another good thing the film picked up on honesty. If you're tired of guys lying to you ladies pick up an Aspie.I was personally moved a lot by the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie. There's an excellent introduction using the story of Le Petit Prince The Little Prince by SaintExupry as a metaphor. I knew at this point that it was going to be a good movie it is perhaps the most tactful and tender approach to the subject that there could be. I won't spoil the ending of the movie but from reading what other people have said it's very easy to mistake what is happening obliquely I will recommend that you concentrate on an incident concerning boxes.I'm a few years older than Adam and readier than he is but love has never come my way as there are not many Beths out there and being 6ft 7 tall and also stocky I am not exactly of the nonthreatening male physique typified by Hugh Dancy in this movie. My way of boring people to death with over detail is film and even though I know that people don't want to know I will still start telling them about the history of film starting in 1888 or if I'm feeling more loquacious starting with Muybridge. The stupidest cosmological one I do like Adam is explain how novae happen in binary systems with a red giant and white dwarf. More recently I have started telling people why Sirius flickers  People think I am trying to make them feel stupid or inferior which is absolutely not the case but I still do it even though I know this I just can't stop myself.As an autistic I felt that this movie was extremely tender but also very educational and instructive I felt almost like I was a chick being feathered off a tree limb for the first flight. Adam does not aim at staggering miseenscene it is not an Antonioni movie but it is possibly the worthiest film you can see. The worst thing about Asperger's is that there are many people who will tell you even straight to your face that it doesn't exist even a doctor I knew was pretty much of that opinion.

	onyx:emotionText "I've needed to see this movie ever since I heard about it's existence unfortunately it was not given a proper release in the UK so I had to wait for the US DVD to come out. It's a film about a relationship between a man with Asperger's Syndrome Adam and a young woman Beth. As I have Asperger's Syndrome and I heard that this movie was well made I was understandably interested. I have tended in the past to find movies and TV shows portraying autism absurd. Fortunately this was not the case here.The level of observation here was really very good small things like how Adam doesn't look at people in the face how he becomes agitated at work over comments that his boss makes that are meant to be humorous or confidence building I am used to blank stares from my performance planner when I take things the wrong way.At one point Adam trembles behind his bedroom door when he is being asked to come out to a social event from the other side pretending he is not there. I've done that myself. He reminds me of me when I was at university. Food fads is another Adam has Macaroni Cheese every night of the week. Currently I have a chicken Kiev with raw mushrooms and yellow peppers pretty much every night of the week.Although he's very talented he only managed to get the electrical engineering job he holds via his father convincing the boss to hire him. I was never able to convince anyone that I was worth hiring even though I have a degree from Oxford. After several terrible years following university I managed to get a job in an office where the head of the office was my brotherinlaw. I can do the job well and am even being promoted getting in the door is the hard part. In the UK at least employment rates for people with Asperger's Syndrome are upsettingly low. The idea of selling oneself in an interview doesn't work and when you're up against people who will bend the truth to get ahead it's really difficult. That's another good thing the film picked up on honesty. If you're tired of guys lying to you ladies pick up an Aspie.I was personally moved a lot by the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie. There's an excellent introduction using the story of Le Petit Prince The Little Prince by SaintExupry as a metaphor. I knew at this point that it was going to be a good movie it is perhaps the most tactful and tender approach to the subject that there could be. I won't spoil the ending of the movie but from reading what other people have said it's very easy to mistake what is happening obliquely I will recommend that you concentrate on an incident concerning boxes.I'm a few years older than Adam and readier than he is but love has never come my way as there are not many Beths out there and being 6ft 7 tall and also stocky I am not exactly of the nonthreatening male physique typified by Hugh Dancy in this movie. My way of boring people to death with over detail is film and even though I know that people don't want to know I will still start telling them about the history of film starting in 1888 or if I'm feeling more loquacious starting with Muybridge. The stupidest cosmological one I do like Adam is explain how novae happen in binary systems with a red giant and white dwarf. More recently I have started telling people why Sirius flickers  People think I am trying to make them feel stupid or inferior which is absolutely not the case but I still do it even though I know this I just can't stop myself.As an autistic I felt that this movie was extremely tender but also very educational and instructive I felt almost like I was a chick being feathered off a tree limb for the first flight. Adam does not aim at staggering miseenscene it is not an Antonioni movie but it is possibly the worthiest film you can see. The worst thing about Asperger's is that there are many people who will tell you even straight to your face that it doesn't exist even a doctor I knew was pretty much of that opinion. People associate mental disability with physical impairment and because there is none with Asperger's except sometimes clumsiness or gangliness for a lot of people it just doesn't register even though there are defined and recognisable developmental symptoms.

I was pleasantly surprised upon viewing this as it really hit home in many ways. I often found myself saying this reminds me of me when watching Adam live his life from day to day though we are very dissimilar in that I would never have a tantrum in front of a girl. Finally this is quite possibly the most down to earth movie of its kind as there is nothing that happens in it that cannot or is overly unlikely to happen in real life.

It is what makes indie films such a treasure ... a small little personal story that packs a wallop.Many will remember Hugh Dancy from King Arthur and Jane Austen Book Club. In both he was eye candy for the girls. Here he stretches his acting chops as Adam who lives with Asperger's Syndrome. At first he just strikes us as a guy with no real social skills. It's not until he meets his new neighbor Rose Byrne that we begin to understand why he's just not quite right.Watching their relationship grown in a believable way is a tribute to both actors and a very solid script. A few subplots are juggled death of a parent living alone loss of a job etc but the key to the film is the relationship and how it keys in our need to connect.This is the type of film I wish more people would get a chance to see. It has so much more to offer than the overhyped Hollywood junk that gets forced down our throats at the local megaplex. Adam won't crack the 200 million gross but Adam will have an impact on you and create some interesting afterfilm discussion. Isn't that the real fun of movies anyway?".

	schema:reviewBody "Right from the getgo I knew that Adam was going to be an enjoyable smartly told tale of love despite humanity's predilection for preconceptions. Just the fact that the film was about a young man with Asperger Syndrome who meets a young girl across the hall of his apartment complex tells you that this won't be your runofthemill romcom. You have to believe that filmmaker Max Mayer will treat the material with compassion and intelligence this is not a laughoutloud vehicle to use a serious disorder as fodder for chuckles. Any trepidation I may have had was gone after about five minutes just the amount of time it took to introduce me to our titular character a span that teaches us so much. A 29yearold man who has lived with his father in NYC his entire life has just lost the one person who understood him and helped him survive. The vacant stare and inability to show emotion at the funeral is interspersed with the methodical routines of his day. We see the chore sheet for which he must cross off his late duty partner we see the carefully hung clothing the boxes of cereal and macaroni and cheese and we slowly watch it all dwindle away as life alone is just too much to handle so soon. I knew then that the rest of the way would never speak down to me or turn the drama into farce.One always worries about an actor taking on the task of a mentally disabled role. Sometimes it works Rain Man and sometimes it fails miserably I Am Sam  maybe Kirk Lazarus was right you never go full retard. But I digress Hugh Dancy is one of the brightest actors working today in my opinion and he knocks this one out of the park. There are moments that linger on his face as his brain works through what has just happened slowly coming to the realization of what it all means. The expressions are pitch perfect and his portrayal never appears as caricature. With sharp transitions to voracious anger from meek sweetness the turbulence caught inside of him shows through in those moments that he cannot control himself. As Dancy's Adam states in a somewhat clunky explanation of the disorder his condition makes it difficult for him to lie. That mechanism we all possessand loveto tell the odd white lie and appease those in our company rather than rile them up is absent from him. He speaks the truth and in return expects the truth back. Understanding this concept can be tough as a lie is a lie even if the intentions were pure the difference can't be seen.His explosions never escalate to violence towards anyone but himself although the scene can be scary. More a tantrum than anything else the emotions inside him are released without control. Words are spoken in a very pragmatic and objective way something that could be misunderstood or not they are his true feelings at the moment after all. spoilers begin Because of this I saw the ending as profound due to the duality in Adam's response to Beth's question on why he wanted her to go with him to California. It starts out as though he will win her heartby a truth so sweet and romanticwith the words that title this review but then it all goes sour. His brain sees the question as one that has a correct answer and that answer is that he needs her to survive. He needs a normal person to help him in the day to day routine to be his sort of translator to the world. The hard part to witnessing his response is the not knowing what he means by it. Is a person with Aspergers unable to love? Is love to them safety and companionship? Or was his answer his brain's way of saying that she completes him? That she is his world? Love is such an abstract concept that whether he feels it or not he could never truly express it in words. And that is the true tragedy of life. spoilers end Much like another slightly offkilter romantic comedy this summer 500 Days of Summer the ending may be a happy one just not quite the anticipated happily ever after Hollywood has ingrained in our heads. Adam takes all the conventions of the genre and utilizes them to fit the story not the other way around. The film takes what it needs to be palatable to a broad audience but never forgets the agenda at its core. For all the quirks and idiosyncrasies involved they aren't there to be fresh or cool they are present because the lead character has them. More than a romance Adam is about a broken man finding his way in life. A lifetime codependent realizing that there is a world out there he can become a part of if he has the strength to work at it and try. Beth is the catalyst for his awakening and he hers too. She finds out that there are people out there who are innocent and sweet that humanity isn't complete rubbish. Sometimes we meet the person for which we will spend the rest of our lives with in bliss and other times first we must meet someone to remind us that the happily ever after is still possible.".

Byrne is amazing. Having never heard of Asperger's syndrome before I walked in with no knowledge of it. The film handled it very well. That's all I can say. It left me with a new interest for Asperger's. The film had its quirks smiles screams laughs and tears but the final product of Adam is definitely something to be admired.

Other people might have used a broader brush but Mayer's narrative develops a simple momentum and a believable conclusion. Mayer avoids deliberate gags or gagreflex resolution and creates a film that is tender and very pretty. Adding to Adam's appeal was the astronomy motif with its layers of stars planets and pulsars. I thought the metaphor linking the the universe's creation to the distance that separates objects in space was particularly resonant and I encourage people to pay attention to shooting stars.".

	schema:headline " Good movie referencing the topic of Aspergers";
	schema:reviewBody "Having a soninlaw that has Aspergers symptoms I found the movie to be quite realistic in a nonHollywood way. It didn't stoop to many of the clichs that several movies trying to tackle this subject fell into. The lead actor did a great job portraying the attitude and personality of someone with Aspergers. His portrayal was quite well done and accurate to real life situations He obviously did his homework when researching the character and the side effects of Aspergers syndrome.Unfortunately I found the lead female character and the script components related to this character to be less than believable. My personal opinion is that people with Aspergers syndrome tend to have a lack of empathy for other people as portrayed in this movie so it requires someone with extra empathy and forgiveness to be able to understand and relate to them unless of course the partner has Aspergers themselves which helps them understand and relate to the other person.She didn't portray herself as an overly empathetic person especially when dealing with her father's problems. Most children would be empathetic to their own parents first and foremost. She seemed to be forgiving of the lead characters flaws but didn't really show a lot of emotion during the tense situations and unusual circumstances that cropped up.Other than that I thought it was a very good movie touching on this subject. If it weren't for the weak script and the issues with the lead female characterization I would have given it a 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been meaning to watch Adam for quite some time now and the film matched my expectations. The good thing about small independent films is that the stories are usually very personal and rich. That's the case with Adam a film with substance and meaning. The film begins with the 29 year old Adam attending his father funeral and then returning to a lonely empty house. Beth a writer damaged from a past relationship moves into the building where Adam lives and soon they meet. Adam is handsome but he's also odd and awkward. He suffers from Asperger syndrome an autism spectrum disorder that causes difficulties in social interaction along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Despite this Adam is very bright and Beth takes an interest in him. This leads to a relationship but is it right? Are they fit for each other?... Adam is not so much a romantic comedy but more of a character study as it shows Adam and Beth learning and growing from each other and stepping into unfamiliar territory. Hugh Dancy is tremendous as the lead character Adam and his portrayal never appears as a caricature. Instead he relies on small gestures and certain facial expressions which results in a very moving and impressive performance. Rose Byrne was very good as Beth as well although I wish her character had been better written. I say this because sometimes she is extremely sensitive to Adam's condition but on a few occasions she almost seems to forget about it. Peter Gallagher Rose Byrne and Amy Irving compose the supporting cast with Gallagher doing a terrific job as usual as Beth's father. Adam doesn't have the clichd happy ending so usual in Hollywood instead it presents us with an authentic and realistic conclusion that felt very satisfying. Adam is a breath of fresh air it's a genuine film with a very moving and well written story.810".

	schema:headline " Heartwarming with a dry sense of humour always steeped in refrained melancholy";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere above the clear skies of a disquieted New York skyline some hundreds of billions of miles away there are stars and galaxies clusters of light and unknowable beauty speeding away not only from us but from themselves. Eventually it will get to the point where all is inevitably lost and the skies will be filled with an overwhelming black nothingness and desolate loneliness for a heaven and a barren sunscorched planet for a home. That's kind of sad says one character. Sad? repeats the nonplussed hobbyistcosmologist before turning off his homebrew planetarium. Somewhere within one of these small gatherings of light lies New York itself and in its central park dwell two harmless furry creatures known as Racoons. In the middle of a giant city these little guys don't necessarily belong but they just happen to be there anywaycoming out at night and playing in their own peaceful isolation when the city closes one eye for the night. This somewhat romantic dualism of being torn apart from where you should be and ending up in world quite different from where you naturally belong is the glue that binds pages of Adam's story together. Brought into melancholic focus through characters relationships the nuances of ordinary life and a vast array of simplistic but nevertheless heartwarming sentiments through photography and music Adam is a humbled and interesting take on love seen through the eyes of a fellow wholike those racoonsisn't quite where he ought to be.A gifted an ostensibly neurotic figure Adam Hugh Dancy is a smart intelligent and insightful guynextdoor type who daytospotlesslyrepetitiveday tries to overcome his disability in order to fit in with those he shares his citylife with. As is found out late into the first act of the feature Adam is affected by Asperger's syndrome a condition which often means that he cannot by any means tell what other people are thinking simply by reading their faces body language or figurative words. Instead Adam relies on honesty and literal meaning without this he is lost and to many this in turn makes him out to be a nave childlike inconvenience. All this comes into play most dramatically however when a new neighbour Beth Rose Byrne moves in above Adam's apartment. Unable to quite go about his attraction to Beth in conventional manners at one point directly asking if she was sexually excited because I was. romantic life it seems isn't about to blow any sympathy points in Adam's direction. After a series of quirky encounters involving Adam's love for space and a particularly intense sequence where he avoids going out with Beth out of fear the relationship takes its turns and develops slowly but surely into an engaging piece of alternative romance. The result is an interesting look into a convoluted form of love from a different perspective that questions the sometimes trivial dos and don'ts of adult relationships when brought to Adam's plate. In a way the movie echoes recent features such as The Science of Sleep by Michel Gondry and last year's Lars and the Real Girl in that it pushes the disability of its lead character to be the central point of its narrative rather than fleeting romance. Sure enough Adam is by no means a sainthe's simply different and Mayer does well to always restate Adam's humanity despite his disability this is no mawkish weepy or oversentimental caricature painting. Like those features mentioned above however Adam hits the proverbial nail on the head when it comes to dishing out moments of pathos anyway there's lighthearted whimsy comedy here genuine welldeveloped characterisation and romance with drama that feels slightly romanticised but not at the extent of its characters and themes. Indeed it's not hard to imagine audiences being more than slightly moved by Adam and Beth's somewhat troubled circumstances and this is much to the film's credit in that it plays as a characterpiece but feels like a traditional romantic drama without sacrificing the former's traits. Of course with a feature such as this it would be easy to pile on the sentiment too heavily resulting in a mawkish and tawdry handkerchieffest steeped in melodrama but thankfully this is not the case. Instead Adam is cemented in place with an extremely engaging performance by leading man Hugh Dancy offset with a warm feminine portrayal by Byrne. The chemistry between the two is as palpable as director Mayer obviously intended which is kind of refrained in between the backandforth nature of Adam and Beth's perceptions of each other. So while not falling for the traditional formaliac techniques of your average romance Meyer nevertheless crafts something genuine and real for his characters. At times their romance is sweet and whimsical at others frantic and awkwardsuch is one of Adam's biggest strengths. This of course will disgruntle some audiences upon which the story's conclusion should bear no redeeming fruit but for those looking for something a little different there nevertheless remains a certain bittersweet sense of integrity about the story that remains consistent right through to the end. It's by no means a perfect tale no but for what it's worth there's undoubtedly a whole lot of interesting qualities to Adam's plight here that take on a life of their own in the truest sense of the phrase. Heartwarming with a dry sense of humour always steeped in refrained melancholy Adam is an impressive and oft moving tale brought to life with memorable performances and a bittersweet account of love and its entwined complexities.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

Whether or not this love works out is not the issue it's what Adam learns along the way about life that I feel is beautiful.The portrayal of Rose's father is so important to the film in my opinion. We find this so called normal person who epitomizes those who are still in fear of a person with mental illness. Buchwald only sees the outside of a person and doesn't really give Adam a chance to show his inner self talents and strengths. How ironic it is that Mr. Buchwald turns out to be the true mentally ill person in the film! Unfortunately many people in our society still have similar beliefs about those who are different. By educating people about those who are challenged hopefully the stigma of mental illness can be lifted.This film made me laugh made me cry and made me think! As far as I am concerned when a movie has those characteristics it has been a huge success. I don't know any movie that has moved me like this in a long long time!".

	schema:reviewBody "As the mother of a bright beautiful winsome young lady who has been living with ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome all her life constantly astounding skeptics with her continuing scholastic and social success I can assure you that ADAM really captures what life is like for adult Aspies living on their own and the people who love them. Written and directed with humor and cleareyed compassion by Max Mayer and engagingly acted by a wonderful cast this lowkey romantic dramedy made me laugh and cry for all the right nonmanipulative reasons. Actors playing people with Asperger's or other developmental or physical issues all too often come across as showy and actory but Hugh Dancy's sensitive performance in the title role avoids all that watching him I felt like I knew him as well as I know my daughter.I could also identify with Rose Byrne as Beth the neighbor who comes to know love and understand Adam  which is not to say it's all hearts and flowers from then on especially since Beth has her own unrelated issues. Mayer clearly did his homework keeping it real by avoiding Hollywoodtype nonsense. For example I found it refreshing that while Adam made progress over the course of the film his love for Beth didn't magically cure him of Asperger's or any such clichd foolishness. The way things turn out in their relationship is bittersweet yet uplifting satisfying and believable. Having said that about Hollywood nonsense as a native New Yorker I must say that in the scenes showing the couple's nighttime stargazing trips to Central Park Adam is an engineer with a passion for astronomy I halfexpected them to be mugged any minute!  Fun Fact Although Dancy and Byrne both play native New Yorkers Dancy is British and Byrne is Australian. I thought they shed their accents quite convincingly. I loved ADAM and I highly recommend that everyone see it but I think Aspies and their loved ones will especially appreciate this fine little film's ring of truth.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an adult with Aspergers the movie was almost painful to watch in its reality. The scene where he doesn't go out with Beth and her friends. When he asks her if she wants sex we are so used to misreading other people's nonverbal communication that you get in the habit of asking about those kind of things. His literal honesty with Beth. What losing his father and his job does to him. How unexpected change just blows his world apart. A very accurate picture of how we live and how things affect us differently than the normal population.My wife was sad when Adam and Beth broke up when he went out to California. My response was They ended up back together. The reason Adam said he HAD to go out to California by himself was because he had to show Beth that he COULD make it without her he just didn't WANT to. That was something that he didn't know how to verbalize. And if she truly understood him she would then realize that and come out to California.When people ask me what Asperger's is like all I do is tell them to watch this movie.".

	schema:headline " Wowthis is a GREAT film!";
	schema:reviewBody "A long time ago I was a social worker and then a family therapist. Later I taught psychology. During the course of this I worked with a few folks with Autism spectrum disordersincluding Asperger's Syndrome. Now I am NOT an expert but know enough by teaching about it knowing folks with it including a few of my students and reading up on it to know whether or not a film that deals with this topic gets it right or wrong. It was because of this background I was excited to watch Adamto see if I finally found a film that got it right. This is because although a lot of folks on the internet talk about this disorder and many claim to have itthough in most cases this seems to be done to excuse boorish behavior but few folks REALLY understand what it is. I sure wish I'd had this film available to me when I was teachingit sure would have provided a nice example for my students.I won't spend a lot of time discussing what Asperger's isthough it would make sense to briefly explain it. People with Asperger's are generally quite normal. However they are socially inepthaving great difficulty picking up on normal social cues understanding polite conversation and relating to people in a healthy manner. It's as if they are socially retardedgenerally unable to understand nuances metaphors or things such as sarcasm or inferences. But on the other hand intellectually aside from the social aspects they are very normal and even sometimes brilliant. They are also incredibly literal in their thinking and speech. For someone to build a relationship with an individual like this is possible...though it certainly poses challenges.Adam Hugh Dancy is a nice young man who lives alone and works with computers and loves astronomy. He happens to strike up a conversation with his neighbor Beth Rose Byrne and slowly they become friends. But early on it's obvious to Beth that there is something wrong with Adam. When he tells her he was diagnosed with Asperger's she learns more about himsuch as how to interact with him as well as his social shortcomings. And despite this problem she learns to love him and viceversa. The movie then unfoldsand addresses the unspoken salient pointis loving a person enough when you're in a relationship? The writerdirector of this film is Max Mayer. It's obvious that Max either knows someone with the diagnosis or he really really did his homework. The film very accurately portrays someone with these life challengesand Hugh Dancy was amazing in the filmsimply amazing. I also really really appreciated how the movie did NOT simply give way to sentiment or stuff itself with clichs film formula or false nobility. Realism and integrity of the characters is what made this film really work for me.If you do see this exceptional film and I strongly recommend you do a couple things I noticed that you may also like are Dancy's amazing performance which includes no trace of his British accent as well as Byrne's Aussie accent as well as the cute scene with Beth reading to her young students. The way the little kids talked about The Emperor's New Clothesand how some just didn't get it at allwas very realistic. Apparently Mayer also really understands kids and child development! What a great filmand one of the few movies where I have NOTHING negative to say about it!I loved how Dancy said in the making of for this film He's not just a syndrome...he's a guy..... THAT is what makes this film so special.".

	schema:headline " Moving impressive and a superb performance";
	schema:reviewBody "Dancy doesn't miss a step with a performance that brings forth the difficulties and tribulations of living with autism being unable to interact with others normally feeling frustrated angry sad and misunderstood or worse not being able to understand why one can't truly become part of the other world and seeing yourself through the fearful and curious eyes of others who don't get you.In the midst of this crisis there is the seed of a love relationship between two people who have suffered through difficult interactions with others. Dancy as Adam and Byrne as Beth couldn't be more perfect for each other if they weren't so different. At one point one couldn't agree anymore with her father as he tells her that he couldn't ever be anything but a child or just wonder whether she is mature enough to deal with his complex nature.There are two stories in Adam one where a daughter discovers the truth in her family and herself and another where a young man tries to break out of a shell or at least emerge from it in order to survive. Adam is a fighter and we rarely doubt he won't make it but it will be an arduous journey because his limitations are huge and the process of adaptation much more difficult than it is for most us.Beautifully written the story follows Adam and Beth as they learn to understand each other grow together and eventually must make a life decision. Simultaneously Beth's family shows up with their own set of problems and these will have a direct effect on the fragile union of the two young people. Gallagher and Irving do excellent supportive work as another apparently mismatched couple who somehow has made it through some rough patches. Their own story foreshadows the resolution of the problems Beth and Adam face.In order to succeed the film needs a great performance and Dancy delivers just that a technical flawless turn that manages to impress us as he shows every reaction every tick every moment of fear and hesitation that somehow is not fully understood by the man himself but it is there and it's unmistakable what is most impressive is that his performance is profoundly emotive giving us the opportunity to relate to his own fears much in the way than previous performances showing autism haven't quite been able to convey. We've seen some actors who appear to mimic a moment in the life of an autistic man or woman but rarely we have been able to see the cries of a soul who yearns to belong to connect to communicate with his beloved one and tell them that they love them because somehow that sort of language is unavailable.Hugh Dancy does marvelous work and should be recognized and rewarded for it is his time on the screen that gives us the chance to learn more about the situations and emotions of others in this world. It is hard to go through this world when we are supposedly normal. Imagine what is like trying to survive when a emotional link won't allow you to express or receive emotions that we take for granted. Adam is a much welcome entry in this year's best movies.".

She knew what she was getting into from the beginning when she asked her friend about the illness then picked up that book and read all about it yet she still continued on as if everything he did was a surprise. Even he explained the illness to her. The end of the movie proved just how selfish she was. This movie was very frustrating and honestly I just wanted to kick her! What ever happened to the good old days of boy meets girl boy gets girl boy girl live happily ever after? Overall the movie had some wonderful and emotional scenes. Acting was superb writing was outstanding and the interpretation of Aspergers was dead on. Very good movie but yes very frustrating at times but then again I am a parent of a blind Aspergers child so I am a bit sensitive to the storyline.".

Very gradually Adam and Rose connect the development of this love relationship is one of the most sensitive and uniquely satisfying on film and Rose learns to appreciate Adam's worth and begins to see a relationship developing despite the warnings of her parents Peter Gallagher and Amy Irving. But when Rose's father is exposed in a scandal and must face prison Rose's need for stability and for caring for her mother supersedes her need for Adam. Adam loses his job and is offered work in California work that directly involves space exploration topics!

	schema:headline " Terrible movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Adam is part of an unfortunate trend I'm starting to notice from Hollywood  the trend of the unhappy ending. It is one of those failed romance movies. A movie about a romance that ultimately leaves us all alone. It tries miserably to buy us off at the end with the exgirlfriend sending the exboyfriend a book for a present which he sits and reads all alone on a park bench with all indications being that he will live and dies all alone too because some bad writing in a couple of crucial scenes all but destroyed what will probably be the single chance at companionship this unattractively quirky guy gets in his entire life.The movie makes a passing remark about how many people with asperger's DO get married and have their happily ever after. Why in god's name didn't they make a movie about one of THOSE couples? I normally try to avoid rubbish like this but due to some misleading advertising I was under the impression it gave asperger's a chance to show off it's interesting characteristic and to receive a little love from the universe.

Both these things were huge mistakes. The movie sets you up only to knock you down. It warms your heart only so you don't see the sucker punch waiting for it.I'd like to make a plea not just to the makers of this movie but to all of Hollywood. We don't need you to make us miserable break our hearts and tear down our hopes. That's what real life is for. We come to you for happiness and comfort. We come to you to inspire us to help us believe that good things can come true  that we can overcome our obstacles and find what it is we're looking for and have it to keep for the rest of our lives.We don't need you to tell us that the universe severely punishes the weird for being weird. We don't need you to tell us that the losers are gonna lose. Most of us know all that. And most of us want to be able to believe in a better world. Please give us that much. You get our 15 for the tickets either way.".

	onyx:emotionText "Adam is part of an unfortunate trend I'm starting to notice from Hollywood  the trend of the unhappy ending. It is one of those failed romance movies. A movie about a romance that ultimately leaves us all alone. It tries miserably to buy us off at the end with the exgirlfriend sending the exboyfriend a book for a present which he sits and reads all alone on a park bench with all indications being that he will live and dies all alone too because some bad writing in a couple of crucial scenes all but destroyed what will probably be the single chance at companionship this unattractively quirky guy gets in his entire life.The movie makes a passing remark about how many people with asperger's DO get married and have their happily ever after. Why in god's name didn't they make a movie about one of THOSE couples? I normally try to avoid rubbish like this but due to some misleading advertising I was under the impression it gave asperger's a chance to show off it's interesting characteristic and to receive a little love from the universe.

	schema:reviewBody "Among many other things especially a romcom Adam is first and foremost a comingofage movie with a twist rather than biological age it is mentalpsychological age.The main plot line is simple a cheerful and outgoing girl Beth Rose Byrne moving out from an affluent suburban home to work in Manhattan meets a neighbour a sweet but somewhat strange young man Adam Hugh Dancy that was later discovered to have Aspergers a sort of autistic disorder within a broad spectrum of its definition. Romance ensues. There are subplots her family problems his work problems etc that augment the development of the story but their relationship is the main focus.The reason I describe this movie as comingofage while the protagonist is already a fullgrown adult hinges on the symptoms of Aspergers. At the start Adam doesn't come across as someone with a mental disorder although the way he speaks is a little eccentric. We gradually find out more culminating in Adam explaining his conditions to Beth he is fully aware of his own problem. Very crudely simplified the way his brain works creates an obstacle in his ability to communicate with people. Outwardly he is shy and socially inapt. More technically he can only interpret messages in concrete terms. A pun is lost to him. So are subtle emotions. When he meets strangers his security blanket is to incessantly rattle away with facts and figures totally oblivious to the recipient's feeling which is obviously usually boredom. In compensation he is kind considerate has a sweet smile when he remembers to can occasionally make simple jokes and work hard to improve himself e.g. preparation for job interviews. The fact that Beth can fall in love with him is entirely believable and the chemistry between the two actors makes it even more convincing.But there is still a child in the corner of Adam's mind. The start of the movie shows the funeral of Adam's father with whom he has always been living. While on the surface life seems to carry on as normal and there is a good friend of his father's that helps watching over him in major affairs such as the very modest estate Adam is not a completely independent adult. When Beth comes along while their relationship is primarily an endearing romance she also becomes in a way his security blanket emotionally and practically both. Things come to a head when another of his weak spots is hit  his vehement detestation for a lie regardless of how wellmeaning it is. In response to his abrupt emotional outburst she yells back F.. Aspergers you're a f.. child!. While I wouldn't go into details suffices to say that while slightly unpredictable the movie closes with an upbeat open ending that is optimistic about Adam's mental coming of age process and the relationship between these two young people.Hugh Dancy dashing and gallant as Galahad in King Arthur 2004 and absolutely adorable as the only male member of Jane Austin Book Club 2007 has made good use of the opportunity in this movie to tackle a very challenging role nailing the character with precision. Rose Byrne after an assortment of minimumtosupporting roles and then an unmemorable lead in Knowing 2009 opposite Nicholas Cage establishes herself in this movie as a female lead that movie makers should seek after. Hope to see more of both of them.The storytelling is smooth flowing and relaxingly paced with occasional uses of montages e.g. the parallel running of the trial scene of Beth's father and Adam's preparation for a job interview. The thoughtful photography gives Manhattan particularly Central Park a welcomed laidback look. Adam can be watched as a highquality romcom but has even more to offer.".

	schema:reviewBody "You won't find traditional romantic comedies at Sundance. But quirky romantic comedies were in this year. And how much quirkier can you get than Adam where the male lead Hugh Dancy has Asperger's Syndrome like a mild highfunctional form of autism and the female lead Rose Byrne is a hot and seemingly normal babe? And that's the movieAdam is very nice but extremely weird socially awkward prone to erratic behavior and a societal misfit and Beth is everything you'd want in a woman.This should provide a ray of hope for all the geeky guys fantasizing about a beautiful charming and goodhearted woman falling in love with them one day. I can hear it now If Beth can fall for Adam then why not me? After all he has Asperger's and all I've got is this little hygiene problem plus my tworoom Star Wars collection. The movie opens with the death of Adam's father. We follow him to work where he is writing microchip software for toys and fixated on creating interesting functionality while his boss simply wants to cut costs. He stays in the apartment he had shared with his dad eating the same meals every day sitting in the same chair and following his established routines until Rose moves into the building. Adam falls in love in his obsessive way. Rose is attracted to Adam but naturally wary. And things proceed from there as they work out their relationship while enduring painfully awkward physical contacts and even more pain and awkwardness meeting the friends and parents and ultimately  well you've got to see the film. But for my money the ending was the best part.Adam is a cute mildly entertaining movie with laughs and smiles despite a less than polished script. Both Dancy and Byrne give fine performances and veteran actors Peter Gallagher and Amy Irving are quite good as Beth's parents. Written and directed by Max Mayer it was picked up at Sundance by Fox Searchlight and will likely be released in 2009.".

At 65 director Hawks was still in top form and the risks he took paid off...HATARI! despite it's length is never boring!The story focuses on a season with a team of professional huntertrappers capturing animals for zoos and circuses. With a breathtaking opening scene of a rhino chase costing them the use of veteran driver 'Indian' legendary actor Bruce Cabot the 'family' dynamic is quickly established with rugged Sean Mercer Wayne both boss and fatherfigure to the group. As he and the rest of the 'family' Red Buttons Hardy Krger Valentin de Vargas and Michle Girardon meet 'Indian's' replacement 'Chips' Grard Blain Mercer has an even bigger headache to deal with beautiful photographer Anna Maria 'Dallas' D'Allesandro Elsa Martinelli has arrived to shoot a magazine spread. A 'traditional' Hawks leading lady 'Dallas' is feisty sultry and attracted to Mercer and the older man uncomfortable with the ease by which she fits into the group as well as his own stirrings tries to make it clear that romance has no place on his agenda in much the same manner as he did with Angie Dickinson in RIO BRAVO...and with the same results.While some elements of the story are dated and politically incorrect shooting a baby African elephant even as a 'mercy killing' would be a major offense today as it is an endangered species the combination of spectacular 'hunt' sequences and the warmth and easy camaraderie of the cast in the subplots make HATARI! a rich rewarding experience.A major plus for the film is a very atypical Henry Mancini score combining tense Africaninfluenced themes for the chases and the very funny 'Elephant Walk' to punctuate 'Dallas's' relationship with her adopted pachyderm 'children'. The baby elephant scenes are film highlights as is the rocket capture of a tree filled with monkeys and both rhino chases which clearly shows Wayne in some real danger!From the opening rhino sequence to the closing 'Honeymoon' scene HATARI! is a grand entertainment and escapism at it's best!".

Although I see 95 positive the ones that dislike the movie because of the romance between Dallas and John are particularly distasteful.They point out an age discrepancy and call John Grandpa Wayne good grief! John Wayne was 59 yrs old at the making of this movie and the actress that played Dallas was 27. In real life those kind of romances happen all the time why would anyone be surprised when they happen in fiction?The animal scenes are exquisite. I doubt there will ever be a movie like this made again. This is how animals get into the zoos they just don't walk in there and say sign me up!I like everything about this movie it is a diversification for Wayne who was already maybe the most diverse actor in Hollywood history. consider The Conquerer vs. The Quiet man. It has love comedy drama and animals!Plus all the actors in the movie were given great character depth. I am sure many people have heard of the baby elephant walk but did not know it came from this movie.Its such a fun movie I have to give it a 10 because there is no way to make it any better. What a great achievement of direction producing and animal filming!".

John Wayne was 59 yrs old at the making of this movie and the actress that played Dallas was 27. In real life those kind of romances happen all the time why would anyone be surprised when they happen in fiction?The animal scenes are exquisite. I doubt there will ever be a movie like this made again. This is how animals get into the zoos they just don't walk in there and say sign me up!I like everything about this movie it is a diversification for Wayne who was already maybe the most diverse actor in Hollywood history. consider The Conquerer vs. The Quiet man. It has love comedy drama and animals!Plus all the actors in the movie were given great character depth. I am sure many people have heard of the baby elephant walk but did not know it came from this movie.Its such a fun movie I have to give it a 10 because there is no way to make it any better. What a great achievement of direction producing and animal filming!";

Red Buttons brings the humor John Wayne the adventure and Else Martinelli the romance. All you need is the pop corn. The kids will get a big kick out of this movie as I did growing up. Many funny scenes in this movie. We have rockets going off monkeys being trapped and a rhino that just wont give up. And don't forget the two baby elephants running thru the streets.And yes there is plenty of action for the adults too. This picture was made in Africa and has beautiful cinematography. And the actors preformed their on stunts in this movie. John Wayne can not only rope a horse but a rhino too. I don't want to give the movie away if you haven't seen it. The movie is about three hours long but it will fly bye. It is a fast pace movie. And by the way Hatari means danger in Swahili.".

It contains Hawks' usual issues as a community decided to build their aim on a dangerous territory  friendship  conflict and attraction between men and women importance of the group and comradeship among people and ample shots over prairies and African savanna . Though John Wayne acted his part in about a thousand ways for Hawks over decades  and he could not be more exciting as intrepid hunter . Impressive chase scenes through its riveting footage of the real capture of wildlife in that the risk of the hunt are stunningly evoked . This Howard Hawks's adventurecomedy is mainly the same loosely plotted story Hawks made over and over again for years . As this could easily be seen as Only Angels have wings transferred from the Andes to the African savanna. Furthermore  ordinary improvisation  and freescreenplay for that reason many scenes were spontaneously realized by Hawks who was continuously telephonying to screenwriter Leight Bracket to America . It only Hawks had been able to do as he wished and stars Clark Gable and John Wayne  but the King passed away and stood Wayne at his best . Colorful cinematography by Russell Harlan who won Academy Award nomination with dangerous shooting in which animals destroyed three cameras .

Marvelous score by Henry Mancini with notable and popular themes as  Baby elephant walk and song titled Just for tonight by Carmichael and Johnny Mercer .

It's great to see those these folks rousting beasts during the day dancing around the piano while they hold a martini in one hand and a beautiful girl wrapped around the other. The Henry Mancini music is a pleasure to listen to. Just try to obtain a rare CD of the Hatari soundtrack. The humor in the movie is largely supplied by an adorable Red Buttons playing a former New York cabbie who currently acts as manic truck driver for John Wayne on his daily quest to capture animals. And why is Buttons now driving in Africa? His explanation is that the animals are like New York drivers so he feels right at home. So run don't walk to your nearest video rental joint. Rent this baby and spend the next few hours laughing with a movie from a different time and world view.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw Hatari was on a Boy Scout excursion to New York City during it's original release year of 1962. I had no idea at the time who John Wayne was let alone any of the supporting players in the movie but I did like wild animals. What young kid doesn't? Since then of course the Duke has moved on to that big rodeo in the sky as his legacy survives in the many fine Westerns and war films in which he appeared. Hatari in some ways might be considered an African Western replete with sidekicks drinking and pretty women with a fair share of action adventure as the Hatari gang captures wild game for America's zoos. As such the film doesn't have a whole lot of story line going for it it's more of a series of vignettes of Wayne's character Sean Mercer rallying his men on to collect giraffe zebra leopard buffalo rhino and a proverbial barrel of monkeys. Though in this case it's a tree full of monkeys thanks in large part to a clever design masterminded by Pockets Red Buttons complete with a red and white silver rocket and a huge fish net. The fact that it worked makes it worth the price of admission alone.In between the animal chases director Howard Hawks sprinkles his movie with comic interludes like the goat milking scene the ostrich roundup and the kissing demonstration that the pretty photographer Dallas Elsa Martinelli plants on Wayne. Of course Red Buttons has his share of comic moments as well though at times his timing seems forced especially when he nags his partners to retell their versions of the monkey capture.I must say my admiration for the film's players rose a considerable notch when I learned that they did all their own work in capturing the large game. The rhino scene in particular left me wondering how the animal didn't severely injure itself much less the occupants of the jeep chasing him down.Some dozen years following the film's release I had the pleasure of going on a photographic safari of my own to East Africa. The locales mentioned in the movie such as Arusha and Manyara were on my itinerary though by that time Tanganyika no longer existed having merged with Zanzibar to form the new country of Tanzania. Along with wild game locations in neighboring Kenya that trip remains the highlight of my travel abroad.As others have noted in their postings I would highly recommend Hatari as solid family entertainment although John Wayne does let loose with a 'hell' while wrestling the buffalo into the transport cage. It must have been one of his milder curses that survived the final cut.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first time I saw Hatari was on a Boy Scout excursion to New York City during it's original release year of 1962. I had no idea at the time who John Wayne was let alone any of the supporting players in the movie but I did like wild animals. What young kid doesn't? Since then of course the Duke has moved on to that big rodeo in the sky as his legacy survives in the many fine Westerns and war films in which he appeared. Hatari in some ways might be considered an African Western replete with sidekicks drinking and pretty women with a fair share of action adventure as the Hatari gang captures wild game for America's zoos. As such the film doesn't have a whole lot of story line going for it it's more of a series of vignettes of Wayne's character Sean Mercer rallying his men on to collect giraffe zebra leopard buffalo rhino and a proverbial barrel of monkeys. Though in this case it's a tree full of monkeys thanks in large part to a clever design masterminded by Pockets Red Buttons complete with a red and white silver rocket and a huge fish net. The fact that it worked makes it worth the price of admission alone.In between the animal chases director Howard Hawks sprinkles his movie with comic interludes like the goat milking scene the ostrich roundup and the kissing demonstration that the pretty photographer Dallas Elsa Martinelli plants on Wayne. Of course Red Buttons has his share of comic moments as well though at times his timing seems forced especially when he nags his partners to retell their versions of the monkey capture.I must say my admiration for the film's players rose a considerable notch when I learned that they did all their own work in capturing the large game. The rhino scene in particular left me wondering how the animal didn't severely injure itself much less the occupants of the jeep chasing him down.Some dozen years following the film's release I had the pleasure of going on a photographic safari of my own to East Africa. The locales mentioned in the movie such as Arusha and Manyara were on my itinerary though by that time Tanganyika no longer existed having merged with Zanzibar to form the new country of Tanzania. Along with wild game locations in neighboring Kenya that trip remains the highlight of my travel abroad.As others have noted in their postings I would highly recommend Hatari as solid family entertainment although John Wayne does let loose with a 'hell' while wrestling the buffalo into the transport cage. It must have been one of his milder curses that survived the final cut.";

	schema:reviewBody "The political attack on this film is bewildering and annoying it's such a parody of outraged liberalism that I can't help wondering if it's not the work of rightwing trolls pretending to be liberal to anger readers here.At any rate let's knock down the most obvious fallacies of this attack 1. In the Trivia section here it is charged that the film was made under an apartheid regime because John Wayne supported it. Hatari was filmed in Tanganika and there was no apartheid in effect in that country at the time. Apartheid was a legalized caste system only ever in effect in South Africa.2. While the native African populations are kept largely in the background there are no denigrating remarks made concerning them but instead an insistence that their traditions be respected. The film's social structure is actually constructed to emphasize cultural pluralism  the focal group is made up of a German several French descendants a SwissItalian a Spaniard a Native American an American Jew Buttons as Pockets and of course Wayne  an Irish Catholic playing the only WASP in the group.3. The homophobia charge directed against the film has to do with a single line when Dallas asks Pockets why Wayne's character doesn't like women and Pockets says she suffers under a misapprehension. I'm sorry this is homophobic? I watched this movie several times over the past 40 odd years and I never noticed this until I read it on IMDb? Well maybe it's not really there.4. It is charged that the film has been censored for homophobia sexism racism and smoking ?! in television broadcasts. Maybe in the troll's fantasy world. The film has occasionally been shortened due to it's length.5. The film it is charged is sexist using women as mere objects. Of what? Dallas the female lead is aggressive about her job about her desires to experience Africa about her sexuality. And she's hip and intelligent intimidating the older and oldfashioned Wayne on a number of occasions. If this defined sexism there would never have been any need for feminism.6. Smoking  it should be pointed out that smoking is as much a rightwing issue as a liberal concern it insults fundamentalist Protestant aesthetics. There's no denying that a lot of smoking takes place in this film. It was made when the preliminary studies on the dangers of smoking were just coming out and their veracity contested by the tobacco companies and after a long tradition of heavy smoking in the cinema. The smoking behavior of the characters is just one of the things one tolerates if one wants to see a good film of the era.7. It is suggested that the animals  especially the elephants  were mistreated during the film and killed off afterwards. There's no evidence to suggest this reports that the actors themselves were involved in the capture of the animals are counterfactual evidence against this charge what you see is largely what actually happened and it is known that the baby elephants died four decades later of natural causes in zoos.Now onto the film itself The acting is largely insufficient as plagued most Hawks films of the '60s. It is episodic. The plot such as it is meanders. The conclusion does feel somewhat artificial.But it's largely a fantasy about a real way of life that most of us hardly knew existed before watching the film. And it's a fascinating way of life fantasy or real.The film is a kind of Western set in Africa without a villain but with chases aplenty. It's an adventure film and a romantic comedy. Its canvass is wide its strokes are broad. And it is character centered  if you like these people and I do you will have no problem liking this film.".

The film credits state that it was shot in Tanganyika. Tanganyika joined with the island of Zanzibar in 1964 the year after Zanzibar gained independence and adopted the name Tanzania. So we can now say that Hatari! was filmed in Tanzania. In the opening rhino chase the vast stream intersected plain with the lush green hills in the back ground is most probably in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Ngorongoro Crater is the floor of a huge collapsed volcano. The inside of the crater is approximately 10 by 16 kilometers and is surrounded by the remnants of the crater which are 600 meters high. After the accident John Wayne's character radios Arusha Control. He mentions that it will take 5 hours to get out of this crater and drive to Arusha. Arusha is also in Tanzania. The Arusha Clock Tower is visible at least twice in the chase scene near the end of the film confirming that filming was indeed done in Arusha. Snow capped Mount Kilmanjaro is visible in the distance at 41 minutes into the film as the Frenchman walks into the compound. The next time we see a shot in that direction Kili is hidden by clouds. It is perhaps interesting to note that the Maisii in Northern Tanzania now wear Maasai blankets that are factory made. In Hatari! they are wearing ocher colored cloth. There is some Swahili spoken in the film. Hatari! is a great film to look at either before or after a trip to Northern Tanzania.".

There is little character development a slim plot and the whole thing takes far too long. Henry Mancini's score is  very nice particularly the cute Baby Elephant Walk.

Hatari is one of several films to follow in the wake of the two I previously mentioned and it's one of the best.John Wayne Red Buttons Bruce Cabot Valentin De Vargas and Hardy Krueger are a group of animal trappers working for Michele Girardon. Cabot gets gored while trying to get a loop on a wild rhinoceros. While he's incapacitated Gerard Blain joins this crew.Another addition is photographer Elsa Martinelli who's a tenderfoot in the jungle and a lot of the comic situations stem from that fact. We've got her getting John Wayne interested and Michele Girardon has some of the other guys in an uproar over her. I won't say who she winds up with.Howard Hawks directs some nice comic moments here. A running gag is how Elsa Martinelli keeps on getting adopted by stray baby elephants. Red Buttons devises a Rube Goldberg scheme to capture wild monkeys that should not be missed.But I think some of the best scenes are simply those showing the trappers going about their dangerous job of obtaining wild jungle animals for the zoo. These men are professionals who take pride in their work a running theme in a lot of Hawks films. Incidentally Hatari was nominated for Best Color Cinematography losing to Lawrence of Arabia. No more sound stage Africa for the public.I've often wondered if John Wayne was talked into this film by William Holden who at that time was the owner of the Safari Club in Kenya. Possibly this film was offered to Holden I'm sure he also would have done a creditable job. Holden and Wayne were very good friends and if I'm right Holden gave the Duke a real good tip. This is definitely one of John Wayne's best efforts.Hatari is a bit dated by technology now. Tranquilizer guns were not invented yet. If they had been the trappers would have had a lot easier time of it. Still it's a fabulous treat.".

Shah Rukh and Raveena had good chemistry the songs were pleasant and the action scenes were plenty. I recommend this movie especially if you are a SRK fan or a old fan of Jitu and Shotgun respectively. Anupam Kher is also very funny in this movie. This movie revolves around the 2 stars Shatrughan Sighna and Jitendra being rivals who were once like brothers. The story unfolds to tell us what went on between them. Shah Rukh and Raveena play the children of each of them who are made to fall in love with one another in order to patch up the differences. At least that is the goal that Anupam shoots for and whether he succeeds or fails is the big question! It is a fun watch. Well acted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judging by the ratings and having heard the opinions of many people 'Zamaana Deewana' seems to be one of Shahrukh and Raveena's most disliked films. I wonder why because for me it's total entertainment. Why would anyone expect a movie with such a title to be anything else? Not only does it stay true to its title it brings together all the Bollywood clichs and molds into a fun movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that's where it scores.Speaking of clichs you'll pretty much see everything to be witnessed in a pre2000s typical Bollywood film and that's why 'Zamaana Deewana' in a way works as a spoof. Here are some examples The ongoing feud between the two families caused by a misunderstanding which is followed by parents disapproving their kids relationship the guy running away with the girl the over the top action sequences Shahrukh on his motorbike fighting the goons 'dishum dishum' the unsuitable boyfriend who drinks gambles and visits prostitutes the helpless mom the evil maternal uncle etc etc. What's notable is that all the sequences are presented with humour. The entire first two hours are hilarious.The songs and entire soundtrack deserves special mention. The soundtrack pretty much has all kinds of songs present in a typical Bollywood film and they are filmed quite well. There's a title song a semiitem number those weren't so big then a dream sequence a parody number a song in the rain a song in a car a song with two desperate lovers a gypsy song where the two lovers finally realize their love for each other. One particular song 'Soch Liya Maine' is executed that way with several dream sequences that include themes like lovers singing in the snow in the rain in the car and even in a tropical jungle. 'Neend Kise Chain Kahan' is one of the most sensual looking songs. The songs themselves are quite pleasant to the ears.'Zamaana Deewana' isn't entirely spoofy. There are some genuine humour like Anupam Kher as the common love interest of the fathers some very funny oneliners and the moments between Shahrukh and Raveena. It very much works as a multigenre film as in addition to the comedy it's got romance action suspense and lots of spice. The last hour could have used more humour as it becomes a tad too dramatic still using the clichs.Shahrukh Khan and Raveena Tandon totally rock as a pair. Tandon's already well recognized for her comedic abilities and I wish Shahrukh was offered more comedy movies as the actor clearly shows a knack. They are sizzling on screen. Also Raveena's Priya is not the typical Bollywood lovergirl bimbo. She's quite headstrong and smart. Unfortunately she and Khan have never done a movie since. Anupam Kher is at his funniest and kudos to him for the dance number where he's seducing Shatrughan Sinha and Jeetendra. Jeetendra and Shatrughan Sinha do a good job as the typical disapproving parents who hate each other's guts. The scenes where they cuss at each other is another LOL moment. Tinnu Anand and Asif Sheikh are alright as the caricature villains.So for me the only flaw is that the last hour is a tad too dramatic and could have used more comedic balance but otherwise this is a typical Bollywood film. I have revisited it after 10 years and still managed to laugh throughout most of the three hours. Why take this film seriously if it doesn't take itself that way?".

These pessimistic questions at the end of the movie are not asked by someone old who has got through the hardship and cruelty of war or Holocaust but by a young girl from Poland Mariola whose psyche has forever been hurt. Putting it in the utmost frankness Pena's film is unlike many other films an extreme movie. It is so powerful emotionally that its content makes even the toughest guys shocked and upset. It is not just a drama that makes people cry... what you get while and after watching the film is far more extreme than just tears. Viewers feel an undeniable true empathy with the main character a kind of feeling that is caused by the content of the film when everything in you cries out Is this humane is it possible that people don't hesitate to commit such crimes?CONTENT The movie starts in a nice even sentimental way. It is so called the golden Polish fall when we see the leaves falling onto the ground. A young gentle girl Mariola Anna Cieslak falls in love with a boy she has known since the school years Artur Rafal Mackowiak and enjoys spending her free time with him. But the feeling that grows in them is not an experienced love but rather seems to be a pure youth female  male sympathy. Although Mariola lives a very peaceful life with her Grandma Barbara Walkowna she primarily wants to be happy who does not? But where does she find happiness? In the arms of her boyfriend. She seems to place all her hope of future in him. One day the young couple decide to go abroad. The trip to Germany at first is to be a two  week vacation but from the very beginning there is something weird in all of it. Actually Artur does not tell Mariola what precisely they are going to do there. But love means trust and in this very feeling she leaves her beloved Grandma her hometown and leaves for a journey that will play a decisive role in her later life and that will terribly affect her psyche a journey that will have to turn her honest love into rotten lusts her freedom of youth into unbelievable captivity her name Mariola into Justine and her hope and dreams into an unbearable shock and disappointment... I won't reveal more of the content because the film will do this itself. I can't promise anyone if heshe will like it or not. SPOILER One thing is certain there are unbearably brutal moments and sometimes you will have to close your eyes. Yet they are worth seeing in order to understand one critical truth  the world that knows no frank love is a real hell on earth!CAST The performances are generally very fine. The most important note must be made about a young Polish actress Anna Cieslak. She does a wonderful job as Mariola expressing her deep psychological states. Sometimes she acts like a very experienced actress and her gestures are to that extend natural that you watch her performance and feel as if you watched realistically someone's tragedy. Anna Cieslak allows viewers to get to the psyche of her role. I will never forget the moment when the plans of Artur are revealed. In a brief very brutal moment she has that depressing blink in her eyes that people have when all their world seems to end so suddenly and unexpectedly. Rafal Mackowiak is also worth consideration as Artur a boy who forgot what conscience and normal human feelings are. I also liked Arno Frisch as Niko a character that is hard to figure out. Sometimes he shows gentleness but in some other moments he seems to lack this too. Finally I must mention Mathieu Carriere a very talented German actor. His role is very difficult since he plays a particularly evil character but he gives a very natural performance. Mathieu's portrayal shows us what it means to lose all that is humane...There is one significant factor except for the cast and the extremely dramatic story that makes this film particularly powerful. That is the dense atmosphere. The film is full of VERY intense psychological moments which make people stare at the screen they not only observe the tragedy but they as if take part in it and yet obviously they are not able to do anything to change this. As a result this occurs to be a very difficult film definitely not the one to be watched by children or viewers who easily get to despair. Yet although it is rather hard I think that this feeling of helplessness perfectly reveals the real world how we usually see people suffering. Although we sometimes try to help them there is still very little we can do. If you can stand violence rape extreme humiliation and personal tragedy showed in a film I recommend you to see De Pena's movie. It is not just a film but a story of a tragedy of innocent people something the world is full of no matter if we live in the times called Dark Ages or in the times that call themselves times of tolerance and freedom See YOUR NAME IS JUSTINE and you will look at this world from a bit different perspective. Such questions like What is a true love? Does the world care? or Where is justice? will be considered in an entirely different way. By showing the world which lacks love and humanity the world that deprives young people from joy of youth and freedom it teaches how crucial this problem is. In other words doesn't it show a need to build a different world now not to experience slavery in the 21st century of Christianity? A FILM THAT LEAVES MUCH TO REFLECT ON".

Anna Cieslak allows viewers to get to the psyche of her role. I will never forget the moment when the plans of Artur are revealed. In a brief very brutal moment she has that depressing blink in her eyes that people have when all their world seems to end so suddenly and unexpectedly. Rafal Mackowiak is also worth consideration as Artur a boy who forgot what conscience and normal human feelings are. I also liked Arno Frisch as Niko a character that is hard to figure out. Sometimes he shows gentleness but in some other moments he seems to lack this too. Finally I must mention Mathieu Carriere a very talented German actor. His role is very difficult since he plays a particularly evil character but he gives a very natural performance. Mathieu's portrayal shows us what it means to lose all that is humane...There is one significant factor except for the cast and the extremely dramatic story that makes this film particularly powerful. That is the dense atmosphere. The film is full of VERY intense psychological moments which make people stare at the screen they not only observe the tragedy but they as if take part in it and yet obviously they are not able to do anything to change this. As a result this occurs to be a very difficult film definitely not the one to be watched by children or viewers who easily get to despair. Yet although it is rather hard I think that this feeling of helplessness perfectly reveals the real world how we usually see people suffering. Although we sometimes try to help them there is still very little we can do. If you can stand violence rape extreme humiliation and personal tragedy showed in a film I recommend you to see De Pena's movie. It is not just a film but a story of a tragedy of innocent people something the world is full of no matter if we live in the times called Dark Ages or in the times that call themselves times of tolerance and freedom See YOUR NAME IS JUSTINE and you will look at this world from a bit different perspective. Such questions like What is a true love? Does the world care? or Where is justice? will be considered in an entirely different way. By showing the world which lacks love and humanity the world that deprives young people from joy of youth and freedom it teaches how crucial this problem is. In other words doesn't it show a need to build a different world now not to experience slavery in the 21st century of Christianity? A FILM THAT LEAVES MUCH TO REFLECT ON";

You won't believe what goes on here. A henchman in this western setting that looks and speaks like Hitler! Two kids named Al Capone and Dutch Schultz! who are dubbed with adult voices! A villain with a robotic hand! Nero eating onions like apples! A motorcycle gang! The death of one character shown in reverse! Speededup action scenes a la the Keystone Kops! And all done with what seems to have been a hefty budget!Most people will hate this movie simply calling it stupid. Well maybe it is stupid.

From the bizarre opening shot of the oil field and the director's credit I knew this was one worth the dollar.Franco Nero does his best Terrence Hill impression as the character Onion who arrives in town to start an onion farm on a parcel of land he's bought real cheap from a farmer. What he doesn't know is that evil oil magnate Petrus Lamb has boughtstolen all the property around the town due to the vast oil reserves under the town. Lamb has a strange mechanical hand that's serviced by Adolf Hitler! Thru a plot device out of Once Upon A Time in the West Onion's property is still owned by the orphans of the original farmer who's been killed by Lamb's henchmen. The rest of the movie revolves around the increasingly silly attempts to steal the lease out of Onion's possession.First of all the film is very well directed by Enzo Castellari so that already lifts it out of the typical spaghetti western doldrums. The script is very silly with frequent forays into total surrealism. Onion fights with a gun and the many onions that he has hidden in his pants. During a duel he always asks Gun or Onion? The first fight scene with Onion is right out of the first Trinity movie except it mostly done with onions. I suppose it's a parody of sorts but how do you parody a parody? Martin Balsam is game as the evil Lamb and he seems to be having fun with the mechanical hand he's wearing. I enjoyed the movie for the most part although the overuse of spedup footage towards the end is a letdown. The English dubbing crew had some fun with this film as they gave Onion a Jimmy Stewart voice and one orphan sounds like Bugs Bunny imitating a gangster. For some reason it works! I wonder what the Italian original sounds like.Not the greatest but with enough bright spots that I enjoyed the film.".

Good hearted street chick meets boy gambler and they hit the road for Vegas where she meets up with her long lost dad falls in love with her traveling companion and both learn some lessons in life. Unfortunately this junk flick is a laughable miscarriage with the sundry heavies more fleshed out than the protagonists. Personally I ended up liking the hitman who refused to kill anyone on Valentine's Day more than the hero and felt more compassion for the slutty stripper than the heroine. Don't waste you time with this mess of a movie which I'm sure Dunst and Caan are trying to forget.".

	onyx:emotionText "Somewhere in this contrived morass of stereotypes and shoddy film making is a story with some entertainment value. Good hearted street chick meets boy gambler and they hit the road for Vegas where she meets up with her long lost dad falls in love with her traveling companion and both learn some lessons in life. Unfortunately this junk flick is a laughable miscarriage with the sundry heavies more fleshed out than the protagonists. Personally I ended up liking the hitman who refused to kill anyone on Valentine's Day more than the hero and felt more compassion for the slutty stripper than the heroine. Don't waste you time with this mess of a movie which I'm sure Dunst and Caan are trying to forget.";

That's unfortunate for him because the kid has FIVE cards in his hand which contain at least trip deuces.  Let's make sure we got that.

Kirsten Dunst is cutely sunny as always but James Caan spends the entire film looking and sounding like he needs a megadose of antidepressants. I almost had to jab myself in the groin with a hot cigarette lighter to stay awake through this thing.Charlie Doyles James Caan is an aging gambler who's returned to Las Vegas to take on his old rival Tony DeCarlo Robert Miano in a high stakes underground poker game. Lidda Kirsten Dunst is Charlie's teenage daughter. He ran out on Lidda and her trashy mother years ago leaving them in Tulsa Oklahoma of all places. Now on her 18th birthday Lidda runs away from home to find her dad in Vegas. Along the way she picks up Colonel Vincent Kartheisen a longhaired teenage loser who fancies himself the world's greatest poker player. Yes his actual name is Colonel. No they never explain what the deal is with that.As Lidda and Colonel do their thing of young love and Charlie and Tony dance through their brutally simplistic conflict there are three other characters who kind of wander around until they end up dead. There's Sugar Jennifer Gareis a stripper who used to screw Charlie is now screwing Tony and pretty much screws every man she meets as substitute for small talk. Rounding things out are Jimmy Luis Guzman and Frankie Frederico Da Vinci two thugs who work for Tony and hang around being all ironic and stuff about being murderous criminals.Luckytown has a lot of naked female breasts and Dunst is always enjoyable. Those are the only good qualities of the movie. The rest isn't aggressively horrible it's just boring as all get out. There's no energy to anything that happens here. Showing 105 minutes of an old man sleeping on a park bench would have more excitement and intensity. Much of the blame for that can be placed on Caan who sleepwalks through every scene and monotones his way through every line. But the script by Brandon Beseth is devoid of interest and the direction of Paul Nicholas never establishes a pace or a sense of importance.Yes Dunst does end up as a stripper at one point. No she doesn't take off her clothes. There is a scene where she's briskly walking and you can see the boobs under her shirt bounce up and down with enough force to kill a small mouse.The only thing this film has to offer is that it might be able to cure a case of insomnia. Apart from cinema's contribution to holistic medicine there's nothing else here.".

That happens here.  Hans Christian Andersen is a village cobbler whose compulsive inventiveness is little thought of until he makes good in Copenhagen after which...But there's much more going on.There's no doubt that Andersen was a great artist in some sense.  The Ugly Duckling' and The Emperor's New Clothes' are two of the greatest short stories  fables folktales  all of these  ever composed.  But he had his limitations.  There were many kinds of stories he just couldn't write.  His fertile talent for anthropomorphising was often a millstone.  In many respects he seems to have been a childish and naive man.  But get this all of these limitations make it onto the screen.  Both the story and Danny Kaye's performance a great performance make Andersen into a human being who is NOT the greatest storyteller since Shakespeare but who can be admired for what he is.The main story isn't the unrecognised genius' bit it's a story of unrequited love.  While in Copenhagen Andersen spends most of his time banging his head against the wall over an unattainable ballerina whose interest in him is as they say purely professional.  He manages to be quite cruel to a close friend in the process right up to the point where it's unclear that a reconciliation is possible.  Indeed it's unclear whether or not one occurs.  When he realises what a fool he's been he just trudges back defeated to his village.  And it's here we have the obligatory scene where the villagers realise how great he was after all mainly by singing the highly memorable refrains of the movie's songs one after the other.  Well the film needed some ending.  I'm inclined to forgive this one.There's also a lengthy Little Mermaid ballet  seven minutes long? more?  danced in its entirety.  We see a LOT of the ballerina's craft in Copenhagen.  This sort of thing wasn't too unusual in the 1950s but it's a genuine gamble in context  and one that I think pays off.  By the time the ballet appears the cheery story of an eccentric village storyteller had become surprisingly dark.  Vidor it seems would rather risk having people leave the cinema than insult those who remain.  Good for him.  I can't claim that this film works in every respect and perhaps you won't like it but I'm sure you won't feel cheated by it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is fantastic. The problem is hardly anybody has seen it and anybody who hasn't is seriously missing out. It features Danny Kaye in his element here as the fairytale author and a superb score by Frank Loesser. All the songs are moving or humorous and I recognised all of the fairy tales. I was moved by Ugly Duckling laughing with delight at Thumbelina and swaying in time to the music of Copenhagen which has never looked that beautiful. The supporting stars are solid most notably from Joey Walsh Farley Granger and Jeanmaire. Speaking of the ballet sequences I disagree that they were plodding. It may have been 20 minutes long but the little mermaid for me was the highlight of the film and perfectly set to the music of Lizst. Hearing Schubert's Rosamunde was a delight and when I heard the music to Anderson's dreamhim trying to get Doro away from Nils I genuinely felt I was watching a Wagnerian opera with its devilish imagery and Flying Dutchman like incidental music. Danny Kaye was fantastic in the song numbers and although his voice isn't large he has phenomenal breath control that is almost as good as that of the opera singer Tito Schipa. Watch this musical which is perfectlypaced. If you don't see this you're seriously missing out! 1010. Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " On the ballet and subtleties in this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "A few comments have been made about the ballet in this movie. More needs to be said. The ballet is really just wonderful. I am not a ballet fan but this dance spoke to me. The movie itself tells a story of unattainable love and the ballet is placed in the movie at the point that Hans has just tried to approach the ballerina at the theater. The ballet then tells the story of the Little Mermaid in dance and ends with the little mermaid walking back to the sea. Thereafter Hans has the same experience. This was a much more enjoyable ballet than others I have seen I think largely because in film one doesn't have the scene changes that are inherent in an onstage presentation. Critics back in 1952 thought that the ballet was one of the best ballet performances that had ever been brought to the screen. In addition that ballerina ZiZi Jeanmaire could act. Her performance as an woman in an odd relationship who found herself touched by Han's affections was nicely done.The more you read about Hans Christian Anderson the more you appreciate this movie. Anderson's approach to his stories was as he said to take an adult theme and tell the story in a way children would enjoy it but to have elements that adults would appreciate. This movie accomplishes this very well. Anderson's father was a cobbler. Anderson originally lived in Odense a town that at that time was wedded to the past and tradition who expected that people would remain in their class. He moved to Copenhagen where he found support and success. Eventually he started grammar school on a royal scholarship but was subjected to a stern schoolmaster who sought to put Anderson in his place and punish Anderson for his creative streak. Anderson was rescued by the kindness of others who saw his gift for writing. The movie itself tells the story of Hans Christian Anderson. As Anderson took an adult idea and made a children's story this movie takes Anderson's life as a concept and relates a story that is enjoyable by children but has much to say to adults watching. Anderson was confident of his abilities as a writer and movie Hans sang with confidence at to being a cobbler. He publicly courted two women both of which were unobtainable to him and his infatuation with the ballerina in the movie paralleled this as well as simultaneously expressing Anderson's love of ballet. He was also attracted to men in later years one was a ballet dancer. The previous post about homoeroticism with the boy in the movie being shirtless in one scene probably reflects that. The movie doesn't have sexual tension between them. It is a fatherson relationship. For 4 years Anderson was at a school with a stern disciplinarian headmaster. The inchworm song where the children in the background sing a rote sequence of math facts while movie Hans sings how the inchworm plods along measuring but ends up oblivious to the beauty of the flower was a short fable which both drew on Anderson's life and told a story to children which was exactly the sort of thing Anderson would have done. Anderson frequently gave magical qualities to inanimate objects in his stories and the scene where movie Hans had the table and chair relating to each other was charming in the same way. Another scene where movie Hans tells the ugly ducking song to a child who had lost his hair ended with a shot of a policeman who was standing nearby giving Hans a nod and a smile to Hans for having done a kind thing for a child which echo's how adults see messages in Anderson's stories. Anderson was not appreciated initially in his native Denmark but after he had international success he gained great fame in Denmark. When he eventually returned to Odense he was welcomed a hero which was reflected in the film and was a line where movie Hans said how nice it would be to return home well regarded for his success away from home. There was even a little match girl seen in the movie.Even the casting of Danny Kaye as Hans was inspired. Anderson was tall lanky awkward and homely but had a sweet melodious voice and was able to tell stories so well that one forgot who was telling them and became enveloped in the story itself. Other than awkwardness this was Danny Kaye.As many of Anderson's fairy tales were metaphors of his life this movie is a metaphor of Anderson's life. Within the movie there is the ballet of the Little Mermaid. Thus there is metaphor within metaphor in the movie. There is subtlety in how this movie expresses facets of Anderson's life as there is subtlety in Anderson's fairy tales.

	schema:headline " A Classic Fairy Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "Samuel Goldwyn was a genius. This is an oftoverlooked classic where the songs by Frank Loesser are better known than the movie Wonderful Wonderful Copenhagen Inchworm Ugly Duckling and Thumbelina.Presented as a fairy tale it bears no resemblance to a biography of Hans Christian Andersen and says so right at the beginning. Hans is a cobbler in an obscure Danish village and wants nothing more out of life that the right to enjoy it and tell stories to the children. The schoolmaster wants Hans to leave town because he disrupts the school. He is persuaded by his apprentice to visit Copenhagen. So he does. He falls in love with a beautiful ballerina there.Jeanmarie He fantasizes marrying her and writes the story of The Little Mermaid which becomes a successful ballet with her in the starring role. He makes special ballet slippers for the ballerina to wear.

I suppose they think that maybe Danny Kaye was gay just because he sang and danced? He was married and had one child a daughter Dora.Danny Kaye gives a somewhat subdued performance here and as noted before this film is often overlooked. I believe it is one of his best.".

This is an oftoverlooked classic where the songs by Frank Loesser are better known than the movie Wonderful Wonderful Copenhagen Inchworm Ugly Duckling and Thumbelina.Presented as a fairy tale it bears no resemblance to a biography of Hans Christian Andersen and says so right at the beginning. Hans is a cobbler in an obscure Danish village and wants nothing more out of life that the right to enjoy it and tell stories to the children. The schoolmaster wants Hans to leave town because he disrupts the school. He is persuaded by his apprentice to visit Copenhagen. So he does. He falls in love with a beautiful ballerina there.Jeanmarie He fantasizes marrying her and writes the story of The Little Mermaid which becomes a successful ballet with her in the starring role. He makes special ballet slippers for the ballerina to wear.

Charles Vidor's picture gallantly beefs up hooky singing snippets composed and lyricized by Broadway songwriter Frank Loesser spawned out of Andersen's worldfamous stories The Ugly Duckling Thumbelina and The Emperor's New Clothes with a main throughline of Andersen's infatuation of a prima ballerina Doro Jeanmaire which begets the genesis of The Little Mermaid and then is transmuted into a spectacular ballet choreographed by Parisian danseur Roland Petit grafted onto the climax. In its notsocomplicated storyline Andersen is dumbed down as a happygolucky cobbler and saddled with a sidekick the orphan boy Peter Walsh who becomes increasingly protective towards him as he fears that Andersen is over the moon with an ungrounded idea that he is the knightinshiningarmor for Doro who is married to Niels Granger even so bratty and uppity the troupe's stroppy choreographer. Their marriage comes off as habitually vacillating between lovey dovey showoff and fiery squabbles but is far from on the rocks as Andersen postulates Peter witnesses and understands Doro and Niels' foliedeux but fails to disabuse a hottotrot Andersen of his wishful thinking so a slipshod breakup ensues the only time Andersen appears as a heartless bastard although in the end the hatchet will be buried in an equally rash fashion because no one should set feet in between Peter and Andersen hooray! Danny Kaye has a soothingly mellow voice like a balm to a jaded ear although his earnest performance is not a showstopper but his congenial amenity is a boon to its family audience but indeed the money shot here are the ballet sequences melded with cinematic bravura its ravishing setting and montage dexterity without an overarching pomposity and indulgence  la Powell  Pressburger's THE TALES OF HOFFMANN and interlaced with a basic narrative structure they are condensed to light up the screen within a nonetoowearing allotted screentime which can at once impress rubberneckers and intrigue balletomanes for this reason alone it has a decisive edge over other screen commodities touting the highbrow oneupmanship!".

I've seen this film a lot. If you look past the nudity and appreciative helpings of sex there is a story but it's through this three characters in this love triangle where for one jealously goes beyond it's limit another one sadly in it's finale is a victim of circumstance I guess while Cage the other in the end is really the loser. He brings another crazy offbeat character that's mystifying in the form of a sleazy nude artistuniversity dropoutwomanizerpart time magician Johnny Collins. He's now back in the bayou working for his new boss old school friendgifted poet Reinhold particularly good here who speaks a southern accent the way he delivers his poetry he's just great. And so is his wife Zandalee Erika Anderson not acting wise just beautiful scenery. She doesn't even try to act which must of been a worry. Joe Pantoliano who almost trademarks character acting is great as a cross dresser who works with Zandalee in her boutique. Soon Cage is getting in Anderson's pants and it's almost as though Reinhold cracked onto this from the start but you aren't sure where he makes soft insinuations here and there some through poetry. That's what I like about it an incertitude a scariness too as what will Reinhold end up doing. Reinhold's a very tortured man of past who gave the poetry up as well as his performance in the bedroom which is why Zandalee is drifting away from him and satisfying her sexual yearning from Cage in some pretty raunchy scenes. The prolonged last act of the film was interesting as that speedboat ride took a more than dangerous turn but a real tragic one evolved in the last breathing moments of the film that was unforeseen and truly climactic. For sex lovers this one's sure not to disappoint but there is more to this film than that and that's not just in it's story. This is another of Cage's best performances among many. His name defines acting in it's true purpose to take that character all the way not be inhibited something Nick definitely isn't in or off camera.".

Everybody was trying so hard to act and obviously had no idea what they were doing. The filming was awkward the bar scenes were quiet enough to hear a pin drop and the ADR and sound mixing were typical TV terrible.That wasn't so bad was it? Far easier to read than Zandalee was to watch.";

	schema:headline " Sensual and almost erotic thriller of the heart";
	schema:reviewBody "Recap Zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with Thierry. Thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way. He has submerged himself in work laid of his writing and Zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them. Into this enters Johnny and old friend of Thierry's who once were artists in exile together. But Johnny has kept on painting and just have a day job for the rent. He takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny. There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny and they enter into an affair. But Zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband. But none of them not Zandalee not Johnny and not Thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control.Comments It is set as a thriller. But maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death and threat of violence. Not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions but the threat comes from a different angle. And it is not really until the second half in Zandalee until the thriller emerges and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half I can't really describe the genre as a thriller then. Much more of a romantic drama than anything else but with the underlying currents of other genres. The developing thriller is there but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind. Because that is what it is all about what drives the characters and therefore the entire story. Desire. The need to have and the need to be.In my opinion it is quite good definitely a lot better than its current 4.1 rating anyway. It takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense and it handles the erotic part very well with taste. It is always an integral part of the story needed to be there to give the story it's needed weight and I never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that. But unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end and the end itself feels kind of flat even if in its own way kind of dramatic.The cast is impressive spearheaded by known actors like Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire she excels were both Cage and Reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough. Her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in Zandalee I can only hope it is because of her own choices. Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie it is Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano.When you're in the right mood this is a very good movie it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Mad Magazine named it Basically Stinks. A bit harsh perhaps.This is not so much about Stone playing mindgames on the perpetuallyhorny Douglas so much as it is about Esterhaz's script playing mindgames with the viewer. An extremely convoluted plot this level of complexity is more often found in political thrillers than in regular cops'n'robbers ones. I'll give credit to Esterhaz for creating a very interesting original story but the man isn't undeservedly known for writing illogical scripts. Clearly his priority is to generate suspense and as many plot twists as possible  no complaints there those things are always welcome. However he does this at the expense of the logic there are so many coincidences contradictions and just general farfetchedness that even a hairless 14mm kangaroo fetus can figure out that various facts do not add up. By the last quarter of the movie all the more relevant evidence points to Tripplehorn as the killer. But Esterhaz being a thrillsattheexpenseoflogic seeker that he is made that predictable lastminute thrillermovie twist Stone has an ice pick lying beneath her bed while she has sex with Douglas in the movie's last scene. What does this mean? It implies that Stone is the killer. Unless that was a complete coincidence the icepick somehow slid from the kitchen and landed under the bed. Or perhaps she placed the icepick there knowing that she can play mindgames with the audience as well. Am I being stupid? Not any more than this plot. However Tripplehorny had too many motives too dubious a past was too emotionally involved  in short far too suspicious  not to be the killer. And the very coincidence of her being in the building when Douglas killed her shakes away the last iota of doubt about her guilt. Yet Tripplehorny and Stone cannot both be killers. Or can they...? Esterhaz never suggests this but the only logical explanation one which would at least tie up some loose ends would be the following Tripplehorn and Stone were in it together from the very beginning just for kicks. I know it sounds ridiculous and entails additional illogicalities. But it would at least explain how the hell Stone had all that information about Douglas which he himself at one point said only Tripplehorny had knowledge of or access to. This is never explained. Since the bald I.A. dead cop wasn't the one who sold the info to Stone nor could he have  he didn't know the intimate details which only Tripplehorn knew it must have been Tripplehorn this is a fact. But if she interacted with Stone then nothing makes any sense. It's a nowin nologic situation. There is also the minor detail of both Stone and Tripplehorn having extremely questionable pasts with dead bodies lying all around them this would implicate both.There is absolutely no point in going further into the complexity of illogical errors which Esterhaz undoubtedly commits. He wanted to entertain and succeeded. His past scripts have shown him that you can have success with illogic so he bravely marched on with yet more absurd material  right into the offices of Hollywood bosses. And they took it. The film is without a doubt very interesting at times suspenseful and there are plenty of twists and revelations to avoid any boredom. That way the viewer is happy Esterhaz is rich the studio has a success on its hands Stone finally makes it big and Douglas gets to yet again have sex with attractive women all over the furniture. Everyone's happy.".

It became a box office winner that made Sharon Stone a star and yet was basically pd on by the critics! The word is the film is better than your average B movie skin flick only by the quality of the actors and Verhoeven's ability. I feel the film is still not given the respect it's  due. I first saw the Rrated version which is very good but now you can get the even better Unrated Director's Cut which has even more graphic content! If you don't like eroticthrillers then don't see it. But anyone with taste will enjoy the thrill ride of events that take place in Basic Instinct. The script by Joe Eszterhas was highly thought of in Hollywood and if not for the graphic nudity a top star like Michelle Pfeiffer would have taken the role made famous by Sharon stone.Does the script go too far at times? Yes but that's part of the films charm and after all the now 'classic film moment' of Sharon Stone's leg spread interrogation likely would have been dropped in a conventional film. Still though I wouldn't have minded seeing a few less people getting killed off to keep even more suspense and realism. The score is also beautiful and fans of Hitchcock's great Vertigo can appreciate the homage that Paul Verhoeven has included. The film has a lot of eye candy but Jeanne Tripplehorn deserves special mention for her impressive supporting role sadly she hasn't done much of note since. Michael Douglas does a solid job also but I can't help wondering if a better actor like Clint Eastwood could have brought more to the table. The dialogue is not up to the level of Pulp Fiction but it's still interesting and fun. I highly recommend this film for fans of adult mystery.".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one begin a review of what is arguably the most controversial movie of the 90's? Perhaps I should start by saying that although Basic Instinct is complete trash with nothing residing beneath its glitzy surfacedespite the claims of Camille Paglia there are NO subliminal meanings and the phallic symbolism of the ice pick is purely coincidental it's also a riveting psychological thriller with Doublas and Stone providing an impressive double in a refreshingly gripping film.I will not go deeply into plot detail as the story is practically part of hollywood folklore but in summary volatile cop Nick CurranMichael Douglas falls in love with murder suspect Catherine TrammellSharon Stone who mayor may not have brutally murdered her lover with an ice pick. If the plot sounds familiar its probably due to the fact that Basic Instinct is essentially a combination of writer Joe Eszthera's film 'Jagged Edge' and director Paul Verhoeven's film 'The Fourth Man' both of which had their fair share of sex and fashionable violence. Despite this Basic Instinct still is enjoyable and having seen either of those films will have no affect on the unpredictability of the film.At the centre of the film is Stone's performance which is actually quite superbthough in the long run this film's been more of a curse than a blessing to her film careeras although she's easily the least probable femme fatale ever to graceor poison to be more accurate the silver screen Stone plays her with such zeal that we can't take our eyes off her. That said it should also be pointed out that she becomes rather less intriguing after the first 40 minutes when she becomes involved with Michael Douglas as her character loses a great deal of her mystique and her personality has less bite. Then of course is the infamous scene which practically every other reviewer has mentioned and I am going to be no exception where Tramell is being interrogated by the police and coolly turns the tables on them by exploiting their libidos and reducing them to drooling idiots totally ridiculous but easily the film's best scene and certainly one that is not going to be soon forgotten no doubt to the chagrin of Sharon Stone.The rest of the cast are fine with Michael Douglas doing the character he does bestthe rather thuggish white male who constantly gets involved with the wrong kind of woman Jeanne Tripplehorn doing an adequate job as Nick's pyschologist and George Dzunda manages to be the only halfway likable character in the movie as Curran's bestand onlyfriend. Unfortunately Leilani Sarelle is underused as Catherine Trammell's enigmatic girlfriendI forgot to mention Catherine's Bisexual.The film is of course not without flaws. Noone not even the director could deny that Basic Instinct has such big plot holes you could park a car in them as for some of the events in the film to make sense characters would need to be either clairvoyant or in possession of otherworldly powers. The endings also a bit of a cop out no I WON'T reveal it as it was clearly engineered so that it could be easily changed with a single edit if preview audiences were unsatisfied with it.It is also impossible to ignore the huge controversey that surrounded the films release with a particulair furor being caused by feminists and lesbians over their portrayal in the film. In truth the jury's still out on wether Basic Instinct is homophobic but I personally don't think it is as the characters' sexuality is never really an issue although in fairness it is used as a somewhat cheap plot device to titillate the audience. The case made by feminists is much stronger as all the women in the film are portrayed as dubious and potentially dangerous. The main defence against all this is that frankly all the characters are unpleasent and devious  with perhaps one exception and no discrimination is given in any way. The other issue was of course the sex scenes which although explicit are really rather pass these days.The film is stylishly filmed expertly paced brilliantly directed and has a superb music score from Jerrry Goldsmith. I'll give it a high scoreby my standards of 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors. His movies are so damn entertaining. They always well I should say most of the time have wit and intelligence Forget 'Showgirls' and 'Hollow Man' any director can make mistakes and have either graphic sex or violence or both. 'Basic Instinct' is in the latter category. It is so erotic and Stone and Douglas have so much sexual chemistry that when you look at an Adrian Lyne film you see them for the crap they are.Basic plotline has Stone's character 'Catherine Tramell' accused of the vicious sex murder of a retired rock and roll star. Douglas's character has a strange attraction to her which may not lead to good things..... Paul Verhoven has openly admitted that this film is a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's  classic masterpiece 'Vertigo'. In fact Stone wears in sequence the same wardrobe as Kim Novak did which makes you wonder was she wearing panties under her clothes. That brings us to the interrogation scene which is the best in the movie. Stone shamelessly flirts with the cops' libidos until the buildup of sexual tension is so great Stone releases it by playing 'peekaboo'  with the space in between her legs. Every male viewer cherishes that scene simply because it is so sexy. That word can be used throughout the film as Stone and Douglas do the mattress mumbo. At the time the sex scenes were so realistic that the press went wild and debated whether or not viewers were witnessing unsimulated sex. The film is still quite sexually daring today and  has an intriguing spider's web plot too. The plot's twists and turns manage to make the movie sexier as the viewer wonders whether Sharon is innocent or guilty..........The film's only misstep occurs at the end with an unsatisfactory ending that makes the whole film seem like some stupid contrived game. But it's not. It keeps it's fascination and it's sexiness and its suspense right up till the end which is what a good erotic thriller should. Actually the ending for some will lead to a lot of discussion if you watch the film with someone as the film toys with two of the film's characters innocence or guilt and does not give up all its secrets.....The film is great Verhoeven. It has his usual hilarious seemingly inappropriate kinky humor and extreme sex and violence to match. The fact that Verhoeven is actually able to balance the film and make it funny and sexy is wonderful filmmaking. Well have I said 'sexy' enough times? Then go rent it.........810P.S. If you like this one check out Verhoevens' Dutch film ''The Fourth Man''. It has a similar plot and even a similar character that resembles Catherine Tramell. If the ending of 'Basic Instinct' leaves you wanting check that film out. It is even better than 'Basic' and is more 'arty'. It is also a little bit more daring erotically.".

And yes they are hypocrites in my mind people who watch this movie are meant to be mature thus denying sex is either hypocritical or prudish. If that's not your thing okay then don't watch it but don't rate it low just because you can't handle it. Because the sex scenes are really just a few minutes long I'm European and they're really aren't that strong but make up a large part of Catherine's character and are a fundamental part of the plot. The film would be unthinkable without them but shouldn't be reduced to them either. Naturally don't watch it with your kids but if you're not scared of some nudity and like thrillers you'll love this one since it keeps one on the edge right until the end.".

	schema:headline " A brutal murder. A brilliant killer. A cop who can't resist the danger.";
	schema:reviewBody "The 90's was a decade that was blessed with many great movies yet there are none greater than that of Basic Instinct. It is a truly great film. With Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone heading a wonderful cast this was one of the great thriller movies I can remember watching. It had everything a movie could want a bit of mystery sex intrigue and murder. There will need to be a pretty good movie to replace this classic from the top as one of the greatest alltime thrillers. Nick Curran is a disgraced San Francisco police detective who helps investigate the murder of a prominent city official. Curran has a history of alcoholism and drug abuse although he is clean now. Catherine Tramell the chief suspect a spoiled rich girl with a background in psychology is toying with Curran's mind. When Curran is taken off the case he enters into a dangerous relationship with Tramell which could have bad implications. Soon everyone Curran comes into contact with turns into a suspect.Undoubtedly this movie is most famous for it's high level sex scenes that it contains. While I did enjoy them they are overrated just a fraction. I must admit Sharon Stone has an incredible body and she certainly knows all the moves. These scenes also turned Michael Douglas into a sex manic of sorts and partially ruined his first marriage to Diandra Luker. Yet they create quite a mood for this film and are the main reason why it was the success it was. The cast was great in this too. Michael Douglas is a Hollywood legend and this film only made him even more popular. His role as a the down and out cop was great. Douglas has some great films to his credit. These include Romancing the Stone Fatal Attraction not to similar to Basic Instinct A Perfect Murder and of recent Traffic alongside his second wife Catherine Zeta Jones and Don't say a word. Then what do you say about Sharon Stone? Before this film she was virtually an unknown then she stormed on to our screens without letting audiences take a breathe. Her film credits include The quick and the dead Total Recall and The Specialist.Other cast members include Jeanne Tripplehorn who played Curran's exwife and Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Garner. Her role made me feel very anxious to realise what was going to happen. The sex scene involving her was a little hard to take. Then you have the good guy of the film Gus played by George Dzundza but the way we see him go is also too much to handle. One other actress I did recognise was Leilani Saralle who played one of Catherine Tramell's gay lover's Roxy. Basic Instinct had a very good director that being Paul Verhoven. He made this film extremely well and any other director might have got it wrong. He has made some other good films including Robo Cop Starship Troopers and Total Recall. He did do one big flop that being Showgirls. He commented on that film by saying I think it was bad too'. I am sorry Paul but you were right. Basic Intinct's script was pretty good in how it left you dangling. It was like you were in a big game of cat and mouse. I can understand that some people might not like it for that reason but I thought it was good. The movie also had a great musical score attached to it giving the movie a chilling feel to it. So all in all Basic Instinct is a film that I will always remember. It was so controversial that where I come from I remember people needed to show there ID to get into the local cinemas because of its sexual and violent content. I don't blame the cinemas for doing so because it is not suitable for young eyes to see. If you want to watch a great thriller then sit down and watch Basic Instinct. Trust me its nice'!Rating 5 stars or 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure its dirty minded and extremely violent but underneath all of Paul Verhoevens trademark sleaze there is a great film noir thriller to be seen. The film has a sense of an old 40's or 50's film noir but of course with the 90's boundaries in taste and graphic nudity. The story is quite involving and there are plenty of twists and turns and unresolved endings. Michael Douglas is good in his role and must have really enjoyed film shagging Jean Tripplehorn and Sharon Stone while it is Stone who steals the show as the writer Catherine whose books write about murders that are apparently being copied by a murdering female. Its very steamy but the cinematography and the score are all very good and the film is more clever than merely TA. It is a film that has spawned many inferior clones usually TV movies starring melon chested playboy queen Shannon Tweed. ".

	schema:reviewBody "I gave this film a 10 in part because 12 years after seeing it for the first  and only  time it still evokes a spontaneous wow it was great whenever I think of it. The screenplay was truly excellent in its genre leaving you guessing and revising your guess throughout the film. It should also be commended for daring to portray an uber homosexual with no apology to either conservative homophobes or the zealously politically correct.Douglas merits praise for this performance which was so good that I was able to put my intense dislike of him for personal reasons aside and worry about the safety of the character he portrayed in the film.As for Sharon Stone it only takes one performance like the one in this film to make an indelible mark. Superb. I had no idea who Sharon Stone was when I went to see this film and I left the theater as mesmerized by her screen presence as I had been by Faye Dunaway's in Bonnie and Clyde and Kristin Scott Thomas in Brideshead Revisited. The caliber of her breakthrough in this film matches that of Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential and Angelina Jolie in Girl Interrupted.In much the same way as Glenn Close set the standard for a certain character type in Fatal Attraction Stone established the standard for another character type against which all subsequent interpretations should be measured. If it were only to see how beautiful Stone is in this film it would be well worth the rental. She leaves as unforgettably stylish and seductive an impression as Rita Hayworth's Gilda did in a role that might be thought of as the antiGilda.".

	schema:reviewBody "A man is viciously stabbed to death with an ice pick while having sexby the way that's the opening scene! Det. Nick Curran Michael Douglas and his partner George Dzundzu get involved with the case and its prime suspectCatherine Tramell Sharon Stone. Then the story kicks into high gear with many twists and turns...One of the most talked about films of 1992. This movie REALLY pushed the R rating to its limits a sex scene and killing were cut by a few seconds and started controversy over supposedly being homophobic. I'll deal with that right awayI'm a openly gay man and proud of it. I found nothing homophobic about this film back in 1992 and I still don't. SPOILER!!!! Yes Stone's character is bisexual and she is a killer. Yes her lesbian lover dies. But does anyone realize that Stone is the most likable character in the movie and that Douglas and Dzundzu are foulmouthed jerks? Also Stones sexual inclination is never a specific plot pointshe just happens to be biit's treated casually. And it's just a movie! I have many other gay friends who saw it and have no problem with it either. SPOILER END!!!!The plot is intricate with many turns you don't see comingI had to see the film THREE times to figure it out completely. Here are a few random thoughts about thisIt has a great score by Jerry Goldsmith. Starts right out with a sex murder wasting no time! There's absolutely stunning cinematography by Jan de Bont. Welldirected by Paul Verhoeven. I love Stone's look when she heard about the first murder. The constant references to Hitchcock's Vertigo were numerouscheck out Stone's outfits. Dorothy Malone pops up in a small part. The interrogation scene with Stone is just superband look close when she crosses her legs! The sex sequence between Douglas and Stone is VERY explicit. Douglas should think twice about ever doing a nude scene again there were giggles when I saw it in a theatre.Acting is great too. Douglas has played this part before and he's WAY too old but he pulls it off. He is very convincingly loosing it at the end when things start unraveling. Stone is just incredible as Tramellsexy frightening just unbelievable. Her best performance so far. Jeanne Tripplehorn in her first movie lends strength in a strong supporting role. Not all of the cast likes this film. Stone has said it's a stupid film and Douglas still won't talk to Verhoeven or Stone and Tripplehorn won't talk about it at all. Also Joe Esztherhaus script is twisty but the dialogue is pretty laughableit seems dumbed down so everybody will understand it.Still this is a sexy violent strong thrillerone of the best ever done. Try to see the unrated version. Avoid at all costs the TV version.".

This film angered some gay activists because of its negative portrayal of female sexuality. I don't think there was any disrespect intended but it seemed that way because of the careless handling of the female characters. The character of Roxy a girlfriend of Stone's character would have been much more fleshedout in a better film.So for all the thrill of the sex scenes and the suspense the viewer is left at the end saying merely Okay I've seen it.

Douglas is super the tight hard boiled dialogue and dramatic scenes are excellent the music score is eery and perfect for this type of movie and the whole production design keeps the viewer spellbound throughout. The only real hangup is the icepick at the very end. It throws the viewer into a state of limbo and leaves the ending a bit unresolved in the viewer's mind.

	schema:headline " Gershwin Paris Astaire Audrey Hepburn Richard Avedon and JohnPaul Sartre";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1957 musical is a little odd. It has a title based on an original 1920s Gershwin musical that included the title song which starred Fred and Adele Astaire. It was a musical and scenic valentine to France but only one tune in it deals with France  Bonjour Paris!. It is a spoof on the modern fashion magazines fashions in general and advertising  but the spoof while sharp at times is never pushed. The opening sequence Think Pink describes how Kay Thompson plans a campaign to make the American woman go for pink clothes accessories toothpaste etc. only to admit to her assistant she personally loathes the color. It takes full advantage of the attractive face and features of Hepburn who is convinced to be a model and help push a new line of fashions in Paris. And it makes two characters into imitations of Richard Avedon the photographer Astaire as Dick Avory and JeanPaul Sartre Michel Auclair as Prof. Emile Flostre. Avedon was a rarity  a fashion photographer who became a great artistic portrait photographer. Astaire never is shown taking pictures of great or famous people in the film but several times he demonstrates a refinement that separates him from the rest of Kay Thompson's entourage most of whom don't care what havoc they cause as long as they get their jobs done. He also has enough sense to question Hepburn's accepting of empathicalism and it's viability. Witness his moment in the bistro pouring wine to the two old codgers who are quite pleasant to him while he insults them in English. Hepburn of course is so insistent on the validity of her philosophical beliefs that she rejects Astaire's warnings and jeopardizes the fashion show.The final blow seemingly to the Astaire  Hepburn relationship is when he confronts Flostre at the author's home. He knocks out the Professor and his brutality demolishes the relationship with Hepburn. But within minutes Hepburn sees another side to Flostre which is unexpected and suddenly realizes that Astaire may be right after all.The character of Flostre is obviously based on that of JeanPaul Sartre the founder of existentialism. Based on in some details but not in theory. Empathicalism has to do with trying to empathize with others so as to have a proper response to their needs and aspirations. Existentialism has to do with An introspective humanism or theory of man which expresses the individual's intense awareness of his contingency and freedom a theory which states that the existence of the individual precedes his essence. This is from Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary. Sartre has a more complex view of man and society and one can plow through BEING AND NOTHINGNESS to try to understand it. In fact some critics have wondered if the Nobel Prize Winner eventually got very wrong headed about his theory. But he certainly seems a meatier philosopher than his celluloid copy.But Flostre does have the trappings of Sartre on him. He is revered by his followers world wide such as Hepburn. He is a man with sexual appetite as Sartre was with his long time companion and fellow writer Simone Beauvoir. And there is some traces of an anticapitalist even antiAmerican attitude in him. It is not definitely pushed but when Astaire and Thompson break into his house during a party they pretend they are American share cropper singers whom Flostre had brought to France to perform for his guests. Now we never hear what this actual pair actually would sing but judging from their background they would have to throw in some protest songs. Sartre was very critical of the U.S.A. and capitalism today his fans have to explain Sartre's willingness to accept Russian imperialist moves under Communism in the 1940s 1950s and 1960s  they find it very hard to do so. On the whole the parts of the film work well so I give it seven stars. Kay Thompson is best recalled for being the creator of the little girl at the Plaza Eloise but she shows here a highly entertaining performance as Maggie Prescott the editor who pushes and loathes pink. The film would have been better if somehow Avedon's portrait photography had been brought into the story possibly in a final scene with Flostre as his subject. However even without such a sequence the film is rewarding to watch especially in the musical numbers. Astaire does equally well with Thompson and with Hepburn as his partners here.".

It takes full advantage of the attractive face and features of Hepburn who is convinced to be a model and help push a new line of fashions in Paris. And it makes two characters into imitations of Richard Avedon the photographer Astaire as Dick Avory and JeanPaul Sartre Michel Auclair as Prof. Emile Flostre. Avedon was a rarity  a fashion photographer who became a great artistic portrait photographer. Astaire never is shown taking pictures of great or famous people in the film but several times he demonstrates a refinement that separates him from the rest of Kay Thompson's entourage most of whom don't care what havoc they cause as long as they get their jobs done. He also has enough sense to question Hepburn's accepting of empathicalism and it's viability. Witness his moment in the bistro pouring wine to the two old codgers who are quite pleasant to him while he insults them in English. Hepburn of course is so insistent on the validity of her philosophical beliefs that she rejects Astaire's warnings and jeopardizes the fashion show.The final blow seemingly to the Astaire  Hepburn relationship is when he confronts Flostre at the author's home. He knocks out the Professor and his brutality demolishes the relationship with Hepburn. But within minutes Hepburn sees another side to Flostre which is unexpected and suddenly realizes that Astaire may be right after all.The character of Flostre is obviously based on that of JeanPaul Sartre the founder of existentialism. Based on in some details but not in theory. Empathicalism has to do with trying to empathize with others so as to have a proper response to their needs and aspirations. Existentialism has to do with An introspective humanism or theory of man which expresses the individual's intense awareness of his contingency and freedom a theory which states that the existence of the individual precedes his essence. This is from Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary. Sartre has a more complex view of man and society and one can plow through BEING AND NOTHINGNESS to try to understand it. In fact some critics have wondered if the Nobel Prize Winner eventually got very wrong headed about his theory. But he certainly seems a meatier philosopher than his celluloid copy.But Flostre does have the trappings of Sartre on him. He is revered by his followers world wide such as Hepburn. He is a man with sexual appetite as Sartre was with his long time companion and fellow writer Simone Beauvoir. And there is some traces of an anticapitalist even antiAmerican attitude in him. It is not definitely pushed but when Astaire and Thompson break into his house during a party they pretend they are American share cropper singers whom Flostre had brought to France to perform for his guests. Now we never hear what this actual pair actually would sing but judging from their background they would have to throw in some protest songs. Sartre was very critical of the U.S.A. and capitalism today his fans have to explain Sartre's willingness to accept Russian imperialist moves under Communism in the 1940s 1950s and 1960s  they find it very hard to do so. On the whole the parts of the film work well so I give it seven stars. Kay Thompson is best recalled for being the creator of the little girl at the Plaza Eloise but she shows here a highly entertaining performance as Maggie Prescott the editor who pushes and loathes pink. The film would have been better if somehow Avedon's portrait photography had been brought into the story possibly in a final scene with Flostre as his subject. However even without such a sequence the film is rewarding to watch especially in the musical numbers. Astaire does equally well with Thompson and with Hepburn as his partners here.";

Unlike Gene Kelly Fred Astaire's dancing seemed natural. Astaire spent as much time learning his steps as Kelly but the viewer always got the idea that Kelly had learned the steps whereas Astaire appeared to be inventing as he shuffled along. Astaire's early movies were made during the age of the crooner yet his singing could not be pigeonholed into that category. Like his dancing his singing flowed naturally and freely.The story to Funny Face is a simple one a musical variation on Shaw's Pigmalion which was already a hit musical My Fair Lady turned into another Audrey Hepburn vehicle a few years after Funny Face. What makes this movie stand out is the spellbinding choreography by Astaire Et.Al. Ray June's cinematography George Gershwin music such as the title song the direction of Stanley Donen and the Paris fashions by Hubert de Givenchy. The colors are breathtaking. Note the incredible images of the opening dance Pink. The sights of Paris have never appeared more intriguing. And who would have thought a song and dance in a photographer's dark room could be so delightful? One of my favorite numbers from Funny Face is the hilarious yet imaginative parody of modern dance performed by Audrey Hepburn in a Paris cabaret. The parody can also be interpreted as poking harmless fun at Gene Kelly's balletstyle dancing in An American in Paris. This scene shows the versatility of the multitalented Hepburn. Teaming her with the also multitalented Astaire makes for a winning combination. Why the hoopla about their age differences? Do film reviewers not live in the real world anymore?This is a much better musical than many of the more touted ones of the 1950's. If you're not careful this little screen gem may slip past you.".

The noticeable age gap between Astaire and Hepburn makes their romance unconvincing but watching the two of them own the screen in their inimitable way remains a joy.

There are occasional longueurs in the story it has after all the thinnest of plots flimsily stretched to a 100 minute running time but there's always a lively scene or song just round the corner to liven things up whenever tedium looms. Overall Funny Face is a classy show. As mentioned though it could have been an absolute classic. It's reminiscent of a damn good golf player who can hit the green every time but cannot seem to sink the putts that would make him a world beater.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd seen this film once before back in the days when videotapes on a CRT television screen were the only home theater. Doesn't really seem that long ago does it? Well I picked up the DVD in the bargain bin of a local store recently and watched it tonight on the widescreen monitor attached to my computer.What a difference! The framing of all the shots suddenly makes sense as does the absolutely amazing cinematography. It's a film built around photography and that concept is reflected in the photography itself. Set design choreography camera angles  it's all there. Having once been a professional photographer myself I could really appreciate all the care that went into photographing this film.I was also very pleasantly surprised at how well Audrey Hepburn acquitted herself here. The role doesn't require much in the way of acting ability but she gives it all she's got and makes Jo not only believable but sympathetic. She's not really a singer but she handles her singing parts creditably. And though she isn't really a dancer either her dance numbers are outstanding. Ginger Rogers she ain't but even next to Fred Astaire her footwork is way above average. And how graceful she is! She carries off even her solo dance number with a balletic poise and flexibility that astonished me.As for Fred Astaire himself he never at any point made a convincing romantic lead to me. Though a magnificent dancer his screen persona was too much the cold fish to really play a passionate lover as Gene Kelly certainly could. And his moment of Gosh I never realized it before but I must really be in love with this girl is just too much of an eyeroller. Even Laurence Olivier couldn't have pulled that one off.The multitalented Kay Thompson it need hardly be said more than holds her own in the acting singing and dancing categories.The script is by turns funny banal emotional and weak. Funny when it's gently skewering the fashion industry and selfrighteous pseudointellectualism banal in its clichd and predictable love story emotional when Audrey Hepburn gets to hint at the powerful emotions she can't reveal and weak in its rapturous Oui oui it's gay Paree! swoonfest over arriving in Paris.So no it's not one of the great classical musicals even the chosen Gershwin songs were far from the best selections from that vast repertoire. But you've got to take the bad with the good and the good is very good indeed. Recommended.PS Oh and for God's sake folks  puhleeze get off that age difference high horse. If that's the sort of thing upsets you so much maybe you shouldn't be watching movies at all.".

The framing of all the shots suddenly makes sense as does the absolutely amazing cinematography. It's a film built around photography and that concept is reflected in the photography itself. Set design choreography camera angles  it's all there. Having once been a professional photographer myself I could really appreciate all the care that went into photographing this film.I was also very pleasantly surprised at how well Audrey Hepburn acquitted herself here. The role doesn't require much in the way of acting ability but she gives it all she's got and makes Jo not only believable but sympathetic. She's not really a singer but she handles her singing parts creditably. And though she isn't really a dancer either her dance numbers are outstanding. Ginger Rogers she ain't but even next to Fred Astaire her footwork is way above average. And how graceful she is! She carries off even her solo dance number with a balletic poise and flexibility that astonished me.As for Fred Astaire himself he never at any point made a convincing romantic lead to me. Though a magnificent dancer his screen persona was too much the cold fish to really play a passionate lover as Gene Kelly certainly could. And his moment of Gosh I never realized it before but I must really be in love with this girl is just too much of an eyeroller. Even Laurence Olivier couldn't have pulled that one off.The multitalented Kay Thompson it need hardly be said more than holds her own in the acting singing and dancing categories.The script is by turns funny banal emotional and weak. Funny when it's gently skewering the fashion industry and selfrighteous pseudointellectualism banal in its clichd and predictable love story emotional when Audrey Hepburn gets to hint at the powerful emotions she can't reveal and weak in its rapturous Oui oui it's gay Paree! swoonfest over arriving in Paris.So no it's not one of the great classical musicals even the chosen Gershwin songs were far from the best selections from that vast repertoire. But you've got to take the bad with the good and the good is very good indeed. Recommended.PS Oh and for God's sake folks  puhleeze get off that age difference high horse. If that's the sort of thing upsets you so much maybe you shouldn't be watching movies at all.";

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw Funny Face and I was just enchanted from start to finish. This beautiful sublime lighthearted musical pairs the incomparable Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn. It was the perfect vehicle for Hepburn and in my humble opinion Funny Face ties with The Band Wagon as the best Fred Astaire musical of the 50's.Funny Face tells the story of Jo Stockton Hepburn a deep and outspoken Beatnik bookseller and Dick Avery Astaire a raffish but compassionate photographer for Quality magazine. Quality is run by its hilariously vapid editor Maggie Presscott Kay Thompson a real scene stealer. After some unusual circumstances Dick convinces the waifish Jo that she has model potential and should go to Paris with him. The plot is sometimes a moot point as soon as they get there but what happens after that is song dance great clothes and a beautiful romantic song and dance with Audrey and Fred on a grassy knoll. There's also a rather famous scene with Audrey descending a flight of stairs in a gorgeous red strapless dress with white gloves.I've seen a lot of criticism for Funny Face and I disagree that it's shallow and antiintellectual. What separates this movie from say She's All That is that Jo only goes to Paris as a means to an end for modelling which Jo is vehemently against. She never compromises who she is and doesn't officially fall for Dick until much later so romance is never a motive for anything. Also Dick admires Jo's inner beauty even before she becomes a stunner. They are much more likable and romantic leads than in most makeover movies. Please don't overanalyze Funny Face just sit back and let yourself be spellbound. Trust me s'wonderful!!".

You've also got the whole Gershwin songbook to pick from for your soundtrack. You even have the studio agreeing to ferry the whole company to Paris for location filming. Sounds promising?Yeah it did to me too. Quite frankly it's the script and basic plotline that let the rest of the enterprise down. Hepburn plays Jo Stockton an intellectual and we know this because of her lessthangleaming pageboy cut and the drab shapeless grey potato sack she wears... and still looks fabulous in who works in a bookstore. She tries very hard to get her shelves back in shape after Dick Avery Astaire and his entourage from Quality magazine including a manic Kay Thompson as ladyincharge Maggie Prescott descend upon the store for a photoshoot... only for Dick to leave her floundering and singing How Long Has This Been Going On? when he surprises her with a kiss. Still she clings to her empathicalism ideals and agrees to go to Paris for a Quality fashion shoot so that she can meet the father of empathicalism her philosophy of choice of course Professor Emile Flostre Michel Auclair. Dick's charming of Jo continues through the fashion shoot and to the tune of He Loves And She Loves he finally realises he loves her back. But as in all romantic comedies the course of true love never did run smooth and Jo gets upset when Dick tries to warn her off Professor Flostre He's about as interested in your intellect as I am. The inevitable misunderstanding happens between two lovers when Jo refuses to turn up for the final unveiling and Dick is set to take a plane back to New York alone.It's all pretty runofthemill sentimental pablum with an attempt to pass poor writing off as profound themes. I never knew Hepburn was a dancer and she acquits herself rather well in her solo prance through the literally underground French cafe. But reallythe only word for moments like this is 'surreal'. The impetus for the dance doesn't ring true the dance itself is technically accomplished but bewilderingly weird... and well Hepburn may entrance her audience when she's acting but she's not a magnetic dancer not the way say Cyd Charisse is. That apart Thompson and Astaire also suffer in their seriously eccentric duet to Clap Yo' Hands. Partly because Thompson's presence in the film is to me utterly mysterious. Of course she's meant to be the typical musical sidekick see O'Connor Donald SINGIN' IN THE RAIN but she falls far short of the mark. A successful sidekick would light the screen up during his or her soloher Think Pink was frankly frightening and she just wasn't very good in the rest of her numbers. Even her duet with Hepburn How To Be Lovely was running on empty when it started. As for Astairewhat a shame. His talent was put to waste in this film even though he still looks pretty spry and his sense of rhythm is as impeccable as ever. But in Clap Yo' Hands his dancing passes only for mugging and sadly not even intentionally so. Another one for the 'surreal' labelit's evidently TRYING to be witty and avantgarde. And failing miserably. Astaire's own solo number is perfectly executed as usual and he pulls off his coatswirling with great style but one still feels as if some spark in him is still missing. Of all the good material the film had to work with it's really a shame that it never used any of its three principals well.That's not to say the film was beyond all hope It's hard to come out of such a poorlyscripted and thoughtout film on your feet but it's also hard for Astaire and Hepburn to be truly horrifyingly bad... so they're just bland. They do go some way in lending their trademark class to the film for example in the extremely poorlylit darkroom courtship dance. It seems very good from what little I can make out through all the murky black and red... it's a scene just crying out for digital reenhancement so that we can actually see what's going on. But it's still quite nicelyexecuted. There's also a flash of the magic that this film could have had the two times Jo and Dick walk together behind the little Parisian church with her in all her wedding finery. When he realises that she's fallen for him for real he sweetly serenades her with the song He Loves And She Loves and the raft across the river is a very sweet pretty touch.Given the pedigree of this film I really had been expecting a lot more than I actually got. It's not horrible but nor is it fantastic. Probably one to watch if you're a fan of Astaire's or Hepburn's but I doubt I'll be pulling this one out for a reviewing any time soon. 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an odd and appealing little movie.It is a musical from an era when they were losing audiences. It features the king of such things at the time an aging Fred Astair at 58 and substantially heavier than his prime. He has relatively few dance numbers and none of those are clever or graceful.Instead this whole thing is cleverly engineered to exploit the rather unique traits of Audrey Hepburn. She was in the middle of a remarkable career based more on simple charm than presence at acting. When charm dominates the thing you have to be extraordinary. Who else can you place in this category? Clara Bow and Louise Brooks probably. Judy Garland when singing.There's no one like this today hasn't been for decades. Perhaps we filter them out as we demand other qualities. Still it is worth watching her to see just what it is that makes her so mesmerizing. Her face is oddly misproportioned with a shallow jaw heavy brow and commanding nose over that huge mouth. Its almost a caricature of a face so that when she smiles she lights up the whole screen.And it seems to be more genuinely in her character than when Julia Roberts does a similar thing with a similar face. She has three faces against which she cast all her poses all of them open to us. Smiling crying or concerned and listening. Its an amazing limited vocabulary though one more than Kate Hepburn managed to wring a career from.I think this and Breakfast at Tiffany's may be her best films because it is as if they were grown especially for her abilities to endear us to her through her face.The setup in Tiffany's is complex a callgirl in a movie who creates her own movie. This is more straightforward. She is discovered by a fashion photographer who  in the body of the movie  photographs her in all sorts of romantic settings. The beginning is just in getting her to Paris for this. The end is just the standard love distance reconciliation drill. But that second act is terrific he places her in scenes to photograph. We see the setup with terrific clothes the actual shooting process and then the final print. I guess eight or nine times.Regular tedg readers will know I'm a student of folding in films. Here's an example. The point of this movie is to get us to fall in love. So while we watch beautiful romantic photography we have a surrogate in the film who does the same. As he watches and falls in love so do we. A simple and effective narrative device.Hey and the subplot involves her fascination with the philosophy of empathy. get it?Oddly this conflates beatniks philosophy and the French which in my experience have little to do with one another. No matter the result is an excuse for Audrey to perform  without Fred  the dance highlight of the film. Who would have suspected that such a gaunt frame grown for static poses would come across so effectively in a modern routine that intends to poke fun at itself.You must see this for the exploitation of an odd and unique face. And that dance in the beatnik club.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "From director Stanley Donen Singin' in the Rain Seven Brides for Seven Brothers Charade I certainly recognised the title but other than that I wasn't aware of any other details but it sounded like a film that should be seen. Basically Dick Avery Fred Astaire works as a photographer for fashion magazine Quality and suggests to publisher and editor Maggie Prescott Kay Thompson finding a backdrop both beautiful and intellectual. They choose a Manhattan neighbourhood bookstore in Greenwich Village and despite the clerk and amateur philosopher Jo Stockton Audrey Hepburn protesting they go ahead and Dick has her in a photo too. Dick stays behind for a little to help clear up the terrible mess the magazine crew have left behind and he gives her a little kiss that makes her feel special for that small amount of time. Having developed the photo Dick thinks that Jo has a very intriguing funny face that has potential so they lure her to the studio to offer her a modelling contract and eventually she accepts. She may have accepted because of the idea of travelling to Paris but she soon gets used to and enjoys the posing that comes with it especially when it is with Dick they are falling in love. One night Jo hears that the philosopher she has always wanted to see Prof. Emile Flostre Michel Auclair is giving a lecture at a caf near the fashion gala she is set for so she goes forgets the gala and ends up in an argument with Dick. She goes back to the Professor and Maggie and Dick after a song and dance manage to get in to get Jo back and when he comes round from being knocked out he tries to make a pass at her she whacks her idol with a vase. Before the crew of Quality magazine leave Paris there is one final fashion show but Maggie and Jo find out that Dick has plans to leave on a plane but Jo agrees to do the runway showcatwalk before running out to go and find him. In the end after it looks like she's too late but in fact Dick hasn't left at all he goes to the one place he can think of that she would be alone and they reunite for the loving end of the film. Also starring Robert Flemyng as Paul Duval Dovima as Marion and Virginia Gibson as Babs. Hepburn is beautiful and lovable as the knowledgeable new to fashion model and a good singer too her voice was dubbed for My Fair Lady due to it not being the sort required i.e. powerful Astaire is a nice guy with plenty of moves and witty dialogue they make a good couple on screen and Thompson is pretty good too. The music and songs are catchy in their own ways the dance and choreography is well done by the two lead stars and the Paris locations are good viewing all in all a good oldfashioned musical comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art DirectionSet Decoration Best Cinematography Best Costume Design and Best Writing Story and Screenplay  Written Directly for the Screen. Fred Astaire was number 81 and Audrey Hepburn number 13 on The Greatest Movie Stars and Hepburn was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and Astaire was number 5 on 100 Years 100 Stars  Men. Very good!".

It's as if Funny Face is pretending to be such a vehicle and she works hard at being Audrey Hepburn.  It's just that what's she's doing isn't all that worthy of her to begin with.

	schema:reviewBody "Certain things are absolutely timeless and then there are others that just do not translate. I was studying abroad in Paris when my mother sent me a box set of Audrey Hepburn films. Learning Funny Face took place predominately in my hostcity I popped it in. I am willing to make the occasional logic leap and accept some fluff and I do understand Funny Face wasn't attempting to sweep the Oscars but there is a limit. And while there are some fabulous scenes overall I was disappointed.Funny Face in brief begins with the owner of Quality magazine Maggie Prescott and her photographer Dick Avery trying to find a new face to shake the fashion world. It is found in the young Jo Stockton an educated introverted and supposedly homely girl working in a bookstore. She dreams of going to Paris to meet Professor Flostre the founder of the philosophy she studies Empathicalism. Though at first reluctant Jo agrees to model for Quality's photo shoot and fashion show as both events are in Paris. Sparks fly between Jo and Dick but jealousy reigns for the latter when Jo meets her professor and the man has more than talking philosophy on his mind. Hijinks song and dance ensue.As to my criticismsMy first issue came from the extraordinarily obvious age disparity between Miss Hepburn playing bookshop employeeturnedcover girl Jo Stockton and Fred Astaire playing photographer Dick Avery. Both are great actors and it isn't the first time the former was paired with an older leading man but this is a thirty year age gap and it shows. I might have been more willing to go with it if at some point the age difference had been addressed but it's conspicuously left off like the audience won't notice if no one mentions it. In fact I almost found it creepy to see Fred Astaire plant one on Audrey in one of the opening scenes. Their chemistry often seemed forced and quite honestly I thought Astaire and Kay Thompson playing Maggie Prescott and nearer his contemporary had far more spark between them.The makers of this film again gave little credit to their audience by presenting the notion that putting Hepburn in a bizarre oversized wool vest and shapeless shift made her dowdy and unattractive. And was it really necessary to play on the clich that a girl who enjoys to read and demonstrates the general ability to think must be a sexually unattractive virginal frump? Admittedly I live in a different generation but the film bothered me by hammering in the idea that a truly happy woman gives up her books and devotes herself to buying designer ensembles and picking up her husband's laundry. I am continually floored when older films make comedic references to spousal abuse and was so here when Dick Avery is searching for Jo in the streets of Montmartre and passes an arguing French couple the male of which solves the dispute by smacking his girl across the faceshe responds by lovingly falling into his arms. I was particularly galled by Astaire's line concerning Jo's sexcrazed professor idol Flostre Michel Auclair He's about as interested in your intellect as I am! No silly a man doesn't want you to thinkjust stand there and look pretty like a china doll. This is what made no sense to methey spend the beginning of the film struggling to find a fresh face with some substance behind it only to transform it into the stereotypical vapid pretty girl who can only achieve real fulfillment if some man deigns to make her a wife.The strange subplot mocking beatniks led to some confusion. I am not an authority on the subject but last time I checked the beat generation was primarily focused in the United States and did not exactly sweep young Parisian intellectuals. It almost seemed placed there just so the filmmakers could have a go at making it look ridiculous and give Thompson and Astaire the chance for their energetic song and dance routine. The very fact that Funny Face is a musical was oddthe leading pair while not tonedeaf are not singers. And why when Dick serenades Jo outside her hotel exactly why if they're all on the photo shoot do they all seem to be booked in separate hotels? does he act like a matador? Spain and its bullfights are NEAR France they are not IN it. And during his matador number why in the world does a cow come through?? Paris even in 1957 was a very metropolitan capitallive barnyard animals in the streets are a relatively rare occurrence.Absolutely hysterical was the number Bonjour Paris! in which Maggie Dick and Jo bright eyed and ready to go even after at least eight hours on a plane wildly dance through the city streets magically jumping between the spreadout landmarks and proudly proclaiming themselves as American tourists. Their dance in the elevator on the Eiffel Tower was particularly amusingI'm not sure what the crowds were like back in the 1950's but nowadays those things pack you in like sardinesyou're lucky if you can MOVE your foot let alone do a couple pirouettes.All that said I will acknowledge the costumes particular those by Givenchy for Audrey Hepburn and shots of Paris are beyond fabulousthe best part of the film is Hepburn's photo shoots interspersing her ensembles in the Louvre Opra and other major sites in the city. The dance sequence with Thompson and Astaire is greatHepburn's famous and lately popularized by the Gap Basil Metabolism dance is...unique. Amongst all that was bizarre it does have a few moments of charm. To the potential viewerdo not watch this expecting any sort of cinematic masterpiece and know that not all t he jokes have carried over well across the halfcentury since it was released. It's certainly an attentiongrabber if nothing else.".

And while there are some fabulous scenes overall I was disappointed.Funny Face in brief begins with the owner of Quality magazine Maggie Prescott and her photographer Dick Avery trying to find a new face to shake the fashion world. It is found in the young Jo Stockton an educated introverted and supposedly homely girl working in a bookstore. She dreams of going to Paris to meet Professor Flostre the founder of the philosophy she studies Empathicalism. Though at first reluctant Jo agrees to model for Quality's photo shoot and fashion show as both events are in Paris. Sparks fly between Jo and Dick but jealousy reigns for the latter when Jo meets her professor and the man has more than talking philosophy on his mind. Hijinks song and dance ensue.As to my criticismsMy first issue came from the extraordinarily obvious age disparity between Miss Hepburn playing bookshop employeeturnedcover girl Jo Stockton and Fred Astaire playing photographer Dick Avery. Both are great actors and it isn't the first time the former was paired with an older leading man but this is a thirty year age gap and it shows. I might have been more willing to go with it if at some point the age difference had been addressed but it's conspicuously left off like the audience won't notice if no one mentions it. In fact I almost found it creepy to see Fred Astaire plant one on Audrey in one of the opening scenes. Their chemistry often seemed forced and quite honestly I thought Astaire and Kay Thompson playing Maggie Prescott and nearer his contemporary had far more spark between them.The makers of this film again gave little credit to their audience by presenting the notion that putting Hepburn in a bizarre oversized wool vest and shapeless shift made her dowdy and unattractive. And was it really necessary to play on the clich that a girl who enjoys to read and demonstrates the general ability to think must be a sexually unattractive virginal frump? Admittedly I live in a different generation but the film bothered me by hammering in the idea that a truly happy woman gives up her books and devotes herself to buying designer ensembles and picking up her husband's laundry. I am continually floored when older films make comedic references to spousal abuse and was so here when Dick Avery is searching for Jo in the streets of Montmartre and passes an arguing French couple the male of which solves the dispute by smacking his girl across the faceshe responds by lovingly falling into his arms. I was particularly galled by Astaire's line concerning Jo's sexcrazed professor idol Flostre Michel Auclair He's about as interested in your intellect as I am! No silly a man doesn't want you to thinkjust stand there and look pretty like a china doll. This is what made no sense to methey spend the beginning of the film struggling to find a fresh face with some substance behind it only to transform it into the stereotypical vapid pretty girl who can only achieve real fulfillment if some man deigns to make her a wife.The strange subplot mocking beatniks led to some confusion. I am not an authority on the subject but last time I checked the beat generation was primarily focused in the United States and did not exactly sweep young Parisian intellectuals. It almost seemed placed there just so the filmmakers could have a go at making it look ridiculous and give Thompson and Astaire the chance for their energetic song and dance routine. The very fact that Funny Face is a musical was oddthe leading pair while not tonedeaf are not singers. And why when Dick serenades Jo outside her hotel exactly why if they're all on the photo shoot do they all seem to be booked in separate hotels? does he act like a matador? Spain and its bullfights are NEAR France they are not IN it. And during his matador number why in the world does a cow come through?? Paris even in 1957 was a very metropolitan capitallive barnyard animals in the streets are a relatively rare occurrence.Absolutely hysterical was the number Bonjour Paris! in which Maggie Dick and Jo bright eyed and ready to go even after at least eight hours on a plane wildly dance through the city streets magically jumping between the spreadout landmarks and proudly proclaiming themselves as American tourists. Their dance in the elevator on the Eiffel Tower was particularly amusingI'm not sure what the crowds were like back in the 1950's but nowadays those things pack you in like sardinesyou're lucky if you can MOVE your foot let alone do a couple pirouettes.All that said I will acknowledge the costumes particular those by Givenchy for Audrey Hepburn and shots of Paris are beyond fabulousthe best part of the film is Hepburn's photo shoots interspersing her ensembles in the Louvre Opra and other major sites in the city. The dance sequence with Thompson and Astaire is greatHepburn's famous and lately popularized by the Gap Basil Metabolism dance is...unique. Amongst all that was bizarre it does have a few moments of charm. To the potential viewerdo not watch this expecting any sort of cinematic masterpiece and know that not all t he jokes have carried over well across the halfcentury since it was released. It's certainly an attentiongrabber if nothing else.";

That's the best way I can describe it. The vacant radiationladen Chernobyl is a wonderfully creepy place for a horror movie to take place. It sets up with a group of friends touring Europe and one of them has the bright idea to go on an extreme tour so they make a quick pit stop at Chernobyl. They see an abandoned ferris wheel they explore the empty buildings they see the remains of dead animals  it sets up an effectively creepy atmosphere. One of the girls takes a picture and something odd can be seen in a window. Weird right? Well apparently not weird enough for her to say anything. After they snap a few pictures with the beautifully bleak backdrop of dead trees and industrial smoke stacks they go back to the tour van. Then the entire bottom of the movie drops.From there it's clich city. Cars not starting people going places they shouldn't people splitting up when they shouldn't be  everything gets so dumb so quickly it's unreal. You stop caring about the characters after a while because they're making stupid decisions so there's no one to root for. The only character with any personality was the tour guide and he is hardly used so we're left with six unlikable people struggling to find their way out of the city while getting picked off one by one. It simply isn't interesting. There are no scares and there is little to no suspense. It's just shhh I hear something... and then oh no something's around the corner and then they get attacked and it's like 'well yeah of course that's going to happen'. It's too predictable for it to be scary and it's too disjointed to make it unsettling. It's just watching and waiting for these characters to die so the movie can end.The disjointedness mainly comes from the directing. The first shot leads you to believe it's a foundfootage movie but it isn't. It is just shot that way  shaky cam quick movements no clear view of anything really. It just makes no sense because we know someone's holding the camera and it acts as a person but the group of people are oblivious to it so it's like an invisible mute character that allows us to see through its pointofview. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to film it that way because it gets noticeably worse as the movie goes on The more stressed the characters are the worst the camera work gets. It's incredibly annoying.Which leads me to believe the only thing the writers had for Chernobyl Diaries was its premise  a group of kids stranded in Chernobyl. Then they were like well now that they're stranded in this creepy radioactive vacant city... let's just have them run around and get killed off one by one until the end. It's just lazy writing. The entire third act feels rushed not to mention the horribly anticlimactic ending. Chernobyl Diaries is a flop uninspired boring and worst of all completely unscary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bradley Parker's Chernobyl Diaries kicks off with a happygolucky montage of American Eurotrippers goofing around to Supergrass's Alright. It's a sequence you'd even groan about if your good friends whipped it together on iMovie. The video diary aspect of the film's title is established here and soon after the overconfident douchey horror clich Paul Jonathan Sadowskicharms ? his brother's two friends into joining an extreme tour into Pripyat.Haven't heard of Pripyat or Chernobyl? The writers were thinking of you Paul Who here's heard of Chernobyl? Natalie Isn't that where the nuclear disaster happened?. I couldn't decide if Natalie was being written as a horror ditz she wasn't or if the expositional writing was beyond awful probably. However in retrospect I wonder how many teens in the audience actually need Chernobyl explained to them? Near the end of the film when two of the protagonists find themselves inside the ghostly ruins of the nuclear plant the audience is let in on some important information We need to get out of here before the radiation kills us. This is good advice seeing as their faces are melting. I wonder how convincing nuclear lobbyists have been at hiding the dangers of being near radiation.I'm still trying to figure out why this film was made. The eerie presence of offlimit radiation zones has been masterfully handled in Tarkofvki's Stalker which shouldn't even be mentioned next to this stinker. The tension between characters doesn't grow beyond You're never there for me as a brother and falls miles short of the complex relationships in Neil Marshall's spelunking survivalhorror The Descent. John Boorman's Deliverance marks a more nuanced look at extreme tourism where city slickers want to raft down an isolated river system before the whole area is flooded by new dams. The antagonists of the film are the locals who don't take kindly to cocky outsiders and yet have no way of knowing that they will be displaced or drowned see Up the Yangtze for a nonfiction displacement situation in China.The closest Chernobyl Diaries comes to anything beyond a Ukrainian The Hills Have Eyes is the attempt at portraying a conflicted character in Uri the tour guide. He is old enough to have lived through the disaster as well as the shifting political landscape and as an exsoldier he establishes his tour company because of what seems like limited financial options. The film hints at Uri knowing about the hidden radiation victims around Pripyat and yet while the tourists mess around in the abandoned homes the big soldier has tears in his eyes. He also includes an abandoned carnival on the tour alluding to a May Day celebration that never happened. Uri clearly feels for the workers whose lives were destroyed by the meltdown and yet shows very little malice for the disrespectful brats he guides around. However because he is the most physically capable and possesses crucial knowledge of the place he is of course the first to die. Keeping Uri alive would have resulted in a much more interesting film.The writers were clearly not interested in investigating in any thoughtful issues. If the argument is going to be made that this is a horror film and is only produced to scare you I'd suggest you pay your friends a dollar to jump out at you a number of times throughout the day. Excellent horror films are more than a popped paper bag. If we've forgotten about nuclear dangers even amongst the recent Fukushima disaster have we also forgotten how to haunt? None of the bumpsinthenight were as chilling as the sick feeling caused by the depiction of radiation poisoning near the end of the film and even this haunting feeling is tossed out the window for one final scare which shifts all the blame from Western tourists to the bigbadprobablystillourenemygenericEasternEuropeangovernment. The thesis of the film seems to be stay out of dangerous countries that can't even take care of their own issues. I remember looking through one of my dad's National Geographic magazines on Chernobyl and being horrified by the children born with major health problems and missing limbs. The image is still frozen in my mind. I'm not morally upset that the filmmakers turned these children into ravenous killer mutants but I am disappointed at the wasted potential Chernobyl offered the filmmakers. Again the film could have used Uri's heart.There are 439 operating nuclear power plants in the world today and that leaves me uneasy. This movie only leaves me uneasy about the state of film. It's as though Chernobyl Diaries was produced by a pronuclear committee blame is shifted elsewhere and the whole thing is easily forgettable. Cue the Supergrass.BY D.P.

If the argument is going to be made that this is a horror film and is only produced to scare you I'd suggest you pay your friends a dollar to jump out at you a number of times throughout the day. Excellent horror films are more than a popped paper bag. If we've forgotten about nuclear dangers even amongst the recent Fukushima disaster have we also forgotten how to haunt? None of the bumpsinthenight were as chilling as the sick feeling caused by the depiction of radiation poisoning near the end of the film and even this haunting feeling is tossed out the window for one final scare which shifts all the blame from Western tourists to the bigbadprobablystillourenemygenericEasternEuropeangovernment. The thesis of the film seems to be stay out of dangerous countries that can't even take care of their own issues. I remember looking through one of my dad's National Geographic magazines on Chernobyl and being horrified by the children born with major health problems and missing limbs. The image is still frozen in my mind. I'm not morally upset that the filmmakers turned these children into ravenous killer mutants but I am disappointed at the wasted potential Chernobyl offered the filmmakers. Again the film could have used Uri's heart.There are 439 operating nuclear power plants in the world today and that leaves me uneasy. This movie only leaves me uneasy about the state of film. It's as though Chernobyl Diaries was produced by a pronuclear committee blame is shifted elsewhere and the whole thing is easily forgettable. Cue the Supergrass.BY D.P.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of the Paranormal Activity franchise and I also own a copy of Paranormal Entity  a rip off from the original I had the guilty pleasure of actually enjoying. I was surprised to see the writer of P.A. and the rip off P.E. working together to make Chernobyl Diaries. So ignoring the bad reviews and my better judgment I took a chance to see if the movie would live up to it's potential.Like a lot of people I thought the trailer looked interesting and thought it had good potential. The problem is the movie is just an extended version of the trailer. There is nothing else to expect from it. Clich characters and a clich set of monsters that were ripped from the Hills Have Eyes. There's really no plot either what you see in the trailer is exactly what you get. An hour and a half of trailer.Several parts made no sense either. Such as1. The group of people were there at least a day and a half  yet nobody complained about being hungry or thirsty. If I were scared running around breathing hard I would have the nastiest case of cotton mouth. Yet they all seem appear and act well nourished and hydrated. The story starts out as a day trip yet nobody could be bothered to pack a cooler for lunch. Doh!2. There's a scene where a bear surprises them but runs right by as if it doesn't see anyone. Nobody gets cornered mauled or put in danger in any way. It just runs by them and they leave the building like someone farted rather than being in mortal danger. 3. The monsters in this movie are simply people who have been the victims of secret experiments of a nature undisclosed to the audience. So like any 1950s brated horror movie we're supposed to take it on faith that simply because they are mutated humans they are by their nature are irrational murderous and cannibalistic. Logic would deduce that being kept in a lab all your life would give you a taste for cardboard pizza not human flesh.4. We never get to see what they actually look like. All they are is a blur of pale bald heads and dark uniforms. Now I am all for the Less is more approach to FX but it would have been nice to see a scene where they stumble on a dead one so the audience can get a good look at exactly what the protagonists are dealing with. I left the movie theater feeling ripped off because I could barely see what the characters were running from all that time. 5. Stereotyping sucks. The portrayal of Slavic people as rough speaking brutes is annoying and insulting. The portrayal of young women as carefree partiers from Girls Gone Wild is annoying and insulting. It's been done to death in every freaking horror movie since god knows when. Give it a rest already. 6. Yuri seems to know more than what he's letting on yet there is no twist to his character. I half expected to see him pop up later in the movie until they found his body that is and expose himself as an agent in the entire mess. That at least would have been something to break up the monotony.In conclusion this movie wasted it's own potential. The tricks that worked in the Paranormal ActivityParanormal Entity movies do not work here. It works for a ghost or a demon but not a flesh and blood menace. I give this a 3 for competent acting and for a fast moving plot that at least doesn't feel like a complete waste of time even though it is.".

	schema:headline " Nuclear Disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "Another horror movie has donned upon us this holiday weekend and it is called the Chernobyl Diaries. The first trailer I saw for this movie about a month and half ago showed some potential for a true horror fest. However I'll tell you now that this was not the case and instead the movie I saw today was nothing more than a hastily produced horror movie that was rather lame. I know it's disappointing but the truth is Chernobyl diaries like most horror movies are losing their edge. Read on to find out more about this movie.For those of you who haven't seen the trailers for this movie Chernobyl diaries is about a group of seven college kids taking a trip to the Chernobyl reactors. What starts out as a peaceful trip full of picture taking and jokes soon takes a turn for the worst. It seems that Chernobyl is not as abandoned as they think and soon the nightmare within decides to hunt the kids through the destroyed city. Sound familiar? It should since this is the story for a plethora of horror movie it's just taking place at a new location. So what suckered me into seeing it? Aside from being assigned this movie I admit the traps seen in the trailer held potential for a decent and entertaining horror flick. Unfortunately the trailers are once again misleading as Chernobyl Diaries fails to live up to the publicized suspense. Instead the movie is essentially a nonstop cascade of scenes and sequences of the incredibly shallow characters running around from some unseen threat. The camera work of the movie is chaotic Blair Witch and Cloverfield style that is unsteady and jumpy which took away from the detail. I think they mainly did this to help keep the monsters true from in the dark and allow the audience's imagination to fill into the details. While the attempt is worthy of recognition Parker dropped the ball on the delivery making it too fast and shallow. Although the fast pace got us to the ending faster it still made the movie boring as the story progressed. One thought I had after watching this film was maybe Parker was planning on the movie being humorous like the Cabin in The Woods. Unfortunately the comedy aspect of this film was lost on me as well. The stupidity of the college kids and the predictable path they take only made me laugh at how pathetic they were. Unfortunately the dialog was unable to humor me as well and mainly consisted of the kids saying Oh my God! or dropping an F bomb further adding to the disappointment. This dialog combined with the shallow characters also meant the acting didn't have to be that good as well. Although the actors played the college kid roll well the acting was nothing extraordinary and isn't enough to convince me to suggest this movie. As for the ending of the film well to put it nicely it stunk. Once again I was left with questions and a bit cheated out of my money. While I feel some will like the ending or find it funny I can't say I enjoyed it all.Were there any positives to this movie? For me there were only some minor positives I could find. Although I normally don't like the ashy grey and desolate camera colors I felt for this movie they were needed. This camera filter brought the desolate and hopeless city to life which added some emotional chill to the film. A few of the shots also managed to capture the isolation and terror they wanted though they were few and far in between. Despite the simple acting the actresses in the movie were very nice to look at and was the only thing really keeping me in the movie. Finally the short time limit of the movie was for once a good thing as I got out of this movie faster than I expected.To sum up this movie it's one best left to the Redbox. Although I applaud their use of letting the imagination paint the horror the delivery still failed to impress me. Again there are no characters to latch on to in this film and unless you just want to see lots of shadows and hear countless cursing you will want to avoid this. My scores below are the followingHorror 3.03.5 Movie Overall 2.5So check back soon my friends and again keep on enjoying the movies. Or at least try to.".

	onyx:emotionText "Another horror movie has donned upon us this holiday weekend and it is called the Chernobyl Diaries. The first trailer I saw for this movie about a month and half ago showed some potential for a true horror fest. However I'll tell you now that this was not the case and instead the movie I saw today was nothing more than a hastily produced horror movie that was rather lame. I know it's disappointing but the truth is Chernobyl diaries like most horror movies are losing their edge. Read on to find out more about this movie.For those of you who haven't seen the trailers for this movie Chernobyl diaries is about a group of seven college kids taking a trip to the Chernobyl reactors. What starts out as a peaceful trip full of picture taking and jokes soon takes a turn for the worst. It seems that Chernobyl is not as abandoned as they think and soon the nightmare within decides to hunt the kids through the destroyed city. Sound familiar? It should since this is the story for a plethora of horror movie it's just taking place at a new location. So what suckered me into seeing it? Aside from being assigned this movie I admit the traps seen in the trailer held potential for a decent and entertaining horror flick. Unfortunately the trailers are once again misleading as Chernobyl Diaries fails to live up to the publicized suspense. Instead the movie is essentially a nonstop cascade of scenes and sequences of the incredibly shallow characters running around from some unseen threat. The camera work of the movie is chaotic Blair Witch and Cloverfield style that is unsteady and jumpy which took away from the detail. I think they mainly did this to help keep the monsters true from in the dark and allow the audience's imagination to fill into the details. While the attempt is worthy of recognition Parker dropped the ball on the delivery making it too fast and shallow. Although the fast pace got us to the ending faster it still made the movie boring as the story progressed. One thought I had after watching this film was maybe Parker was planning on the movie being humorous like the Cabin in The Woods. Unfortunately the comedy aspect of this film was lost on me as well. The stupidity of the college kids and the predictable path they take only made me laugh at how pathetic they were. Unfortunately the dialog was unable to humor me as well and mainly consisted of the kids saying Oh my God! or dropping an F bomb further adding to the disappointment. This dialog combined with the shallow characters also meant the acting didn't have to be that good as well.

I give credit to this film for being able to do it twice which is more than I can say for Paranormal Activity The Hills have Eyes etc. With that being said the story did focus on a part of history which I'm very much interested in and this might mean I've rated the film more highly than people who came to see a general horror flick.The film centres around a bunch of people illegally going to Chernobyl to explore the area affected by the nuclear disaster before things go drastically wrong and the tried and tested system of people being plucked away is in motion. The film benefits from being mostly in darkness as it helps the jumpy aspects of some of the shockmoments as well as the eerie music and camerawork which kept me on my toes throughout. As with most horror films the major failure of this for me was to produce a storyline past the generic people get attackedkilled by a mysterious things instead following the trend and making me struggle to care about who died. The one thing I will comment on is that there is a good swerve at the end of the film which will throw you off guard but by then you've already seen too much destruction and any hope of a happy ending is virtually impossible. If this film had lasted twenty minutes longer and had used that time to contain some more structure of a plot I would have enjoyed it almost twice as much as I did but I did enjoy it anyway. Would recommend for anyone who is a avid horror junkie looking for something sort of new in terms of the bad guys as well as an interesting take on the effects of the Chernobyl disaster.".

Take this movie for what it is...a simple fun horror movie...not a documentary.";

	schema:reviewBody "Chernobyl diaries is a really underrated film. Seeing the reviews I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to me that many of the critics want to compare this flick desperately to recent entries in the genre. It doesn't quite fit so they have a hard time understanding it's true nature. This film has pretty much everything what a good horror film needs. The setting is great it creates an eerie atmosphere and it's used very well. But we know that good setting doesn't make a good movie in itself. The characters are likable and their reactions to situations are pretty realistic. I often thought what would have I done differently and I found that not much. You have this sense of realism from the start and it's kept nearly until the end. There are a few jump scares but those are not the main elements this film relies on to keep you tense. There aren't any moronic moments which ruin most horror films with good premise. Also avoids most bad clichs successfully. It's well crafted I would give the director more money to make an even better film. Really enjoyed it recommended to horror lovers.".

There was also almost no plot. The fact that the things chasing them were never further identified or even really seen just makes the lack of plot even more frustrating. There was SO much more they could have done with plot and really developed some interesting conspiracy theories or ANYTHING more than what they did. I would have much rather had a stronger more intricate plot and less of the shaky obscure fights running scenes. There was some good built suspense and surprises but over all it left A LOT to be desired.".

It made no sense all that wrong preferences of characters anyone would go away to bring aid but they preferred searching another characters and they could only find their dead bodies and suffered from another dangers incidents and eventually the last two characters were killed by officials.It would be extremely frustrating and terrifying to know that it would be impossible to get away from that hell and survive.

	schema:reviewBody "Was this movie great? No. Was this movie good? Not really? Was it above average? Yeah I'll give it that.In a genre that is literally over populated with cheap knock off Syfy Channel style survival horror movies you can certainly do MUCH worse than Chernobyl Diaries.I think that the best part about this movie was the location. The abandoned living area of Pripyat was pretty creepy. This type of movie works better if you have a little bit of imagination and can project yourself as one of the characters. Even though none of this movie was shot near Chernobyl yes I know there's some stock footage used in the movie Im merely talking about scenes with the actors check out pictures of the living areas of Pripyat. There's a good one on Wikipedia that is at least pretty similar looking as the location in the movie.The whole concept of going on an extreme tour in a town that was abandoned after a nuclear disaster like Chernobyl is pretty cool. And in the realm of mutated peoplezombielike horror movies its not all that implausible that there might be mutantszombies like this.The actors weren't terrible either. Yeah many of the clichs of this genre are present. Incredibly poor judgment calls nonexistent survival instincts etc. There's even a couple real puzzlers like the bear scene make you slap your head. But I've seen many movies where the entire cast is down right terrible. For what is was the cast in this movie did a decent job.Finally one of the best things about this movie is that it WASN'T shot in the 'found footageshaky camcorder' style. I applaud Blair Witch Project for coming up with a new subgenre of horror and there's been some movies that have used this technique well but most of the time its just annoying. I was happy to see that although the very beginning has some camcorder footage the rest of the movie was shot rather traditionally.If I had to pick the two biggest things that I didn't like about the movie is the lack of gore. Part of the reason I like zombie movies is for the mutateddeaddecayed look of the creatures. There are very few shots of the monsters in this movie. I would have preferred to see a little more gore. Also the ending was kind of a cop out. I had the feel that the filmmakers got to a point where they were running out of money and rushed the ending. I don't want to ruin it for anyone but it felt rushed to me.So there ya have it. This movie isn't winning any Academy awards there are some foreheadslappers and the basic plot is one that's been done thousands of times. But for what it is this is good entertainment. At the very minimum it should keep anyone watching occupied for 90 minutes and for horror fans who like this style of movie it was pretty decent. A solid 710 in my book.".
