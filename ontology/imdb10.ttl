	schema:reviewBody "I'm a longtime fan of the great Pushkin's novel Eugene Onegin and the great Tchaikovsky's opera with the same title. And I always wanted to see a good film adaptation of Eugene Onegin.So I've been watching 1988 Decca's screen version of the opera 1999 British screen version of the novel...and I didn't like it. I almost despaired but I was thinking There are no Russian screen version of Onegin? It can't be! And I was right! There are Russian screen version. And WHAT A VERSION! This 1958 Soviet film is just perfect film adaptation of the story  amazing Tchaikovsky's music  singing of the Bolshoi Theatre stars. But that's not all! Beautiful locations costumes ball scenes...And what a beautiful Russian actors..! Vadim Medvedev Onegin is incredibly handsome redhaired Ohredhaired Onegin is something special! man with an aristocratic face majestic posture and eloquent face expressions love his haughty puffedup mien and these curved eyebrows... and he is amazing as arrogant and selfish dandy Eugene Onegin Igor Ozerov is good as young and naive poet Vladimir Lensky and Ariadna Shengelaya makes a lovely Tatiana a shy landowner's daughter... Galina Vishnevskaya Tatiana's voice is the world famous Russian soprano and her singing is outstanding. Yevgeni Kibkalo Onegin's voice is a lyric baritone of truly beautiful timbre and Anton Grygoriev Lensky's voice is expressive lyric tenor.So I can't say a single bad word about this film. Everything is perfect singing acting direction camera work costumes...just everything. This tastefully made film is another proof of the greatness of the Soviet cinema and true pleasure for all the film and opera lovers.P.S. Try also a Soviet film Queen of Spades Pikovaya dama 1960 httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0054183. This is screen version of another Tchaikovsky's opera directed by the same director Roman Tikhomirov and also starring Vadim Medvedev. A beautifully made opera film.".

	schema:headline " As of now my favourite Eugene Onegin";
	schema:reviewBody "Eugene Onegin is one of the great Russian operas and is amazing as an opera in general too. It is involving and touching with some of the most beautiful music Tchaikovsky ever wrote. This film from 1958 is outstanding in all regards Petr Weigl's 1988 film is also a masterpiece the HvorostovskyFleming Met production I thoroughly enjoyed as well but I marginally prefer this one. The locations are really colourful and striking and the costumes are wonderfully opulent enhanced by the skillful photography. The lipsync has in some opera films been a problem but it isn't here. How everything is acted out and staged is not as spontaneous as when you see an opera live but this doesn't matter when everything is so movingly done with never a dull moment.The dancing really does give you the impression that you are at a ball Lensky and Gremin's aria are heartwrenching and the Letter scene shows Tatyana's vulnerability wonderfully. The orchestral playing is rousing in the Polanaise lush and soaring in the Letter scene and sensitive and expressive in Lensky's aria. The conducting show authority and nuances while the chorus are animated and beautifully balanced. The singing couldn't have been more perfect Galina Vishnevskaya sings powerfully but also perfectly conveying Tatyana's shyness and vulnerability. Yevgeni Kibkalo's timbre is beautiful and full of virility while Anton Grygoriev's singing is full of expressive lyricism while Larissa Avdeyeva sings Olga with a full mezzo and I love equally Gremin's resonant bass.As for the acting that is just as superb and in perfect sync with the voices with Vadim Medvedev's Onegin in particular arrogance and eloquence personified. Ariadna Shengelaya is a touching Tatyana while Igor Ozerov plays the young poet Lensky with charm. Svetlana Nemolyaeva and Ivan Petrov give commanding performances respectively as Olga and Gremin. All in all an amazing film. I will see Queen of Spades and Prince Igor by the same director but I do doubt they will be better than this Eugene Onegin. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Soviet film of the famous Tchaikovsky opera";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1958 film remains the first known in the West and only film adaptation of Tchaikovsky's rare opera. First rereleased on video by KULTUR in 1984 and now available on Amazon.com the film is riding a strange wave of popularity for everything Onegin. The opera relatively obscure in the West is now being performed everywhere. I saw it a few months in lavish new production performed by Miami's prestigious Florida Grand Opera with a distinguished stellar allSlav cast. The Fiennes family of course released Onegin the nonoperatic version starring their most famous brother Ralph............While the 1958 Soviet film Yevgeni Onegin is as artistic as it is operatic and though it does use the sights and sounds of Saint Petersburg and the Russian countryside to great effect the film suffers by comparison to other Onegin versions. Not only to the recent lavish live opera presentations but to Martha Fienne's film. Tchaikovsky's music is of course wonderful. However the character development is serious lacking practically nonexistent in this film. And the actors are all known Sovietera actors dubbed by the cream of Moscow's Bolshoi Theater which also provides the chorus corps de ballet and orchestra. This dubbing concept is also a distracting feature. This once ubiquitous process now seems very outdated and unnatural. All these faults contrast too sharply with the recent Onegin reincarnations featuring fabulous characterizations which really bring the story line to life naturally. The live opera experience is also far more exhilarating than this film ever is though....... In all fairness to director Roman Tikhominov this film of an opera it is not a filmed opera performance is a groundbreaking film. It's just that since 1958 the opera film especially the Franco Zeffirelli productions such as LA TRAVIATA and OTELLOplus CARMEN and the more recent MADAME BUTTERFLY has evolved greatly and therefore this Soviet film pales by comparison. Ditto for the recent live opera productions and the overall experience provided by the 1999 Fiennes film. Nevertheless Yevgeni Onegin is a welcome addition to any opera lover's videoDVD collection.  If for nothing else than curiosity value.".

The pacing of the film is slow and salubrious but definitely not plodding sic. Angela's Ashes You will be left wanting more but any more would spoil the plot. Don't miss it. Full marks.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a truly wonderful film.  It is an adaptation of the 19th century romantic poem by Alexander Pushkin about the tragic love affair between Evgeny Onegin Ralph Fiennes and Tatyana Larina Liv Tyler.  Evgeny has inherited his uncle's provincial estate and goes to the country to put his affairs in order.  While there he befriends Vladimir Toby Stevens who introduces him to Tatyana the sister of his fianc.  Tatyana falls madly in love with Evgeny but he brutally rejects her and leaves to return to St. Petersburg.  Upon returning years later to find her married his regrets ignite into a passionate and obsessive love for her.There has been some criticism of the fact that this film was produced by Ralph Fiennes to give a project to his sister Martha director and brother Magnus original music.  Well if this is the high quality wrought from Fiennes nepotism we need more such collaborations.In her feature film directorial debut Martha Fiennes gives us outstanding imagery precise period renderings innovative camera work and dramatic lighting.  The locations sets costumes and props were fabulous. I especially loved the furniture.  The scenes on the dock by the mill in the fog were eerie and chilling.  One shot of Liv Tyler in a rowboat shot through outoffocus reeds in the foreground was pure art.  The extreme closeup of the inking of the love letter added to the power of the emotions being written.  Remi Adefarasin Elizabeth' added wondrous cinematography to the list of filmmaking kudos.Ralph Fiennes delivers another superb performance as Evgeny.  In the early scenes he is cavalier self absorbed and arrogant to the point of being despicable.  His stoical dismissal of Tatyana was ice cold.  In the later scenes he delivers a character so pathetically tormented by love that he wins back our sympathies.This is by far the best performance I have seen by Liv Tyler.  She was poised graceful and lovely and gave an extremely dignified performance. With this role she has proven that she can move beyond the troubled teen type and play a character with substance.This is intelligent and inspired filmmaking.  I rated it a 910.  The pacing is deliberate so action junkies will want to pass on this film.  However for those who can savor a compelling love story with splendid imagery this film should not be missed.".

	schema:headline " interesting romantic drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Fine performances highlight Onegin' a generally interesting version of Pushkin's complex love story whose contemporary significance shines through the tortured souls of its two main characters.  Ralph Fiennes stars in the title role as a 19th Century Russian aristocrat who like many similar figures in Russian literature of that time suffers from the attenuating effects of enervation and ennui.  Though the recipient of vast sums of wealth and property at the death of his uncle Onegin finds no meaning or solace in life as he lives it.  He is as bored by the stifling superficiality of the privileged elite languishing in splendor in the fancy halls and glittering ballrooms of cosmopolitan St. Petersburg as he is by the domestic dreariness of the provincials residing in the bucolic countryside where one of his uncle's vast estates is located.  In the latter setting while visiting Vladimir  a poet he has recently befriended  Onegin becomes drawn to Tatyana the beautiful younger sister of the man's fianc.  Both Onegin and Tatyana reflect a remarkably modern sensibility in their temperaments.  For instance though the attraction between the two is a mutual one it is Tatyana who makes the first move pouring out her unbridled love for this newcomer in a letter which Onegin politely rejects because he fears the deadening of the soul that he believes will inevitably accompany marriage and fidelity.  One can't get much more contemporary in tone than these two characters one stepping well out of the accustomed bounds accorded her sex in affairs of romance and the other reflecting the fear of commitment that is such a staple of modern times.  Yet fate plays its cruelest hand at the end as Onegin finds himself years later trapped in an ironic role reversal as the nowmarried Tatyana is forced to rebuff the advances of the obsessed lovelorn man whom she still admits to loving. As in many bleak works of Russian literature the character is forced to live out his existence in a hell of his own making suffering the torment of regret without end.The personal drama unfolds against the fascinating backdrop of the subtly changing society of 19th Century Russia a country that then and now has seemed to be always several centuries behind its European neighbors in its moves towards liberalization in the areas of basic human and civil rights. We see clearly the struggle between the empty ritualism and entrenched barbarism of the past as reflected in the continuing institution of serfdom and in gun duels fought over affairs of honor and the enlightened philosophy of the coming world as many young aristocrats begin to champion both the abolition of serfdom and the growing acceptance of love as the foundation of marriage.   Indeed the two young lovers cannot extricate themselves from the entanglements that often accompany a time unsure of its traditions.  Onegin for all his talk about freeing his serfs is himself forced to participate in a duel that both horrifies and disgusts him.  And Tatyana for all her comments about only marrying a man she loves succumbs to the pressure of tradition ultimately agreeing to a marriage based on class money and position.  Here are two people caught in a world not yet ready for them who are forced to settle for the compromises their society has deemed fit and proper.This wellacted wellwritten and welldirected film may seem a bit slow at times but the intelligence of the dialogue the subtle underplaying of the cast and the quiet beauty of much of the direction lead us into a strange world of the past that still has resonance and relevance for the world of today.".

For those who enjoy Russian literature this movie will captivate you for those who have no exposure to it it will not.  So your preestablished experience will determine to a great extent your appreciation of this film.The lead acting is superb!  Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler are so good that they unfortunately show up everybody else.  The setting however does not have much of a Russian feel to it what with everybody trying to act French and all which is very accurate to the time.  Thank you Peter the Great.As for the story the movie is very faithful to the Pushkinian attitude. The story is very charactercentred typical to Russian lit.  The change in Evgenyi Onegin pronounced Yevgehny Ahnyegin is marked indeed. However the character of Tatyana captivated me.  Her faithfulness to herself and to her integrity especially given the context of American film is amazing.  How refreshing to see a character turn down the opportunity to have an affair with the man she loves deeply out of loyalty and faithfulness to her husband whom she unfortunately doesn't really love.  This is especially refreshing in light of prevailing attitudes towards marriage and in particular adultery.  Liv Tyler portrays both the deep angst and yet the firm conviction of Tatyana beautifully.I recommend this film heartily.  I gave it a 10 in my rating and I encourage anyone to view this film to escape the prevailing American Bruce Willistype formula film and allow this film to expand your perceptions and your mind and to enjoy the challenge of seeing people grow and thereby encourage yourself to do the same.".

There he meets the young and beautiful Tantianna Ladin played astonishingly well and seductively by Liv Tyler.  Their love sets off a chain of tragic events that will forever alter their lives.

The camera work is so well done and every shot is done with such care and precision that it is absolutely breathtaking.  Director Martha Finnes has truly outdone herself.  The score by Magnus Finnes is also terrific and adds so much depth and feeling to the story. The costumes are also something to be commended they are so gorgeous and well made. Bottom line is great movie for anyone who appreciates good literature and a good period drama.  This movie moves along very slowly so action fans beware.

Having grown up in Russia and being as we would say here a great Pushkin's fan'  I was caught between curiosity and caution when deciding whether I should even rent this film. Then I saw Ralph Fiennes name and thought that it could not be all that bad.so curiosity won. I was pleasantly surprised that the film is fairly faithful to the original. Not completely of course but when I think about horrible mutilations other filmmakers perform on marvelous works of literature I'm very grateful that the producers of Onegin' read the poem very well and chose scenes and changed some of them with care. I won't talk a lot about beauty of scenes in the film it's a pleasure to watch. Here are some of the things I didn't like. First of all I was a little disappointed by the film's interiors. Several of them look very natural some of the room's in Larin's and Onegin's houses. Others like Petersburg palaces more than anything resemble theatrical decorations. I don't think this was intentional since the overall scenery is very realistic. Another objection is the lovemaking scene. I don't think it belongs or was needed at all. Was it just a due paid to modern filmmaking? Why not do Tatyana's dream instead this is a meaningful symbolic scene in the poem not filming it could hardly be an accidental decision I would love to know what was the reason? The third kind of big problem is that married Tatyana is not clearly portrayed as the queen of Petersburg's society. This detail is very important for understanding of Onegin's character a tragic figure who can only exist within the laws and decorations of high society  the very society he despises more than anything else. Tatyana the queen of this society a complete part of it and yet completely not involved with it comfortably within and yet far above the chattering crowd  that very likely is the only thing Onegin can love. Unfortunately the question am I noble enough for you now?' which Tatyana throws at Onegin during the climax scene of the film does not fully convey that understanding and is an oversimplification compared to the speech that Pushkin's Tatyana gives to her fallen and still loved hero.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that I was a bit hesitant about seeing this film for several reasons.  I had read Onegin in the original Russian and frankly I mistrusted the abilities of a filmmaker to convey a true sense of the story and the life and mood of Imperial Russia while also catering to the tastes of modern film audiences.  But as a fan of the work of Ralph Fiennes and Toby Stephens I took the chance on this film and I am glad that I did. Onegin was fantastic.  I have to agree that this film is not for action fans but everything came together spectacularly in Onegin the acting the dialogue the haunting music the beautiful cinematography the subtle timing and angle of each shot in the film.  I was moreover surprised by the superb acting of Liv Tyler.  The high point of the film with the unveiling of Tatiana's letter and Onegin's growing passion is well worth the anticipation.  Fienne's portrayal of Onegin is realistic absolutely riveting...  He is a man jaded by opulence and overindulgence trapped in his indolence and boredom cool and reasoning and underneath it all absolutely miserable a man who comes to realize too late what flames of passion burn within him which he attempts to beat down with his reason... His torment creates the most compelling kind of tragedy the tragedy that compels us to consider what might have been. My rating 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is wonderful and beautiful. I was impressed with the amount of user comments considering the film has not been very popular and in the Americas hardly seen and bashed by critics. It is an almost perfect film rendition of this classic literary work. I recently saw an acclaimed production of the opera Eugene Onegin by Tchaikovsky and have read Russian literature. This film is a more complete and captivating experience than the opera or the original verse novel in translation. However the true Russian spirit cannot be captured with the entire cast speaking in Etonian British accents. The film should have been released even in English speaking countries completely synchronized in Russian I prefer to say synchronized since the actors in any film are dubbed the word is very negative  by themselves anyway. Some of the original verses could have been included. The wonderful score by Magnus Fiennes should have been complemented by Tchaikovsky and not German Beethoven music preferably from the newlypopular Onegin opera. With those very important revisions the film would have been the finest example of Russian literature ever brought to the screen.".

All comments on historic technicalities aside this film creates a breathtaking performance of Pushkins masterpiece. I have read the translated Onegin I have to admit only after seeing this film. After I did I could not decide if I liked Onegin so much because of Pushkins beautiful prose or Fiennes fantastic acting. He in my opinion becomes very much the true personification of Onegin's character as it was meant by Pushkin when he wrote Onegin. Captivated by his indifferent arrogance and later on tormented and consumed by his heartfelt passions the public is undeniably drawn into this film. Liv Tyler contraries his character beautifully playing the young innocent and introvert Tatjana. She is beauty in it's simplest and purest form. The kind of beauty that is sublime. Shy and isolated from her environment she is both mysterious and lovely. This film has touched my soul and placed itself in my heart.Onegin is a must for anyone who loves a romantic tragedy which sets in a magnificent place. This drama is excellent for those who want to enjoy the magic of poetry on screen.".

Where Russian readers and western students of Russian culture see a vision of the decadence of Russian aristocracy and a condemnation of the Ancien Regime both in social and cultural terms the Fiennes saw a nice romantic interlude. The limited scope of the filmmakers'interest explains why the movie is successful in just one aspect  the two love scenes between Onegin and Larina are great actually much better than what Russian actors would perform in the place of Fiennes and Tyler. But that's that. Everything else including the duel or the scandal between Lensky and Onegin is dull insipid and rather unRussian. Fiennes obviously misunderstood the meaning of being tired of life. Pushkin's Onegin was not a selfcentered selfsufficient and utterly satisfied English gentleman who speaks patronizingly to everyone in the country because he knows things. He was a model for generations of Russian malcontents in a rigidly conservative society playing the tired of life was a social stand not a psychological state. Onegin was a passionate man and his aloofness was a deliberate pretense not that much different from Hamlet's delusive craziness. In short the Fienneses had better screen a romantic drama without referring to Pushkin's masterpiece. Their movie is nice watchable and enjoyable well Liv Tyler stars in it! but their rendition of Pushkin's characters is so dissatisfying the great poet might easily take offense.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this can be like enjoying exquisite oysters on the half shell complemented with the perfect champagne very subtle and understated yet complex and sensuous. Ralph Fiennes and sisterdirector Martha Fiennes worked as a team to bring this classic piece of Russian literature to the screen. For her it is a first turn directing a feature making a move like Ridley Scott from commercials to film. Production values are fantastic filled with rich textures without the selfindulgence and pomposity which are a common fault in period films often at the expense of pacing and storytelling. The cinematography and editing are fluid and musical languorous in areas without stagnation. Here are dynamics which are not unlike looking at paintings of Masters displaying contrast between the bleakness of the Russian winter and the warmth and security of wealth and privilege. Magnus Fiennes another family member created the soundtrack and borrows from period contemporaries like Lizst without the recycledrippedoff path of least resistance. The use of duduk and strings casts a haunting spell in the ice skating scene. Casting here is perfect. Liv Tyler is impressive as Tatiana embodying an elegance and organic sophistication without affectation. To watch her deal with the anguish resulting from rejection of her love is excruciating. Toby Stephens as Lensky is wonderful the complete photonegative to Onegin. There is a moment where he is playing chess making a juvenile mistake and his reaction to the blunder is a brilliant bit of vacuity playing Lensky at the height of his intelligence which is at that moment absent. Ralph Fiennes puts in as usual a phenomenal turn as Onegin. It's amazing how he pulls us in when playing the tormented lover. And upon further examination they are lessthanlikable at that the English Patient End of the Affair and Onegin all moody taciturn guys. It's the magnitude of his devotion distress and passion that are so compelling why we women are so crazy about him. You believe that for him love truly is his lord and master.Lucky Francesca Annis. Why people haven't commented lavishly on this gorgeous gem I find mystifying. Perhaps the ending wasn't mainstream happy enough....".

	schema:headline " A truly great period drama beautifully shot acted and directed.";
	schema:reviewBody "Note the following comments were written after a preview screening for the film 'Onegin' Tuesday 8th October 1998 in Wimbledon London. The film was still a 'work in progress' with some cleaning up to be done on the sound track and most of the scene transitions somewhat shoddy. The film's title was not 'Eugene Onegin' but simply 'Onegin'.The idea of an adaptation of a 19th century Russian novel about unrequited love will clearly not appeal to everyone especially given the considerable number of period dramas that have come before it. However 'Onegin' distinguishes itself both by its sparkling script its stunning locations and by the outstanding efforts of both director and cast.As an extremely critical film viewer noone was more surprised than I that when facing an audience response sheet for the film I could not think of a single scene I did not enjoy whilst running out of space to list all the scenes that I loved!The cast headed by Ralph Fiennes Onegin and Liv Tyler Tatiana acquit themselves admirably and I will be very disappointed if one or both do not receive Oscar nominations for their performances.  Toby Stephens Lensky in one of the key supporting roles is equally superb especially when being played off as the emotional loose cannon to Fiennes' laconic and cynical Onegin.The locations  especially the millpond at which some of the film's key scenes take place  are stunningly shot and the camerawork in general is a cut above most films. The directors decision to let sound and vision take upon some of the personality of the central characters at key moments only serves to underline the emotional content of the film.As an example when Tatiana writes her letter to Onegin the camera views what she writes only in close up  single words giving the viewer a sense of the obsession and passion that is working in her. As she writes her hands become more and more stained with ink and eventually we see her trying to wipe the ink from her hands as if she is stained with guilt.As I intimated before this is not a film for all people. There is little action and most of the story rests upon the simple interaction between Onegin Tatiana and Lensky. But it builds with grim inevitability to an emotional climax which left me strangely delighted that there are still film makers out there who can produce truly great movies.The film it most reminded me of was 'Remains of the Day' but whilst I found that to be labored and frustrating I almost wished that the central characters were in the room so I could slap them for being so foolish the characters and situations in 'Onegin' are tragically believable. I found myself sympathizing with all three of the central characters for entirely different reasons.I cannot recommend this film highly enough to anyone who has ever enjoyed a period drama a nineteenth century novel or suffered through unrequited love. Martha Fiennes is a director worth keeping an eye on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Onegin is a fairly good attempt at capturing the spirit of the original. One should praise the work of costume designer the sets are also quite methodically reproduced. But unfortunately there are some things that cannot but jar on the ear and on the eye of the viewer Olga sings Oy tsvetyot kalina  this song appeared only in the mid 50s of the 20th century in one of the Soviet films. So it couldn't be sung in the 19th century. The same about the waltz  it's Na sopkah Manchzhurii  this waltz appeared during the Russian  Japanese war about 1904. These details mar the impression for the Russian viewer very much because they are as ridiculous as jets in films about World War II. The film appears to be made of two easily recognized parts  one made by the American camera men and the other  filmed by the Russian camera crew. They have absolutely different ways of building the frame and focusing on different things. So American camera work is more Hollywoodlike pompous and sometimes in the first half of the film the characters are evidently illmannered which disappears altogether in the second SaintPetersburg part. Good manners is not walking about stiff and pompous as if one has swallowed a ramrod. It's natural grace ease and delicacy. That's why Tatiana could hardly lie in the boat with her legs spread as if  an obstetrician were being busy with her even when no one could see. Lensky is a very complex character difficult to portray on the screen. On the one hand he will definitely end as Pushkin himself wrote as a country squire fat negligently dressed and romantic to the end at the same time. His romanticism is pitiable. But at the same time he believes in it he is a poet he is young passionate and delicate. It seems to me that that part was botched. Lensky is pompous and ridiculous hopelessly provincial the way it was done. I know that a film should not follow the text of the book doggedly but the scene of the duel surprised me because if I am not mistaken they were fighting in winter. I hardly understand what for the windowmills on the water! are. But on the whole it is very touching to see that people are still interested in Russian classics and managed to convey that obsession with love not meaning bedroom scenes that divine madness taking place against the background of the imperial majesty of SaintPetersburg.".

Scrolls seals ideograms and magic tricks dispensed by the terrific cast are used to serve both the action and the comic relief. No flashy CGI it's cool and discrete. The audience burst in laughs when they did the old school 'white smoke' metamorphosis trick.The film lacks a good editing though a recurrent handicap in Korean movies. Despite the great acting of the cast it tends to slow down when trying to develop the very secondary female characters. This is probably due to the presence of many Korean movie stars who always insist to get a lot of screen time for their characters even if that doesn't serve the storyline.I'll give it a 8 because of all the good laughs and this very refreshing and magical atmosphere the movie provides. While Korea's grown famous for pushing to export crappy CGI movies out of sheer patriotism but this isn't one of them. Woochi actually delivers.".

	schema:headline " Quite entertaining but drags on slightly";
	schema:reviewBody "For once I found the movie actually better than the underwhelming trailer. Woochi is an action fantasy comedy movie with one half taking place in the past and the other in modern South Korea. It's not traditional fantasy with traditional magic. The socalled goblins only fantasy creatures in here are actually beastmen able to take human appearance and you only really see two of them maybe 3 depending on how you count. However they're really well done and animated. The magic is of the taoist kind with spells written on little pieces of paper. Sounds lame but works wonderfully. I found it quite different than the usual and often a delight to behold. Wooji the title character is a very confident trickster mage who is a lot of fun and his introduction was a great moment. He's constantly surprising and I loved the character as well as his comicrelief sidekick. The 3 taoist monks were also quite enjoyable and got way more interesting as the movie went on. The ambiguous and stoic main villain had a lot of presence but the goblins although excellent martial artists were bland in terms of personality.The plot and motives mostly exposed in the starting moments and in snippets afterwards were quite forgettable and not really necessary for enjoyment. The special effects were very well done combining seamlessly CGI and real actors. It was even better sometimes than bigbudget American movies. Not only that but there were several beautiful original sequences rarely or never seen before at least by me. Some of those include going in and out of paintings multiplication of bodies think Naruto and flying tramways. The action scenes were exciting and very cool but unfortunately the fights were often too closedin and fast for my poor eyes. The comedic moments were funny and didn't turn the film into bad parody. I must admit becoming fidgety and my mind wandering more than halfway through as if the movie was too long or had lost part of my interest. I've seen movies that were as long or longer not thinking of when they would end as I did in Woochi. I had a good time watching this film and would recommend a rental to those who like somewhat exotic martial arts fantasies with comedic elements.Rating  7 out of 10.".

The great Yunseok Kim who impressed audiences in RUNNING TURTLE and inparticular in the brilliant THE CHASER is perfectly cast as Woochi's main nemesis. Sujeong Lim from Park Chanwook's underrated I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK and the outstanding A TALE OF TWO SISTERSis perfect as the object of Woochi's affections. It's also great to see Donghun regular Yunshik Baek TAZZA  THE BIG SWINDLE  THE ART OF FIGHTING  SAVE THE GREEN PLANET make a very welcome appearance. With 200 million Hollywood productions failing to make the grade it is wonderful to see a film like WOOCHI deliver such highclass entertainment on a fraction of the budget. Fastpaced exciting very funny and full of vibrant involving characters JEON WOOCHI  THE TAOIST WIZARD will certainly be one of my best films of the year. One hopes it will get a proper international release unfortunately the director's other films have yet to achieve a deserving release outside of South Korea.".

But for me and the group of people watching it with me Jeon Woochi was a big bust.The biggest problem I had with this movie was the terrible pacing especially in the first 30 minutes of the movie where the timeline was not linear and the director did practically nothing to inform the audience that he had made a jump in time until wrapping up the scene and rejoining the main timeline. Other problems included a major lack of funny  there was so much opportunity for fish out of water jokes but the writers barely even tried. And it wasn't like the comedy was too subtle either much of the humor in the movie was just too hamfisted to laugh at.There were also way too many fast cuts during action sequences  it made it difficult to enjoy the biggest feature of the movie the excellent CGI. The director barely gives the audience a chance to focus on the contents of a shot before cutting to a new camera angle. I recognize these fast cuts are a modern Hollywood style but it is still a terrible one to emulate.The story itself was as expected fairly simple. But even then the telling of it was too convoluted  due mainly to the confusing timeline.I haven't given any examples to illustrate my criticism because I wanted to avoid spoilers as much as possible but still provide a counterpoint to the misleadingly high rating 7.0 as I write this and the other 5 or so reviews which all gave the movie exceptional scores. It was on the basis of that rating and the other reviews that I purchased the korean bluray and would strongly recommend that no one else waste their time or money the way I did. I suggest watching the older Arahan which has a similar wizardry in the modern city plot. I had a lot more fun watching Arahan despite its flaws.Also watch out for the korean bluray. It is poorly mastered  the black levels are elevated making the picture look washed out and hazy unless you have a fancy display that can correct the problem.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is actually a pretty fun fantasyadventure movie that is also pretty fast paced. Although it's fast paced the editing is not very well done and kinda choppy at times. The plot of this revolves around a guy named Jeon Woochi who is a Taoist Wizard who is also very rebellious and boastful with no humble qualities. Almost the first half of the movie takes place about 500 years ago in Korea but after Jeon Woochi gets locked into a painting by three dumb immortal elders. But gets freed by the elders cause they need Woochi to fight off the goblins and so Woochi ends up in present time in South Korea. While dealing with this Woochi also has to face off with another villain with wizard like powers who fought Woochi's master in the past. The main villain wants the flute well at least the other half of it which got locked away in the painting along with Woochi. Although for the most part this is a fun ride the main flaws is how the characters aren't really developed well and the editing just isn't well done like I said before. Oh and the CGI is pretty crappy as well some done okay though. Also there is hardly any scenes where Woochi actually seemed vulnerable cause his powers seem infinite as long as he has his talisman papers. It would have been cool if it actually showed the limits to his power. I had a pretty good time watching this and some scenes were really cool. Overall Jeon Woochi delivers.7.210".

	schema:reviewBody "The early part of this film takes place five hundred years ago when the 'Flute of Prophecy' has been acquired by evil goblins. Three Taoist gods are trying to retrieve it along with two powerful wizards and student wizard Woochi. They are initially successful and the flute is divided into two part so it can't be used for evil again. Shortly afterwards Woochi is framed for the murder of his master so along with Chorangyi his dog in human form he is banished into a picture. Five hundred years later in modern day South Korea the Goblins are back so the gods return Woochi and later Chorangyi from their banishment and together they set off to defeat the goblins and ultimately the person responsible for their release.If you are expecting a serious film then you are likely to be disappointed yes there is plenty of action but above all it is a comedy. The story is a bit confusing at times occasionally deliberately so but ultimately proves to be solid enough. The action scenes are fun in a fantastical way rather than the sort of bonecrunching action that has the viewer wincing. The gags had me chuckling with the sort of humour that is universal rather than requiring the viewer to be steeped in Korean culture. There is a lot of fairly obvious CGI but thankfully it is of a high standard and fitted in with the magical nature of the story. The cast does a solid job most notably Dongwon Gang and Haejin Yoo as Woochi and Chorangyi. Overall this isn't a classic but it is still fun enough if you want a film with a good amount of action and a similar amount of comedy with little in the way of offensive material.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.".

WOOCHI THE DEMON SLAYER turns out to be a weaklyplotted comedy full of irritating breakneck editing and general disregard for the usual conventions of cinema it's overlong rambling trivial and most of all a bore.The trailer sells this as a fullblown action movie but it turns out to be a comedy. Now Asian comedies don't typically do well overseas so I can see why the trailer was cut that way but it's still a bit of a cheat. The humour isn't very funny and the script including various evil wizards travelling between dimensions shapeshifting goblins and the like is all over the place. The one thing the film does boast is some excellent special effects work in the form of aboveaverage CGI but the elaborate action scenes are spoilt slightly by the disjointed editing and general lack of cohesion. It's a shame because if the comedy had been toned down and the drama upped this could have been a very good film indeed as it stands it's an overlong misfire.".

I had just expected it to be set in the present day because of the movie cover and all. But having the movie take place in two different eras was entertaining enough and it did work out well enough.Now that I have seen it I feel somewhat disillusioned because the movie wasn't all that it was hyped up to be with the praises and the comments on the cover jaw dropping action 24framespersecond.net and The no. 1 Asian box office smash hit!. The movie wasn't bad but with praise like it had received I had expected a bit more from it.The story is a combination of action drama and comedy and it does work out well enough. And you do get caught up in the storyline but it is not really one that will stick with you for long after you have ejected the disc from the DVD player.Woochi The Demon Slayer has really great effects and there are some interesting scenes. The demons were depicted as a rat and a rabbit in semihumanoid form which was sort of strange to see as that is not how I envision a demon to be being a Westerner and all but I suppose it might work out well enough for Korean mythology.This movie is well worth checking out for the effects alone but in my honest opinion then there are better Asian movies available out there of a similar genre.".

It has funny characters witty lines and does not at all take itself seriously.There are a lot of small details that can take multiple viewings to catch. One thing I found funnier the second time I watched it is the scene where Will Smith has just been severely lectured by his boss in the interrogation room when Tommy Lee Jones enters asks a few questions and tells Smith to come with him. Smith I can't there's still a lot of paperwork to fill out. Jones No the paperwork is all taken care of. Smith's boss walking by Hey nice work Edwards! This is one of many quick funny scenes that you only really get if you're paying attention.All the actors do a good job too. I thought Rip Torn was the funniest character and Edgar the bug was hilariously gross. Linda Fiorentino was one of the coolest female characters ever. She put Ripley to shame. Every time I watch this I want to marry her.Overall it's a great comedy that is clever and fun all the way through. 810 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "God do I remember when this movie came out in the summer of '97. This movie brought aliens back in the strongest way possible everyone was singing Will Smith's catchy song of the same title. But I remember seeing this movie and just wearing out the VHS when we got it. As a 12 year old kid I just adored this movie and so badly wanted to be apart of the Men in Black. I thought they were so cool. Years later I got the DVD because I wanted to go for a trip down memory lane this may not be as cool as when I was a kid but this is still a very fun scifi flick that makes you laugh squirm and also has some good scares. There is a reason why Will Smith is a star he made this movie a riot to watch and has every star quality you could imagine. He and Tommy Lee Jones take us on an incredible ride through our world where the person that lives next door to you just might be an alien.Agent K is a member of the Men in Black a secret agency without ties to any government whose goal is to maintain Earth as a neutral zone for aliens seeking refuge. K's former partner D has just retired but identifies New York City detective James Edwards as a potential replacement due to his agility to follow a disguised alien. After putting Edwards through several tests K offers him the chance to join the MIB which Edwards accepts. Edwards' past identity is erased and he becomes Agent J assigned to K by the agency director Zed. The fleet warns that a Bug a member of a giant cockroachlike alien species that are currently at war with another alien race has crashed down to Earth and is seeking an object known as the Galaxy that would turn the tide in favor of the Bugs. To prevent this they are willing to destroy the Earth unless the MIB can secure the Galaxy before their deadline within a day.The make up effects in this movie are just incredible. The main villain that was the bug was one of the creepiest looking things you've ever seen. Vincent D'Onofrio who is one of those great secrets of Hollywood always delivers an outstanding performance makes the villain even more creepier because of his jerks and twitches. The CGI effects are very noticeable but I don't think they could have gone any other way since the aliens are over the top. The humor is on key one of my favorite scenes is when Tommy Lee Jones is trying to find out information and you see Will Smith in the background who is helping a lady give birth to an alien and the tentacles come out and start carrying him around everywhere and even slam him on the car. Men in Black is the definition of a summer blockbuster it's funny action packed had the great actors and a very catchy song that is now stuck in my head thanks to this review. I still like Men in Black I think anyone who just lets go and watches this film is guaranteed to have a good time too.710".

There's the first alien we see Mikey there's the Worm Guys and the villanous Bug. But there are many others such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line No ma'am.

After a brief examination of his life James now Agent J joins the agency. On his first day suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war. The chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart their inventive and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.The presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens Independence Day. Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. Men In Black.

	schema:reviewBody "We're so familiar with aliens terrifying the bejeesus out of us in films that it's refreshing to see a wellknown classic spoof the genre. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work miracles together playing detectivelike heroes assigned to take down and destroy aliens. Jones is hilarious. Usually playing serious men Jones is so funny and doesn't take himself too seriously. Bruce Willis has nothing on him. Will Smith is a little out of control and that't the reason his performance works. He's a funny dude who isn't fit for saving the world. Jay and Kay bond perfectly together breathing energy to this fun film as well as an ounce or two of heart. Seeing Smith and Jones wear sunglasses and fancy suits while holding giant space guns is a cinematic sight no one can forget. With visual effects pretty spellbound for the time Men in Black is fun and entertaining throughout. It can't compare to some of the other films mostly relying on unique creatures to draw us in but it's such an original story that has a witty script by Ed Solomon and wellhandled directing by Barry Sonnenfeld who not only knows how to blend comedy and intense action but can make you truly care about the men in black shooting up giant cockroach aliens and working like charmers. Men in Black does get a little odd at times not staying true to its premise and taking some plot turns that I wasn't particularly fond of. However this film stays fun throughout and should be seen to experience 90's blockbuster action.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters upon subsequent viewings however it loses its luster. Still though it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny and the dog is not over used as in the sequel and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad I liked it okay but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.".

It opens a doorway into a fantastic worldwhilst playing it straight since most of these guys are used to this stuff that would be overwhelming were it not for rookie agent JWill Smith who brings both his sass and undeniable charm posing as a proxy for the audience asking the questions we want to and being given the exposition and explanations that we need. He is likable in his naivet and his efforts to help the people affected by the outerspace stuff and the odd couple dynamic between him and KTommy Lee Jones awesome and enjoyable as the old grump who's blas about what they experience is great as are the various other character aspects. Linda Fiorentino is perfectly cast as a somewhat cold coroner and she has a nice strong female role. As the villain we have Vincent D'Onofrio giving an unforgettable and unique performance as the large cockroach! wearing the skin of farmer Edgar. It's a size or two too small leading to ithim making some rather inelegant movements and possessing poor motor skills. And don't worry at the same time he's seriously scary. He's immensely physically powerful and he can't stand humans. This really gets into perspective and that the importance of something is not defined by its size. This is primarily a comedy as well as a fun scifi action adventure with some very unexpected situations and outcomes. It's exciting engaging and a cool universe that we want to see more of with this being a briefand wellpaced peek at roughly 90 minutes. There are creatively designed creatures and big shiny guns. Danny Elfman supplies this with a bombastic and playful score. There is a bit of moderate to strong language and a little violence and gorelittle of it involving people and just about none of that graphic in this. I recommend this to fans of the stars and the concept. 710".

Enough is enough.But I caught the whole film more recently and the humor is generally more subtle than that although the usual special effects abound. I'll give an example of what I mean. Smith and Jones have just shot down a huge flying saucer that has whirled around the skies like a justloosed inflated balloon. The saucer crashes into the earth a hundred yard from the two men and its momentum carries it towards the duo standing there immobile. Closer and closer it plows through the earth towards the two fixed figure stirring up a monstrous cloud of roiling dirt and debris. It looks as if they're about to become part of that debris. Jones is starring defiantly at the approaching catastrophe as if staring down a villain in an action movie. Smith says nothing  no wisecracks no cries of fright. He simply glances briefly at Jones with an entreating expression. It's only an instant but it's at least as funny as any other scene in the movie.The catastrophic shoot outs and wreckage may appeal to the kids but what I found most admirable were the smaller touches of absurdity. Multiple TV screens of aliens let loose on earth to lead normal lives include clips of Sly Stallone and a popular network weatherman. Two of the aliens looking normal or relatively normal enter a restaurant for a chat. And the director and writer make sure that we see what they order. Not the usual fare not sandwiches or spaghetti but pierogi  Polish dumplings.I won't carry on about it. Will Smith is our proxy. He finds out what's going on as Tommy Lee Jones leads him through the problems they face. Smith is often puzzled frightened and given to ironic cracks. Jones is his opposite the straight man who never smiles and who is just as funny because his absurd statements are delivered deadpan. Ditto for Rip Torn who plays it almost as a serious thriller. Linda Fiorentino is alluring as all get out and I'm glad she was there so she could tumble through the trees in a short skirt.The kids will get a kick out of the wreckage and the grown ups who are sensitive to the more delicate touches will find it funny.".

The element which stuck out to me as being done extraordinarily well was the writing specifically the comic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Their characters are so different and yet play off each other so well. Even the smaller parts were wellwritten and played. Of particular amusement to me was the largely physical performance given by Vincent D'Onofrio as the main bad bug. You can tell he gave it his all with his awkward speech patterns and movements. It really seemed like he was adjusting to a human body and it was all done with a sly sense of humor. The only thing I find lacking was some dated CG but considering it came out over 15 years ago it was fine. If anything it adds to the Bmovie charm and some of alien design was probably influenced by 1950's Creature Features anyway. All things considered it was an absolutely incredible and enthralling viewing experience. It's just a shame I waited so long to check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is simply so lovable and it has affected many people who have seen it. Men In Black has such a nice atmosphere and it's not gritty and dark as science fiction or fantasy written these days. How many people have seen this movie and were immediately not entirely seriously convinced aliens have visited us? When it's a movie like Men In Black it's so much more fun believing aliens might exist. There are movies that make aliens seem like killing machines whose only purpose is to destroy human race OR they are the kind of wise creatures who are so much better than us. But the aliens in Men In Black are  apart from the villains  almost sympathetic. They seem nice and really ordinary. Most of the charm of this movie comes from Will Smith. He is a talented actor and his experience in comedy such as Fresh Prince of Bel Air has given him the ability to deliver comedic lines wonderfully. For him they are natural and while Tommy Lee Jones's character Kay doesn't get as many oneliners said by him the feeling is different. The character Jay is exactly how many of us would like to be in a situation like this. Of course the aliens and secret organisations are all new to him and he is allowed to be openly confused but he still seems extremely excited about everything instead of being too broody or too angry like most heroes in action. This movie was made in 1990s and the effects aren't what we see in the theaters these days but they are still pretty damn amazing. When we are used to see the extremely beautiful science fiction something as simple as Men In Black is a nice change. Men In Black is simple science fiction comedy. It's a movie that made me like science fiction and is still probably the reason I'm not into the kind of science fiction where everything is in space and where you can see the filmmakers tried way too hard. Men In Black has a quite simple setting quite simple plots and ordinary characters. Jay could be anyone of us chosen by almost randomly instead of having some kind of great destiny. This is what science fiction needs to revisit. This is amazing.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is simply so lovable and it has affected many people who have seen it. Men In Black has such a nice atmosphere and it's not gritty and dark as science fiction or fantasy written these days. How many people have seen this movie and were immediately not entirely seriously convinced aliens have visited us? When it's a movie like Men In Black it's so much more fun believing aliens might exist. There are movies that make aliens seem like killing machines whose only purpose is to destroy human race OR they are the kind of wise creatures who are so much better than us. But the aliens in Men In Black are  apart from the villains  almost sympathetic. They seem nice and really ordinary. Most of the charm of this movie comes from Will Smith. He is a talented actor and his experience in comedy such as Fresh Prince of Bel Air has given him the ability to deliver comedic lines wonderfully. For him they are natural and while Tommy Lee Jones's character Kay doesn't get as many oneliners said by him the feeling is different. The character Jay is exactly how many of us would like to be in a situation like this. Of course the aliens and secret organisations are all new to him and he is allowed to be openly confused but he still seems extremely excited about everything instead of being too broody or too angry like most heroes in action. This movie was made in 1990s and the effects aren't what we see in the theaters these days but they are still pretty damn amazing.

Hence the heavyweights like Blade Runner Terminator 2 Avatar or more recently Prometheus when it's all about wowing the audience plunging viewers in a world of wonders and amazement their disbelief suspended beforehand.How refreshing now to have a movie like Men in Black one of the most original contributions to Scifi but never taking both genre and budget for granted and as a result never taking itself seriously. MIB is a hilarious spyactioncomedy involving probably the coolestlooking secret agency of the same name well with their RayBan sunglasses and black and white suits they sure have the coolest outfits. And talk about a thrilling job monitoring aliens who visit or live on Earth and controlling their movements inside and outside the planet. In fact they're not even aliens but intergalactic immigrants.And it really suits the film that it introduces the MIB during an arrest of illegal immigrants. Agent K Tommy Lee Jones and his partner intercept the patrol and quickly exposes the alien a weird bugeyed Mexican who doesn't seem to understand one word of Spanish. His face reveals to be a human mask only held by a creature that bears some strange resemblance sorry for the outrageous reference with the monster in Howard the Duck's. The monster jumps on the horrified border patrolman but is immediately blownup by Agent K spilling a disgusting blue slime all over the place and the poor guy's face.And then comes the key moment that unveils the film's most memorable device after the black suits and sunglasses the neuralyzer. Just one red flash and the witness's memories of their recent sightings and prevent the agency from some undesirable publicity are instantly erased. Not only the poor patrolman and his colleagues have no clue about what is going on but K's partner who feels it's time to retire will get the same treatment. He watches the stars in the dark sky and sadly declares I'll miss the chase to which K answers No you won't putting on his trademark sunglasses and adjusting the neuralyzer.The film cuts to Edwards Will Smith a NYPD officer chasing an extraordinarily fast and agile criminal who leaves no doubt about his 'extraterrestrial' background. No one believes Edwards except for the coroner Dr. Laura Weaver who just discovered some pretty weird stuff during her autopsy her enthusiasm will be abruptly cut in one neuralyzing flash from agent K. He confronts him with a pawnshop owner Tony Shalhoub in order to find out the model of weapon used by the alien Geebs knows nothing and then the bad cop good cop routine is suddenly interrupted by K blowing Geeb's head off  but only as a warning the head grows back contributing to one of the film's most defining moment.Still Edwards is not part of the secret anymore and as we expect gets a little red flash in the eye believe me it never gets redundant However K finds some potential in Edwards and leaves him a business card to assist to a recruiting session. The test the admission in the headquarters the little aliens who specialized in making coffee and Rip Torn as Z the head of the agency everything is a triumph of design and humor. The 'MIB' is like an intergalactic 'spaceport' with the widest range of Aliens' you'll find in a film but even the most rudimentary is more convincing than Independence Day atrocious octopuses.And the place works as a galactic bureau of investigation as well with all the procedural you'd expect and treated the most seriously. And that's the greatest thing about MIB that aliens are visiting Earth or trying to find a cover is treated as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world. In a brief screen showing different undercover aliens we can immediately spot Sylvester Stallone these gags are the soul of Men in Black. And don't get me started with Pavillon State monument used as a disguise for two spaceships or a weird fireball being the cause of New York 1977 blackout.But these gags work less because of their content than the way they're delivered. Tommy Lee Jones with his humorless and very matteroffact tone makes the weirdest information sound totally normal therefore more hilarious. And the funniest thing is that we end up believing him. Would you believe he'll get the hottest information from cheap tabloid newspapers? Well in fact given the context of the film it all makes sense.However the rhythm slows down a little because such a film still needs a villain who can only lead to more formulaic situation. The bad guy is played by Vincent d'Onofrio as a hillbilly whose skin was used to cover a hideous cockroachlike monster. His plot involves a small galaxy held by an Alien from an enemy planet but it's not as creative as the whole setup and while Fiorentino tries to find a place between the two leads the film is never as funny and absorbing as when it involves Agent K and Agent J. The ending is perfect though with a last shot that teaches us a wonderful lesson of intergalactichumility.As a comedy MIB captures the existential Scifi spirit more than serious films  life's a joke but stars are still beautiful to watch or to paraphrase Will Smith the difference between MIB and other Scifi is that comedy makes it look good.".

	schema:headline " An always surprising and amazing actionadventure scifi comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the best and most original films to come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years. Director Barry Sonnenfeld takes his unashamedly different approaches to film and comedy into the area of the comic book movie franchise genre. The wonderful cast is headed up by the always dependable Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as Agents K and J respectively. It is an absolutely delightful film in every sense of the word. The movie combines drama with humor and action and does it very well. It is the best film I've seen in the area of achieving these moments of fierce action and realworld occurrences directly followed up by moments of offthewall scifi adventure and outrageous dialogcharacterizationsbody language. 'Men in Black' is more or less three parallel stories running simultaneously all expertly navigated by Sonnenfeld. We have the background story of the Men in Black agency being told to us by Agent K and Director Zed Rip Torn. In a nutshell the agency has been around for a long time now. It is tasked with monitoring alien activity and protecting Earth's citizens from any harm the aliens might have planned. Smith first shows up as NYPD cop James Edwards who through a very strange yet hilarious set of occurrences is gradually inducted into the agency and learns the ropes therefore becoming the newest recruit. And we have the notsounfortunate story of a douche bag farmer named Edgar who is killed but his skin is used as a disguise 'Edgar suit' for an evil alien bug. This bug plans to find an item of great importance to him and to other alien races so that a certain war between two of these races can continue and his own race can continue to feed off the casualties  literally. Now while this may seem like a lot of unnecessary explanation leading to a lot of unnecessary exposition in the film this is simply not so. The story is explained very quickly in just a few scenes. Sometimes we figure out things as the characters do other times we are let in on stuff long before the characters ever are. But the film does not ever lose pace because of these elements nor does it stop so the audience can catch up with all these goingson. The film purposefully barrels along at a breakneck speed and the audience is just expected to dive right in and hold on for dear life. Once this is accomplished the story is really not that hard to understand. However if one feels that the story disappoints or just doesn't understand it then the film is always entertaining just as a great popcorn flick. This would also probably be the case for why small children enjoy these films so much  they may not understand the story particulars but they like the special effects and the comedic moments. This is all assisted by not only the main cast but also by several great character actors and actresses such as Tony Shalhoub and Siobhan Fallon. Whichever way you look at it 'Men in Black' is a ridiculously entertaining ride of action and all kinds of comedy and I highly recommend it. Which is not something I can say for 'Men in Black II' unfortunately. Since I haven't seen 'Men in Black III' as of yet I cannot comment on it in the slightest. I'm hoping it's just as good or better even than this first installment.".

Meanwhile a huge cockroach like alien has landed nearby  is in search of an Arquillian disguised as an antiques dealer Mike Nussbaum who has something he needs a Galaxy in a marble. Edwards accepts the job  he becomes Agent J he soon finds himself in the thick of the action as an Arquillian battle cruiser threatens to blow up Earth unless the Galaxy is returned to them...Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who replaced Les Mayfield shortly before production began this is a pretty fun scifi with some neat special effects but when all said  done doesn't add up to much. Producer Steven Spielberg hired David Koepp to do a rewrite on the script by Ed Solomon which in all fairness ended up pretty good it doesn't take itself too seriously  was based on character's from a comic book that only ran for 6 issues in 1990  it's no coincidence that the film feels like a comic book itself it's very overthetop it's quite funny at times  it's even occasionally witty as well. There's a touch of satire here as the whole alien cover up issue is played for laughs as it's a commonly accepted theory. The cheeky  jokey Will Smith plays nicely of the deadpan Tommy Lee Jones there are some funny oneliners some neat aliens  it moves along at a nice pace. There are some good setpieces as well although overall the story is average fair  while it's undoubtedly fun to watch there's not much substance beyond flashy CGI computer effects  once the whole Men in Black idea has worn off by the 30 minute mark it doesn't really have anywhere else to go  becomes a bit repetitive.Director Sonnenfeld does a fine job the special effects scenes are impressive  the film has visual flair  style. The alien creatures are very imaginative like the little guy in a mans face controlling him or the baby squid like alien or the worm guy's  all the other's that are dotted throughout the film. The special effects  CGI computer effects are superb as one would expect from a film with this sort of mega budget. That totally out of the blue ending that comes from nowhere is a bit odd though don't you think? The violence is tame although there are maybe a few scary scenes that might not be suitable for younger children  there is a fair amount of bad language. Apparently Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to direct Men in Black but turned it down wow just imagine how the film might of turned out if he had accepted!With a budget of about 90000000 Men in Black is well made with excellent production values as one would expect it has that big budget Hollywood look  feel. Danny Elfman provides his usual recycled score that sounds the same as his other's. The acting is OK the two leads play off each other well  are an amusing contrast at times rumour has it after reading the script Will Smith didn't want to do the film but his wife convinced him otherwise. Apparently Clint Eastwood was offered the role of K but turned it down while Chris O'Donnell  David Schwimmer were both offered the part of J but foolishly considering their's  Will Smith's subsequent careers said no.Men in Black is a good light hearted scifi film that can be witty funny clever  exciting but maybe not quite on a consistent level. It's still a very good film though  definitely one worth checking out if you haven't already. Followed by a sequel Men in Black II 2002 a cartoon series Men in Black The Series 1997  2001.".

Apparently Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to direct Men in Black but turned it down wow just imagine how the film might of turned out if he had accepted!With a budget of about 90000000 Men in Black is well made with excellent production values as one would expect it has that big budget Hollywood look  feel. Danny Elfman provides his usual recycled score that sounds the same as his other's. The acting is OK the two leads play off each other well  are an amusing contrast at times rumour has it after reading the script Will Smith didn't want to do the film but his wife convinced him otherwise. Apparently Clint Eastwood was offered the role of K but turned it down while Chris O'Donnell  David Schwimmer were both offered the part of J but foolishly considering their's  Will Smith's subsequent careers said no.Men in Black is a good light hearted scifi film that can be witty funny clever  exciting but maybe not quite on a consistent level. It's still a very good film though  definitely one worth checking out if you haven't already. Followed by a sequel Men in Black II 2002 a cartoon series Men in Black The Series 1997  2001.";

I am so glad that neither David Schwimmer and Clin Eastwood accepted the role of J and K  because I cannot imagine two better actors then Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to play them! Will is so funny while Tommy is sarcastic and ironic and they have an excellent chemistry as a team!We can see many references made in this movie to ''E.T.'' and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the end where a big alien is playing marbles with our galaxy is brilliant! I also learned after this movie that existed actual ''Men in Black'' who were supposed to be in contact with UFOs what was a big surprise to me since I imagined it to be a creation of the director or writer.Agent K is a member of an organization called ''MIB'' that has been keeping track of extraterrestrial aliens on Earth for over 40 years as a police for alien activity on Earth. K needs a new partner and after knowing about the abilities of James Edwards a NYPD officer he sees that the guy has potential to be his partner. James eventually becomes agent J being erased from the government's and society's records and receiving a new identity. With many funny scenes specially from J trying to ''adapt'' himself to his new world full of aliens both K and J needs to save the world from destruction with their high tech weapons. Their enemy is a ''Bug '' considered to be a plague and one of the worst aliens in the universe and also a very large and disgusting cockroach.".

	schema:reviewBody "The second the movie was over I was dumbstruck and I wasn't the only one. When the movie ended I thought there would be a big round of applause but when I turned around I saw that about half the audience was still in their seats. I looked at a couple of people some were speachless and most were crying. Nonetheless I didn't hear a word. When I thought about it i realized an applause would have been ridiculous.When someone asked me how the movie was I was going to say it was amazing but that wouldn't have done the movie justice. The movie was an extremely moving emotional experience.The cast was absolutely flawless Jim Caviezel gave a powerful performance as Jesus Maia Morgenstern as Mary brought me to tears and even though Monica Bellucci spoke only a few lines her performance and beauty astonished me. The score was incredible. It had a middleeastern feel to it and was timeless and beautiful.Most aspects of the movie were perfect to me. Instead of a squeaky clean version of the life of Jesus it was a realistic and heartbreaking portrayal of his final hours. The Aramaic Latin and Hebrew languages and wonderful cinematography made you really feel like you were in first century Jerusalem. The flashbacks truly had an emotional impact on me.While watching this movie I forgot about everything else in the world. Mel Gibson did an incredible job as a director and he truly was brave for taking on this project despite all the controversy.As for the two main concerns of most people the ultraviolence and the alleged antisemetism these are my views on the two.Everything people are saying about the violence is true. It is brutal gory and quite possibly the most violent work in cinematic history. This RRating is very well justified and an NC17 would have made sense. If you are the type of person that cannot bear violence this is definately not the movie for you. Some scenes of torture last about 10 minutes when you feel you've seen enough after 30 seconds. But the violence I feel was absolutely necessary. The movie is about the sufferingpassion of Jesus and turning the camera away would not have an impact on you. The movie shows what Jesus actually went through for all of mankind's sins according to Christianity. Mel Gibson did not exagerate the violence or make it look like horror movie or Kill Bill violence. As Jay Leno said on his show the other night when Jesus was hit it felt like WE were being hit as opposed to other violent movies were you feel like YOU are the one hitting the person. I don't think anyone can say that every single hit upon Jesus didn't affect himher somehow.As for the antisemetism in the movie I didn't find it was as bad as everyone is making it out to be. The thing that made me see why people were criticizing Mel Gibson for was that instead of spreading the blame somewhat on the Jewish high priests Sanhedrin and mostly on Pilate 99 of the blame was put on the Sanhedrin which seemed false to me considering that historically it is known that Pilate was a vicious monster and in the movie he seems like a gentle person and reluctant to crucify Jesus. I simply didn't buy the fact that Pilate would be so nice. The movie can be considered antifirstcenturyRomans and antiSanhedrin but I did not feel the movie was attacking the Jewish religion or the entire Jewish people. But the movie is not antisemitic for these reasons 1. It is made evident that it was Jesus' prophecy and destiny is to die. He could probably have escaped from Gethsemane or even the cross if he truly had ''powers''. He was born to die and there is no blame to be placed on anyone. If anything the Romans of that time are portrayed horribly though realistically and they are the ones that made him suffer tremendously before his death. 2. Basically all the ''Good Guys'' in the movie are Jewish. Jesus himself was a Jew Mary was The man that helped Jesus carry the cross was Jewish Veronica the woman that brought Jesus water and wiped his face was and many Jews were screaming in the crowd against the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. Personally I don't know why Pilate was portrayed so nicely. It's not like the Jews had the ultimate power. It was ultimately HIS decision to have Jesus crucified.An aspect of the film that intrigued me was the character of Satan and the demons in the movie. When I first found out Satan was in the movie I was scared it would be a red man with horns and a pitchfork but heshe is portrayed subtly. Everything about himher was very Eerie.Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for making this film. He made the movie the way HE thought it was and though most historians or even religious figures would not agree completely to what happened it is a general idea as to what those final hours were. When reading the new testament or hearing the story of Jesus it's hard to understand what it was actually like for Jesus to go through all that pain and what it was like for Mary to watch her son get tortured and crucified. The movie really put things in perspective for me.Some people are criticizing him for adding things never written in the gospels such as demons harassing Judas Iscariot most scenes with Satan and the torture from Gethsemene to the Jewish court but he had to fill the blanks in the Gospels with what he thought might have happened.In conclusion not everyone will like this movie. Some will love it and some will hate it. But I think that if you can endure the extreme violence and torture you should at least see it before you judge it. My opinion 1010".

I don't think anyone can say that every single hit upon Jesus didn't affect himher somehow.As for the antisemetism in the movie I didn't find it was as bad as everyone is making it out to be. The thing that made me see why people were criticizing Mel Gibson for was that instead of spreading the blame somewhat on the Jewish high priests Sanhedrin and mostly on Pilate 99 of the blame was put on the Sanhedrin which seemed false to me considering that historically it is known that Pilate was a vicious monster and in the movie he seems like a gentle person and reluctant to crucify Jesus. I simply didn't buy the fact that Pilate would be so nice. The movie can be considered antifirstcenturyRomans and antiSanhedrin but I did not feel the movie was attacking the Jewish religion or the entire Jewish people. But the movie is not antisemitic for these reasons 1. It is made evident that it was Jesus' prophecy and destiny is to die. He could probably have escaped from Gethsemane or even the cross if he truly had ''powers''. He was born to die and there is no blame to be placed on anyone. If anything the Romans of that time are portrayed horribly though realistically and they are the ones that made him suffer tremendously before his death. 2. Basically all the ''Good Guys'' in the movie are Jewish. Jesus himself was a Jew Mary was The man that helped Jesus carry the cross was Jewish Veronica the woman that brought Jesus water and wiped his face was and many Jews were screaming in the crowd against the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. Personally I don't know why Pilate was portrayed so nicely. It's not like the Jews had the ultimate power. It was ultimately HIS decision to have Jesus crucified.An aspect of the film that intrigued me was the character of Satan and the demons in the movie. When I first found out Satan was in the movie I was scared it would be a red man with horns and a pitchfork but heshe is portrayed subtly. Everything about himher was very Eerie.Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for making this film. He made the movie the way HE thought it was and though most historians or even religious figures would not agree completely to what happened it is a general idea as to what those final hours were. When reading the new testament or hearing the story of Jesus it's hard to understand what it was actually like for Jesus to go through all that pain and what it was like for Mary to watch her son get tortured and crucified. The movie really put things in perspective for me.Some people are criticizing him for adding things never written in the gospels such as demons harassing Judas Iscariot most scenes with Satan and the torture from Gethsemene to the Jewish court but he had to fill the blanks in the Gospels with what he thought might have happened.In conclusion not everyone will like this movie. Some will love it and some will hate it. But I think that if you can endure the extreme violence and torture you should at least see it before you judge it. My opinion 1010";

As a nonChristian who nevertheless respects the historical figure of Jesus Christ and the beauty of his philosophy and teachings I found The Passion to be a powerful portrayal of much that I think is worthwhile about the Christ story. I know the film has been maligned for antisemitic content perhaps because Jews make mistakes in the film and are seen as persecutors instead of victims?  it could have been anybody! and for various other problems  but let's face it  any movie portraying this subject was bound to face strong reactions. And kudos to Mel Gibson for not shying away from the subject by creating a sterile gutless Disney story out of what really was a good example of the everyday horror of life on the fringes of the Roman empire. Gibson invents a new genre with The Passion  that of historical horror. The performances in this film are inspired. I felt that the film brought out the cowardice of the apostles very forcefully and the courage and love of the two Maries in Jesus' life was palpable to the very end. The effect of Aramaic and Latin with the moody soundtrack was spellbinding. Again kudos to Mel Gibson for his courage and artistic integrity on the decisions involved in these elements of the film.Final word  this is not a film for the whole family nor is it a feelgood film. Don't see it if you're not willing to confront the worst aspects of human nature up close. And don't go in looking for your own version of the story  it's not your film!

	schema:reviewBody "It took me a long while to decide whether to see The Passion of the Christ. It had been my intention to since Mel Gibson first announced the project but endless reports of the film's unflinching brutality made me fear it might be too much to bear. I eventually decided however that whether I really wanted to or not this was a film I needed to see. It took me two viewings to really get a grip on it so intense were the emotions it provoked in me. Even now weeks later reexamining it in detail is still deeply affecting. For those few still unaware the film details the last twelve hours in the life of Christ. Its dialogue is entirely in Latin and Aramaic with English subtitles a remarkably bold decision by Gibson and one that pays dividends. On one level it unites an international cast sparing us any clashing accents and gives the film a greater sense of authenticity. On another it forced Gibson and his team into a very visual form of storytelling even amongst the carnage there are shots of aching beauty.Huge credit must go to the cast for mastering the language and employing it in such universally excellent performances. As Jesus James Caviezel has the immense task of embodying the most important figure in human history and often doing so with little dialogue and one eye swollen shut. Despite these handicaps Caviezel delivers a performance of great emotional depth embodying quiet nobility and sacrifice. The performance that really stood out was that of Maia Morgenstern as Mary. The pain she conveys through her large and expressive eyes is heartbreaking as she is forced to watch her child endure the most unimaginable suffering. Yet throughout the film she maintains an almost luminescent beauty entirely befitting the mother of God.One of the themes of the story emphasised by the film is the bond between Jesus and Mary. One flashback found nowhere in the Bible details the mundane routine of Jesus being called in from carpentry by His mother to eat. It was an immensely powerful reminder that for all He was the Son of God Jesus was also the son of an ordinary woman who He loved as any child loves its mother. It was also from this vein that the most powerful moment of the film sprang. As Jesus carries His cross Mary begs John to get her closer to Him. She emerges into His path just as He fall under the weight of the cross. She runs to His aid and as she does so the film cuts between this and a similar moment when Jesus was a child and fell outside the house. While she could offer him protection then now she is powerless she weeps as the guards thrust her roughly away from her son and so do we.It is moments such as these that make the film so much more than the orgy of violence its detractors claim. For example Peter's panicked betrayal and subsequent horrified realisation of what he has done is handled in such a way as to move one to tears. There is also an immensely poetic moment near the film's end in which the camera tracks the progress of a single drop of rain from miles above Golgotha which falls as Jesus breathes His last a teardrop from Heaven.As a film The Passion of the Christ is excellent as a religious experience it is even better. Gibson has come under attack for focusing merely on Jesus' death and omitting His message of love  this criticism is both unfair and illjudged. In fact he strikes the perfect balance including flashbacks at pivotal moments of the film to events such as Jesus washing the disciples' feet the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper. These remain very true to the text with quotes such as You are my friends and the greatest love a man can have for his friends is to give his live for them John 1513 incorporated whole and delivered beautifully.Even is there were no flashbacks however the point of the film would remain and it is a vitally important one. It serves as a powerful reminder of the reality of what happened Jesus did not merely die for us He was killed by us in the most terrible way imaginable. It is something that can easily be lost through over familiarity with the text and the flowery nature of other representations but which must not be forgotten.It has been said that If Christ be not risen then our faith is in vain and the film has also been attacked for devoting just a few minutes to the Resurrection. Such criticism however betrays a very narrow minded approach the manner in which this sequence is filmed conveys the full thematic significance it.Perhaps the film's greatest impact has been to get me to pick up the Bible again and do so with a new faith and understanding. And for that Gibson deserves nothing but praise.".

The emphasis on violence is fundamental as it's what reveals how much God suffered because of what I did. So I the spectator am experiencing with all my emotions what I can only imagine and reflect about when reading the Gospels. And I'm not the kind of person that reads about Jesus crucified and direct relates it to all the bad things I did to contribute to that moment and even when I do it's more like in a lucid almost indifferent way while the movie forces me to feel the burden that I've put on My Lord's shoulder.This is of course from my Christian perspective and I wouldn't even try to talk about what's great in the movie from a secular perspective.

There's so much of it and it feels so natural.I can only assume that christians that don't like The Passion of the Christ are those that didn't actually take their time to think about the Passion of Christ. The movie is a chance to do so. It's ugly and repulsive? Yes but only for a moment. When you realize that it captures the essence of God's love for humanity it becomes eternally beautiful. Jesus didn't have to do that. He did because of me because of you because He is the good shepherd that lays his life for the sheep.So what if the reality of the Passion is full of gore and tears and injustice? We are the cause of that and sometimes we better realize it by having it thrown on our faces however hurt we may end up feeling. Just remember that our pain is nothing compared to our Lord's pain. I can only speak for myself when I say that my love for my Savior is very small but I know very well that He loves me with a heart that is ready to bleed without hesitation even though I'm not worth it.".

Trailers have shown too much story reviews have jaded your perspective or friends have refused to see it  movies get spoiled. Yet sometimes knowing the story is a far cry from seeing the event. For many the story of the crucifixion is something they've grown up with lived with as far back as memory serves. I tell you this no matter what you've heard no matter what you know  you will be stunned by The Passion of the Christ.From the opening shot to the falling credits this film demands full control of ones body and emotion. So visually spectacular and physically gripping this film had me literally convulsing as I attempted to watch what was onscreen. Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ starring Jim Caviezel is a retelling of the last hours of Jesus Christ. Believe me when I say that this production is more than a story more than a movie this film can only be described as an experience.This movie is fantastically brutal. From beginning to end blood drenched flesh is smeared across the screen in a ghastly fashion. Gibson defends his incredibly graphic depiction by noting that the bible states Jesus was beaten beyond recognition. I assure you beaten beyond recognition hardly describes soft tissue being torn to be the bone as blood drips into puddles on the ground. The violence shown in this movie is unlike other Hollywood violence  it's uncomfortably personal. The scenes are so believable the violence so real that the scenes appear to take place in your very presence imagine before you a man being torn to bloody shreds your helpless to do anything you're a spectator  utterly horrific.As any appreciator of the finer things in film might see The Passion of the Christ is artistic genius. Mel Gibson stated that his film follows the last 12 hours of Christ in accordance to the gospel and although biblical scholars have confirmed this to be true it is also true that a certain artistic license was taken to particular moments in the story. Nothing antibiblical was added but inside a sense deep meaning was inserted through symbols and actions not actually recorded in the gospels. This artistry serves to aid the story and engage the audience  artistically and culturally expect nothing less that a film superbly crafted. Set your expectations high this one can handle them.Unless you've been avoiding the media in recent months you've heard accusations of antiSemitism against this movie its going to rekindle a hate for Jews its depicting the Jewish leaders of the day as monsters and its showing that the Jews were solely responsible for the death of Jesus. I trust that once the movie is seen by the general public all of these statements will fade into the shadows this movies greatest defense will be itself. It is true that the Jews were involved in the crucifixion of Christ just as it's said in the bible for nearly two thousand years. Hearing this story doesn't swell up a hatred for the Jewish race no more than watching Schindlers List makes one hate current day Germans. This film is going to be many things to many people  antiSemitic is not one of them.No matter your background no matter your race no matter your beliefs on the afterlife this movie needs to be seen. The art the culture and the magnificence  see The Passion of the Christ and you will have seen the fantastic. Ten out of ten.This has been a critical review by Adam Schellenberg".

This film is going to be many things to many people  antiSemitic is not one of them.No matter your background no matter your race no matter your beliefs on the afterlife this movie needs to be seen. The art the culture and the magnificence  see The Passion of the Christ and you will have seen the fantastic. Ten out of ten.This has been a critical review by Adam Schellenberg";

	schema:reviewBody "The Passion of the Christ is an undeniably moving and emotionally galvanizing experience and will indelibly stay in your conscience long after the credits roll. It is now 3 years later and I saw the film once in the theaters and I remember it like I saw it yesterday. And this is coming from someone who still hasn't made up his mind about religion. This is a one of a kind film that will affect you as long as you have a pulse. For those jaded enough to just view the film as antiSemitic or just plain hooey then perhaps I will stipulate that you will find something wrong with it. But for anyone who at least has a humanitarian side to them this movie will get inside you and never leave.Mel Gibson has lost much of his credibility when he got drunk one night and went off on Jews. This rant painted him as a hypocrite and that is very unfortunate because this film is one that at least has something to say. If nothing else it shows us that humanity hasn't changed in 2000 years. We are still as violent as we ever were. We still don't value a human life anymore than we did when Jesus ostensibly walked the Earth. Christ apparently died for our sins and if you believe in this if you accept the fact that Jesus got tortured more than any living thing should be then you have to understand that this was done so that we could have our sins wiped away when entering the Kingdom. But it was also done if you believe in Christianity andor Catholicism so that we could become better people. Why else would God allow his only begotten son to succumb to such despicable and inhumane treatment? One would hope that it is to better humanity not make it worse. Although I didn't live in Biblical times I can only assume that times are not any better now than it was then. Torture is still prevalent in myriad of countries and even condoned by the U.S president himself...the most powerful man in the world. Famine is at an all time high and while the rich countries like the one I live in do little to help wipe it out there are starving people even on our street corners. Altruism is a word that most people don't know how to spell let alone practice. Greed is everywhere and the opulence that is provided by the very Earth we live on is being destroyed and pillaged by those that should be thanking their lucky stars that we have this great place to live in.What does this all mean? Does this have anything to do with the movie? Of course it does. As I said if anything this film appeals to the humanitarian in all of us. I don't know how I feel about God Jesus John 316 and The Bible and so on. But even though I am ambivalent to all of this I still have emotions and I do respect a human life. And if a man deity or human was actually treated this way by a society that existed 2000 years ago or 10 days ago it is bothersome. If there was a man named Jesus Christ that existed and taught us to be altruistic and benevolent and peaceful he would be disgusted to see how we all turned out. The Passion of the Christ is about that man. It doesn't matter if he was a God a spirit or the flesh and blood this is a film about the power belief. But it is also about the power of corruption and corruption of power. And power can be absolutely corrupting and this is what has turned our world into a cesspool of the rich and dangerous. Because when you watch the film the fear of this man the fear of what he represented is what scared everyone.The Passion of the Christ is a masterpiece of film making. I believe it wasn't nominated for anything because the donkeys that run Hollywood are powerfully corrupt as well and there are plenty of powerful figures who just don't agree with the supposed message and supposed antisemitism. I don't really think Mel cares too much what the rest of Hollywood thinks of him as this film apparently netted him more than 300 million dollars as he funded the film by himself. I say good for him. It's a shame alcohol makes you say such asinine things because Mel damaged his reputation beyond repair when he did so but that shouldn't take away from the brilliance of this film. James Caviezel is a miracle as the Christ figure. Speaking in an entirely different language he conveys the passion the fear the emotion and the spirit of Jesus Christ. I can't imagine another actor playing this part.The Passion of the Christ is one of the most moving motion pictures of all time. It brought me to tears. Tears of anger tears of sorrow and tears for fear. As I said this is coming from someone who sits on the fence when it comes to religion. If you are a Christian or a practicing Catholic this film will move you like no other.1010 Love it or hate it for what it says you cannot deny how it will make you feel.".

Mary Mother of Jesus asks Mary Magdalene on the night Christ is arrested to which Magdalene replies Because once we were slaves and now we are free. This in my interpretation forges a quite beautiful link between Judiasm and Christianity as this question and answer or some variation of it is recited at traditional Passover Seders to commemorate the beginning of ancient Jews' escape from their Egyptian overlords but could also apply here to those of us including myself who are believers that Christ was and is the Son of God as we see this night as the beginning of our freedom from eternal death and the end of our slavery to sin.This film has been criticized for its level of violence I read one other reviewer who commented that this film was for people who like pulling the legs off of bugs or something to that effect. This of course is the common attitude of people who misunderstand what the story of the Passion of our Lord means to those of us who believe in Him. It is not about taking pleasure in His or anyone else's pain it is about an admittedly painful reminder of just WHAT He was willing to endure for we believe our salvation. It is NOT about sadomasochism antiSemitism or any other negative thing it is about LOVE SALVATION and again LOVE. In fact the kind of LOVE that would drive our Lord to do what He did can only be spelled in capital letters it is more than we can comprehend.Now on to the performances. Mr. Caviezel was absolutely magnificent. Never have I seen a human face on film or in reality that looked so brutalized and yet so peaceful even in the throes of agony. Whether you believe Christ was in fact the Saviour or not his performance is the embodiment of infinite unconditional LOVE peace and grace under the pressure of unimaginable physical and emotional abuse and in the flashback scene between Christ and His Mother JOY! Yes there is joy in this film albeit briefly as Jesus shares a laugh and a kiss on the cheek with His Mother after obediently washing His hands before entering their home to eat. Caviezel is amazing and the other actors are up to par with him. And for all the brutality leading up to it the depiction of the Resurrection is simply breathtaking  so much so that it made me forget the horrors immediately preceding it.See the film with an open mind whatever your beliefs or religion. Do not believe the negative things you have heard if you ever believed them and perhaps if not Christian yourself you will come to understand what this Man means to your brothers and sisters in humanity who do take Him as their Saviour. God bless you all whoever you are whatever you believe.".

	schema:headline " an honest review about this controversial film";
	schema:reviewBody "it seems as many reviews on here aren't reviewing the film but are reviewing it's topic which depicts the last days of Jesus and therefore there are different opinions based on their religious or nonreligious views or based on the brutality in which this film portrays the crucifixion of Jesus like they think it is trying to brainwash the viewers into becoming a believerChristian. this film isn't about any of that.it attempts to be different than other films about Jesus in its portrayal as others depict his life in English a language not used amongst them and using whips as scourging rather than a Roman flagrum which is similar to using a cat o' nine tail. as great there have been films to illustrate Jesus' life such films as Jesus Christ Superstar The Gospel According to St. Matthew The Greatest Story Ever Told Jesus of Nazareth The Messiah Jesus with Jeremy Sisto to name a few they never went to such lengths as this film went. is this film better for it? that's debatable but something I am in favour of and here's why..I went to view this film with my sisters as soon as it hit the theaters here despite my mother's disapproval. she had heard of the woman who had a heart attack and died at the scene of Jesus' scourging and has never seen this film as a result. when viewing the film one can see why. some scenes are hard to take. Mel Gibson went through quite an effort to research the Aramaic language one that has been lost for quite some time and it's understandable that someone would think it not accurate. however no other filmmaker has attempted this and at the same time a film that also features Hebrew and Latin combined as the languages were at the time with the Jews and Romans. as mentioned earlier the film also uses the Roman flagrum and that's where the brutal scene is. we see skin falling of James Caviezel's back when they scourge him and with that a lot of blood. it's a hard watch but a realistic one at that. along with this we also see sightings of the devil as told in the bible and the events of Judas after he wants to take back what he said which after the refusal it is said that he went crazy started to see things and hanged himself. the film shows he being tormented by the children and we also see him hanging himself to the point he is hanging. the scene that impacted on me the most is when Mary Maia Morgenstern and Mary Magdalen Monica Bellucci are left to clean up Jesus' blood. for me that was the hardest watch as I truly felt sympathy for Jesus' mother and was drawn to tears. I didn't know if it was just me crying at that scene but as I looked around the room I did not see anyone who was not crying. everything else in the film it didn't affect me because I was prepared for it. James Caviezel is great as Jesus and I rather liked the performance Hristo Shopov gave of Pontius Pilate and Giacinto Ferro gave of Joseph of Arimathea and that of John and Peter Christo Jivkov and Francesco De Vito. the overall cast were quite perfect for their roles really.For me this film is a true gem and it's one that is loved by my dad my sisters and I alike. so much so that since its release in 2004 we haven't missed a year of viewing this film as it is a film we watch every good Friday. I especially love it because it skips right to the final days rather than retells Jesus' life as that does get repetitiveseen it all before. Finally a film that is brave enough to go that extra mile.".

It emphasised how much Jesus suffered for all of us. Beside this so many film critics and people who had problems with both Mel Gibson and the Catholic Church said this film was antisemitic but i agree with Mel Gibson when he says that this film was just going along with what is said in the gospels and who accuses the gospels of being antisemetic? No one because it isn't and had a message of forgiveness predominately in it as does the Passion of Christ  it does'nt leave out Jesus saying 'Father forgive them for they know not what they do'  Jesus forgave those responsible for his death and everyone  some Jews were responsible for his death as were some Romans and some future Catholics but we do not hold anything against the other Jews or of the time or those Jews andothers actually responsible or against any Jews now or any descendants of those who might've had a part in Jesus' death and those that claim to be Catholic and do are not Catholic truly. This movie is a inspiring movie and the talent of Mel Gibson indirecting and producing it is evident in the quality of the filming and the the way in which the sequence of events along with flashbacks is portrayed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe I didn't write a review after seeing this but I must have incorrectly presumed I did. With so many other reviewers by now I'll make my points as brief as possible. GOOD  Kudos for someone finally presenting an accurate account of Christ's sufferings as gruesome and horrible as they were although if you read the Gospel accounts in the Bible it was even worse than shown on this film. Jesus' face was beaten to a pulp and unrecognizable so keep that in mind if you think the film overdid the beatings. However the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film it's an accordingtotheBook account and after you see this on film it shakes you up.I heard that people were so stunned they couldn't speak for about a half hour after coming out of the theaters. I thought that was probably exaggerated but it wasn't. I felt the same way just stunned at what I had witnessed. As a Believer it was something I needed to see to remind me of what this Godin the flesh human voluntarily went through. For nonBelievers scoffers or whatever I don't know what your reaction was to the film but for me it was a humbling sobering experience.THE BAD  The unrelenting brutality against Jesus the last threequarters of this film is so bad that frankly I would hesitate before ever watching this again. One viewing is enough. I am amazed so many people sat through this including Christians. I wish directorproducer Mel Gibson had shown more of Christ's resurrection instead of centering 99 percent of this movie on his suffering although I understand Mel's point. However all of Jesus' claims and sufferings are meaningless without the resurrection so why not emphasize that instead of just tacking it on for the last minute or two? Just asking.It's a clich but this is a film you won't soon forget but I would add to that one you probably won't want to watch multiple times.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie the night it came out with my boyfriend. We are both Roman Catholic. My bf is more religious than I am I'll admit but after seeing this movie I think I really understand and appreciate why I was Baptized and Confirmed. If you are Catholic or Christian or whatever you want to call your beliefs in Christ do yourself a favor and see this movie. Don't worry it's far less gory on your home TV. About three minutes into the movie until the bitter end and past the credits my boyfriend and I held each other and cried. Mel Gibson BRAVO. Who knew he had it in him? I thought he was just another rich movie star. Mel if you read these YOUR MOVIE WAS AB SOUL UTELY BRILLIANT! I never really understood why my Mom wanted me to go to Church and why she cried and was so insulted when I told her two days before my Confirmation that I was having doubts. My Mom believed in something I could not grasp by the teachings of my Church alone. Maybe it's because we are so used to gore in today's society that I didn't really think twice that Jesus had to endure all these things. Maybe it's because no one takes the time to show and explain to kids just exactly what all those lashings would do to your flesh.NOT over the top  I think this was a brilliant move with the lashings and the cattails  to show us the horror that words alone cannot portray. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Jesus and those who loved him during these last few hours is breathtaking. His portrayal of Satan is also quite interesting. Why shouldn't it be played by a woman? Haven't YOU had any dealings with them? I myself am a woman and I thought that was a pretty good idea along with the maggot. Excellent way of telling us who that was. This movie will make you a better CatholicChristianWhatever. It made me believe that even if the viewer doesn't think this man is the Messiah He did suffer ever so much for a cause that HE believed in. That is enough for me The fact that this Man believed that if He died on the cross that all humankind would be saved and the fact that He carried this out is amazing.You might think that He was just some nut or probably didn't exist at all but the fact of the matter is that this is a historically documented tale about someone who's belief was larger than life itself. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Oh and about whether or not it's antiSematic um...go read the Bible. It's not Mel's fault....".

Mel definitely adds whatever he feels like it's funny that the religious right has long attacked The Last Temptation of Christ on this board too for its liberties but that movie wasn't intended to be 'accurate.' This one is supposedly and that's a shame because I don't remember the Gospels including any instances of Jesus using his power for trite little tricks like sitting on air. I mean come on even the Jedi in Star Wars take their power more seriously than that we should not expect less from the Son of God. Add to that the eyepecking of the thief and the demonchildren who chase Judas around... as a version of scripture this is weak because it's not interesting and abominable because it pretends to accuracy but does not deliver it.As a work of art awful. Braveheart The Patriot Pearl Harbor any other dumb sentimental Hollywood 'epic' tripe that is shamelessly manipulative in technique and beats you to death with its opinions and plastic message. Redundant slow motion painfully silly camerawork at times Jesus's upsidedown pointofview shot comes to mind rife with historical inaccuracies Jesus carrying the whole cross as opposed to just the beam the nails going into the hands not the wrists... and pathetically acted by the female leads who show almost no emotion when they could evoke justlyearned tears with the hysterical wailing that was probably called for.Another glaring failure of this film is its inability to decide whether to be symbolic or literal. The claim most 'Christians' are making is that the extreme violence in this film is justified for the sake of realism. Well I don't buy it this movie is not even trying to be realisticliteral. Consider the appearance of Satan the heavyhanded symbolism surrounding Judas's death etc.Which leads me to an oftmade point there is no justification for the pervasive level of violence in this film. Mel does nothing to lend it context thus it is totally unearned. Mel's obsession with this especially to the extent to which it excludes Jesus's allimportant message is distressing to me.The characters are wooden. There's simply nothing else to say here. If you watched the movie you got to see one dimension of each character.On the good side Jim Caviezel's performance was excellent. Great casting I was surprised and please Mel didn't pick a superattractive Jesus. I liked the choices of the disciples as well. Satan was creepy but don't get me wrong the fact that Satan existed at all was way off base in my opinion. There were some nice shots but they were mostly ruined by the supershiny look featuring sappy morecolorfulthanreallifeevenis coloration.As a means for proselytizing dismal. Anyone seduced by the Hollywood gloss of this movie is not coming to Christ for the right reason nor with the proper understanding since the film does not teach us anything. Read the Gospels.".

Braveheart The Patriot Pearl Harbor any other dumb sentimental Hollywood 'epic' tripe that is shamelessly manipulative in technique and beats you to death with its opinions and plastic message. Redundant slow motion painfully silly camerawork at times Jesus's upsidedown pointofview shot comes to mind rife with historical inaccuracies Jesus carrying the whole cross as opposed to just the beam the nails going into the hands not the wrists... and pathetically acted by the female leads who show almost no emotion when they could evoke justlyearned tears with the hysterical wailing that was probably called for.Another glaring failure of this film is its inability to decide whether to be symbolic or literal. The claim most 'Christians' are making is that the extreme violence in this film is justified for the sake of realism. Well I don't buy it this movie is not even trying to be realisticliteral. Consider the appearance of Satan the heavyhanded symbolism surrounding Judas's death etc.Which leads me to an oftmade point there is no justification for the pervasive level of violence in this film. Mel does nothing to lend it context thus it is totally unearned. Mel's obsession with this especially to the extent to which it excludes Jesus's allimportant message is distressing to me.The characters are wooden. There's simply nothing else to say here. If you watched the movie you got to see one dimension of each character.On the good side Jim Caviezel's performance was excellent. Great casting I was surprised and please Mel didn't pick a superattractive Jesus. I liked the choices of the disciples as well. Satan was creepy but don't get me wrong the fact that Satan existed at all was way off base in my opinion. There were some nice shots but they were mostly ruined by the supershiny look featuring sappy morecolorfulthanreallifeevenis coloration.As a means for proselytizing dismal. Anyone seduced by the Hollywood gloss of this movie is not coming to Christ for the right reason nor with the proper understanding since the film does not teach us anything. Read the Gospels.";

The Jewish contingent hated it because they perceived it as portraying the Jews in a bad light. I understand that but I can find lots of titles that portray different groups not to their liking. My criticism  the real objection to how the Jews were portrayed  was that they were nothing but caricatures the result of a terrible script and worse directing.This is the worst failing that can be leveled at any screenplay and any director and it impugns the integrity of the film more than political overtones. This is the same criticism leveled at the portrayal of the Roman soldiers  they are nothing caricatures. Can it be that not a single Roman had ANY trace of compassion or humanity? How stereotyped is that? And how totally unbelievable. If anything the Italians should be even more insulted than the Jews about the portrayal of their country men. But then comes the gratuitous unrelenting violence....it is abhorrent. I got it Mr. Gibson  Christ was scourged. I got it in the first 3 min of the scourging I got it after the next 15 minutes. To prolong those torture scenes was about the most viscous unnecessary violence I have ever seen on a movie screen. I would have thought there would have been an outcry from every corner of the political and religious spectrum about that  from the Jews from the Christians and the especially from the Churches since all that violence was nothing more than using the suffering of Christ whether you think he is the Lord or just a poor guy caught up in the politics of the day he was a human being and to trade on that suffering to make a movie sensational debases all of us. But I guess gratuitous violence is tolerable even perfectly acceptable if it is enlisted to prove some religious ideology.The film teaches us nothing. Not about the man not about his divinity not about the underlying historical context in which he was sacrificed  absolutely nothing. I think it is a loathsome film and I am ashamed that socalled religious people overlooked all that is wrong with it and praised it just because whether consciously or unconsciously they could use it as a kind of weapon against another religious group. It is despicable mix feeding on violence and religious sensibilities to make a buck....it is so crass that even Hollywood much to its credit turned it down. But I guess where there is a buck to be made SOMEONE will grab it to make more no matter how sleazy the project. The fact that it was made independently of Hollywood doesn't absolve it of its glaring disgusting faults.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since there is only one review of this film on IMDb and it is a relatively shallow positive one I felt compelled to express my acute lack of sympathy with the writing acting and overall commercialism of this attempt of the mainland Chinese film industry to prove they can do romantic comedies as well as Hollywood  or more precisely the same as Hollywood.First of all for someone to lose a boyfriend after seven years and to ostensibly recover in about 30 or 35 days is simply not plausible. In addition she seems not really all that put out by the whole affair. She does fall asleep while working with a client and she does yell at her boss but other than these few feelingsorryformyself lapses she soldiers on with her job and cultivating new interests.Yes she gets drunk  but this scene was merely set up to allow her ex to put her down with a few of the only well crafted lines of dialogue in the movie.The joke about 'handsfree' vs. 'mute' on a cell phone I've seen more than once before the coming to care about a guy whom you suspected of batting for the other team has been done better elsewhere the kindly indulgent advice from her understanding boss echoes so many Spencer Tracy Elizabeth Taylor scenes and finally the pathos of losing your aunt and her story of her husband's infidelity seemed a patch job relatively unconnected to the rest of the film.The main problem is the central character a girl seemingly chosen primarily for her looks rather than her acting ability and with the writing which gave her persona no real depth of sympathy with which the audience could feel any sort of empathy.3 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Since there is only one review of this film on IMDb and it is a relatively shallow positive one I felt compelled to express my acute lack of sympathy with the writing acting and overall commercialism of this attempt of the mainland Chinese film industry to prove they can do romantic comedies as well as Hollywood  or more precisely the same as Hollywood.First of all for someone to lose a boyfriend after seven years and to ostensibly recover in about 30 or 35 days is simply not plausible. In addition she seems not really all that put out by the whole affair. She does fall asleep while working with a client and she does yell at her boss but other than these few feelingsorryformyself lapses she soldiers on with her job and cultivating new interests.Yes she gets drunk  but this scene was merely set up to allow her ex to put her down with a few of the only well crafted lines of dialogue in the movie.The joke about 'handsfree' vs. 'mute' on a cell phone I've seen more than once before the coming to care about a guy whom you suspected of batting for the other team has been done better elsewhere the kindly indulgent advice from her understanding boss echoes so many Spencer Tracy Elizabeth Taylor scenes and finally the pathos of losing your aunt and her story of her husband's infidelity seemed a patch job relatively unconnected to the rest of the film.The main problem is the central character a girl seemingly chosen primarily for her looks rather than her acting ability and with the writing which gave her persona no real depth of sympathy with which the audience could feel any sort of empathy.3 out of 10.";

However as the criminals aren't just printing up their own money they also plan to use it to topple the economy and take down the government. As her investigative work continues Namsoon soon makes the acquaintance of a young man known only as Sad Eyes Gang Dongwon for the way that he looks out at you from underneath his hair  he doesn't say much but he's got that look and that's all it takes to pique Namsoon's interest in him even if she shouldn't be thinking those thoughts about someone she might have to toss in jail. Of course Namsoon can't deny her feelings even if the object of her affection belongs behind bars and it's not long before she's starting to act on her emotions.";

I'm currently an art student and I've helped in the filming of more than a few movies in my life and I've seen more movies than most people have even heard of and yet this movie has stood near the top of the list of my favorite films since I saw it. Now maybe I'm biased because this movie has more emotion depicted in one scene of swordplay than movies like the Notebook. If you missed it the first time through you were obviously reading a book by its cover because its story is told through expressions and movements of the characters not through the traditional blunt in your face talking which can sometimes neglect the need for visuals in a movie. Half the movies that have come out in the past five years wouldn't be worth a damn except for their dialog. They would be better as books on tape. This movie is all about the visuals and how they blend with an amazing score. Very few directors can pull off emotions through pure visual splendor and music. How this has a barely above a five rating is disgusting. I recommend this movie to anyone. They say the plot is thin but if your just basing that off the dialog you've missed three quarters of the story. Watch the actors body language and how the music builds upon it.".

How the audio engineer pulled this off without it sounding like a train wreck is beyond me. But you can distinctly make out the two clashing pieces of music.The whole movie is much like this phenomenon. First of all it boldly crosses the line between art house and martial arts flick. If you're looking exclusively for either you'll be disappointed. But if you're sharp enough to follow the jumps you'll love this picture.Almost every other reviewer has criticized the plot for being too thin. I think they're missing the point. The classic Japanese film SEVEN SAMURAI can also be said to have a weak plot if you're get right down to it. But the point is not to look for an intricate Alfred Hitchcock weave the point is to enjoy how expertly the visuals can bring a fairy tale to life. And this is a great fairy tale at times leaving you wondering what is a dream and what is real.And then suddenly you're holding your sides because you're laughing so hard at the comic routines. Like I said this film mixes it all. You gotta be quick to keep up.Visually I can't praise this film enough. Vivid colours smooth camera motion graceful movements to the point where a mob scene looks choreographed and gorgeous sets give this movie a fantasy quality that few directors have been able to achieve. And the computer animation if even there was much at all was not noticeable unlike a lot of modern films that use CGI for everything. Instead the director uses very creative lighting and shadows to accentuate the swordplay. At times it looks like a Star Wars light sabre duel but so realistic.Enjoy this film for what it is. Expect nothing drop all preconceived notions and I guarantee you'll have a great time.Oh I also thought I'd mention... no nudity or gratuitous sex no blood splattered across the screen no animal cruelty. Fun for everyone.".

The plot is confusing enough but it really doesn't matter it's just an excuse for some amazing set pieces involving crowds of swordfighters fighters chasing through markets and dye factories barroom brawls and over the top humor. And swordplay as foreplay. Not likely to get a US release but a lot of fun. Modern Korean cinema in my opinion is leading the world in terms of set and scenic design and innovative cinematography.

The former a hotheaded young woman who is just as willing to stick a knife in the gut of an adversary as look at him and the latter a calm pleasant man who tries often in vain to keep his protg's temper in check. One day while working undercover Namsoon notices a skilled swordsman sporting a white wig and a mask amazing onlookers with his impeccable skill. However things soon become chaotic when a struggle between two groups breaks out and a wagon containing a huge amount of money is spilt. In order to keep the peace Namsoon and Ahn pursue a couple of thieves one a bald man with an eye patch and the other the masked man who swiped a gold statue. Namsoon is able to catch up with the masked man and they cross weapons. Although she is able to split his mask the man is able to get away.After this incident trouble begins the spread because the money was counterfeit. The huge amounts of counterfeit money make prices inflate and cause distress throughout the kingdom. Wanting to get to the bottom of the problem Namsoon and Ahn search out the only engraver who just happens to have been released from prison recently after a mysterious person bailed him out who is capable of making molds that could press near perfect coins. The artist sketches a picture for the detectives of the man who bailed him out a young man with shoulder length hair and sad eyes. Namsoon recognizes him as the swordsman she pursued earlier.Namsoon and Ahn soon learn that Sad Eyes works for the minister of defense and Namsoon dolls herself up as a simpering court woman in order to get close to the man. The two battle a couple of times and through the clashing metal and enhanced sensations Namsoon begins to fall in love with the beautiful swordsman.The most common criticism that I have heard and read about The Duelist is that the plot is paperthin. Honestly this is the case. The plot can easily be summed up in one sentence and it is a plot that has been done numerous times before with better execution. However The Duelist is a beautiful film. The costumes are magnificent especially those of Namsoon and Sad Eyes and architecture is extraordinary. The fight scenes especially those between the heroine and her enemybeloved are gorgeous and they give off equal sensations of danger and beauty. Also the soundtrack is quite wonderful with equal parts rock and traditional music. At one point there was a thunderous rock track being played with a soft piano. The trio of bass drums and guitar did not drown out the piano and it gave the supple movements of Sad Eyes Kang Dongwon even more beauty and grace. A decent film just don't go looking for an intricate plot.".

I suppose it's not for everyone although I think it's possible if one watches it one more time. When I first watched it I hated it. It was boring weird and never seemed to end. but then I felt cheated for paying for it I watched it online.. small screen still paid for it.. so I watched it again cuz I could rewatch it within 6 hours or something like that. And now I have the DVD.This movie is very unkind to people who are used to traditional storytelling format in movies. We at least I usually want to hear things out loud. Have things explained to us. I didn't know before but I guess we must depend a lot on the dialogues.At first I hated some parts with its echo effects and how everybody would singsong a line or divide them into neat parts as they would NEVER do in real life. It was hard for me to understand and I'm more of a Korean speaker. Later I watched the DVD with the Korean subtitle on and very annoying. You don't get much of the storyline by listening to what they say. A lot of things happen that can only be seen and much emotion is conveyed through the actionsmovements of the visual items on the screen including the actors and actresses of course instead of being delivered straight forward in narrative 'words' to our ears.On my first viewing I thought the film doesn't show enough convincing evidences or hows or whys of the main characters falling in love. It seemed unreal and to happen so fast that I felt they were getting away by themselves leaving the audience behind.But on the second viewing it touched me much more than at the first time. I could feel how the characters felt and acted how their feelings changed throughout the passage of the movie. Those things no longer unconvincing to me. This time I was with them. I felt what they felt. as opposed to just knowing what I'm supposed to feel And after my second viewing I could say this is a very emotional film. not boring. A lot of people accused the director of being conceited and just showing off how pretty he can make the screen look but not trying to communicate with the audience.But there was also a sector? of mania fans who viewed the film over and over again raved about it protested for a second viewing in the theaters. cuz the movie was out of the theaters quickly for not making much money. I think the reason is 1 the way of story telling was something that most people were familiar with. They were expecting something else. And 2 Maybe it just is a film that needs a bit more concentration or work from the audience. more active participation? Maybe one does need a second viewing to enjoyappreciate it more. but I've heard of people who loved it instantly on the first viewing. Maybe I just didn't concentrate or look for the right things? Well. I own the DVD now. and I don't buy lots of dvds. Actually it was the first DVD I ever purchased. although I still haven't finished viewing all the supplemental features and the second one was this kdrama series. and now I want to buy the movie Bittersweet on DVD. or is it Bittersweet Life? Don't know the exact English title. I just wanna say that for those who really hated it and thought it was boring the first time they watched it give it another chance if you ever get around to it. The chances are you are not gonna regret it and will grow to love it like I did. I think it improves upon repeated viewings. You see things you didn't see before every time you watch it again. the movie has lots of symbolism that's fun to try to figure out. Hm. that was kind of a long review. but really it's quite a lovely film I think. ".

Style Style and more style. The Director Lee MyungEs was there Must be a big deal back in South Korea as he was swarmed with folks after the screening and he explained the story original came from a Comic Book. Wish I had known that going in. It is a period piece with a modern flare. Characters do things not because it makes sense but to strike a pose. The director did not want to tag this as an action film but as a 'Melodrama'. Full of color especially in the early market scenes I am sure the fans of comic at happy as hell. Does that make it a good movie? Not really. Lee MyungEs said the film just opened in Korea with the critics loving it and the audience 5050 on it. The film took ninety three days to shoot and I am sure most of that time was spent getting the color scheme right. It's looks wonderful and he uses Dark shadows to make some beautiful images. All this just doesn't work for me. The attempts at comedy are so over the top and goofy it is hard to take the characters seriously. The Namsoon character is just so goofy during the first half of the film I never really bought the romance between her and the Sad Eyes character. There are many action scenes oh sorry dance scenes but they never had any real sense of danger for me. If you do not care who is fighting or why they are fighting then it comes across as really cold to me. Some will like it others like me will not. Can not see this playing at all with a North American Audience so the chances you will see this on the big screen are slim. A better reviewer than I has said on the internet I think that director Lee's films are poetry not prose. Guess this fearless reviewer is not really a poetry kind of guy.".

	schema:headline " Come On Now People. Cinematography Is Only ONE Aspect of Filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "While perusing IMDb comments lately I've noticed a rather interesting perspective that glorifies cinematography as if it's the only meaningful aspect of filmmaking. I always thought that things like directing acting scriptwriting action choreography and postproduction only to name a few are all important parts of making an entertaining film. Realistically almost every film is lacking in some of these elements but the good movies make up for it by excelling in others. Unfortunately lots of people apparently think that cinematography alone can carry a film. I disagree and Duelist provides a case in point.This movie is essentially an actioncomedy which to me automatically signals an emphasis on action choreography and humor. The most entertaining films of this genre take the fight scenes to exceptional levels while sprinkling in some good laughs along the way  e.g. The Legend of Drunken Master 1994. Duelist on the other hand provides subpar humor and downright atrocious sword duels. I actually liked the lead actress and actor in other Korean films I've seen but they were not utilized well at all here. Quite frankly this film is a disaster. If I had known it was directed by Myungse Lee Nowhere to Hide I probably would have never watched it to begin with. Shame on me for not doing my homework.For the record there is a lot of action here but it is utterly destroyed by inept directing because the camerawork used during the sword duels sucks to high heaven. It's almost as if the director's sole purpose was to sabotage his own movie. Here are a few examples 1. The opening scene was nonsensical schizophrenic and overly sloppy in its execution. A wagon full of money crashes and sprays on a road. The officials try to stop people from stealing it. The scene is nothing more than amateurs scuffling and falling over each other. Not good. There is a very brief duel at the end but it only entails one or two sword swings.2. One particular night duel had this viewer's blood boiling as the only discernible action was a series of special effects sparks on a pitch black screen. Two of the lead characters are in a dark alleyway but instead of having them fight where we can see them the director cuts to total blackness and adds some sparks. This kind of copout really grates on my nerves because the director knows that he can take the easy way out and not even bother to map out carefully choreographed sword motions or character movements. This sequence in and of itself solidifies Myungse Lee as one of the laziest directors in the industry today. Hey jackass do us all a favor and don't even bother shooting an action scene if you're too lazy to do it right.3. Another brief duel takes place in a courtyard and would have been pretty good had the director not placed the camera directly behind an obstruction thereby showing only portions of the characters as they fought. Seriously he could have placed the camera just about ANYWHERE else and it would have been acceptable. Instead he tracks behind a thick fence. What an idiot.4. Yet another scene has a character in a room with dozens of baddies but every time he swings his weapon the director moves the camera behind a pillar to obscure the action. The scene itself lasts a matter of seconds and ends prematurely with a freeze frame of the protagonist screaming. At this point I wanted to break something.The aforementioned points convincingly argue against other IMDb comments that assert that the action scenes are entertaining. On the contrary they are not the slightest bit entertaining for viewers who actually want to SEE the characters fight in wellchoreographed sword duels. I'm perplexed that so many reviewers enjoy having so many events occur offscreen. You people need to raise your standards a bit.Someone should seriously tell Myungse Lee that the Andrew LauWong Kar Wai Wuxia method of slideshow photography is the single worst way to film a fight scene primarily because the viewer cannot see what the hell is going on ala Storm Riders and Ashes of Time. Someone should also tell him to stop aiming the camera at walls and start aiming the camera at the actors. After suffering through Lee's Nowhere to Hide and this feat of idiocy I pray to God this imbecile never makes another action film. And if he does I pray that I'm not stupid enough to watch it.Which brings me to the cinematography. Lots of reviewers here have claimed that the cinematography of Duelist carries the film. I see this reasoning often and quite frequently the most overrated movies are those with good cinematography because the people who love them conveniently forget that everything else sucks badly  e.g. Akira Kurosawa's Dreams. Hey I love great cinematography too but the movie has to have SOMETHING else lest it be a very pretty but hollow shell. For example Kiyoshi Kurosawa's films have excellent atmosphere but without innovative philosophical concepts they would be practically worthless like this film.Everyone mocks me because I consider The Twins Effect 2003 to be one of the most entertaining in this genre yet I'm vindicated every time a crappy actioncomedy like Duelist comes out. Go figure.".

	schema:headline " Great dramatic acting within stunning visual jewel box";
	schema:reviewBody "I am not sure what some of the critics and spoilers of the COTGF story were expecting... I agree with the comparisons of Shakespearan tragedies and royal family intrigues and the reference to dysfunctional families and meltdowns. Actually I was thinking a lot about the Lion in Winter transported in a Chinese setting. In the English drama the King simply has the Queen imprisoned for her political rebellion. In this movie the Emperor decides to slowly poison the Empress because of her affair with his oldest son. Both lead characters have their reasons for sticking to their planned course of action. Also I was reminded about the Borgias and some of the other Italian French and Greek royal dramas when emotions get totally out of hand. Why do some viewers say that emotions are over the top or that the females are too scantily clad? This movie shows that Chinese characters can have very powerful human emotions sexual attractionlust filial love greed ambition... just like any other people in the world.And yes the Chinese Imperial Palace is displayed on an extravagantly grand scale just because it is possible to do it only in China! China has more people than any other country and can afford the larger than life scenes in opulent settings.The Emperor is at first shown as a kind father who wants to maintain a harmonious balance of family and state. Ultimately we find out that he is a hypocritical megalomaniac who obliterated his first wife's family in his bid to become Emperor and will not allow anyone to cross his will in his kingdom. Interestingly even for a blood thirsty dictator he has his soft spot and that is his love for his first born son who means well but appears rather weak of morals.The acting is very powerful the epitome of Chinese acting is in the facial expressions within a restrained and mechanical setting see Chinese opera and both Gong Li and Cho Yung Fat do a great job in their roles. Watch the eyes and the hands... The occasional outbursts of real emotion when the character is pushed beyond its limits see the Empress when she occasionally cannot help herself and tries to seduce the Crown Prince as a woman see the Emperor when he toys with the Empress and shows her his kindness in prescribing herbal potions and her defiant reply makes him toss his arm in frustration the final eruption of the despot when the youngest prince dares to rear up with hate...I wonder if any dysfunctional family that lives with a totally controlling father and experiences his insane fits of punishment can relate with the control and violence shown at the end. He tolerates the Empress because she is a princess and very decorative and the mother of his 2 younger sons and he even tolerated silently her affair for a while but he will not tolerate her efforts to usurp him publicly. I can predict that the Empress will die a slow and humiliating death unless she finds a way to kill herself first.What I picked up very clearly is the subtle form of psychological cruelty that underlies the Chinese concept of revenge. Many longstanding cultures understand this form of torture very well which goes above and beyond killing a person. Think about the movie Jean De La Florette where the protagonist is slowly killed by the grinding labor of finding nonexisting water. It is the slowly grinding down of a person's will through dayin and dayout abuse. See the daily poisoning of the Empress under the guise of caring for her health. See the impossible ending offer to the rebellious prince to choose between killing his own mother with regular offering of the herbal potion versus death under his father's hand  the prince decides to end his life to get out of this insane set of situation. He actually succeeds in comparison to the eldest prince who tries suicide the previous evening and fails to slice his own throat.Yes the Emperor is ultimately an evil man because he sacrifices all that he loves for his political ambition to be the boss but he has his human dimensions he is attracted as a man to the 2 women he loves most in his life as seen in their rare intimate moments together and he loves the first son unconditionally... Personally I think that the characters are very well developed because they are complex obsessed and quite multidimensional in their basic human drives. They make sense within the constraints in which they are cast.".

But the Chinese film makers did not know how to tell a story in the Hollywood way. Especially the film makers wanted to make BIG movie the movie making cost high to gain the high profit in the market but in the same time they seemed like they forget how to tell a good story. But Chinese audience is very tolerable they watch they comment and they despise. After all these years' BIG films' bombing I watched a good story telling film why should I not be satisfied?Disscusing this film in the technique way is not the important thing. All this years the BIG films all packed by the advanced techniques but inside is a garbage.sorry for the rude word I can not say a better word for my poor EnglishSomebody maybe a lot of foreign people may want to watch more KongFu in Chinese films. But what I want to say is KongFu is not the only part of Chinese Culture in fact it never was the major part of Chinese Culture in the past three thousand years. I can say it because I know our country and her history. The relationship and interaction of characters is the major part of film . This film is based on a novel Thunder Storm by Chao Yu in 40s of 20th century and the background is changed to about 9th century.For the solid story by Chao Yu the film is brilliant. And the success of this film is also a victory of Chinese writers. It proved that the real good novel can live all the time.Thank you for read this.".

This is after all a movie. Moviegoers are used to seeing the full spectrum of a movie varied scenery and ambiance multiple stories realistic characters a realistic society portrait and so on. Certainly this movie has strong characters but like the imperial court setting they are puppets. They never change their directions they are forced to play the drama. Most of the action happens on the same 34 scenes with the same characters. Like an opera stereotypic but intensely dramatic and glorious.That said this movie had an effect on me and as mentioned it is very well crafted. Without a doubt it shows Yimou Zhang's skills in his profession and I do recommend it. But don't expect a movie in the classical sense expect Greek tragedy or operastyle drama.".

Meanwhile Prince Jai the faithful son grows worried over the Empress's health and her obsession with golden chrysanthemums. The Emperor harbors equally clandestine plans the Imperial Doctor Ni Dahong is the only one privy to his machinations.

	schema:reviewBody "Zhang Yimou was a very highly regarded filmmaker 5 years ago before I had ever heard of him. Then he earned a place in my heart by directing both Hero and House of Flying Daggers. With those last two I felt like I was in martial arts movie heaven so I would instantly be interested in any other future films that could approach those two in scope talent and action. Curse of the Golden Flower focuses mostly on the first two of those three traits but besides anything starring Chow YunFat will earn my attention like a bullet to the head. I do own The Corrupter after all.This is a film about a royal family rather dysfunctional at that in the 928 AD Tang Dynasty. Chow YunFat is Emperor Ping who from the way he handles his family and can anticipate any kind of attack or counterattack seems like quite the ruthless warlord. He has three sons one is a teenager who isn't given much regard but knows more than others think. The eldest of the three is the current crown prince but doesn't seem to have any special talents other than drawing the affections of the wrong women. The middle son is a great warrior and of course is now the favorite of the father. But these characters may be just pawns to Empress Phoenix Gong Li who is mother to the younger two brothers and stepmother to the eldest. Under normal circumstances she might be a great mother wife and Empress but current circumstances including a mystery illness have forced her to take actions involving a secret plot to remove her husband from the throne.This is not the action movie some might expect though there is enough near the end to earn the R rating. It's basically a family drama though in a rather fascinating and different setting for such a story. As you'd expect with a royal family appearances are everything. Anything out of the ordinary has to happen in secret. All the normal everyday stuff is almost mechanical in nature. Whether you see dozens of servants getting up in the morning or preparing food or planting flowers it all occurs in such a fiercely coordinated fashion. It would have been such a hard life either being a royal or supporting one but it would be a miserable life if one couldn't take any pride in what they did.The filmmakers who designed and implemented all the sets and costumes should take a hell of a lot of pride in what they do. The family of this story even while destroying themselves and therefore their empire from within are living in the most lavish accommodations and outfits I've ever seen. I usually don't think much of costuming or set design but I must say that after seeing Chow YunFat's golden suit of armor or anything Gong Li was in or the design of their personal quarters I really hope for some Oscar recognition. Perhaps the best I've ever seen in those areas.Overall though a good film and a definite must for any Chow YunFat fan to seem him play such a great villain as with Sammo Hung in Sha Po Lang. It kept me interested throughout but nothing too surprising happened in regards to story. It basically all went how I imagined it would.".

	schema:reviewBody "So many superlatives can be applied to CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER that it's difficult to assess the movie without sounding totally biased and over the top. Few films have achieved the level of sheer visual beauty as this one with its interior shots of Chinese palace walls and columns illuminated by glowing hues of gold emerald and ruby. Few also have managed to weave the threads of so many tangled tortured relationships into such a spellbinding masterpiece of tragedy.The seductive visual beauty of this film's set and costumes makes a powerful contrast to the deadly schemes and betrayals that motivate the leading characters members of the Tang Dynasty 618907 BC. Just as the viewer finds him or herself starting to feel sorry for one characterfor example the Empress who is being tortured by her husband or the Emperor who has been scandalously betrayed by his wifeit turns out that nobody is 100 percent innocent not even the youngest of the royal family's three sons. If there's one great exception to the royal family's collective guilt it would be the second son Prince Jai played with nobility and charisma by Chinese pop star Jay Chou. Having proved himself on the battlefield as a worthy contender for the throne Prince Jai returns home only to find himself agonizingly torn between loyalty to his mother and father. The sacrifice he makes in the end turns out to be the most brutal tragedy of all.Yun Fat Chow as the Emperor and Gong Li in the role of the Empress give incredible performances as a couple whose love has long died but who remain together for the sake of political convenience. Behind their beautiful clothes lavish furnishings and perfectly choreographed movements the two calmly seek each others' destruction. Yun Fat Chow's and Li's performance are on par with that of the world's best Shakespearean actors and the story of CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER itself can be compared to a combination of King Lear and Oedipus Rex. One begins to truly appreciate the challenges directors face when considering the titanic logistics director Zhang Yimou had to deal with in order to make this film. Imagine the precision of detail and control it took to go as he does with the movie from one scene of dozens of beautiful feudalera women waking and preparing to work in the palace to another later on of a thousand warriors in gold armor charging against another thousand warriors in metallic black. With its brilliant storyline glorious production and extraordinary performances CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER stands as a major triumph of modern filmmaking.by Aberjhani author of The Bridge of Silver Wings".

	schema:headline " Cursed but Delightful";
	schema:reviewBody "Curse of the Golden Flower is probably the most lavish costume drama in history equaling or outdoing director Zhang Yimou's other spectaculars such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers. It's a sea of gold red blue silver with Yee Chung Man's improbably luxurious costumes. Armies clash warriors fly the imperial family selfdestructs and the Shakespearean plotting feuding and killing never stops. Also in a likely surprise to cultural historians Curse establishes 10th century China as the time and place for the perfection of the pushup bra. Although heaving bosoms are present throughout the movie the opening scene is unequalled in its discreet Playboy fantasy of legions of young women getting ready for the arrival of the Emperor. It's spectacular and outlandishfunny at the same time prompting simultaneous leering and laughing. The flamboyant Later Tang Dynasty 923936 AD is the subject of Zhang's film the royal family giving dysfunctional a bad name. The Emperor Chow Yun Fat is a majestic but thoroughly evil man who oversees the systematic poisoning of the Empress Gong Li back with Zhang the director who made her a star years ago before the two parted ways. The Empress who eventually engineers the meltdown of the entire court carries on an affair with her stepson the Crown Prince Liu Ye who in turn sleeps with the beauteous Chan Li Man both blissfully  but not for long  unaware that they are closely related. Prince Jai Jay Chou in a great performance is the middle son aspiring to become the Crown Prince and then the Emperor not necessarily in that order Prince Yu Qin Junjie is the youngest son not well positioned for the succession but keep your eyes on him  he may just have a surprise coming. This is just a fraction of the what's going on in the Imperial Palace but Zhang's genius as a director is proved once again. He is telling this complex even convoluted story in such straightforward manner that it can be followed easily. Zhang who is in New York right now directing a Tan Dun world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera having done Puccini's Turandot in Beijing is the most operatic of film directors with an epic sweep flamboyance gripping drama. Speaking of the ZhangTan Dun partnership which gave Hero a magnificent soundtrack it's a shame that the composer for Curse is Shigeru Umebayashi whose music is smaltzy and unoriginal. Zhang quotes an old Chinese saying Gold and jade on the outside rot and decay on the inside and Curse has it all although the goldandjade surface is so ostentatiously brilliant that all that portentous stuff within lacks depth and believability. At some of the most dramatic moments there is laughter in the audience the fun is too much to bother with what's supposed to be hot and heavy the intended drama turns into melodrama. But again the fun is great and nonstop bosoms may well heave merrily in the seats as well as they do dramatically on the screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Curse of the Golden Flower is probably the most lavish costume drama in history equaling or outdoing director Zhang Yimou's other spectaculars such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers. It's a sea of gold red blue silver with Yee Chung Man's improbably luxurious costumes. Armies clash warriors fly the imperial family selfdestructs and the Shakespearean plotting feuding and killing never stops. Also in a likely surprise to cultural historians Curse establishes 10th century China as the time and place for the perfection of the pushup bra. Although heaving bosoms are present throughout the movie the opening scene is unequalled in its discreet Playboy fantasy of legions of young women getting ready for the arrival of the Emperor. It's spectacular and outlandishfunny at the same time prompting simultaneous leering and laughing. The flamboyant Later Tang Dynasty 923936 AD is the subject of Zhang's film the royal family giving dysfunctional a bad name. The Emperor Chow Yun Fat is a majestic but thoroughly evil man who oversees the systematic poisoning of the Empress Gong Li back with Zhang the director who made her a star years ago before the two parted ways. The Empress who eventually engineers the meltdown of the entire court carries on an affair with her stepson the Crown Prince Liu Ye who in turn sleeps with the beauteous Chan Li Man both blissfully  but not for long  unaware that they are closely related. Prince Jai Jay Chou in a great performance is the middle son aspiring to become the Crown Prince and then the Emperor not necessarily in that order Prince Yu Qin Junjie is the youngest son not well positioned for the succession but keep your eyes on him  he may just have a surprise coming. This is just a fraction of the what's going on in the Imperial Palace but Zhang's genius as a director is proved once again. He is telling this complex even convoluted story in such straightforward manner that it can be followed easily. Zhang who is in New York right now directing a Tan Dun world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera having done Puccini's Turandot in Beijing is the most operatic of film directors with an epic sweep flamboyance gripping drama. Speaking of the ZhangTan Dun partnership which gave Hero a magnificent soundtrack it's a shame that the composer for Curse is Shigeru Umebayashi whose music is smaltzy and unoriginal. Zhang quotes an old Chinese saying Gold and jade on the outside rot and decay on the inside and Curse has it all although the goldandjade surface is so ostentatiously brilliant that all that portentous stuff within lacks depth and believability. At some of the most dramatic moments there is laughter in the audience the fun is too much to bother with what's supposed to be hot and heavy the intended drama turns into melodrama. But again the fun is great and nonstop bosoms may well heave merrily in the seats as well as they do dramatically on the screen.";

If you're looking for anything deeper then it's not for you although the movie is loosely based on a masterpiece of play in China. That being said I think it's actually a nice movie.Story B The story line is nothing amazing but flows well although not devoid of a few confusions or loopholes. For the people who're not familiar with all the power struggle backstabbing stories of Chinese royal families some relationships and emotions may seem a bit too much. And it did actually get a bit overheated at certain point possibly for theatrical tensions. But overall it made sense to me. My major complaint is that he could have cut out some of the side stories while allowing the major line to a fuller development.Acting B This movie focuses on Gong Li and she's a good actress. So yes she did a great job even though I wish it could have been toned down a bit. Chow Yunfat is also good but his role is not as rich as hers. Liu Ye crown prince is adequate for his role and the character also has a limited range. Jay Zhou the second sonis not quite up to par with the others after all he's not a professional actor. But he got better in the end.Visuals A Actually I wanted to give it a B but I awarded it a higher mark for being so daring. It does have tons of colors and shades in it. Most of time they actually work out cool at least for me. But I totally understand if someone finds it way overthetop. I actually like the fact that ZYM used bright colors only if he had used fewer kinds of them. Those fighting scenes didn't quite catch my attention not because they're no good. Actually they're proper and effective. But since I've seem so many martial arts movies they did not bring any surprises to meOverall it's an entertaining movie with an understandable story and believable characters.".

Rather it is a historical grand opera epic. In addition to great sight and sound Curse of the Golden Flower boasts great performances by Chow Yun Fat Gong Li and Liu Ye. Even Jay Chou is surprisingly good. The movie works in so many levels and has a frantic pace that is unlike anything out there at this time. It is somewhat melodramatic but also grandly tragic. This is what grand opera is all about. This is cinema at its best. This film will not break any box office record in the US anyway. This film will not win many critics awards or Oscars.

I don't know what Zhang Yimou is doing but his movies have been on a steady decline since the great Hero. This movie like House of Flying Daggers is BEAUTIFULLY made but lacks substance.Let's talk about the cinematography first. The colors details patterns and the views of the palace were so expertly filmed that I was in awe the first 30 minutes of the movie. Zhang continues his perfect track record in making spectacular visual epics in this movie. The acting was also very good anchored by experienced great actors like Chou YunFat and Gong Li. Even with my average score if you are the type of movie goer that appreciates great visual feats in movies I would recommend you check this movie out.Now for the disappointing bits. There wasn't too much plot involved other than your standard doublecrossingspyvsspy story. It reached the point of absurdity when new characters were introduced an hour into the movie to add a new plot twist in the already complicated web of intrigue. The entire process felt very heavy handed and damaged the impact of the tragedies in the movie. The battle scenes were very fake you can easily tell it was CGI and the ending was horrendous. It just left the entire audience hanging and did not tie up the most important plot line of the movie. It really left a bad taste in my mouth after watching the movie.Anyway I hope Zhang's next movie focuses more on the plot like Hero and less on the spectacles. Otherwise his good name as a director will probably go down the drain.".

Also excellent is the always charismatic Chow YunFat as the Emperor a cruel tyrant who is genuinely fond of his sons. Jay Chou and Ye Liu are fine as the two princes faced with moral dilemmas. Hero is one of the bestlooking movies ever made but I found it morally reprehensible.

	schema:headline " Zhang Yimou's zillionyuan test for the Beijing Olympics";
	schema:reviewBody "Curse of the Golden Flower can be best described as an apotheosis of overwrought kitsch hypersaturated colors and military choreography. Everything in it is big lavish excessive but staged in a clockwork style every shot spells money and extravaganza but under stiff control. If you  like me  once marveled at Zhang Yimou's refined artistry in masterpieces like Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern you'll be baffled by Curse it's hardly to believe they were directed by the same man. After Hero and Flying Daggers Zhang completes with Curse his exhibitionist rococo trilogy where the message i.e. the connections between power and corruption gets crushed under formalist grandeur militarist fascination and commercial targets.The colors in Curse belong to a sort of Phosphorescent Lollipopland with blazing goldens sanguine scarlets shocking purples and pinks it feels like a colorblind exam. The lighting is so overdone it's flat the sets so overwrought and overcrowded that Hollywood Bible epics of the 1950s look minimalistic by comparison. The costumes though masterfully executed are so flamboyantly flashy they upstage the actors. Oh and as many reviewers pointed out there are those anachronistic ? popping boobs...very distractingThe CGI work is underachieved the music is monotonous and incongruously Westernish. The action scenes are lukewarm at best Zhang is a flat unexciting fight director  he doesn't know how to edit them. The plot is even more convoluted than the sets while the dialog alternates between risible clichs and hermetic symbolisms. The cast is told to overact Chow Yun Fat sulks groans squints his BLUE ! contact lensedeyes and combs his goatee with a cool gadgetring. Gong Li suffers trembles cries suffers trembles cries drinks endless cups of poisoned tea and feels sick all the time is it the stifling wonderbra or the smell of the script?. Song popstar Jay Chou has an interesting face but is betrayed by the director who lingers on his clueless reaction shots revealing Chou's lack of proper acting training. The closing credits song which Chou produced wrote and sang just proves that bad pop songs exist everywhere. What IS remarkable about Curse is the flabbergasting amount of money spent to tell what is after all a huis clos story all that matters in the plot takes place indoors  the CGI the battles the armies the ninjas the fights are pretty much there to satisfy action junkies justify the stratospheric budget and crush the audience with a paraphernalia of excesses.Also remarkable of course is Zhang's taste for unimaginative clockwork crowd choreography thousands of real and virtual extras flow by in rigid geometric patterns with a maniac precision that can only be described as militaryinspired. No wonder Zhang has been appointed to stage the opening ceremony at the next Beijing's Olympics Curse serves as his zillionyuan test for the job. All of this made me think of how Zhang's substantial groundbreaking past work has turned into vacuous formalism and establishmentfriendly status. And I recalled his notorious megalomania and authoritarianism check the documentary The Turandot Project by Alan Miller and his quote saying My films are an excellent channel for promoting China's culture.Curse is a gigantic souffl an exhausting mammoth extravaganza made by a selfobsessed controlfreak artist who  though he states in interviews his aversion to politics  seems to feed on cherish and serve the very status quo he thinks he transcends.".

Everything in it is big lavish excessive but staged in a clockwork style every shot spells money and extravaganza but under stiff control. If you  like me  once marveled at Zhang Yimou's refined artistry in masterpieces like Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern you'll be baffled by Curse it's hardly to believe they were directed by the same man. After Hero and Flying Daggers Zhang completes with Curse his exhibitionist rococo trilogy where the message i.e. the connections between power and corruption gets crushed under formalist grandeur militarist fascination and commercial targets.The colors in Curse belong to a sort of Phosphorescent Lollipopland with blazing goldens sanguine scarlets shocking purples and pinks it feels like a colorblind exam. The lighting is so overdone it's flat the sets so overwrought and overcrowded that Hollywood Bible epics of the 1950s look minimalistic by comparison. The costumes though masterfully executed are so flamboyantly flashy they upstage the actors. Oh and as many reviewers pointed out there are those anachronistic ? popping boobs...very distractingThe CGI work is underachieved the music is monotonous and incongruously Westernish. The action scenes are lukewarm at best Zhang is a flat unexciting fight director  he doesn't know how to edit them. The plot is even more convoluted than the sets while the dialog alternates between risible clichs and hermetic symbolisms. The cast is told to overact Chow Yun Fat sulks groans squints his BLUE ! contact lensedeyes and combs his goatee with a cool gadgetring. Gong Li suffers trembles cries suffers trembles cries drinks endless cups of poisoned tea and feels sick all the time is it the stifling wonderbra or the smell of the script?. Song popstar Jay Chou has an interesting face but is betrayed by the director who lingers on his clueless reaction shots revealing Chou's lack of proper acting training. The closing credits song which Chou produced wrote and sang just proves that bad pop songs exist everywhere. What IS remarkable about Curse is the flabbergasting amount of money spent to tell what is after all a huis clos story all that matters in the plot takes place indoors  the CGI the battles the armies the ninjas the fights are pretty much there to satisfy action junkies justify the stratospheric budget and crush the audience with a paraphernalia of excesses.Also remarkable of course is Zhang's taste for unimaginative clockwork crowd choreography thousands of real and virtual extras flow by in rigid geometric patterns with a maniac precision that can only be described as militaryinspired. No wonder Zhang has been appointed to stage the opening ceremony at the next Beijing's Olympics Curse serves as his zillionyuan test for the job. All of this made me think of how Zhang's substantial groundbreaking past work has turned into vacuous formalism and establishmentfriendly status. And I recalled his notorious megalomania and authoritarianism check the documentary The Turandot Project by Alan Miller and his quote saying My films are an excellent channel for promoting China's culture.Curse is a gigantic souffl an exhausting mammoth extravaganza made by a selfobsessed controlfreak artist who  though he states in interviews his aversion to politics  seems to feed on cherish and serve the very status quo he thinks he transcends.";

The term family feud is really an understatement as this family is totally screwed up. Rather than go into detail and give away any potential spoilers let's just say that the emperor Chow YunFat and empress Gong Li don't get along to put it mildly. What follows is a series of affairs incestuous relationships murder intrigue double crossings triple crossing and quadruple crossings. Sounds good? Not on your life. Things don't develop naturally because Yimou robbed us of real characters. As such these shocking revelations come at us like a series of knuckle balls bashing us in the face not because they're truly shocking or even all that surprising but because they're hammed up in grand soapoperatic fashion. It's sure to elicit more than a few chuckles and boisterous fits of laughter as characters tremble cry scream and then tremble some more as these Perry Masonesquire revelations come to light.Gong Li a talented actress in every sense of the word is reduced to playing second fiddle to her impressive cleavage. She's given little room to breathe and no room to act or develop her character beyond that of another tragic victim. Chow YunFat also making his longawaited return to Chinese cinema is sorely misused as he spends most of the film sitting down looking menacing that is until he whips off his belt to deliver some unintentionally funny discipline. The visuals impressive indeed ultimately prove too garish and distracting in a film that features the most overthetop performances in years.Cao Yu's original work was notable in part because of the well drawn characters and heartbreaking interactions but Yimou again seems more concerned with that elusive Oscar rather than actually telling a compelling story with engaging characters. Strangely enough the fundamental theme behind the film that what is golden on the outside is rotten within seems to also describe not only this waste of celluloid but other lame attempts by Feng Xiaogang The Banquet and Chen Kaige The Promise to duplicate the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which I don't even think is a very good film. All of these hack directors need to STOP making films because they have clearly forgotten how.".

Gong Li delivered an amazing performance as always as well as Chow YunFat Liu Ye and Li Man.Action. Like I have stated earlier there isn't much action in this film and with the very little action that exists it wasn't really all that impressive.Overall I give this movie a 910.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie with a slightly heavy heart. I have been a huge fan of Zhang Yimou since seeing Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern some years ago. But while i really enjoyed 'Flying Daggers' as pure entertainment i thought 'Hero' was little more than a beautiful propaganda piece for the government of China. Based on reading some reviews of 'Curse' i was beginning to think that he was the new Leni Riefenstahl.But how wrong I was  I'm very surprised that all the critics who lined up to explain to western audiences the antigovernment metaphors of his earlier movies have reviewed this as a pure soap opera a glorified 'Dynasty'. But they seem to forget that the exact same could be said of his earlier masterpieces such as Red Lantern. Those movies too were sometimes stagy and fully of internal dramatic inconsistencies that didn't stand up to too much analysis. But this movie is every much a devastating critique of centralized power as any of his earlier movies. Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with Chinese history and politics knows that the current government of China is very much a continuum of earlier dynasties with Party Officials performing the same roles as the old Confucian bureaucrats. This movie is a straightforward satire of such centralized power with clear modern parallels. The clearing up of the aftermath of the 'coup' and the similarities with what happened after Tiananmen Square in 1989 is all too obvious.Anyway having gotten that off my chest suffice to say this is a gloriously over the top epic with staggering settings and set pieces and of course it has Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li in the same movie which should be enough pure pleasure for anyone.I had my strong doubts up to this but I think in years to come critics will see this as one of a series of truly masterful movies from Zhang Yimou that will collectively consist of a coherent and brilliant artistic and political statement not to mention pure kick ass cinematic pleasure.".

The suits and helmets made for Jay Chou who plays the prince are goldplated. Chrysanthemum patterns and ornaments can be seen throughout the film in the furnishings and costumes  this golden flower is a symbol of rebellion in the film.The film is roughly adapted from Thunderstorm  the best drama of China writer Cao Yu but the story is set in a period after Tang Dynasty  about 1000 years ago. Gong LiEmpress and Chou YunfatEmperor provided their excellent performance in the film and also I love Jay Chou the Prince Jie in this film.Comparing with other Zhang Yimou's films such as Hero House of Flying Daggers we can see the breakthrough from this film the picture and the photography are still perfect but this time the film tells us an excellent story of course part of contributions are from drama Thunderstorm. And the other reason for me to vote 10 point to this film is the performance from the cast  Chou Yunfat Gong Li Jay Chou  Liu Ye  this group is nearly the strongest player team in China.I loved that it surprised me in how it ended an ending that moved me to tears when Jay Chou began to sing the theme song Golden Flowerbed .

The setup is an extraordinary web of relationships between two families. Some commentors think this is drawn from soap opera but I think they have a common ancestor instead. This is Greek and though on daytime TeeVee you will get similar relationship complexities they will have their tethers to the cosmos broken. They will be single souls adrift in the world. These are souls that command the world apparently. It could have worked. Why it didn't I think is because the filmmaker decided to root himself in the magisterial. It probably was influenced by the fact that he is a former lover of the female star and there are some reflections between that situation and what we see.

	schema:reviewBody "Tarantino could probably provide more contemporary celluloid examples but the closest I can come to the plot of this elaborate epic of vicious royal conflict outside the world of Greek tragedy is the Jacobean revenge plays. And it's got the poisoning that was all the rage in those days as well as incest. Nothing too complicated really. An emperor Chow Yunfat of the later Tang Dynasty tenth century A.D. is slowly killing his current consort Gong Li through a royal doctor whose wife Jiang Shi Chen Jin unbeknownst to him is an old mistress of his and the mother of one of three possible heirs to the throne Crown Prince Wan Liu Ye who is unwittingly having an affair with his stepsister the doctor's daughter Chan Li Man and has knowingly been the lover of his stepmother the empress. You could say things are rather inbred in the Forbidden City. The empress who suspects the hourly herbal teas to treat an illness are slowly killing her and turning her into a cretin is preparing a surprise to coincide with the oncoming Chong Yang Festival celebrating golden chrysanthemums. As the overwrought action draws to a climax one of the sons lays siege to the palace with a large army garbed in gold and embroidered chrysanthemum images and a third son reveals another surprise he doesn't like anybody and wants to become emperor now. Fields of flowers are drenched in blood before it's all over and digital armies have clashed by night with hordes of red or blackgarbed ninjas flying down from on high to capture individual royal rebels.This grandiose affair is not without notable performances and wonderful looking people chief among them Gong Li whose outsize emotions are worthy of a Greek tragedy  except that Medea didn't have sixinchlong elaborately painted fingernails. Gong's face is mesmerizing to look at. Prince Jai Jay Chou looks fabulous and sexy in a war helmet. John Woo favorite gangstercop hero of the Eighties Chow Yunfat manages to be both appealing and scary as the emperor and Li Man as the taboo girlfriend is just the prettiest thing you've ever seen. Why doesn't it work better? I think back to the pleasure provided by House of Flying Daggers and I believe the difference lies in the claustrophobic nature of this story most of which takes place inside a garish recreation of the palace that looks like a very very expensive jukebox. There's just too much material here crammed into too confined a space with ornamental violence that seems too unrelated to the central core of royal machinations. I suppose these oldergeneration Chinese epics are the equivalent of popular folk art  except they don't come from the people but from an increasingly internationalfocused film industry whose creations are neither culturally authentic nor emotionally convincing.This is also a very nasty story. It's demoralizing to find a royal family whose members are all out to get each other. But if we got to look in on that in emotionally valid terms  if some time was taken to develop the feelings and conflicts instead of constantly interrupting them with kungfu action or vast scenes of concubines all with identical cleavages or ninjas spinning around with curved weapons in the air  the nastiness might develop some conviction. As it is this is a spectacle that seems both ugly and hollow at the core. Anyone who is seriously pleased by this may not be paying much attention to what they're seeing. Sure as a spectacle it's frequently eyepopping. But its pretense at content is superficial.".

With this movie I found myself completely immersed after the first few minutes. Although the theme of love jealousy and politics are commonplace except the subtle homosexuality which I don't believe plays too much role in this movie director JunIk Lee magnificently put together the beautiful Joseon dynasty Korea euphonious dialogs and some great acting. I particularly liked that of the King Jinyeong Jeong and Jangsang Wooseong Kam.It made sense why the movie was so popular and why many people have seen it more than once. It is a multifaceted masterpiece which can appeal to multifarious crowds it is a love story a political drama a comedy a tragedy a musical a historical gallery and maybe more.I believe the dialogs are straightforward enough to be translated well into English but nonKorean audiences may lose some great rhymes and subtlety  especially those of the clowns as their dialogs are downright colloquial and hilarious.

Jeong JinYeoung plays the slightly deranged tyrannical King scarred from his mother's early suicide forced upon by his court ministers who later becomes obsessed with one his new entertainers Gonggil Lee Jun Ki. Kam WooSeong who plays Jangseng the leader of the troop managed to win a DaeJong award equivalent to an Oscar for his role while Lee Jun Ki for his brilliant acting that brought tears to his audiences as well as his beauty that surpasses most girls became an instant and extremely popular success.I highly recommend watching this film.

Its well crafted narration fantastic lines beat  timing verisimilitude and breathtaking cinematography breaks all conventions of what is known as Korean Cinema. Unlike many successful Korean films it stays away from patriotism excessive special effects and story lines that are far from the country's true identity. It truly represents the Golden Age of film to the likes of what Kurosawa and Mizoguchi meant for Japanese and world of cinema. Simply it is the most truthful unpretentious exhibition that Korea has made to the world about what the country is truly about.Distant from the present and free from Conglish and other cues of Americanized society it is a story about people of the lowest class of all the street jesters of Chosun Dynasty who are now considered to be living national treasures by the Korean government. These are the people who know the traditional dances music games and embody the spirit of traditional Korean culture before the massive overtake of Americanization. This film is as educational to contemporary Korean generation as to the rest of the world because it is a tradition that is almost completely lost.This film was a huge hit in Korea despite the blatant nature of homosexuality as one of the elements of the story. This is achieved because breaking the taboo is not the focus of the film. The audience is made to focus on the hardship of low class social differences and the psychological world of the characters regardless of their class or sexual orientation. The film treats all characters as just people. All characters' sufferings intermingle as the clowns become a part of the court and the film is especially made rich when the antagonist King who is the embodiment of all the high class' rights and practices is also treated as a round character. Despite his tyranny he is represented as a broken soul who is a product of the brutal politics of the court's high class figures.This film is a definite must see for all art film lovers.".

This sounds a little like Brokeback Mountain taking place in Korea but the speech and behavior the two clowns have towards each other is carefully crafted that they make it look more like a case of brotherhood amongst them. However that does not in any way dilutes the affections we see between the two male friends which are incredibly genuine. It is this genuine affection that makes this such a touching show to watch.

This film has done remarkably well in Korea despite the taboo nature of the film. I though do feel that a lot of Koreans have not really grasped the full intent of this film. Homosexuality has only recently gained some acceptance in South Korean society with its strict Confucian traditions and strong Catholic Church. In April 2004 the government removed homosexuality from a list of socially unacceptable sexual acts. Still today I am there quite often half of my year is spent in North East Asia the elders still see homosexuality as a myth something that is sometimes talked about but definitely does not exist.2. This film's main plot line is about two men who are deeply love each other passionately not fraternally but do not know how to express it outwardly to each other so they stay content on their friendship. The leader of the pack of jesters Jangsang is desperately in love with Gonggil. The troupe heads to Seoul to be the best pack of jesters in Korea. They soon land upon the stage of King Yeonsan who is amused by their performance which portrayed the likeness of the king in a negative manner. The king falls is infatuated with the very effeminate Gonggil by the way in Western eyes Korean men may seem effeminate but that is not the case they are just very comfortable with their sexuality and do not feel it necessary to put on a macho front as Westerners sometimes do. The King and Gonggil engage in what one would consider an affair although it was not a concealed one very public in fact. This of course enrages the queen and she sets out to destroy Gonggil and the troupe. You can see the worry and that remaining spark of love in Jangsang's eyes as he sees the love of his life drifting away. And the eyes have it as one looses his sight then the other comes back to seal their timely death together. End scene with the troupe traveling to a new destinationor was it them traveling to an old destination it is up to your idea.3. I have read a set of omnibus collections at the Seoul National University Library on the history of the Korean Dynasties. King Yeonsan has the shortest entry of any king in the history of these Dynasties. He was a selfless man who did not do for his people but did for for him. The King harbors mixed feelings of love and hatred towards his late father King Seonjong for killing his mother as a result of rivalry among his concubines. He also killed members of his ministry for publicly detesting his lack of ruling for the people.I hope that this write up does not offend either a Korean or a Westerner but this is the way I looked at this film from my Western eyes and felt with my Eastern heart.P.S. This is the first user comment I ever submitted to IMDb.com.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review King and the Clown";
	schema:reviewBody "King and the Clown was South Korea's best selling film of 2005 having sold more than 12 million tickets over a span of 7 weeks. But after watching it it's difficult to fathom the craze nor about the New York Times hype that it may be the equivalent of 'Brokeback Mountain'. Not that it is a bad movie it is actually entertaining and tells an intriguing story in the courts of the Korean emperor.Perhaps anything to do with the gay theme will suffer inevitably comparisons to Lee Ang's acclaimed Brokeback Mountain. But somehow the way this film developed I saw it in a different light  a story between two male best friends even though one of them might look and behave more effeminately than even some girls do. Instead of jumping to the straight conclusion that both the protagonists are gay why can't it be a platonic relationship and that the more effeminate one had chosen what he had to do i.e. sell backside because being poor minstrels they cannot afford to put food on the table? Literally capitalizing on his looks to bring back the dough. Sure his friend might not like the idea and it could be interpreted as either being jealous as a lover or disapproving as a friend. Then again because of culture this movie might have decided to be more subtle about the theme. Ambiguous to say the least but it makes for interesting debate if you watch this with a friend.Two friends Jangseng Kam Woosung and Gonggil Lee Joonki are impoverished street performers who dream of having their entertaining performances reap rewards they should be getting. They come up with a wildly popular and bawdy performance poking fun at the emperor and his consort and it's not long before they get arrested only to have Jangseng proposition a dare that if the King doesn't laugh at their skit they can be put to death.As fate would have it their jittery performance brought on a favourable response from the tyrannical King Jung Jinyoung. Having now become official court jesters their subsequent plays whose content they obtain from coffeeshop talk of those days about the royal family and other court scandals serve as suggestive fuel for the King to break free from his constrictive shackles and take some serious action according to his whims. But dictator attitudes aside he casts a lustful eye at Gonggil and turns almost childlike when in his presence in private. The most powerful man in the kingdom reduced to a vulnerable kid in the presence of a lowly minstrel. What ensues is an interesting look at the relationship dynamics amongst the three men and with the people around them.Set during the Chosun Dynasty King and the Clown has some of the most gorgeous sets bringing to life an era long gone and beautiful costumes that drown the movie in a myriad of colours. The songs are also fairly pleasing to the ears and the skits I believe are likely to be many times more enjoyable if you understand Korean instead of having to rely on subtitles.The movie also makes discreet jibes at those in power and their ability or inability to accept satires about themselves. It is always easy for men in power to dismiss harshly the satires and their creators but it takes a lot more to be able to look past the comic and understand the issues made fun of. There are brief scenes at courtroom politicking and on corruption but these scenes are too short to leave any lasting impression or distract the audience.The cast is a delight to watch as they carry their roles with aplomb. The chemistry between the 3 main leads was almost perfect especially Jung Jinyoung as the temperamental King  childish at times serious at others and the androgynous looking Lee Joonki truly owned the role of Gonggil that even as a guy I thought he was beautiful to look at ahem.All in all King and the Clown is a story of friendship how good friends fend for each other how despite shortcomings and misunderstandings the best medicine is always laughter and it's the strength of the bonds between men that can ultimately stand up against fear and overcome any adversary. If only the opening didn't spoil the entire movie.".

This is why I had such a hard time finding it on this site so the administrators might want to add this other title. It is based on a true story. Also the historical representation should be somewhere around the year 1506 since this is the end of King Yeonsan of the Joseon Dynasty's reign or staging and costumes was absolutely magnificent not to mention some very good acting.".

In my opinion the two strong points of this movie are the historical background and the fictional story over it.This movie takes place during the reign of king Yeonsan 14761506 of the Joseon dynasty. King Yeongsan was not exactly a quiet man and is well known for being despotic and cruel. It is believed that he had serious psychological problems. A part of his life as a Joseon king is well depicted in Wangui namja. This movie gives opportunity to understand a bit the private life of a king during this time especially concerning entertainment.The story starts following two clowns during their every day life. One of them looks like a woman but is actually a man. He will be in the center of major events. Questions about social position sexuality and private life are issued. This make an interesting story although not revolutionary.The relationship between people are quite well shown. There is some funny parts maybe too easy but it's obviously not a story for children. Acting is OK but the movie seems sometimes a bit longer due to long monologue very korean way and some parts could have been skipped.Anyway it's a nice movie to watch and I recommend it for people curious about the korean tradition and culture under the Joseon dynasty.".

The King and the Clown Wangui Namja directed by Lee Junik gets this phrase the pageantry of life. The movie initially released in South Korea in December 2005 is adapted from the 2000 highly acclaimed Korean play entitled Yi You. Whereas the play is about Yeonsangun a Joseon dynasty king who falls in love with a court clown the movie uses the love interest of the King to weave a tale of human activity at its most base level of political and social upheaval.What is indeed so amazing is it manages to intertwine this American's imagination subtitles aside into its allegorical webs even while one sits thousands of miles away from its Korean audiences. Such universal appeal is rivaled only by one's love of music.The movie carries its own clout. Indeed The King and the Clown was the highest grossing over 85 million in US dollars in South Korean history. That is until it was out done by the horror film The Host.Weather the movie was intended to operate as historically accurate film is soon lost on the magnificent delivery of the characters portrayed. The director elicits from his fine cast of actors performances that that further Asian film from the heavy handed fight scenes and bold colors that often connect westerners to Asian film.Among them JangSaeng Karm Woosung and Gonggil Lee Joonki play off each other so well that one begins to wonder if JangSaeng does not secretly lust after his partner himself. It takes fine foreign actors to take the American viewer's mind away from the subtitles and feel comfortably lost in the characters.You'll feel comfortable lost and found in The King and the Clown.".

The director elicits from his fine cast of actors performances that that further Asian film from the heavy handed fight scenes and bold colors that often connect westerners to Asian film.Among them JangSaeng Karm Woosung and Gonggil Lee Joonki play off each other so well that one begins to wonder if JangSaeng does not secretly lust after his partner himself. It takes fine foreign actors to take the American viewer's mind away from the subtitles and feel comfortably lost in the characters.You'll feel comfortable lost and found in The King and the Clown.";

His performance was captivating and who would believe that he is actually a man his face is just so beautiful and feminine to quote another site 'prettier than most normal women' he was just absolutely perfect for this role it was like it was written for him. he is certainly the prettiest man i have ever seen. In Korea he won the best supporting actor for his performance in the King and the Clown and now is the most sort after male actor in Korea.His fellow compatriot Wooseong Kam also put in a stellar performance that bagged him the best male actor award his performance was so that it was hard to differentiate whether this movie was about homosexual love or brotherly love that maybe what makes this movie so great as it allows the viewer to believe what it wants to believe. For example is the king in love with gong gil in a homosexual way or was it a motherly figure way.i don't believe i could recommend this movie highly enough even if this doesn't seem like your type of a film you should watch it for the acting performances alone as it will surely blow you away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the unknown history The King and the clown or the jester seemingly have special relations whether they intend it or not. And it goes without saying the clowns always put themselves in a position on stage where people usually find deep sadness  if not humbleness  and throw their sympathetic applaud. In this movie this milieu doesn't fade away as though I didn't find any similarity and simultaneousness betwixt and between Korean and any Wesern history. So I momentarily wonder if any two historicalcultural facts with different backgrounds can be juxtaposed. Of course it we think from outside of the box we'll ambiguously realize there's only one rules controlling under any culture common sense.Yunsankun is the one of the ferocious dictators throughout the Chosun Dynasty. No wonder his characteristic behaviour sometimes led to the horrific incidents draws broad attention yet he governed the country surprisingly adequate even though his way of making decision seemed rebellious comparing to the social notion at the time. Although the story deals with the chaotic times which we might have gone through the similar one unwittingly it introduces Pan culture throughout the movie. Pan means simply the stage where the clowns and acrobats perform. In the movies along with those three Pan performances I realized how we have become so accustomed not to open up ourselves and let it go as opposed to people arduously enjoyed it.I may have to say the movie doesn't describe the dark history effectively because of too many fictitious characters and artificial scenes however it successfully delivers the coarse conversation beautifully between clowns. It is obscene and full of hatred against the discrimination towards them from the noblemen. The social climate was not ready for these kinds of radical protest and thoughts either. But I believe it was generally amused and accepted only by grass roots. But when it happens on Pan it was ironically accepted to noblemen. It is a dramatic irony after all.One thing I'm not sure is if the movie sets and garments were really reflected based on the fact  especially the scene when two clowns perform about the death of King's mother the garments and ambiance look like they borrow them from Chinese opera. I just hoped it properly reflects more about Korean culture whether it intends or not. I suppose the movie can provide the Pan and we only can be an audience. Still the movie has a great deal of efforts to embrace it though. I personally think the script is almost perfect. Of course for those who can understand the text and Korean innermost feelings streaming amongst them.".

	schema:reviewBody "The King and the Clown is a movie about a pair of street performers who come to the attention of King Yeonsan of Korea around the start of the 16th century the Chosun Period.Yeonsan is tired of his ministers who chirp away about the example of his dead father and provide consistently contrary counsel. Yeonsan is both a genuinely sensitive individual and also a deeply disturbed one whose neuroses are amply watered in the fertile garden of his royalty and allowed to blossom bloodily. I felt there was some sort of allusion to North Korea here where the Supreme Leader Kim Jongil is quite literally secondincommand to his dead father theocrat Kim Ilsung and certainly does have a twee side.Jangsang and his partner the extremely effeminate Gonggil are clowns who come to the attention of the king. They put on shows that are sometimes extremely bawdy or acrobatic comic or dramatic. They divert Yeonsan from his concubine Noksu whose skirt he lives inside as even the public are aware. I think this is a key point that the movie makes that the diversions of the clowns are more interesting than fondling even the most seductive woman a king can find sex an inferior version of play that adults have come up with.The King becomes attached to Gonggil in an apparently nonsexual way reentering a childish state. The story touchingly reminded me very much of the biblical one where David plays the harp to soothe King Saul when madness came upon him.The film in many ways is a feelgood one times are very harsh in the Chosun era but the performers don't let this get them down and can find ways to cheer each other up even when times are bad. The blindmen scene is the key example of this. The characters perform even when no audience is around to amuse themselves and because they seem to feel most alive when living in a form of collective identity. Gonggil even enjoys the stage of party nights when vomiting starts.The film manages to capture the innocence and virtues of childhood which the performers have kept intact for example and there are times in my life when I have seen this happen admitting to misdeeds that you have not committed to avoid the collective punishment of your group. Another lovely example would be a puppet show where a love story is enacted by the furtive stroking of one another's hands. The film has a lot of bright colours and looks good although this may be more down to the often exquisite set design than any particularly beautiful cinematography. One good example of shooting though was in a meadow which I like to think of as daisy drop.Aspects of the movie that weren't to my taste were the bawdiness which was a little strong for me I still have some innocence too so this is a very subjective point and the fact that Yeonsan's back story intruded a lot the intrigue surrounding his mother's death and was quite hard to follow.The King and the Clown is however an excellent movie full of values that have almost vanished and need some reviving.This is for Mollie for the memories at Renato's.".

They are dragged to the palace and threatened with execution but are given a chance to save their lives if they can make the king laugh.  This is just the beginning of the whole story the plot is much more than that.The king's character is the most fascinating one His mother was ordered by the previous king to commit suicide by consuming poison. Her death left a lasting trauma on the future king's psyche which played a significant role in the deformation of his character. But other than his tyrannical excesses he was a man of great sensitivity and intelligence. And the way he connects and forms a bond with Gonggil through Gong's jests and plays is quite moving. It's forms an interesting study of human nature.The climax scene is quite artistic and meaningful and shows the end of a reign and beginning of love  friendship in next life so beautifully merged.Note It's a period drama and the homosexual themes are just implied. Some foreign viewers call it the 'Korean Brokeback Mountain' but that's an amusingly misleading nickname the are no sex scenes or nudity. The themes have been explored in quite a subtle way because of the country's culture.".

	schema:reviewBody "The King and The Clown left me speechless at the end. All I could think was 'What a movie'. Nearly everyone whom I have recommended this movie to shared more or less the same reaction. Such is the beauty of The King and The Clown.This film tells the story of two minstrels who break away from their troupe and seek to make a living for themselves in Seoul. Jangsang the more masculine and brash one and Gonggil the weaker and emotionally fragile one soon get into trouble with the higher authorities for mocking the king. Jangsang makes a deal that their lives should be spared if their play makes the king laugh. Fortunately for them the king does and they are thus installed as court jesters. Everything seems to be going swimmingly until the king takes a fancy to the beautiful effeminate Gonggil and the minstrels' politically satirical plays begin to strike various chords with the government.First of all the acting is brilliant. The main trio of Kam Woo Seong Jeong Jin Yeong and Lee Joon Ki own their roles completely especially Lee Joon Ki who is really an eyeopener. I think majority of the viewers male and female alike were smitten with him during the show. Jeong Jin Yeong plays his psychotic warped king to the hilt and Kam Woo Seong is convincing as the streetsmart daring Jangsang. The three of them play off each other beautifully.The script is equally good. The characters are all real and multidimensional and the story pans out in a very emotional and intelligent way. The minstrels' 'meaningwithinmeaning' plays the friendship between them the confused relationship between the king and Gonggil the hypocrisy of the government and the politics are fascinating. Other aspects such as the wardrobe and soundtrack compliment the movie perfectly.I highly recommend this movie. I watched it with high expectations and it exceeded them. It is heartrending touching profound and comedic in parts. Do not miss out on this beautiful piece of filmmaking!".

Everything seems to be going swimmingly until the king takes a fancy to the beautiful effeminate Gonggil and the minstrels' politically satirical plays begin to strike various chords with the government.First of all the acting is brilliant. The main trio of Kam Woo Seong Jeong Jin Yeong and Lee Joon Ki own their roles completely especially Lee Joon Ki who is really an eyeopener. I think majority of the viewers male and female alike were smitten with him during the show. Jeong Jin Yeong plays his psychotic warped king to the hilt and Kam Woo Seong is convincing as the streetsmart daring Jangsang. The three of them play off each other beautifully.The script is equally good. The characters are all real and multidimensional and the story pans out in a very emotional and intelligent way. The minstrels' 'meaningwithinmeaning' plays the friendship between them the confused relationship between the king and Gonggil the hypocrisy of the government and the politics are fascinating. Other aspects such as the wardrobe and soundtrack compliment the movie perfectly.I highly recommend this movie. I watched it with high expectations and it exceeded them. It is heartrending touching profound and comedic in parts. Do not miss out on this beautiful piece of filmmaking!";

	schema:reviewBody "The best part about a movie is always a story. But that alone can't save the movie. The best part about a movie hence is the performances of the cast. I had been watching several of Lee Jun Gi's Kdramas and had been hearing how he was the original flower boy of the pretty boy trend of Korea. His performance in the King and The Clown was the reason which shaped South Korea's cinema forever. Aptly so. I was blown away by watching his performance on the movie. So much that I couldn't forget his character even when I was watching the freshly released horror movie The Nun in the theatre. The story is very simple. A troupe of street performers or clowns get in trouble after mocking the king and their only chance of survival is by making the King laugh. They perform very nervously and the king doesn't laugh. Its only after their queer performer Gong Gil who enacts the King's concubine Nok Su makes a witty joke is when the King is finally amused and laughs his heart out. He then keeps them as his personal jesters. Soon the King starts lusting Gong Gil and the clowns get trapped between all the polotical hoolabaloo and the King's madness. The King becomes obsessed with Gong Gil which leads to many ploys and internal strife. The performances of all the actors was on point. The actor who played Jang Seng the lover and protector of Gong Gil did a marvellous job in keeping us engaged. Your heart will go to him every time he would be on screen. The madness of the King was aptly portrayed as well. But the real show stealer was Lee Jun Gi. The original flower boy justifiably so. He was so feminine and elegant you could hardly take your eyes off screen. The character was very naive and kind and arguably the purest soul of the movie. Jun Gi portrayed it with such perfection that you would never even for second believe it is unreal. It seemed real as if we were watching the real Gong Gil. And needless to say the movie has a tragic ending. Though its central theme was about the harsh lives of street performers it also touched upon the controversial themes of homosexuality which is commendable considering the time it came out in South Korea. Overall my words are not enough to praise this movie. Highly recommended. Be prepared with tissues and chocolates because this movie is gonna touch your heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe that this film was lowbudget. The cinematography was breathtaking the costumes were colorful and vibrant and depicted what each character should be wearing the acting was superb for the main and minor characters the skits were hilarious the dialogue based on the subtitle was poetic and must be more poetic in Korean and the entire feel of the movie was outstanding. It did not rely on star power or glitzy special effects or well choreographed action sequences. It used an interesting plot well rounded characterization even for some of the minor characters and of course themes and actions that were better left unsaid or implied. I never liked the in your face style of movie making that many Western directors seem to take to make their point which some Asian directors seem to follow. For example I am uncomfortable with homosexual themes and yet the depiction of homosexuality in this film was subtle and it was not the only theme explored in this movie. There didn't have to be sexual scenes to make me think that there must be something between the two jesters. The beauty of this kind of subtlety though was the fact that some viewers just thought of the relationship as brotherly or platonic in nature. And because it was so subtle it could be interpreted as such. Even the deaths of the jesters were subtly portrayed and did not become explicit. I got tearyeyed even though in the end there were no tears and the characters were shown as happy being together. And there were humorous parts that came off naturally. The skits were of course funny by themselves though they were bawdy. But the dialogue among the jesters made me laugh despite the fact they were just talking about what was happening to them in the course of events like not wanting to act the parts of certain characters or why they had to do certain things or why awful things happen after each skit.The melancholy scenes also tugged at the heart and even though the king was such a tyrant one couldn't help pity him at some parts.This will become a classic because of its universal themes and great film making. I have to admit that I am homophobic but the love portrayed between the two jesters and to me it was not brotherly love in this film was more romantic than other couples depicted on film with a lot of explicit sex scenes whether they are homosexuals or otherwise. I wish modern films would use more implied scenarios off cam situations instead of using a lot of graphic sex and violence to sell their films. Viewers who have brains won't have an issue understanding the implications unless they love sex and gore.BRAVO!!!!!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Painted Skin";
	schema:reviewBody "Based upon the classic literature of Liao Zai Painted Skin is an adaptation of one of the stories that dwell on fox spirits. If you're someone expecting either a supernatural spook fest or an amalgamation of ghosts and kung fu you might be disappointed to find out that it's actually a romance through and through with complicated relationships all around that you can weave a complex web of love and lust amongst the players involved.Chen Kun plays Wang Sheng a general whose army recently overrun the camp of a group of barbarians. In their battle he rescues a beautiful girl from the grasp of the enemy and brings her home out of pity and suggestive lust given that she looks like Zhou Xun. OK so Zhou Xun plays Xiao Wei who unknowing to everyone else is a fox spirit touted always as beautiful beings in their human form with an appetite for human hearts in order to maintain her beauty and youth.Thus begins a tussle for General Wang's heart by both Xiao Wei and Vicky Zhao's Pei Rong who is the dutiful and demure wife of Wang Sheng. Pei Rong is indeed wary and beginning to suspect Xiao Wei's supernatural abilities when a spate of killings surface with her arrival but with no proof Xiao Wei starts to sow discord between the man and wife in order to try and become the new Mrs Wang. It's quite an interesting attempt through the characters to tell of the varying degrees and types of love one of possession in Xiao Wei's ruthless means to reach her objective and one of sacrificing for the love and well being of the other half as established through Pei Rong's selfless courage.But that's not all. Throw in Donnie Yen as an exgeneral Pang Yong who also shares the hots for Pei Rong and one time rival of Wang Sheng for her affections a bumbling lowly ghostbuster Xia Bin Sun Li who is in possession of a fabled mythical weapon opportunity to show off some special effects here and quite a sight to behold too in its temporal usage and denying her affections for Pang Yong and Qi Yuwu as a lizard spirit whose infatuation with Xiao Wei ensures that she gets her fair share of food without the need to get her hands dirty. Connected the dots yet?Fans of Donnie Yen will probably be a tad disappointed by his limited screen appearance and for the most parts he's either playing the joker where his jokes will likely be lost in translation going by the English subtitles that didn't manage to truly capture the essence of his lines and the remaining screen time having to see him execute some action but nothing groundbreaking and not seen before. We know what Donnie Yen can do and perhaps in seeking some form of redemption the story has a flashback scene where he dons armor yet again anyone remember the dismal result of An Empress And Her Warriors and does battle in a scene which Jackie Chan has already stamped his authority on.One could have expected the Gordon Chan is familiar with shooting decent action sequences but you don't really get a lot of that in Painted Skin save for some generic rooftop chase in the night and a be all and end all finale where no punches got pulled though it really got marred by all the tight shots that all you'd probably get to see is a blur. The narrative also got a little choppy in the mid section and you do feel that a huge chunk of detail got summarized to keep it running generously under two hours with subplots dropped that I suspect involved the growing affection and admiration between Pang Yong and Xia Bin in order not to distract the audience from the main love triangle of Pang Yong Xiao Wei and Pei Rong.All in all this is recommended for Zhou Xun's face off with Zhao Wei especially with the former playing the temptress role to perfection. The last where we saw two prominent Chinese actresses square off was between Zhang Ziyi and Gong Li in Memoirs of a Geisha. Otherwise Painted Skin held a lot of promise but didn't deliver that level of oomph in its final product lapsing into mediocrity throughout.".

	schema:headline " A social ETHICAL movie in the painted skin of legend";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not a horror monster or romance movie. It reflects very well social panic today in China third leg in marriage. Almost all Chinese females start to discuss about this fiercely online after watching the movie. There wasn't much horror at least in my opinion but mainly complicated relationships.Background Traditionally Chinese men could have one wife and several concubines with lower social position than the wife. Communist government made up law of onewifeonly since 1949. However when China started to get rich underground lovers start to emerge again and this trend is growing stronger each day since the last 15 years.Story and implication The movie almost directly indicates this social phenomenon The General indicates a powerful and rich man his wife represents the Chinese traditional image of wife she lives for her husband and is very tolerant until the last moment but still would sacrifice herself for the husband's good. The fox woman and the lizard man are at lower social positions because they are monsters just how the rich and powerful Chinese see the lower social class. They are highly skilled people though we can consider them as freshly graduated university students. Just like many Chinese women struggling in the lower social class in reality can be a nightclub waitress erotic massager and so on the fox woman met the General and gave him a beautiful weak needs protection impression. On the other hand the lizard man was ignored by society he was invisible sometimes in the movie just as many male in the lower social level.The General let the fox woman into his private life giving her many privileges that only wife can enjoy having maids managing daily stuff at home can even take over the wife's order see the dinner scene when the wife was late. The only thing that he has not given her is sexof course in reality the powerful man must have had sex with this third leg in marriage. The fox woman given so many indications believed that she could take over the position of wife social position upclimb rather than just becoming concubine.However exlover of the wife and social order keeper the jokeralike woman showed up. In reality there would not be exlover but family and other supporters of the wife possibly also powerful like indicated in the movie and social order keeper can be the public mass media etc. Social order keeper seemed useless at the beginning in front of the General which clearly shows today's society power in China.

Lizard man is skilled but still helpless struggles alone and loyal to the woman he loves who only look up to power and money. This indicates a serious social problem in China imbalanced malefemale ratio causes many men with lower socialposition to be left out in marriage while richer and more powerful men can enjoy several women at the same time.It is a good movie after all though if audience is nonChinese it can be hard to enjoy not much visual effect not much fighting.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is not a horror monster or romance movie. It reflects very well social panic today in China third leg in marriage. Almost all Chinese females start to discuss about this fiercely online after watching the movie. There wasn't much horror at least in my opinion but mainly complicated relationships.Background Traditionally Chinese men could have one wife and several concubines with lower social position than the wife. Communist government made up law of onewifeonly since 1949. However when China started to get rich underground lovers start to emerge again and this trend is growing stronger each day since the last 15 years.Story and implication The movie almost directly indicates this social phenomenon The General indicates a powerful and rich man his wife represents the Chinese traditional image of wife she lives for her husband and is very tolerant until the last moment but still would sacrifice herself for the husband's good. The fox woman and the lizard man are at lower social positions because they are monsters just how the rich and powerful Chinese see the lower social class. They are highly skilled people though we can consider them as freshly graduated university students. Just like many Chinese women struggling in the lower social class in reality can be a nightclub waitress erotic massager and so on the fox woman met the General and gave him a beautiful weak needs protection impression. On the other hand the lizard man was ignored by society he was invisible sometimes in the movie just as many male in the lower social level.The General let the fox woman into his private life giving her many privileges that only wife can enjoy having maids managing daily stuff at home can even take over the wife's order see the dinner scene when the wife was late. The only thing that he has not given her is sexof course in reality the powerful man must have had sex with this third leg in marriage. The fox woman given so many indications believed that she could take over the position of wife social position upclimb rather than just becoming concubine.However exlover of the wife and social order keeper the jokeralike woman showed up. In reality there would not be exlover but family and other supporters of the wife possibly also powerful like indicated in the movie and social order keeper can be the public mass media etc. Social order keeper seemed useless at the beginning in front of the General which clearly shows today's society power in China. Supporter of the wife could not help much because the wife's own decision determines all.Lizard man's existence was considered redundant by many who could not read the social background of China. Lizard man is skilled but still helpless struggles alone and loyal to the woman he loves who only look up to power and money. This indicates a serious social problem in China imbalanced malefemale ratio causes many men with lower socialposition to be left out in marriage while richer and more powerful men can enjoy several women at the same time.It is a good movie after all though if audience is nonChinese it can be hard to enjoy not much visual effect not much fighting.";

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Painted Skin";
	schema:reviewBody "Tagline Revoking the days of A Chinese Ghost Story Review by Neo The ultra screen beauty of the early 1990s was undeniably the ambassador of ghostromance movies Joey Wong. Its been a long time coming since those comedyspookyghostlyromanceaction genre. The good news is that The Painted Skin's ability to revoke those kind of unique feelings while the end product may not be the same. That's not to say The Painted Skin is not a good movie as the current reviewer thoroughly enjoyed the ride but in the end it just feels a little too forgettable. Carried by the consistently good actress in Zhou Xun who have now developed a reputation for being head and shoulder above her given material who attempts to follow the foot step of Joey Wong and adding to the pot of fire is an equally impressive return to form by Vicky Xiao Wei. Perhaps the downside is easily Alloy Chen Playboy Cops who appears to be miscasted in a role born to be played by say Liu Ye Connected. Adding to the mix is the overacting of Donnie Yen who is intentionally funny by overacting rather than in Seven Swords where his limited emotional range became more laughable than all the jokes added up together in that flick.In many ways Painted Skin feels like The Promise it allows the audience to totally disband their beliefs and escape into another world namely a dream. While Neo was one of the few people who actually liked the uneven and largely acclaimed disappointment The Promise. The Painted Skin fares even between and sometimes it is just fun to live within a dream. Perhaps fans of action cinema would have expected more as one would expect in a Donnie Yen's flick. In fact this isn't a Donnie Yen film where he grins kicks ass and ultimately kick more asses but rather at its core a love story a light hearted genre mixture of action ghosts and comedy. Quite simply revoking those days when movies like A Chinese Ghost Story are still in existence. Then again when a movie leaves you thinking about Joey Wong it really can't be half bad.There is no doubt that Mainland starlet Zhou Xun is a shinning star. Ever since Neo first associated with Zhou Xun in Fruit Chan's Hollywood Hong Kong he knew that there was something special and her display in Peter Chan's Perhaps Love enhanced her reputation to mainstream Hong Kong cinema. Although Zhou Xun does not possess the sweetest voice her vocal is distinctive easily recognizable and really something of an acquired taste. Her looks are pretty but pale incomparsion to compatriot Fan Bing Bing. Still her acting her screen chemistry her sheer screen presence makes Zhou Xun easily one of the better actress in Hong Kong cinema now. Here she performs to perfection the cross between humanity and evil and her ability to allow the audience to sympathesis with her character is not something that everyone can achieve. Clich and cheesy as the finale may seem to be the current reviewer is leaning towards liking it.If there is one aspect about reviewing movies that Neo enjoys is the part where he gets to talk about performances. I fondly remember way back in 2005 Koma provided a moment for two acting queens in Karena Lam and Angelica Lee and likewise Painted Skins goes head to head with Zhou Xun and Zhao Wei. The Shaolin Soccer girl Zhao Wei performs more than admirably and certainly a triumphant return to form. In arguably a much more difficult role than her counterpart she still manages to engage the audience and maintain some believability within the dream.Donnie Yen has come a long way since those Shanghai Affairs and Legend of the Wolf days but it is not surprising that while his screen presence has increased dramatically the same cannot be said about his acting. Luckily The Painted Skin does not require Yen to act and the result is one of Yen's better comedic display in recent years. Remember the time when Yen tried to emotes in Seven Swords it was unintentionally laughable here Yen deliberately overacts and the effect is the audience laughing with him rather than at him. As for Alloy Chen it just goes without saying that he still have a few notches behind the girls. Perhaps his good looks overshadowed his already nonexistent performance. While it is adequate there are not sparks and his chemistry with Zhao Wei comes up lacking. Fearless's Betty Sun makes her second film and passes with flying colours. Her lively performance brighten up the film in all corners and somehow manages to romance with the nonromanceable Donnie Yen.All in all Painted Skin ends up being good cinema due largely to the performances of the two leading actresses. There is no doubt that Skin gains even more sympathy points for alluding to those early 90s genre movies. So what's wrong with Painted Skin maybe you can argue about the lack of action lack of a storyline or even the believability factor. However Neo seems to think otherwise as Painted Skin feels like a dream. Not entirely a successful movie but certainly any movie that reminds the current reviewer of the sheer beauty of Joey Wong really can't be too bad Neo 2009 I rate it 7.510www.thehkneo.com".

I didn't know that the Lizard man actually was a lizard until after I watched the DVD extra. The makeup artists could have made his face and body more lizard like. And when Xiao wei turned all white at the end of the movie her face reminds me of the Japanese movie Grudge.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I didn't know quite what to expect of it but being Hong Kong's official entry to the 81st Acadmy Awards I thought it may be of some value. This film is adapted from the 300 year old classic ghost story of Song Ling Pu and is a combination of historical romance supernatural and martial arts from director Gordon Chan who also wrote the screenplay along with Abe Kwong and Lau Ho Leung with action scenes directed by Wei Tung. Yong Donnie Yen is China's best warrior. His former love Peirong Wei Zhao is now married to Wang Sheng Ken Chen the commander of the armies. In a raid on desert bandits the beautiful Xiao Wei is taken into the armies custody and she takes a liking to Wang Sheng but Peirong stands in her way. Mysterious grizzly deaths start happening and soon XiaBing Betty Sun a tough female hunter of demons shows up. Xiao Yi David Leong is the mysterious supernatural companion to the beautiful but deadly Xiao Wei. This is an entertaining story and makes for a great debut film for director Chan. Great cinematography from Arthur Wong and a great visual setting from the art department of art director bill Liv and production designer Chung Man Yee. A coproduction of Hong Kong with China and Singapore it's a little drawn out but worth seeing. I would give it a 7.5 and recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie painted skin is loosely based on a legendary Supranatural Chinese tale 'Hua Pi' about a disguised demon under a human skindrawn skin exactly. Like many favorite ancient tales despite the illogical and senseless aspect always have some moral aspect to be dig or contemplated over. Painted skin in this case is not much different of. It digs a very deep portrait about the meaning of love and the willing of sacrificing for love. And believe it or not the movie want to show us that not only do human can sacrifice when it came to the matter of love.Although stamped as a 'horror' movie but sorry to say don't expect to see very much horror in it. It's nowhere near the horror like you saw in most Zombie movie or modern slasher horror. It's in a more mannerly and elegant way to level its emotion to human being and in my opinion the horror thing is just to dramatize the center love story and not really the main course in the first place. Some humor in the movie is driven well enough to at least force some smirk on audiences. And for those who're aware with Donnie Yen as the main cast one can expect less than some martial arts showdown. The rest of the cast is very eye catching especially the irresistible beauty of Zhou Xun.And finally orchestrated by veteran director Gordon Chan who has experienced in so much genre since his existence in mid 80's the movie is not disappointed at all except in my opinion if only the director did try boldly adapted a more tragic ending it could really be better. Because in order to keep the movie running when the plot seems finally reach an end path the revealing of the demon's true identity in the end is way out of the blue and the motive is also very laudable.I'll give it a fair 610. Not Special but Enjoyable.".

Cynics may sneer but even if the sincerity in Painted skin does not win conviction it garners sympathy.To introduce this movie as the latest adaptation from the famous Chinese literature ghost story could be misleading. The movie in fact goes to great length of AVOIDING being scary. As director Gordon Chan A1 headline 2004 explains in an interview this is a story of romance where six characters speak for themselves about love. The movie does indeed adapt the ghost story but only as an anchor for the love stories. Also the movie talks about monsters and not ghosts in order to get through the movie censor authority of the Mainland of China to whom ghost is an absolute nono but monsters are tolerated. While this hardly seems to matter to the audience it means a potential market of hundreds of millions to the producers.The plot is simple even when it involves a doubletriangle or whatever geometrical form that is a more appropriate description of entangled love relationships. At the centre of it all is a girl Xiaowei rescued from a battle scene by General Wang Chen and taken into his household and becoming the darling to everybody. Xiaowei a monster that feed on raw human hearts falls in love with Wang and plots to usurp the place of his wife Peirong who soon suspects something. Into the scenes blunders Pang Yong derelict loner and exgeneral Wang's old boss as well as an old rival for Peirong who now seeks his help to check out her fears. A chance encounter brings to Pang's side a young woman Xia Bin Summer Ice a ghostbuster hot on the trail of Xiaowei. Finally to complete the double triangle is another monster one that reminds you of Toad in Xmen hopelessly in love with Xiaowei but only able to please her by bringing freshly snatched human hearts sometime served sliced in a bento box.The various shades of emotions and passions between these three men and women loosely defined is explored deftly by director Chan parading different levels of infatuation obsession devotion  from subtle to fiery from deviously possessive to nobly selfless. The movie is so delightfully unpretentious that it's almost nostalgic. In the end love conquers all  a little nave a bit idealistic seen it been there  and yet so refreshingly simple that it's not difficult to empathize. And this is not the least because of the good acting.ZHOU Xun irresistible to the audience just as Xiaowei is irresistible to almost everyone in the story pulls off the final conversion of a ruthless monster consumed in selfish passion to someone that finally realizes what true love really means with a degree of conviction that very few others can achieve. CHEN Kun who played another love triangle with ZHOU in The little Chinese seamstress with LIU Ye as the third look more like a scholar than a general as Weng but that hardly matters because he is winning as the faithful husband who chooses to die with his wife that he is tricked into believing to be the monster. Vicky ZHOU Wei was told by director Chan to grow up and stop relying on her cuteness did just that in this movie playing the most sympathyearning roll as a wife who makes the ultimate unspeakable sacrifice for love. Donny YEN fulfills his role in his favourite persona  a loner hero with a temper of fire and a heart of gold. Betty SUN in Fearless with Jet Li provides good support as the tomboyish monsterhunter who keeps stumbling when fighting with hate but finds herself and her power when driven by love.For those not satisfied with just the love story there is Donny Yen's martial art action and I happen to be one who thinks that he is the best since Bruce Lee. For cinematic effects a frequent moviegoer will be able to catch glimpses of familiarity  the wallandroof chase scene in Crouching tiger the tongue shooting act in Xman the nowyouseeitnowyoudon't monster in Predators just to name a few.".

For cinematic effects a frequent moviegoer will be able to catch glimpses of familiarity  the wallandroof chase scene in Crouching tiger the tongue shooting act in Xman the nowyouseeitnowyoudon't monster in Predators just to name a few.";

	schema:reviewBody "Painted Skin draws you in with it's recognizable list of performers Vicki Zhao Xun Zhao Donnie Yen and gives off an air of mystique with its movie posters and unique storyline. Loosely based on the classic Chinese short story Strange Stories From A Chinese Studio Painted Skin revolves around a female demon that feeds off of human hearts to retain its human like skin. The movie takes liberty to add several of its own plot twists the major one being a Gothic love triangle of sorts with the demon's desire to win the heart of General Wang and take the place of his wife. Ending gets pretty emotional. There is no vampires in the movie and it isn't a gory horror flick. It's one of the best Asian flicks I seen! In other words Painted Skin is light years better than An Empress and the Warriors and proudly untypical from the flood of Chinese epic period pieces we have seen this year. One of China's most versatile actresses Zhou is good at switching between Xiao Wei's evil and goodygoody sides. The characters are quite engaging the acting is solid and the action is exciting. Better yet the fighting scenes doesn't go on and on for a million light years as with most Asian films. The mood shifts dancing around between drama fantasy demonic and melodramatic romance. Very entertaining and mesmerizing! I couldn't get enough and started to watch it again and again. I'm glad I ignored bad reviews and took a chance on this! It's definitely not one to be missed by lovers of Asian films!".

	schema:reviewBody "If your ideal fantasy genre contains unrelenting action and adventure Painted Skin may not be the title for you. But if you're looking for a beautiful dramatic romance that is as poetic as it is entertaining you will not be disappointed.Written in an intelligently mature fashion and performed with emotional poignancy Painted Skin is quite unlike its American contrasts with stories of battlers fought for love occasionally becoming lost in bloody violence and nudity. This Chinese feature delivers a tasteful approach that sacrifices in your face thrills and excitement for a gripping character driven tale of unrequited romance.General Sheng returns home with his army after defeating barbarians infringing on his borders bringing a beautiful young woman he rescued with him. His wife is immediately suspicious of the young woman and becomes more so when her former paramour Yong a soldier turned nomad returns to the city at the same time as gorgeous demon hunter Xia both firmly believing the woman is not who she claims.There is without a doubt more to the mysterious woman Xiao than meets the eye though any accusations are rendered preposterous in the eyes of those who appreciate her. With suspicion and paranoia mounting Yong and Xia begin investigating only to find themselves in the middle of a battle plagued by conspiracy jealously betrayal and lust.Although there are a number of astounding action sequences Painted Skin is more of a cat and mouse thriller with many of the fights taking place in conversations where one character is always trying to outwit the other. At its heart the film reveals that no sacrifice is too great when you love someone both the script and the actors capturing the emotion perfectly from the beauty of romance to the grueling pain of loss.Unlike in other films where demons are purely villainous antagonists Painted Skin makes demons and humans alike sympathetic characters with breakable hearts and many a vulnerability the seductive storyline between man and demon being similar to the fourth Hellraiser. With this in mind though a sex scene is apparent nothing is ever seen the tasteful directional style presenting the audience with all of the passion but not at the expense of the actor's privacy.With outstanding special effects that draw you further into the plot alongside a soundtrack that mirrors the turmoil and romance exhibited in the film Painted Skin is a perfect fantasy that you do not want to miss.".

So yes I enjoyed Painted Skin aka Hua pi.Directors Gordon Chan Danny Ko and Andy WingKeung Chin managed to put together a good story that had a good amount of variation. Painted Skin is an enjoyable combination of love story action and drama.The talents were wellcast and it was nice to see a movie where Donnie Yen wasn't allovershadowing over all other actors and actresses. You know what you will get from martial arts star Donnie Yen of course. However the two female leads Xun Zhou and Wei Zhao were really impressive in this 2008 movie.Painted Skin has a lot to offer and chances are that you will find something in it too. I enjoyed the storytelling and the fact that the movie wasn't focusing on being a display of CGI effects.The action and fight sequences were wellchoreographed and equally so executed which is a given when Donnie Yen is involved.The costumes and sets were grand with lots of details and it helped bring the story to life quite well.Painted Skin is a wellworthy addition to the collection of anyone who enjoys Asian cinema.".

Vicki zhao acts as the stupid wife of a stupid man. they dying for each other is so lame. if they truly love each other he will believe her when she say zhou xun is a demon won't he? this movie makes no sense whatsoever. besides lamenting the absurdity i absolutely have no feelings toward any character. Wang sheng is your typical goodlooking hormonal guy who fall in love with the pretty girl idiotic as ever. Donnie yen is ugly but at least he has sense. qi yu Wu is funny but i don't see any special effects. can't he use his tongue to kill like toad from xmen? why must he fight using swords like normal people? he is also redundant as i don't think the original tale includes him. why would he wanna follow zhou xun if there are many demons around? Betty sun can't fight. AT ALL. it is a marvel she can even stab anything without taking out her own finger. she is a joke to martial arts. she only managed to kill qi yu Wu by accident. like he fell on top of her sword. all in all this shows how Chinese literature has deteriorated today. since Jackie Chan's 'kongfu' and exploits of Chinese 'legends' by Hollywood this is another hollow empty eye bubblegum that will lose flavor in ten seconds.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful yet disturbing art piece";
	schema:reviewBody "Definitely worth catching on the BIG screen this is an epic about court intrigue in the Five Dynasties period which follows in part the Hamlet setup of a murderous uncle usurper You Ge and his duplicitous queen Zhang Ziyi with an angry yet distant brooding prince Daniel Wu. The details and setting are different enough so that the new story carries its own weight and is interesting however. The acting is strong some excellent the martial arts scenes memorable and the sets are fantastic! This is not a fully realistic historical drama by the way. Director Xiaogang Feng has crafted a modern art piece here highly stylized in some parts and often gory especially the martial arts scenes so if you can't stomach people flying and leaping like phoenixes while disemboweling each other skip it. The highly artistic feel of the film is kept somewhat in check by the gritty used and sometimes decaying feel of the palace and more so by the tight sparse dialog the drama and the tension of the story. Although following in the footsteps of highly stylized films like some of Zhang Yimou's the focus returns very firmly to the story in this one thankfully. Similarly the stunning beauty of parts of the film is balanced by the unmitigated ambition of the characters and their other dark flaws. These left the story with no single simplified protagonist to cheer for  the very opposite of Hollywood formula. The supporting role played by Xun Zhou might be an exception but she's the very image of innocence and purity to a fatal flaw and you pity her more than rooting for her. The raw ambition incestuous lust jealous hate betrayal andor impotence darken nearly every character. While refreshingly different in this sense it almost left me reaching for my goblet of hemlock. The Chinese title Ye Yan should have been translated as The Night Banquet rather than The Banquet its English billing where I am as the climax occurs at a midnight banquet unwisely set by the emperor at an inauspicious time and it would have better reflected the darkness of the film.Overall I give it a big thumbs up.".

	schema:headline " More than just a Hamlet Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "The Banquet is a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet which I believe is Shakespeare's most powerful literary creation and one which has been adapted as I count 5 times in the silver screen my personal fave is the version with Mel Gibson I have yet to watch the one with Ethan Hawke. This adaptation is so loose that oftentimes it feels like it has its own originality and only drew inspiration from Hamlet. One of the original aspects of the film is that of the character played by Ziyi Zhang which is a product of a revision of the original script. A revision which added quite a depth to the storyline. Gong Li Memoirs of a Geisha Miami Vice Farewell My Concubine was originally supposed to play Zhang Ziyi's part. Maggie Cheung 2046 Hero was also considered for the role. Due to scheduling conflicts. When Ziyi Zhang took over the part the script was rewritten to make the character younger. Her character is a former love interest of the Prince Wu Luan the main character but was later wed to the Prince's own father and eventually to become the Empress to his uncle. Such a character has given a large amount of dramatic tension to the storyline and further complicates it making the story more unpredictable even though it is an adaptation. It is such a wicked delight to see Ziyi Zhang play such a dark snake of a character in this movie a character who claims a love which is actually of self rather than something pure. Since her breakthrough in Crouching Tiger... she has proved time and again that the potency of her talent doesn't easily wither and in her youth she has already made great performances more than enough to satisfy a cinemaacting retiree. Likewise impressive performances from Daniel Wu as the Prince Wu Luan the alluring  yummy Xun Zhou as the Opheliac Qing Nu Jingwu Ma as the wise Minister and You Ge who also deserves much praise for playing the Emperor Li a character who defies being generalized as black  white a character which is richly layered with many levels. THE BANQUET is mainly drama You do not watch this film for the Martial Arts even though Yuen Woo Ping has a hand in the making of this film as both producer and action choreographer I would consider Yuen Woo Ping as the living god of Martial Arts movies having directed timeless classics like Snake in the Eagle's Shadow  Drunken Master until now  was given international spotlight when he worked as Fight choreographer of The Matrix movies but you watch this movie for its beautiful storyline. Although there are moments that induce awe in some of the fight sequences these are expected to be minimal compared to the dialoguedriving motion of the film. It may even be observed that the martial arts here is a mere icing on the cake. Along with that icing is the amazing visuals that it presents. From flying stunts to set designs to costumes. You can feast your eyes upon the visuals which wakes up viewers from a possible boredom. It employs a semisurreal style of setting. It seems that ever since it broke into worldwide popularity Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has opened the floodgates for Chinese dramatic epics which are done in closed form of movies movies which such a forced unnatural ambiance that generally use wireworks to do fantastic martial arts feats and exaggerated vibrancy and style on sets which depict surreal environments although this style was long used in Hong Kong but mostly only for action epics. But this type of fantasylike genre was getting old and it needed to be complemented with really good story lines. Such was achieved by Yimou Zhang's Hero which starred Jet Li  Donnie Yen. This same surreal closed form style is employed by THE BANQUET. THE BANQUET is powerful dramatically rich and such a masterpiece of a work as dark and beautiful as the Shakespearean tragedy from which it is based on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies out of HK and China are increasingly rivaling or surpassing the best out of Hollywood in acting cinematography costuming and artistic vision. 'The Banquet' is a shining example.This is a loosely based interpretation of Hamlet adapted for the Tang dynasty period. In my opinion there is too much energy spent on this site debating whether it is a good adaptation of Hamlet comparing it to other Hamlet films etc. It is not a straight remake of Hamlet  it obviously takes inspiration from the play and uses many of its elements and that's it. So just sit back watch it and judge it on its own merits.This is primarily a drama but it's sprinkled with great martial arts choreography a la Yuen Wo Ping. Many fight scenes follow the wu xia fantasy kung fu genre  just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the beautiful spectacle of it.A riveting moment comes when a one of the Emperor's mandarins scholars who rule over the provinces introduces Wan as Dowager Empress language that means Wan is the mother of an Emperor Prince Wu Luan and is a slap in the face to Li. Wan and Generals alike must decide where their allegiances lie.The acting is very good and I enjoyed Zhang Ziyi playing the lecherous Empress You Ge playing a convincingly imperial Emperor and Xun Zhou as the nave Qing in love with our 'Hamlet'.One of The Banquet's strong points is it is absolutely stunning visually right from the first scene in a verdant and swaying bamboo forest that makes you wonder if such a beautiful place really exists. The costumes throughout are incredibly rich and detailed.It lags a little in the last half hour maybe I was just tired but to its credit does not run much longer than 2 hours.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of Chinese movies Ziyi Zhang and Shakespeare so I was definitely looking forward to this movie. The story is inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet and does an excellent job of translating the classic to an historic setting at the end of the Tang dynasty. I especially enjoyed the reinterpretation of Hamlet's mother as Prince Wu Luan's former lover there was always something uncomfortably incestuous in Shakespeare's original. The acting is superb with kudos to both Ziyi Zhang and You Ge for creating a pair of very complex characters as Empress and Emperor. Some of the dialog is poetic in spite of not being Shakespearean. The sets were sumptuous. And Qing Nu's song at the end was beautiful!So where did it go wrong? Except for Qing's song the rest of the music was annoyingly obtrusive. Most of the action scenes were stylized and shot in slow motion. And many times the annoying music was playing during the slow motion action sequences which effectively doubled the annoyance. Only the Prince's audition was a meaningful well constructed action sequence. Finally it could have been edited better with the movie reduced by about 15 minutes. There were several scenes that just didn't make sense. For example there is a beautiful shot of Empress Wan entering the water naked but it has no relation to what came before or after ok maybe that scene doesn't need context but it just seemed out of place.Overall a decent movie with flashes of brilliance but having one too many flaws to rank any higher.".

	schema:reviewBody "Feng Xiaogang arguably the most popular director in China today demonstrates convincingly that in his first attempt at the historic epic genre loosely termed he has outclassed the two veterans best known to the rest of the world Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who by trying too hard to impress and please have courted backlashes. Zhang's pretentious Flying dagger has become a bit of a laughing stock and Chen's elaborated Wu ji while not as disastrous has failed to be convincing. Feng avoided these fatal mistakes by keeping his feet firmly planted on the ground. While he starts with a clear message that he is second to none in the fancy stuff department with two spectacular sequences which I'll come back to he did not get carried away as the other two directors and comes back firmly to the story and the characters.The story is what I would call quasihistory  and is a very clever move. While there is definitive reference to the rather chaotic historical period after the Tang Dynasty the decaying Tang or five dynasty ten nations period as known in Chinese history the movie is intentionally vague on where exactly the story happened. For all intent and purposes it's a fictitious nation. There's the cleverness of getting the better of both worlds  having the air of authenticity and yet avoiding completely any possible criticism of distorting historical facts. VERY loosely there is a Hamlet plot sort of. We do have an indecisive prince Daniel Wu finding himself in the predicament of his uncle Ge You murdering his father and taking over both the crown and the queen Zhang Ziyi. But here the queen is not the biological mother but a former adolescent sweetheart 4 years younger that his father took away. Perhaps to ease his son's pain the king now murdered made a match for him with lovely and devoted maidofhonour Qing Zhou Xun. This would be the place to bring up an interesting point. Purportedly the role of the queen was initially offered to Gong Li who declined because of other engagements. Had it been Gong she would have to play someone 4 years younger than Wu. This leads me to speculate that maybe we had originally a closer Hamlet plot in which Gong would be Wu's real mother. It was then changed because Zhang playing Wu's mother would be just as unconvincing as Gong playing his young exlover. If that is really what happened the plot suffers in that the love story between the prince and Qing has become less pure and sympathyworthy.There is no question that the queen is the main character the opening credit of Zhang's solo billing betrays as much. She is relentlessly scheming overmatching even the king the reigning one that is her exbrotherinlaw hitting him at a spot that is every man's Achilles' heel by telling him that he can give her something that he brother wasn't able to and she may well be very honest about it judging from what we see in the erotic scenes. But there are more facets to the queen than just the ruthless survivor. There's the ambitious powermonger and there's the vulnerable young lover just to name two. Zhang has come a long way from the wooden angry rebellious young damsel which has been her singleexpression oversimplified persona. In Banquet she begins to show subtleties and variations that we have never seen in her before. Although I must confess that in Zhang's scene throughout the movie I couldn't help that ifonlywehaveGong subconscious in all fairness to Zhang she has come off rather well with this difficult challenge.Daniel Wu suffers by comparison but manages to deliver an artloving introvert prince that is reasonably believable. And I must give Ge due credit for resisting the easy temptation to overacting the usurping brother or uncle or brotherinlaw depending on who's talking making the role more of a real fleshandblood human being than a stereotyped bad guy. The darling of the movie is obviously Qing  pure innocent but not nave devoted defiant  portrayed to perfection by Zhou. There are two other important characters Qing's father the minister Ma Jingwu and brother the general Huang Xiaoming.The movie opens with a most exquisite set a threedimensional arenacumstage where the selfexiled prince finds melancholic pleasure in perfecting his art in a Greektype tragedy complete with masks and all. Soon this tranquil paradise becomes an infernal of bloody slaughters by the royal guards sent by his uncle to eliminate him. These are the two scenes I mentioned earlier in which director Feng shows what he is capable of in the artistic department. But as I said he didn't indulge.After a stunning opening the movie gets back down to earth telling a story in a simple but effective way. The middle section could be considered slightly long but is never dragging. The finale is surehanded punchy or poignant as the situation demands and I particularly like the imaginative aerial shot framing an exquisite pattern of three dead bodies in white black and brown and a living one in fiery red.The music is also exquisite beginning with Tan Dun's powerful orchestration. Most memorable is the haunting song of unfulfilled love that starts the movie and is echoed at the end sung in a scene by Zhou in a way that deepens the pain tenfold. The original sound track has been advertised in town just as heavily as the movie. I expect to get one soon and will edit this comment if there's more to say after listening to it. If you like Crouching Tiger this is the movie to see. Forget about everything in between.".

She is relentlessly scheming overmatching even the king the reigning one that is her exbrotherinlaw hitting him at a spot that is every man's Achilles' heel by telling him that he can give her something that he brother wasn't able to and she may well be very honest about it judging from what we see in the erotic scenes. But there are more facets to the queen than just the ruthless survivor. There's the ambitious powermonger and there's the vulnerable young lover just to name two. Zhang has come a long way from the wooden angry rebellious young damsel which has been her singleexpression oversimplified persona. In Banquet she begins to show subtleties and variations that we have never seen in her before. Although I must confess that in Zhang's scene throughout the movie I couldn't help that ifonlywehaveGong subconscious in all fairness to Zhang she has come off rather well with this difficult challenge.Daniel Wu suffers by comparison but manages to deliver an artloving introvert prince that is reasonably believable. And I must give Ge due credit for resisting the easy temptation to overacting the usurping brother or uncle or brotherinlaw depending on who's talking making the role more of a real fleshandblood human being than a stereotyped bad guy. The darling of the movie is obviously Qing  pure innocent but not nave devoted defiant  portrayed to perfection by Zhou. There are two other important characters Qing's father the minister Ma Jingwu and brother the general Huang Xiaoming.The movie opens with a most exquisite set a threedimensional arenacumstage where the selfexiled prince finds melancholic pleasure in perfecting his art in a Greektype tragedy complete with masks and all. Soon this tranquil paradise becomes an infernal of bloody slaughters by the royal guards sent by his uncle to eliminate him. These are the two scenes I mentioned earlier in which director Feng shows what he is capable of in the artistic department. But as I said he didn't indulge.After a stunning opening the movie gets back down to earth telling a story in a simple but effective way. The middle section could be considered slightly long but is never dragging. The finale is surehanded punchy or poignant as the situation demands and I particularly like the imaginative aerial shot framing an exquisite pattern of three dead bodies in white black and brown and a living one in fiery red.The music is also exquisite beginning with Tan Dun's powerful orchestration. Most memorable is the haunting song of unfulfilled love that starts the movie and is echoed at the end sung in a scene by Zhou in a way that deepens the pain tenfold. The original sound track has been advertised in town just as heavily as the movie. I expect to get one soon and will edit this comment if there's more to say after listening to it. If you like Crouching Tiger this is the movie to see. Forget about everything in between.";

The use of masks and movement play with Shakespearean notions of the play within the playall the world's a stage. And for me at least this is the most impressive layer of the film. The story is well done though one should not watch it as a version of Hamlet but rather as inspired by Hamlet. Both Ye Yan and Hamlet address political cultural and social issues through the story but their issues are not identical. At this point I would say this is my second favorite Feng Xiaogang filmonly behind Tian Xia Wu Zeibut oh how I wish they would all be released in America. I read in the trivia of this web page that Ye Yan will be nominated for the Oscars and I hope this is true......mostly on the off chance that if it winsdespite the American public not seeing itthat it will lead to some of Feng Xiaogang's movies getting an American release.".

I was there.Much criticism has also emerged in China after several smaller showings in the cities of Guangzhou Xi'an Hangzhou and Shenyang. Interestingly enough in recent years Chinese audiences and critics have followed the unofficial routine of trashing any bigbudget blockbusters by Chinese directors aiming to rival their Hollywood fellows. Even Hero directed by Zhang Yimou whose Curse of the Yellow Flowers is due out this year received a great amount of negative publicity in China while being highly praised in the rest of the world and topping the US' movie chart. Chen Kaige's The Promise has also provoked much controversy even public anger from audiences especially netizens.The Banquet reportedly costing about 150 million yuan to make is expected to be longtime comedy director Feng Xiaogang's directing transformation. The movie tells a tragedy happening in a kingdom during the Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms in ancient China.The storyline was inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet which has been admitted by the director from very beginning but has several adaptations Empress Wan Zhang Ziyi in love with Prince Wu Luan Daniel Wu since their very young age she is crowned as the Empress and becomes her beloved's stepmother by marrying his father who was later murdered by Emperor Li Ge You his powerhungry brother who crowned Wan as the Empress once again. Meanwhile the prince Wu Luan is locked in a powerstruggle with Emperor Li and loved by Qing Nu Zhou Xun an innocent minister's daughter. In the end all die for love struggle revenge and desire.Director Feng punched back when asked by press about foreign criticism who said the movie lacked Chinese characteristics. I think it was their biased conspiracy. They want to look down upon us from their hegemony culture angle. When you have done a good job as they do they are not pleased. They will say it lacks socalled 'Chinese characteristics' and 'hope' you go back to do those old colorful stuff. They also feel that The Banquet is almost the same as the House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. As a matter of fact I feel the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are almost the same too. But they are definitely different. This only indicates that we have known very little about each other. I exclusively invited was treated to the morning viewing. With its depressive but magnificent music short but eyecatching action scenes and darkly beautiful set and costume designs The Banquet is far from a flop. The plots are well organized though a little sluggish. The cast works well especially Zhang Ziyi at her best when demonstrating her character's physical and mental crises.For Chinese audiences the biggest problem may be the movie's Chinese dialogue much of it drawn from literary language. The amusement inherent to hearing characters speak in such a way detracts from the tragic atmosphere the film tries to build. Feng argued there should have been nothing to laugh at blaming it on journalists and unprofessional critics themselves who had not fully understood the movie and the script. But some news outlets previously guessed that one of the causes is Chinese audience's longstanding impressions of comedian Ge You and Feng's former comedies. No one laughed at the Venice premiere since most of the audience did not know who Feng was.At the evening's showing most audience members gave warmer responses than critics did. When Feng Xiaogang asked if the movie was good as credits rolled people cheered good! immediately.".

The assassins' arrival at the theater where Wu Laun studies ignites the first of the marvelous fight sequences. The amphitheater is multileveled with ramps connecting the different areas .

Her acting has matured quite a bit since I first saw her in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Her fight scenes are also quite good. Daniel Wu as Wu Laun and You Ge as Emperor Li both give fine performances.The fight scenes are beautifully staged and shot by all involved. The opening fight sequence in the amphitheater is my personal favorite. My only complaint is there are not enough fights but I understand that this is a limitation of the source material. I'm sure when Shakespeare wrote it he never envisioned its adaptation to wuxia.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes wuxia historical epics or someone looking for a neat twist to Shakespeare's Hamlet.I have this review and some screen shots posted on my blog burndvdburn.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Banquet";
	schema:reviewBody "It's an oriental kung fu Hamlet.Everyone's been saying it's loosely based on Shakespeare's tragedy and to some the movie's indeed a tragedy with its slowness in pace and lack of action but I'd like to see it as because of its heavy reference to Hamlet the poisoned quill and many other plot points and scenes it sort of created a crutch on which to lean the movie upon hence the familiarity to some therefore having the source serving as a double edged sword  the movie beholden to it and eventually ending it on a weak note.Having inherited the creative team of Yuen Wo Ping action choreography Tan Dun Music Tim Yip Art Direction and the starlet in Ziyi Zhang wonder why the westernized juxtaposition of her name does not automatically replicate the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon that easily. It's the Xfactor and the blending of elements of novelty in CTHD that made it a huge success and blindly following the predetermined formula is akin to hammering a square peg into a round hole.While the art direction is lush and everything looking adequately regal somehow Tan Dun's music seemed to be muted throughout the movie only exhibiting sporadic brilliance to drum up scenes with the soundtrack or the hauntingly beautiful theme song. The major disappointment however will be in the fighting scenes. Here martial arts both function as a contrast to the much muted artsy style of the Hamlet here Prince Wu Luan Daniel Wu highlighting the difference in power between the pen and the sword as well as functioning as foreplay. I thought with the gratuitous fake blood spewing across the screen it was kind of a homage to 70s Shaw Bros martial arts classics and a nod to director Chang Cheh the king of ketchup blood. The initial big sequenced battle scene might have whet appetites but sadly subsequent battles do not match up with its repetitive running up walls or in mid air as if Yuen had run out of tricks in the wirework manual having at one point seemed to copy Tsui Hark's Dao 1995. There's one moment of innovation though in a scene of punishment not seen at least to me before.But not that I'm complaining. If this martial arts in this movie is viewed without comparisons to other more recent fantasy martial arts movies like Hero and House of Flying Daggers it is still enjoyable and beautifully choreographed and surpasses The Promise by a huge mile. Just that it lacked a fresh look in battles and the unimaginative costuming of the Imperial Guards didn't help looking too close like distant cousins of Lord of the Ring's Nazguls  Ringwraiths  Black Riders.Desire as a theme runs through the movie very strongly the desire for love endless power and pure unadulterated revenge. Very briefly the story by now will be fairly obvious with Emperor Li Ge You usurping the throne from his brother and coverts his wife Empress Wan as his own who at one point in time was Prince Wu Luan's old flame. The Prince here is a fellow in love with the arts and bent on avenging his father and who is the subject of unrequited love by the daughter of a minister  Qing Nu Zhou Xun.It's all about the wearing of masks and the building of facades of hiding true intentions to achieve personal objectives. The contrast between the two men in the Emperor and the Prince is looked into their love lives examined  one who uses power to obtain love while the other's fortune to be loved brought him unimaginable influence.

	onyx:emotionText "It's an oriental kung fu Hamlet.Everyone's been saying it's loosely based on Shakespeare's tragedy and to some the movie's indeed a tragedy with its slowness in pace and lack of action but I'd like to see it as because of its heavy reference to Hamlet the poisoned quill and many other plot points and scenes it sort of created a crutch on which to lean the movie upon hence the familiarity to some therefore having the source serving as a double edged sword  the movie beholden to it and eventually ending it on a weak note.Having inherited the creative team of Yuen Wo Ping action choreography Tan Dun Music Tim Yip Art Direction and the starlet in Ziyi Zhang wonder why the westernized juxtaposition of her name does not automatically replicate the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon that easily. It's the Xfactor and the blending of elements of novelty in CTHD that made it a huge success and blindly following the predetermined formula is akin to hammering a square peg into a round hole.While the art direction is lush and everything looking adequately regal somehow Tan Dun's music seemed to be muted throughout the movie only exhibiting sporadic brilliance to drum up scenes with the soundtrack or the hauntingly beautiful theme song. The major disappointment however will be in the fighting scenes. Here martial arts both function as a contrast to the much muted artsy style of the Hamlet here Prince Wu Luan Daniel Wu highlighting the difference in power between the pen and the sword as well as functioning as foreplay. I thought with the gratuitous fake blood spewing across the screen it was kind of a homage to 70s Shaw Bros martial arts classics and a nod to director Chang Cheh the king of ketchup blood. The initial big sequenced battle scene might have whet appetites but sadly subsequent battles do not match up with its repetitive running up walls or in mid air as if Yuen had run out of tricks in the wirework manual having at one point seemed to copy Tsui Hark's Dao 1995. There's one moment of innovation though in a scene of punishment not seen at least to me before.But not that I'm complaining. If this martial arts in this movie is viewed without comparisons to other more recent fantasy martial arts movies like Hero and House of Flying Daggers it is still enjoyable and beautifully choreographed and surpasses The Promise by a huge mile. Just that it lacked a fresh look in battles and the unimaginative costuming of the Imperial Guards didn't help looking too close like distant cousins of Lord of the Ring's Nazguls  Ringwraiths  Black Riders.Desire as a theme runs through the movie very strongly the desire for love endless power and pure unadulterated revenge. Very briefly the story by now will be fairly obvious with Emperor Li Ge You usurping the throne from his brother and coverts his wife Empress Wan as his own who at one point in time was Prince Wu Luan's old flame. The Prince here is a fellow in love with the arts and bent on avenging his father and who is the subject of unrequited love by the daughter of a minister  Qing Nu Zhou Xun.It's all about the wearing of masks and the building of facades of hiding true intentions to achieve personal objectives. The contrast between the two men in the Emperor and the Prince is looked into their love lives examined  one who uses power to obtain love while the other's fortune to be loved brought him unimaginable influence. Despite its references to Hamlet the focus of the movie here seemed to be Ziyi Zhang's Empress Wan as she plots and schemes leaving you perplexed as to whether to sympathize and pity her or applaud her attempts at exacting her own brand of justice. Acting all round is nothing to rave about and though Ge You's performance seemed the better of the lot his measured subtle ways as the Emperor comes off rather weakly as a man capable of scheming to get to where he is.

The setting is good but it's too dark since almost everything are in black and red. This is somehow a bit disappointment and Curse of the golden flower is much better than this movie. The director couldn't bring the talents of the artists. Zhang Zi Yi and Zhou Xun are may be who acted well. The ending also silly and unexplained.

I thought the story was great the acting was great great sets I don't know why so many people hated this movie. First it is not an action or a fighting movie it is a drama. A story about the human heart and how easily it is corrupted. All of the actors did a good job of portraying this through their characters and the director did a good job of implementing the same theme throughout the whole movie. As for CTHD references please stop. They are not the same movie. Period. If CTHD and Hero and HOFD etc. are all the same then the same must be said for every American piece of garbage to come out in the last 10 years. with few exceptions I'm white. I'm American. I can tell the difference. Why can't you. That being said I think people have the wrong idea about the ending. Since the director leaves it up to the viewer to decide this of course is only my opinion but like all of my opinions I believe it to be correct. We simply do not know who killed Ziyi it does not matter. Again the whole theme of the movie is poured into every scene Human greed and evil desires of the heart. Whoever killed Ziyi was someone who like her character probably started out completely innocent and over time was corrupted by the pursuit of power. I think this is made evident by the look and reaction on Ziyi's face. The person she saw was the last person she would ever think could kill her another testament to the evil intent of the human heart. The person doesn't matter just the event does.".

We have the absent prince whose father has died at the hands of his uncle the remarrying wife a pining lover in the court the scheming elderly minister and his crusading and loyal son.And these parallels hold sway for much of the film however it is not to the film's detriment at all  this is a damn fine story and stands up pretty darn well in this setting I've yet to establish if there's a parallel tale in Chinese history or not.The costumes and the sets are as lovely as you would expect and there's even a dash of CGI in depicting the ancient city  good enough to make Peter Jackson or George Lucas wonder what they've been doing wrong. All the performances are engaging and there's that rare thing of all the characters  whether they are 'good' or 'bad' pulling a decent amount of empathy.How close the story keeps to the 'Hamlet' plot I won't say for fear of throwing in too many spoilers  but as a tale of courtly intrigue this is as good as it comes to be honest.In fact the plot is that solid with regard to these matters it does feel like some of the fights really had to be shoehorned in because they are what is expected. The film could easily have survived with two or three of the fight scenes removed.What we see though are well done and sometimes haunting  the opening fight at the theatre between a handful of elite guardsmen and the superior forces of the emperors guard and then the slaughter of the inhabitants of the theatre  followed by the final defence of the prince  is particularly effective.I get the feeling this will be one of those films that's going to be aimed at the western audiences rarely quickly  already bearing a ChineseEnglish poster and fully translated credits.The only performer who may be familiar to most is the always excellent Ziyi Zhang  who portrays the empress  full of grace and contrasting emotions and if we look at this film as a Hamlet analog bringing more to the role than any actress I've seen Although her 'expanded' role in the tale may be something to do with that.So yes The Banquet is a particularly well presented drama laced with the spectacle and grace that has flourished of late in Chinese Cinema ifwhen it appears over there it's well worth watching  there are more spectacular examples of Chinese Cinema out there but there seems more substance to this than many.".

The storyline is basically Hamlet and if you have ever watched Hamlet you can see the parallels in the story but in Chinese with added martial arts goodness. The only downside you could guess how it was going to end and sadly unlike Western movies it doesn't keep you in the grips of your seat wondering would the prince make it this time...I found that towards the end I just wanted the movie to end I guess if you know the age old tragedy story by Shakespeare people die and in this movie they die tear jerking realistic deaths no PG here... The acting is serious excellent I can only understand Cantonese but when the words are spoken with such emotion and the acting so well done you don't need to understand the language to feel the movie. Certain scenes are such a treat eg the love song is so beautifully done the martial arts are second to none going to leave scenes out not to spoil anything. The only downside is if you know the storyline of Hamlet you can guess how everything is going to go.I do hope you check it out well worth a watch and it is damn impressive coming out of China... The PRC is coming out with such talent nowadays!Zeroing out.

	schema:reviewBody "I have a high threshold for bad movies. While I think the Resident Evil movies are horrible I sat through both of them without complaining too much. I even put myself through an Uwe Boll marathon just to see what the hype was all about. But this movie actually made me physically violent. It just made my angry that I was wasting two hours of my life watching a film that I knew was bad.So why is this film bad? First it's a horribly can't use the word I want to poor adaptation of Hamlet. Now not all adaptations of Shakespeare have to be accurate or even full adaptations. Kurosawa's Throne of Blood and Ran are excellent adaptations of Shakespeare's plays that rely loosely on the plots and themes of MacBeth and King Lear respectively. How does this film adapt Shakespeare? By exposition. The characters essentially speak the plot of Hamlet to each other constantly reminding the audience that they are watching a Chinese interpretation of Hamlet. You're basically sitting through a two hour plot summary of a four hour play. There are better adaptations of Hamlet... and if you really need to get your Shakespeare fix through Asian cinema get it through Kurosawa because he does it infinitely better.Second the film assumes that you're an idiot. The film not only explains the symbolism of the most basic visual cues  the meaning of the color red the meaning of water and really anything that you could think of  but it also over explains the plot. In one convoluted scene a general calls the Empress the Empress Dowager. The Emperor that goes on a five minute tirade on how this is an insult to his dignity. As if you couldn't figure that out on your own. And the film constantly does this. So you're not only sitting through exposition that reminds you that you're watching Hamlet you're basically sitting through a director's commentary as told by the characters in the film. It makes for a painful experience.Third if you're expecting some of that Wu Xia stuff to impress you because this is billed as a Wu Xia film well you're going to be disappointed. There is probably one short scene at the end which is slightly impressive but on the whole it disappoints. It's not that kind of a movie even if it's in the genre.So really there's no reason to watch this film. If you want a good version of Hamlet go watch Branaugh's version. If you want a good Asian adaptation of Shakespeare go watch Throne of Blood. If you want a good Wu Xia film go watch Hero or even better go to your local Chinatown and pick up something from the 90s. However if you want a film that is patronizing and treats you like a five year old child then this one's for you.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have a high threshold for bad movies. While I think the Resident Evil movies are horrible I sat through both of them without complaining too much. I even put myself through an Uwe Boll marathon just to see what the hype was all about. But this movie actually made me physically violent. It just made my angry that I was wasting two hours of my life watching a film that I knew was bad.So why is this film bad? First it's a horribly can't use the word I want to poor adaptation of Hamlet. Now not all adaptations of Shakespeare have to be accurate or even full adaptations. Kurosawa's Throne of Blood and Ran are excellent adaptations of Shakespeare's plays that rely loosely on the plots and themes of MacBeth and King Lear respectively. How does this film adapt Shakespeare? By exposition. The characters essentially speak the plot of Hamlet to each other constantly reminding the audience that they are watching a Chinese interpretation of Hamlet.

The acting is good Ziyi Zhang showing another compelling performance. Many of the scenes feel a bit oddly shot as though it doesn't really capture the characters true feelings. The ending  i wont say anything about it is also a tad confusing but i'm assuming is meant to be symbolic of tragedy  see it for yourself and see if you understand.The similarities with Hamlet are very apparent yet the real villain in the film is the queen.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was that great. It sucked really bad IMO and I had preferred Tsui Hark's works from the good old days. And recently all these socalled Chinese Epic Dramas they are so blatantly catered for Hollywood that I actually laugh at their attempts of defending themselves. Well if you look pass the obvious catering for the western market you could find some gems like Hero was magnificent and House of the Flying Daggers was not too bad but the other attempts shall just slip away into oblivious history.That being said I was pleasantly and gratefully surprise at The Banquet. When I heard that it was in production I was anticipating it just like I did with all the other Epics that promised but does not deliver mainly because I heard of the stellar cast for the movie Zhou Xun Daniel Wu Ge You Huang Xiaomingokay he is cute and I was promised Gong Li. Somehow I didn't realize that Gong Li was replaced by the younger Zhang Ziyi. That fueled my disappointment and I almost didn't want to watch this movie if not for the great love I had for the other cast members.The difference between this one and it's overly pretentious predecessors is that it has a little of everything but does not over do anything. It has a play of colors but not as brutally used as Hero. It has beautifully choreographed fight scenes but not as overlyenthusiastic as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It has remarkable sets and astounding scenery but not shamelessly used like House of the hidden daggers. It has beautiful costumes but not ridiculously extravagant as The Promise I could go on and on but it doesn't matter what matters is that this movie has everything in an appropriate proportion.Well maybe not everything I wish there were lesser scenes with the adequate but nothing great Zhang ZiYi. I understand that Ziyi Zhang is the name the westerners would recognized the most thus the hard sell but seriously the more they focus on her the more it is obvious that she is only an adequate actress. Some may say that she excelled in this role well this role is tailored for Miss Zhang if she did less than what she did she really doesn't deserve any recognition at all. That being said I believe that I can name at least 3 other Chinese actresses that could have done an equal or even better job then Miss Zhang would ever do.Zhou Xun who plays Qing Nu on the other hand is perfect well in my eyes anyway all previous roles she had done Perhaps Love Suzhou River had proved her versatility. Here she is saccharine sweetness not pitiful nor sympathetic. In the little screen time she had she had shown a powerful character. Longing for her prince but not to the point of wimpy. In fact the purest form of acting as shown by Zhou Xun is not emoting by practiced expressions like Zhang but emoting by just a stare a look just the eyes told an endless tale.Ge You a respected actor proved once again that he is a great actor of his time. He was believable as the king in lust for his queen the old saying The kingdom or the beauty is well portrayed by Ge. Even that forced ending where he drinks the poison that the Empress bestowed him was quite heartwrenching and human really.Daniel Wu a brilliant young actor is sadly under used in this movie. His character proves too onedimensional and if not for the great acting Wu pulled off I would have said sheesh. Huang Xiaoming a new actor is someone to look out for handsome dashing and mostly great acting.As much as Hamlet is referenced and mentioned over and over again by literally everyone I don't see much of a resemblance. I can see the plot line being similar but then again isn't there like a million movies out there that has similar plots? Maybe I am just a sucker for period movies from the early 50s to recently but I can clearly remember many movies that has similar plot lines and story arcs. I find this movie even more similar to The King and the Clown the korean movie of 2005 Watch it... it is magnificent in the way they used theatre from the first scene to the end where they used theatre to tell the treachercous story of betrayal and usurped. The King and the Clown is probably the only period drama of that era from recent times taht is worth more salt then The Banquet. And anyone who enjoyed or thought that The Banquet sucked should watch The King and the ClownFeng XiaoGang whom I adore pulled off this wonderful epic the best in recent years. My only complain would be and that is true about almost every Chinese movie to hit the screens is the weak and anticlimatic ending of the 3rd act. This movie is adequate enough if they did not add that awful monologue that Miss ZHang goes into but it was quick to redeem itself with that Who killed the Empress ending. All in all an awesome movie with an awesome cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Moon is a Taekwondo master migrates from South Korea to Thailand with his five family members. One day Moon's family encounters a group of treasure thieves on the street and are soon involved in a fight with them. With their impressive martial art skills Moon's family is able to defeat the thieves and take back the stolen treasure. Pom the leader of the gang is the only one to escape and threatens revenge.Moon's family becomes more popular in the public eye not knowing when or where Pom will get his revenge.The actions scenes are topnotch as always you see in any Prachya Pinkaew film. However this lacks in the story and screenplay part. The comic relief is an advantage amongst the fast paced punches and kicks. Special mention to Taejoo Na Tae Yang Kyungsuk Kim Tae Mi  and Jeeja Yamin Wawa from Chocolate 2008 she has already impressed with her martial arts skills. It really creates havoc when comes to fights and will keep up you engaged if you really love these kinds of films.You need to watch it to the credits and you will know the real hard work of these actors.Recommended for all action lovers. My Vote 610".

	schema:reviewBody "A family of South Korean martial artists are on their way to a tournament when they inadvertently get involved in a plot to steal an ancient knife that is priceless but if I had to put a price on it I'd say it was worth about US33million. Anyway hailed as heroes for their intervention the family find themselves the target of the gang when they come looking for revenge.Having been really impressed by Jija Yanin Mitananda in Chocolate I had sought out other films with her in it  and the trailer for this one looked very good indeed. The reason for this is of course but it is full of clips of great physical feats and thankfully it is representative of the film in that it does have plenty of action and much of it very impressive. The skills of the main cast members is impressive and there are a few very well choreographed sequences. Problem is that the film itself is pretty poor and while some of the action compensates for this it really isn't what they deserve. The plot is weak and makes almost no sense. The delivery of the comedy is poor and the use of music is roundly terrible  particularly a fight sequence where a character dances his way through the villains. There are lots of things like this and it hurts the film  and I felt it even more when the really cool move or sequence came along to remind me what it was capable of.In terms of performances it is hard for me to judge because I watched a dubbed version. As with Chocolate I did love Yanin  she is stunning but physically her abilities are amazing she really needs a film that can support her. Wongkamlao was pretty funny here  previous films I have not always liked him but here he worked as comic relief. Korean Lee is a decent villain if you ignore that his character's motivations make pretty much no sense but his bodyguards were good. The rest of the family are mixed but I liked the son daughter and mother characters  the father and cute kid I could have done without. A weak film then but one that contains some great physical sequences  so good in fact that they really deserve a film that is better than this one.".

It does help a lot that I am a massive fan of Asian cinema to begin with.The Kick is however not really standing out in the Asian market of movies as there are far better movies out there. That being said don't get me wrong because I am not saying that The Kick is a bad movie far from it it is just doesn't stand out in a market of actioncomedy movies.The story is about a Korean family who honor the ancient Korean martial arts of Tae Kwon Do who live in Thailand. They end up getting mixed up in a web of abductions crime and gangsters as they are forced to steal a national Thai treasure if they want to have the youngest family member returned to them after being abducted.The Kick has a good variety of characters. Characters that are well portrayed on the screen and all have very different traits characteristics and personalities. And thumbs up for this because they really managed to put together a good group of people to portray these colorful characters. In that aspect then The Kick really does impress.However it is the overall storyline that sort of drags the movie down and fails to stand out with a lasting impression. And that is a shame because there is a lot of nice things to the movie. If you enjoy martial arts then there is a good display of that in the movie. And personally I found it to be a really nice treat to find JeeJa Yanin playing Wawa in the movie but also hats off to Kyungsuk Kim playing Tae Mi and Taejoo Na playing Tae Yang. As much as I don't like dancing then Taejoo Na managed some really impressive jumps spins and fighting in general.The Kick is sort of a martial arts movie for the entire family as it is not overly violent but has elements for all ages in the movie. There is action martial arts and comedy. This could very well be considered a Korean  Thai version of a Jackie Chan movie.".

JeeJa Yanin of Chocolate fame shows up about forty minutes into the film and helps the family kick butt. She's as awesome as ever. The teenage son of the family I think the actor's name is Kyungsuk Kim is an awesome martial artist  in the film he does a combination of taekwondo and hiphop dancing looking kind of similar to capoeira. I'd love to see this kid star in more movies perhaps more of them with JeeJa. The action is often awesome in this flick though I could have done without all the CGI in particular the awful CGI crocodiles. This film never showed up in Region 1 though it's been on the internet for a couple of years as have subtitles.".

But everything else that has come since has been a disappointment.Even with ONG BAK director Prachya Pinkaew on board and martial arts choreography from old timer Panna Rittikrai THE KICK is an underwhelming film. There's a storyline about the hunt for a priceless and ancient kris a type of eastern dagger but the main narrative is bogged down by the antics of an unlikeable Korean Taekwondo team who really drag things down. The reason for their inclusion is that this film was part funded by South Korea who obviously wanted a slice of Muay Thai for themselves.The problem with this is that we get the likes of Taejoo Na occupying most of the screen time. This Korean actor's acting is poor and his martial arts is little better and the bit where he does a hip hop dance to beat up the villains is a huge embarrassment. At least the reliable Petchtai Wongkamlao THE BODYGUARD is on hand to bring some laughs and the fantastic JeeJa Yanin CHOCOLATE stars in support as another fighter. But they really should have focused the story on Yanin alone and concentrated on doing great choreography and extensive fight scenes and then this would have been something special instead of weak and generic.".

Outskirts is Barnet's first sound film and a darker work though not as it is often described purely a serious one.The setting is the year 1914 first in a total backwater we never know exactly where this town is or if it's attached to something bigger it's one town out of a thousand in Tsarist Russia and then as war breaks out at the front as well.  The plot is simply a series of episodes initially comic though increasingly grim depicting the ordinary folk.  Though war is here and the great Soviet revolution is coming the movie seems to offer little more than a sardonic Russian shrug toward such events the people much more interested in love and clowning around.  Like some other early Soviet talkies Barnet makes a virtue of primitive Soviet sound technique by using sound expressionistically the difference between this and a film like Pudovkin's Deserter is that Barnet often uses sound to blow a raspberry at whatever grandiose thing is supposed to be happening.This vaguely avantgarde aspect has led a few critics like Jonathan Rosenbaum to call Outskirts an unknown masterpiece of cinema but it's a little too rough and awkwardly put together for the name to fit comfortably.  And more to the point a Soviet masterpiece is something grand and auspicious and this is a very different kind of film closer in spirit to some of Godard's playful and absurdist early films or to the casual working stiff's cynicism of 1960s Eastern European films like Menzel's Larks on a String which mocked the pretensions and promises of Soviet society but were careful not to get too specific lest the censor's hand come crashing down.  Actually in both cases the hand came down anyway Larks on a String was shelved for 20 years and Barnet apparently got in trouble for Okraina though by mid30s Soviet standards he got off lightly and at least continued to work for another 25 years before committing suicide in the Brezhnev era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Introduction Kuleshov was a genius and most of his students are worth getting to know about.Barnet was really the most inconspicuous of Kuleshov's cycle always quite apart from cinematic polemics raging at the time. He looked like a big lunkhead when we first see him as a cowboy in Kuleshov's Mr. West from '24. His first stab at directing assigned by his mentor as I read was a long serial on Fritz Lang territory about spies and counterspies and international intrigue except humorous and whimsical. He made another two silent comedies one of which I've seen very delicate and sweetnatured class conflict almost dainty blood.Now this about events leading up to the Revolution of '17 and so by nature more sombre and reflective. Eisenstein and Pudovkin had turned out rigorouslydriven paeans for the 10 year anniversary Barnet's is something else altogether.It is comedy about neighbors and brothers who are too stubborn to embrace true feelings searing drama in the next beat about these mutual feelings sublimated in the massive conflict of war. It bleeds and you laugh with a laughter that is sadness.It is plain fun to watch for the duration. There is sound but nowhere near as radical use as in Dezertir from that same year. Barnet was a much more gentle soul eventually took his own life  the story goes  because he could no longer deliver art on the level he aspired to.It's all in the ending here a true apotheosis of cinematic expression and one of the best moments in 30's film truly farreaching stuff. You have to do the work though it's not laid out in the open submerged further afield where censors wouldn't have the imagination to apprehend him.Two brothers have gone to war the father receives news from the trenches that one has died the young rash one. Meanwhile a German POW has returned in his place the same age also a shoemaker a worker and finds love in captivity the young brother was denied in an early scene on the same bench. The brother dead for a dubious cause has been surreally transmuted back home into a narrative that now turns vindictive cruel anxious  the German POW is summarily beaten by Russians persecuted. Barnet's coup is that these scenes depict a Revolution under foot a valiant cause in communist lore.Meanwhile the older brother is still at the front fighting the war. We hardly ever see the German enemy it's mostly exhausted soldiers futilely storming desolate no man's land. He calls off the bloodshed singlehandedly walking in the firing range and is summarily arrested by Russians as a traitor. The last news he hears is that the Winter Palace has been stormed. His response on the threshold of consciousness what a rush!.Barnet had Kuleshov's films to draw from on how to outwit the censors but he outdoes even his mentor here in his ability to envision a multidimensional fabric.".

	schema:reviewBody "The remarkable qualities of this early sound film pertain to it's stunning use of sound which is inventive and innovative by any and all standards the stunning camera movements and long takes. Just as remarkable is the storytelling which plays like a series of short stories and sketches rather than a novella or novel. Yet it doesn't break these short stories into segments or blocks or frame it unlike other attempts at multiple short narratives in a feature.The movement between the various segments and stories is very poetic like from one Greek chorus to another. The central conceit being between the conflict between the war frontlines and the homefront of the village. The scenes of warfare shown in this film is harsh and brutal in a way that anticipates Roberto Rossellini's or Samuel Fuller's later films.What makes it even more harsh is the sense of futility in the conflict. As the infantrymen who fight each other in the trenches have more in common than either would do with their civilian countryman anticipating Renoir's La Grande Illusion. One breathtaking scene is when one Russian soldier saves a German from getting bombed and then tells him after their initial celebration that he'll be their prisoner now.Equally moving is the tender love story between a Russian girl Anka and a German POW given permission to work in the village. This love story is made possible because Anka's father's friend Robert Karlovish a German taught her enough about his country to escape the xenophobia of that community at war. Also interesting is the sense of homoeroticism neither vulgar nor campy among the various male characters. Early in the film when the soldiers leave for the front there is a wonderful shot of two men kissing each other on the lips which is shown casually without any sense of sensation in the presentation of this scene. Barnet in his film shows that despite the conflict the violence the sense of division among his charactersall acted superbly conveying a naturalism absent in many early talkies there is always a brief glimpse of what things could be or should be.Even if for reasons of propaganda the film ends with the parade of saviour communists Barnet has managed to create a film that transcends that all the more by ending the film in a shot worthy of Dovzhenkoa key influence on this film where a character after hearing the arrival of the commmunists breathes close to death What a rush! and presumably dies offscreen. The world of this film belongs to people to human relations and not to party lines.".

The town the film begins in is struggling with the shocks and effects of war and the film follows those effects in multiple story lines. The ways that the war is used vary from a factory strike brought on by the harshness of the times to a young woman and her budding relationship with a German prisoner of war to the shoe factory strike to the soldiers at the front lines. As with many other Soviet films there are many semileading and leading characters and these film is constantly shifting between groups of characters and stories we are following. There are also tertiary characters being effected by the war as well. The transition from the more comedic parts to the horrors of war are quick and often very abrupt. The clumsiness of the story comes from the odd pacing with toolong bouts of time spent in the various places where the film takes place making it difficult to transition back to the other story lines easily. The film is clearly struggling to fit the appropriate criteria laid forth by the Soviet Union to tell the right story with the appropriate characters and the right messages. The stories we follow are compelling in and of themselves but the choppy pacing and the lack of technical finesse detract from the overall quality of this complex multilayered war film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was an interesting movie to watch due to the format of the film itself. Although the film summary talked about a love story between Anka and a German prisoner of war there was no mention of the rest of the cast who the story also centered on. It was less of a love story and more of a story about a small village and the people living there. Throughout the whole movie there is a struggle between the workers and the owners of the shoe factory in the town which reflects the national struggle at the time between the tsarist regime and the Bolshevik movement. Honestly this movie was slightly confusing. Yes it was very good at touching on a number of themes  how ideas can transcend national identities workers united and the greed of industry  but it went about it in a very confusing manner by jumping between different stories. It also seemed like the last 20 minutes of the film were rushed with the time skip and then trying to resolve the stories in a timely manner. Outskirts criticized the prerevolutionary government with its portrayal of the shoe factory owner. The factory owner is portrayed as a greedy industrialist who only sees the war as a way to make profit and does not care for his fellow workers. However this isn't made apparent until those last 20 minutes of the film. While the film is entertaining and contains typical party ideals it falls short in its presentation by trying to do too much at once.".

The movie takes place at the brink of World War I in the midst of a troublesome time for the prerevolutionary nation. There are even scenes of a strike at the start of the movie that alludes to some of the class struggles that were common during that point of time. A student of Kuleshov a famous director known for his experimentalist movement during early Russian cinema Barnet truly follows in his mentors footsteps in more ways than one. The film follows the stories of different characters who all hold different dynamics in their relationships with each other including two brothers in war longtime friends who become inherent rivals and two young lovers that come from opposing sides of the war spectrum. Their stories are well developed through the use of film angles and cutting the scenes in different segments that eventually lead to a chronological order that tie the character's together. The film has heavy comedic and depressing elements that make the characters stories that much more palpable.There are even some flashbacks that are used to emphasize the emotions that the character is having like the violent snap of the war as someone reads a letter announcing the death of a loved one. There are a couple of examples of communist ideology such as when the shoe maker stands up for the German prisoner who is also a shoemaker. The film was able to hold my attention to the very end. It was definitely an interesting watch.".

This series of subplots was entertainingit allowed for a lot of issues to be tackled the soldiers on the front and the POWs in the town provided a look at the war and some of the issues the Russian people were faced with during WWI. While it didn't even begin to show the incredible struggles and loss it did convey the feeling that the Russians did not want to be fighting the war. There was also the love story that did a good job of showing the common humanity between the Germans and the Russians. The series of subplots however were also quite confusing. None of the scenes really came full circle and a lot of them left me with more questions than I got answers. Even in the end when the revolution was beginning to come full circle the subplot method did more to confuse than anything. My other thoughts on this film are related to its ideological content. It doesn't seem to focus too much on ideology until the end and then it is sort of in a frantic way that tries to cram all of it into a very small period of time. This seems strange to me since it was made in 1933 the heyday of the party minded film. Despite some of the film's shortcomingssuch as the confusion it was still an enjoyable 90 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a lot of things at work in this film. They're not all necessarily working together but they're at work. This is often a serious war film but we still have horses talking and characters winking broadly at the camera for comic effect when need be. Under the umbrella of telling us about of small Russian town on the outskirts during a vital point in history we end up with a story about a small shoefactory that may or may not go on strike one about a German tenant in Russia and his landlord one about German prisoners of war held in the town and their search for work and one about a potential romance between one of the soldiers and the landlord's daughter  and that's before we jump ahead to 1917 for the last twenty minutes. Some of these subplots intertwine in interesting way but they all cannot. It's filmed with a very striking visual style and filled with memorable images even occasionally using a visual pun for a scene change but it still has the earlysound characteristic of moving fairly slowly. That wouldn't be a problem due to the interesting visuals except that it magnifies the scattered nature of the stories. At its heart the conflict of the landlord who is caught between affection for his tenant and nationalism turning him against Germans and later must deal with this again when he catches his daughter with the German prisoner is a touching one. It also allows for several conflicted and threedimensional characters in the midst of things. Jumping ahead to the revolution feels out of place and disjointed to this viewer but perhaps that was mitigated at the time by the fact that for the intended audience of this film this was a war at home that was well within living memory and it would have been very directly relevant to them. In all the film is imposingly made but doesn't come off all the way due to the fact that its matter is too scattered to make up one story but not as broadlens at it would have to be if it wanted completely to be the story of a town. But it's well worth a watch both for historical interest and for its commendable camera and direction work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boris Barnet's 1933 film Outskirts was created during a time when the only films acceptable for public Soviet cinemas had to obey the motto films for the millions. If it was not simplemindedly portraying Communism the Revolution or the Party's role in improving Soviet life it was not screened. Every viewer had to be able to understand their message about these themes. Although Outskirts did indeed depict Soviet class struggle its relationship with World War I and the Revolution it did so in a way that very few contemporary moviegoers could fully understand. I say this because even I a modern viewer with much more cinemawatching experience than the common Soviet citizens of the 1930s had trouble following the film. Its many subplots were allowed to run their respective courses with little to no connection at all and some of these subplots were not even adequately concluded. As a result Outskirts provides little more than a series of incomplete stories with confusing messages at the end.To get right into it the purpose of the German tenant at the Russian hotel is unclearother than to perhaps depict bourgeois indulgence through whimsical games of checkers why is he even in the film? All he does is play checkers get angry at the bourgeois Russian owner at the outset of World War I and leave without any further explanation. Furthermore although the role of the captured German soldier is more understandable in the film's goal in representing Communist ideology it was not concluded clearly at all. When the Russian shoemaker protected the German soldier as being a fellow shoemaker against the wounded Red Army soldiers he made a point about the fact that Proletarian struggles transcend national borders but what happened to the German soldier afterwards? Was he a convinced Communist? Did he fight again in the war? Outskirts failed to answer any of this.While all of this is going on there are even more subplotsthe relationship between the Russian shoemaker and his superior shoe factory owner with a large government order of boots his two sons who fought and died in the war an emerging love story between the Russian hotel owner's daughter and the captured German soldier and a final sequence where the shoemaker may have murdered the hotel owner during the Revolution. There is a point where as a viewer I have to say enough is enough. Although most of these do in fact represent Communist themes I feel that Outskirts was a desperate attempt to compress the entire Party's ideology into one movie. In my opinion the film's grand scope is what led to its confusing message and consequent failure.".

Realistic characters believably conveyed by the actors and full of great dialogue. There is no excess unnecessary fluff or overkill in this movie! All players carry their weight and are completely believable in their characterizations operating as one would expect normal people to communicate with each other with intelligence and humor. All of this serves to amplify Ned Beatty's Myerson character making him look all the more obnoxious  a lifelike caricature when compared to the other key players. This film is a creative alternative to the stale ridiculous explosions unnecessary violence and 'shoot em ups' seen in many movies. Every aspect of the movie compliments the story line it is shot on location in the natural settings of Europe and the U.S. which makes it visually attractive. There are no studio backdrops with dark unrealistic settings. It is unendingly interesting and can be seen many times a year without becoming old and tired. The only problem it has is the poor picture quality as film sometimes appears out of focus.Jackson and Matthau are brilliant foils for each other because despite their obvious age difference they are well matched by intelligence and wit therefore coming off as a believable pairing as players of equal stature eclipsing the obvious age issue altogether. This is a delightful movie has an apparent absence of Hollywood movie politics. This is one of the very best films I have ever seen for the all of above reasons.".

It's the type of film that one knows is not about winning awards the kind of film that is an actors film where everyone is comfortable with the material and appears to be having a great time. The lead role of Kendig is tailor made for Matthau ambling along at his own pace with a glint in his eye and a quip on his tongue Matthau carries the film with charming ease.

The twists and turns of just how he goes about this keep the movie moving and interesting. You want him to get away with it while humiliating the agency at every turn. He gets excellent from then wife Glenda Jackson and a young Sam Waterston. Too bad it's not available on DVD as the VHS tape isn't wide screen and isn't a great transfer.".

As to picture quality the movie was rereleased on DVD with a complete remastering of both picture fantastic! and sound good audio but still monophonic there's only so much you can do when the original is singletrack mono plus interviews with Ronald Neame D and Brian Garfield writer of the novel and coscreenplay a couple of years ago. The DVD is anamorphic widescreen so all the stuff that was panandscanned out of the VHS release is back just like it was in the theater. I bought two copies as soon as it was available and sent one to my brother who introduced me to this gem. One of my alltime favorites.Note to producers do NOT attempt to remake this picture. It would be folly. There are no actors on the planet who could pull it off. No one I mean NO ONE has the charisma and charm of Walter Matthau and the chemistry between he and Glenda Jackson isn't something you can fake. If anyone else had been the costars this picture would have disappeared completely. You wouldn't remake It's a Wonderful Life would you?".

I have to admit I liked the movie for the congeniality of Walter Matthau. While not as zany and original as the much earlier Charade also with Matthau Hopscotch shares a lot of the feel of that movie with villains who aren't quite villainous and a leading man who is part bumbling and part a step ahead of the game. The supporting cast is fun though just barelyboth of the key CIA guys after our hero are good actors at their best but they are not at their best here especially Sam Waterston in a wishywashy role. Most peculiar of all and almost scotchtaped into both the plot and the casting is very British and very different actress Glenda Jackson a former spy who chips in as needed and plays a growing role as things proceed.British director Ronald Neame who directed The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and The Odessa File is completely in charge here making the most of a middling script that uses well worn or barely surprising twists and gags to keep a potentially violent espionage film from ever leaving light comedy. Because in fact the pace is consistent and the filming under the eye of Arthur Ibbeteson also British is completely fine if nothing to write home about. In fact this feels like high budget British television which is something different than pure Hollywood. Or it might feel like 1960 Hollywood widescreen with minor updatesnot including the 1960s Hollywood star Mr. Matthau.But it is Matthau's movie fortunately. He can be a convincing bumpkin and a warm hearted fellow and he can be clever beneath his seeming simplicity. All of this is an advantage here and you are completely on his side as he thwarts with winks and tricks the supposedly superior forces of a full press CIA assault. Expect some fun and you won't be disappointed.".

The film also features Ned Beatty Sam Waterston and Herbert Lom. The film received an R rating due to the use of the F word by Ned Beatty's character.Matthau plays Miles Kendig a CIA operative who is demoted to a desk job after he doesn't do what his boss Myerson Beatty expected him to do. It's just as well with Miles  he's tired and he would like to get out but not before giving a kick to the shins of the organization. He announces that he's writing a book that will reveal a lot of behind the scenes stuff and scandals. Naturally everyone including the Russians want him terminated.Thus begins with the help of his girlfriend Jackson a game of hopscotch around the world as Kendig leads the powers that be on a merry chase. Aware that just about everything he touches is bugged he feeds operatives all sorts of information changes his name more than once rents planes flies commercial steals a police car and arranges for operatives to break into a hotel room where they think he is. In his greatest coup he calls his exboss from his exboss' house which is then blown to bits when there's an attempt to capture him  of course he's long gone.Both funny and dramatic you've really got your fingers crossed for Kendig and the film keeps you guessing as to whether he can get away from the CIA  and what his ultimate plan is as well how various elements fit in.Matthau is his usual implacable flippant self perfect for an operative and with the right temperament to try to escape CIA clutches. Jackson gives a classy smooth performance as his helpmate. Sam Waterston plays it straight amidst the comic elements as he attempts to bring this spy in from the warm and into the cold. Ned Beatty plays the boss like the buffoon that he is. Everything works together to make a wonderfully entertaining film.Highly recommended. Very clever and well acted. Of course there's nothing like seeing government operatives making fools of themselves.".

	schema:headline " Tale of Matthau's rogue CIA agent is a rather dull and boring affair";
	schema:reviewBody "You'll probably love 'Hopscotch' if you love Walter Matthau. It's really a one man show with the supporting cast playing second fiddle all the way to the late great thespian. The film dates back to 1980 during the height of the Cold War. Matthau plays Miles Kendig a veteran CIA agent who takes down a Soviet spy ring but declines to eliminate the leader of the operation his KGB nemesis Yaskov. Kendig has been friends with Yaskov for years and when his new boss at CIA headquarters Myerson played by an unpleasant Ned Beatty who continually employs the F word throughout the movie is angered by Kendig's refusal to eliminate Yaskov he transfers the veteran operative to the file room.Kendig then destroys his own file and takes off without telling anyone at the CIA where he is off to. He then meets with Yaskov who offers him a job as a double agent but Kendig regretfully declines. Yaskov then asks Kendig what he'll do with the rest of his life and when Kendig replies that he's uncertain Yaskov suggests that he write his memoirs. This is the impetus for the second act of 'Hopscotch' in which Kendig decides to take his revenge on his former employer by sending the first chapter of his memoirs to various spy agencies around the world including the CIA. The memoirs chronicle a long history of CIA 'dirty tricks' in which Myerson had a big hand. Myerson is bent on eliminating Kendig in order to prevent the big expose.The rest of Hopscotch involves a cat and mouse game where Myerson along with the operative who replaced Kendig Cutter ably played by a young Sam Waterson attempt to discover Kendig's whereabouts before he finishes his manuscript and has it published. Kendig ends up globe trotting including a trip to Myerson's house in Georgia where he places firecrackers inside the living room and then phones the CIA from Myerson's home phone. The FBI joins the CIA and they end up shooting up the house as the firecrackers go off. Kendig escapes by taking one of Myerson's bumbling operatives hostage driving off in a small truck since this is supposed to be a comedy no one ever tries to jump Kendig while he brandishes a gun knowing full well that he would never shoot anyone!.Nothing much else happens until the climax when Kendig rigs an old biplane to fly via remote control. As Myerson chases the biplane in a helicopter Kendig pushes a button and the plane explodes leading the CIA to believe that Kendig is no more it's not clear how Kendig makes it look like he never got into the plane. With the CIA no longer chasing him Kendig's memoirs becomes a bestseller and he walks off into the sunset with his old flame Isobel played by the now retired Glenda Jackson.We first meet Isobel at the beginning of the film where Kendig rekindles his old relationship with her in Austria. Unfortunately the chemistry between the two actors fizzles since they are never seen face to face until the end of the movie they communicate constantly via telephone. The same goes for all the other principals including Beatty and Waterston who have virtually no screen time face to face with Matthau there's a rather flat scene where Kendig ties Cutter up in a hotel room.If you're looking for many twists and turns you will not find it here in 'Hopscotch'. The whole thing is a rather pedestrian affair adapted from a popular novel whose screenplay did not translate very well into the intended visual tour de force. Hopscotch is also supposed to be witty and amusing but is undercut by the onenote nasty image of the CIA represented by the aforementioned unpleasant Myerson bent on taking down a rogue agent at any cost. The CIA's attempt to eliminate Kendig instead of capturing him ruins the otherwise whimsical tone of the film's narrative. On the other hand Waterson's 'Cutter' and Herbert Lom's 'Yaskov' are too warmhearted to have much effect on the proceedings as the story simply plods along.My late father a big classical music aficionado was a big fan of this movie and with a plethora of all that Mozart constituting the film's soundtrack I can understand why. Despite the endearing musical score Hopscotch's plot is a big dud as its protagonist's machinations do not prove to be very clever. If you're willing to give Hopscotch a 'pass' based on your love for Walter Matthau as Roger Ebert did in his 1980 review then you might deceive yourself into believing this is a wellwritten movie. It's not and in reality it's a rather dull and boring affair!".

	schema:headline " Staying one step ahead of the CIA in this Cold War comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot for Hopscotch is very simple. One of the top CIA field agents is being sent to a desk job until retirement. Walter Matthau plays Miles Kendig. His boss is of the Ivy League set and doesn't like the way Miles works. Ned Beatty plays boss Myerson. We don't like him right away. He's a jerk not as intelligent and he swears and cusses a lot. Miles won't take it sitting down and decides to go on the lamb. He destroys the CIA file on himself and through work contacts arranges for a few new IDs  passports and all. Miles contacts a former colleague and girlfriend to help him with parts of his plan. He wants to get back together with Isobel played by Glenda Jackson who is a welltodo widow now living in Switzerland. A couple of other main characters are Cutter a CIA agent who Miles trained and who is now in charge of trying to find him. Cutter likes Miles and tells the boss that he will be a step ahead of them all the way. The other character of substance is a Soviet counterpart to Miles whom Miles like and respects. Miles know how he thinks.. Herbert Lom plays Yaskov who also likes and respects Miles. Most of the film is about Miles eluding the CIA who pursue him around the globe. He is writing his memoirs and sending them a chapter at a time to the CIA and its counterparts in Moscow Peking London and Rome. Myerson wants Miles eliminated and maybe the other intelligence groups do as well. But Miles finds a publisher in London and his book becomes a best seller. As he sets in play each move Miles stays a step ahead of his pursuers. Until the very end with its unusual but not very surprising ending. The film is based on a book by Brian Garfield. In an interview that came with my DVD of the movie Garfield said he wanted to write a CIA story as an adventure and a comedy without the gore and killing. His screenplay kept to the book in that regard. He and Ronald Neame director talked about how Ned Beatty had to practice using his profanity because he wasn't that way in real life. That's the one thing that keeps this from being a movie for all ages. Another reviewer noted how the intrigue of the plot keeps one somewhat on edge for what comes next. We all pull for Miles and want him to succeed. The comedy isn't of the loud laughing type but is dry and subtle at times with some humorous situations. It's an enjoyable film but there's still something lacking about it. We don't see or know what Miles plans to do from one point to the next  and there's a sense that he doesn't have a plan. He even says something to that effect at one point. Yet his every move seems so methodically planned out. He moves too smoothly and almost nonchalantly between stops. He visits a forger. He flies to Switzerland. He rents a car. He drives to see Isobel. He flies to London. He visits a man for a job there. He flies to Washington. He drives to South Carolina. He rents a house. He hires an oil truck. He hires a plane and pilot. He flies to Bermuda. He flies to London. He hires buys rents and flies ad infinitum.The movie was shot in several locations  London Munich Salzburg Atlanta and other locales. In the interview that came with my DVD we learn that Matthau was cool on doing the filming portion in Germany. He is Jewish and lost several relatives who were killed by Nazi Germany during World War II. Ronald Neame explains how he got Matthau to come around. It involved giving parts in the film to some relatives. Mathau's son David Matthau plays CIA agent Ross. Lucy Saroyan daughter of Matthau's second wife plays the airline pilot Carla. Both tested well for their parts according to Neame and he said he made their roles conditional on Matthau's agreeing to the filming in Munich during the annual Oktoberfest there. This movie was made at a time when Cold War spy and espionage films were highly popular. It broke away from the usual suspense and mayhem with killing and gruesome scenes. It offers a light comedic touch to the otherwise dark and often seedy world of espionage. It's not a great or complex film but a light comedy that most adults should enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Hopscotch is lovingly photographed in many locations around the world and beautifully played by its stars Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson I could not quite get into it.Matthau plays a top CIA man who is stationed in West Germany and who has his corner of the Cold War down to a science. His opposite number for the Russians is Herbert Lom and they hold each other in mutual respect.That's not good enough for Ned Beatty the new guy in charge who after Matthau recovers secret microfilm from Lom Beatty wants to know why not terminate Lom. Matthau considers that kind of stupid because he and Lom know each other so well that if that ever happened and the Russians put a new guy in charge it would take him years to get know a new man's moves as well as Lom. In point of fact by the time this film was made the whole Cold War had settled into something like this.But Beatty's a true believer and he relieves Matthau. A move Matthau doesn't take lying down. He writes his memoirs and threatens to reveal all including a lot of embarrassing moments for the CIA. Beatty than makes it a crusade to get Matthau and Matthau with the help of girl Friday Glenda Jackson leads them on a merry chase on two continents.As ridiculous a fool as Beatty is made out to be in point of fact he's not wrong. But this was the Seventies the age of Watergate and as is said in the film National security is not the all embracing excuse it once was.As for the ending you'll find almost the same ending in Charley Varrick a movie that starred Walter Matthau that I liked a lot better.".

In addition to the thousands of male employees there are also 187 underpaid women machinists who primarily assemble the car seat upholstery in poor working conditions. Dissatisfied the women represented by the shop steward and Rita O'Grady work with union rep Albert Passingham for a better deal. However Rita learns that there is a larger issue in this dispute considering that women are paid an appalling fraction of the men's wages for the same work across the board on the sole basis of their sex. Refusing to tolerate this inequality any longer O'Grady leads a strike by her fellow machinists for equal pay for equal work. What follows would test the patience of all involved in a grinding labour and political struggle that ultimately would advance the cause of women's rights around the world.";

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing that strikes you about this movie is that it looks and feels like ancient history. In fact it is based on the real life happenings in 1968  only about 40 years ago. Sally Hawkins so wonderful in HappyGoLucky portrays Rita O'Grady the Ford sewing machinist who reluctantly takes on the leadership role in the battle for equal pay for women.Director Nigel Cole tells this story minus the heavyhandedness of the times. In fact it's a very entertaining tale of right vs wrong  because that's how we have always done it. He uses actual archival footage of Ford plants cars and workers as well as general footage of England circa 1968. These cuts give the film a feel for the times and prevent any overanalysis of wardrobe and sets in the movie. Mr. Cole clearly has an understanding of women based on this film and his previous work in Calendar Girls.The crossfire between the unions Ford the workers and the government really bang home the notion of just how ridiculous this entire argument was and is. Rita O'Grady was so effective because she cut through the muck and made it what it really is ... a simple case of right vs. wrong. Rights vs. privilege. This was never more apparent than in her meeting with Secretary of State Barbara Castle Miranda Richardson. Madam Secretary is attempting to negotiate a settlement that will keep Ford happy but quickly realizes ... with help from O'Grady ... that there is really only one correct course of action.Supporting work is excellent from Bob Hoskins Ms. Richardson Daniel Mayes as O'Grady's husband Rupert Graves and Rosamund Pike husband and wife on different teams and the rest of the cast of women as well as the Ford executives and Union leaders. The film mostly rests on the shoulders of Sally Hawkins who breezes through with a natural energy that just makes you want to pull for her. She was terrific in HappyGoLucky and even better here.The film stops short of detailing the massive battle that escalated the following year between Secretary Castle and the Labor Unions. Most attribute these fights to the downfall of the Labour Party in 1970. However Ms. Castle's contributions are very clear in these all important topics and led directly to England's Equal Pay laws of 1970 which in turn paved the way for most other countries to follow.This is a very uplifting film and shows the bravery and determination required of those who change the course of history. Whenever you hear talk regarding the lack of strong female movie roles this film is exhibit number one that fact can be even stronger than fiction!".

	schema:reviewBody "Made in Dagenham has brilliantly broken the mould. It combines the clear explicit and nuanced politics of the best of Ken Loach with the heartgrabbing attractions of any mainstream popular film you care to name. The brilliant scene where Sally Hawkin's modest and unpractised union rep spells out why the job she does is skilled is a metaphor for the whole movie. Politics isn't hard to understand  it's our lives stupid! I cannot think of a previous British film with a mainstream aesthetic that has had the guts before to put the ordinary workers' point of view so wholeheartedly at its centre. But this is no simplistic idealised narrative. Going on strike as the women find makes you very unpopular not least with the very people you'd thought would support you  the Union leadership and your fellow male workers. Nothing is a cinch nothing too easily won and Sally Hawkins brilliantly portrays the thorny predicament of the figurehead of the struggle beginning to doubt her own singlemindedness and how much it's costing not just her family but the entire town and possibly the UK's working community. Made in Dagenham shows a true story in a truthful thoroughly engaging way. There is not one bum note in any of the performances  from Kenneth Cranham's sleazily compromised Union official to Rosamund Pike's surprisingly moving posh wife to Jamie Winstone's wannabe model  everybody has a committed credibility without ever being worthy or cloying and Sally Hawkins with a startling look of the young Rita Tushingham plays a richly layered blinder in the central role. Huge hats off to the writer Billy Ivory who has written a bright funny completely unpatronising and clever script. And a big big thank you to producers Stephen Woolley and Elizabeth Karlsen for the guts to get right inside the truth of this big big story that started in a little place.".

It is well written apart from a couple of modern expressions in the dialogue. It is brilliantly acted the settings costumes and clothes are excellent. It took my attention at all times and I was sorry when it came to an end. The women really gave the impression of being genuinely good mates. I hope the working conditions for them in Ford's were not quite so cramped as the film portrayed! I worked in a clothing factory in Witham Essex in 1968 and there was room to walk round all the sewing machines and we kept it immaculately clean. It's a pity equal pay still isn't quite there in spite of legislation. That old trick of changing the jobtitle to keep the payrate down perpetuates! I have just read the other reviews. I notice Richard Schiff mentioned a lot... not sure who he is or what he played in the film but I also note the more negative reviews are written by men which illustrates the point of the film has well and truly got home. Something I found to be most refreshing in this film is the characters which I would describe as normal... It was not about people who are constantly saying fk and are late for posh weddings. Nor was it about people who work for or know a prime minister and meet up when they go to the local comprehensive school nativity play. As for hot pants appearing... these girls were machinists... they would have made their own clothes... we all did. My sister made a very short pair of bright yellow shorts in 1963. We've got the Super 8 film of her wearing them to prove it!".

A sparkling performance from Sally Hawkins as Rita the leader of the group is complemented by excellent performances from the whole cast including Bob Hoskins Geraldine James and Jaime Winstone.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1968 women at the Ford car factory in Dagenham UK went on strike to be reclassed as skilled workers it lead to further action demanding equal pay. The women were responsible for making the seats covers and after a while as they were on strike the covers ran out meaning car production had to stop and the whole factory came to a stand still. The women and the unions were at loggerheads for some time as orders came in from the headquarters in the US. Eventually with the secretary of state involved the demands were eventually met leading to a change in laws and better rights for women across the industrial world.This is a fascinating story perhaps even more so in today's society when woman's rights are much better. It is a very 'British' film but a very well made one with a superb cast including Sally Hawkins and Miranda Richardson. There are some wonderful relationships in the film most of them are effected immensely by the events and it is these deeper moments that are quite moving. The story is the real highlight of the film it is a remarkable story that really does prove determination is everything. The film recreates the late 1960's very well occasionally using real stock footage which gives it a more authentic feel. It is interesting to see how the reactions this caused from the unions and the Ford Corporations dismissal of the women as well as the anger as once the men are on strike and the pay stops.A real turning point and a industrial landmark the film provides not only an uplifting entertaining story but a history lesson. The short snippets of interviews of some of the actual women at the end are wonderful although maybe too short.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Made in Dagenham";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some things we take for granted in this day and age and it's always interesting to see how far we've come. Made in Dagenham is a delightful and engrossing film about one of the origins of that fight for pay equality amongst the womenfolk in the UK from what had started out as a simple walk out in a small town to a movement that would have taken the country and probably much of the industrial world by storm.A dramatization of the 1968 strike at Ford's plant in Dagenham William Ivory's screenplay didn't trivialize the tussle and fight between the workers and the unions that were perceived to represent their interest and finally the employers themselves in what would cover both the micro aspects of such an industrial action to a wider macro economic focus with politicians and prominent business people thrown in the mix. And it is this macro aspect that I found to be refreshing because it links everything up very nicely albeit simplistically to show how businessmen and politicians make for strange though necessary bedfellows when talking about and dealing with the economy.It's a reminder that we shouldn't take bread and butter issues for granted today when there is much talk about fairness and equality at the workplace although unions here are something quite unheard of yes they exist but.... It's a ringside seat to how organized class action down at the workers level can help to galvanize woes into action by employers to improve their workers lot be it conditions or renumeration though Nigel Cole's film also covers how unions and their leaders can be corrupted and enticed to keep the status quo or to promise lip service to drag things out a little bit longer.At its core it would seem it's about pay equality with a group of female machinists responsible for putting together the upholstery for Ford's cars off the assembly line and being awakened by Albert Passingham Bob Hoskins to the possibility of success should the women band together to make their demands heard. And the initial demands were actually very simple and they don't need a rocket scientist to realize that working conditions have to be improved. Treating workers with respect is probably fundamental to a happy work force which will likely spiral more positives for a company but mistreat and undermine your workers then it's a course that's set for disaster.So we learn of how the Ford motor company had to deal with such unpleasantness in engaging spokesperson not on their payroll or influence and how best and fair practices have evolved from decades ago to what would be a marked improvement we see in the workplaces of today with some minor spotlight put on the wheelings and dealings involving cocky corporations. But the larger picture comes from having the courage to stand up and be counted and fight the good fight for what's right instead of being satisfied with the status quo and accepting being spoken down to. Societal mindsets involving the role of women also get a look into through the introduction of the minor character played by Rosamund Pike.On the micro level this story deals with how women have their work cut out for them when they're out in the workforce and yet having a family to take care of when back home. It's never an easy juggle and more of a struggle really especially when the money isn't coming in the debts are mounting and relationships get strained. Even on a normal day we witness how the sole responsibility for the kids become that of the mom's and adding some complexity to the equation is how the husband tries but fails miserably to take on that additional household role. You may disagree with me but the role of a woman in society these days isn't exactly a walk in the park.Some have argued that Sucker Punch isn't really about the empowering of women so I guess this film fills that void through its embodiment of Girl Power. It's an incredible film that deserves to be seen by a wide audience and it goes into my shortlist as one of the best on offer this year. Highly recommended so don't let this slip you by as it's only screening in a limited number of halls.".

	schema:reviewBody "A strike by female workers which led to the introduction of the Equal Pay Act in the UK and similar legislation in other countries is the subject of 'Made in Dagenham'. The film provides a spirited and partisan though generally believable account of the women's struggle and a portrait of 1960s life a long way from the classical image of swinging London. There's some melodrama and a comic book portrayal of Harold Wilson but it's generally a convincing and ultimately uplifting story and an unusual one for modern sympathies in that the trade unions are more or less shown fighting the good fight. However in highlighting a struggle against such an obvious injustice the film only partially makes a more general point that unionism is always ugly in that it concerns the promotion of a sectional interest to the detriment of the whole but can still be a good thing if the section it represents cannot otherwise be heard. When that section is as large as 50 of the population the point seems obvious but it's just as true when the interest is narrower but still neglected. The film's credits are shown interspersed with interviews with some of the women involved and it did make me wonder if a documentary might not ultimately have proved more enlightening. Overall though the film did its job of showing how our world has changed in the last 40 years and in some ways for the better.".

Added to the terrible working conditions the women were paid wages that were so low it was a miracle they were able to subsist on such meager income. Rita O'Grady one of the most outspoken workers decided enough was enough. The year was 1968. The union organizer Albert Passingham saw in Rita a powerful ally for he felt she was fearless against what the company was doing. It was easy for Rita to get started as she and the other ladies decided they have had it so they decided to protest against what they saw as a clear act of discrimination against them for the simple fact of being women who would not dare to protest against the mighty company.Sally encounters all sorts of obstacles piled against the women workers. She and her comrades decide to strike asking the men to join their protest. The result was a power struggle like no one seen in the country because it was a question of equality for women who demanded what was only proper and right equal pay for equal work. Sally gets an unexpected ally from the wife of a Ford executive and from a Labor minister Barbara Castle. They proved to be invincible because in spite of their trouble they remained together in their aspirations for equality.Made in Dagenham directed by Nigel Cole evokes other films of the genre. Norma Rae and North Country both American made reminded us never to underestimate a resolved woman whenever she decides to put an end to an oppression. William Ivory's screenplay plays well as he documents the details of the 1968 incident. It is basically a document about that era what emerges in this positive and inspiring film.The film owes a great deal of gratitude to its star Sally Hawkins who keeps getting better and better all the time. Her winning personality and screen persona go hand in hand in every project she is employed. Her Rita is a wonderful creation. Bob Hoskins appears as the union organizer working together with the women and feeling their pain. Geraldine James has a pivotal role as well as Rosamund Pike the neglected wife of the Ford executive. Miranda Richardson is wonderful as Barbara Castle the Labour minister who joined the women in their cause.".

Poor Rupert Graves  no wonder he telephoned that performance through! The only real representation of male macho and chauvinism comes from the US Ford manager and UK workers on newsreel  a real cop out.But there are nudges and winks which work well  no more than Rosamund Pike's clothes and home. She plays a first class honours graduate from Cambridge locked into a traditional married woman's role who takes a lot of interest in brands and designer home luxury  again more 2010 than 1968!!!!

The comic dialogue is grounded and placed in a realistic situation like the raunty woman on the factory floor to many conversations throughout the film. With Cole's direction the film was able to balance the comedy with the serious drama and makes the issues its raising engaging. There are fine examples of showing a complex picture like the people who are meant to support the women strikers are themselves sexists who look out for their male members. There is a really tragic performance from Roger LloydPack who is known as a comic actor who adds some harsh reality to the film. Cole's direction is a colourful and positive for most of the time. David Arnold gives the film an upbeat 60s soundtrack and whilst Cole focuses on a more romantic view of the period with hot pants women's liberation and partying.Audiences will leave with a smile on their faces.".

Trouble is this makes it a Jack  Jill of all trades and mastermistress of none. It is at the end of the day a superficial treatment of a ground breaking industrial dispute. The best you learn is that Ford employed 44000 people in the UK at the time and it was only 187 women they refused to give equal pay to. That makes Ford's threat to take their manufacturing business elsewhere because of the additional costs associated with paying the women their dues very hollow...as shallow as this film. Nevertheless there is some great character acting from Miranda Richardson John Sessions Kenneth Cranham Bob Hoskins and a very slimline Richard Schiff you know....him off West Wing".

The best you learn is that Ford employed 44000 people in the UK at the time and it was only 187 women they refused to give equal pay to. That makes Ford's threat to take their manufacturing business elsewhere because of the additional costs associated with paying the women their dues very hollow...as shallow as this film. Nevertheless there is some great character acting from Miranda Richardson John Sessions Kenneth Cranham Bob Hoskins and a very slimline Richard Schiff you know....him off West Wing";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1968 the women at the Ford auto plant in Dagenham England go on strike. As sewing machine operators making the coverings for car seats their jobs have been reclassified from semiskilled to unskilled. A friendly shop steward tells strike leader Rita that this isn't about whether they are skilled or not. They're getting paid less because they are women and unless they change things they will always make less than the men do. The women walk off the job and eventually the plant runs out of car seats with the entire plant threatening to shut down. With the men nearly out of work it's left to Rita to convince them they need the support of all worker to succeed. The intervention of a senior government Minister who takes up their cause despite a heavy handed response from Ford clears the way for a solution and leads to legislation on equal pay for work of equal value.....I can imagine there is a fair demographic of men who will hate this film with a vengeance and to be fair it's portrayal of men comes across pretty typecast we all want our dinner on the table we all go to the pub after work and we all treat women as lesser people as seen when Rita complains to the teacher or whenever Pike is on screen.But this little typecasting is intricate to the plot and makes the womens journey that little bit more forfilling and making you say 'go on girls' in your head that little bit more.It's a phenomenal movie with some great performances but Sally Hawkins really makes the film the emotional feast it is. Not only does Rita happen to accidentally run the strike but she has to contend with abuse on the street and a husband who cannot cope with the change to his activities of daily living.Pike has never been better and Richardson also puts in a great performance as the minister who made it all happen for Rita and the girls.All in all it's pretty old fashioned with the way men are portrayed here but as i've said before it's vital to the plot so I won't complain too much.".

The two Civil Servants were ridiculous Harold Wilson was laughable and as for Lisa Hopkins  well there is no way such a clever lady would've married such a ninny of a husband. The movie is set in MayJune 1968 and it's a pity more care wasn't taken to ensure the period detail was spot on. Mostly it's OK but some elements aren't quite right e.g. Hot Pants were an early 70's fashion. Nice to see 'Sooty' again though! The film has all the look and feel of a TV movie and is utterly predictable in its mix of humour and tragedy. Sally Hawkins is excellent as the leader of the women strikers out for equal pay with their male colleagues at the Ford motor plant.Bob Hoskins also does well and gets to deliver one line reminiscent of Harold Shand in 'The Long Good Friday'. It's just a pity that in portraying the women as strong saltoftheearth characters the men have to be seen as caricatures.".

But another classic of British underdog dramacomedy is assured with a typical combination of ebullient acting and homegrown pride for the episode. This is a film that will travel across the pond with ease full of the conviction and style of the 1960s without all the Union Jackmini cooper trappings.The protofeminism at its heart is neither threateningly radical or tiresomely hippie but strangely genderless. Sally Hawkins' Rita is a pitch perfect lead the distillation of gigglygirl roles for Mike Leigh and the longsufferinglyespoused counterweight to the mild hedonism of An Education. It's this that fights through the Full Montygrade set pieces to really convince the viewer. In this she's joined by the discreetly exquisite Geraldine James and the humourveiled fire of Bob Hoskins.Danny Mays usually a favourite of mine is adequate in his role as the husband caught between the tectonic plates of cultural change at his doorstep  in the same but opposite way I think the huge presence of Richard Schiff is almost too much in a film where the tonal emphasis is more on pluck than the gravitas of people consciously undertaking to change their world. Miranda Richardson has the balance just right other important actors Rupert Graves Rosamund Pike Roger LloydPack and Kenneth Cranham excel in the same ensemble fashion as Geraldine James. Two hours gone by in a feelgood flash. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most captivating love stories I've ever seen on film. It starts with a young woman Katya played by Vera Alentova reporting to her Worker's Dormitory friends that she has flunked by two points the exam to get into university. It ends with the most incredible sweetness of life.It is like a French film done by a Russian company which is what it is. The Moscow we see that does not believe in tears does believe in love and it is not a Moscow of politics although some people do call one another comrade. This is a woman's point of view film a chick flick that transcends any genre cage. It begins slowly almost painfully dull in a way that will remind the viewer of all the clichs about Russia the unstylish dress the worker's paradise that isn't the sharp contrast between Moscow and the peasants who live outside the city. Katya works in a factory. She works at a drill press. She is obviously underemployed. Lyudmila Irina Muravyova works in a bakery. She is probably gainfully employed for the time and place. They are friends twentysomethings who are on the make for a man but not a man from the sticks. They pretend to be university post docs or something close to that and they impress some people as they housesit a beautiful Moscow apartment.This is how their adult life begins in a sense. Lyudmila falls in love with an athlete Katya becomes infatuated with a television cameraman. One thing leads to another and before we know it they are forty. Neither relationship worked out. The athlete becomes an alcoholic the cameraman in the sway of his mother believes that Katya is beneath him once he finds out that she works in a factory. How wrong he is of course.But no more of the plot. I won't spoil it. The plot is important. The characterizations are important. The story is like a Russian novel in that it spans lots of time but once you are engaged you will find that the two and a half hours fly by and you will perhaps like me say at the end What a great movie! My hat is off to director Vladimir Menshov and to Valentin Chernykh who wrote the script and to the cast. I've mentioned Vera Alentova and Irina Muravyova but Aleksey Batlov who played Gosha was also excellent. I don't want to say anymore. Just watch the film. It is one of the best I've ever seen.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

There were the normal problems of living in Moscow particularly for the 3 young women trying to make it under very difficult circumstances. The things they do particularly Lyudmilla are funny and yet give us a glimpse into how difficult it must have been for them. Katya the main character goes through her trials but comes out on top. She does better than anyone else out of the 3 even raises a daughter without a husband but she secretly longs for a man in her life. After many failed attempts are relationships she accidentally meets the man who turns out to be the perfect one for her. However they too go through some struggles before coming to the final realization that they belong together. It is a wonderful story of struggles successes and life in general. The acting was wonderful particularly the actress who played Katya. Her young daughter Alexandra was adorable. The scene I liked the most was Gosha invites Katya and her daughter to a picnic to get to know each other better after declaring that he is going to marry Katya. Katya is tired and she just falls asleep in a chair in the fresh air. Gosha gently puts a blanket on her. Very simple but very caring and touching. There are many wonderful moments in the movie. The humor is sprinkled throughout and it is very refreshing to see a movie like this one. The most valuable thing to me was it gave a glimpse into life in the USSR and yet we can relate to the story and the characters on a human level.".

They try to talk things over at a park bench but he just leaves.Twenty years later the movie focuses on Katya's redemption one might say. She is now the director at the factory and even gets to drive to work practically unheard of in the USSR and her daughter Alexandra is doing quite well. Granted Katya's successful in her public life but what about privately? It looks as though her personal life will remain empty until she meets one Gosha Alexei Batalov an honest outspoken perceptive fellow. She does meet Rudolph again  and this time he's going by his real name Rodion he called himself Rudolph because western names were popular in the '50's  but she leaves him at the bench.This movie makes an interesting use of duality. There are two meetings in the park RudolphRodion leaves Katya the first time but she leaves him the second time. RudolphRodion makes two speeches about how TV is the wave of the future and will eliminate theater movies and books. There are two trips to the countryside. Katya twice falls asleep crying. Katya is twice filmed for a TV interview by RudolphRodion she's working at the factory the first time and she's the director the second time. And finally there are two scenes where people dance to Besame mucho. And watch how they use the alarm clock in the middle of the film.Among other things how Gosha and RudolphRodion bond at the end is classic for Soviet cinema. And we get to see remnants of the '50's and '70's that even we in the west can understand as teenagers the girls swoon over movie stars and their socks looked kind of like bobby sox and people wear colorful clothes in the '70's. A classic in every sense of the word.".

It even won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1980. It's just one of those films where everyone involved in making it contributed to a result that delivers on all fronts. If the acting or the direction was worse then the result could have been another forgettable drama. Soviet filmmakers however specialized in drama films. This is because of the restrictions that were put on them by the government. Many good dramas were released during the Soviet period and Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears is one of the most memorable.

To understand the comedy in what appears to be a story of feminist angst you need to be Russian.  There is no other way to see it.  We don't see that the supposed conflict between between the heroine and her lover is that she is a manager and he is not.  It's much more primal than that.  It is because she EARNS more than he does.  Women held managerial positions in the USSR since they first began driving tanks and tractors during the second world war.  Most of us are brought up to believe that we can do just about anything and a lot of the time we have to.  So please if you see this film remember to laugh.

The acting is also brilliant and after seeing this movie several times each another time makes me thinking again about my and our life and also about the type of the gender relationships which concerns lies.The story begins in the late 50's and the first part concerns the lives of the characters at their early 20's. Then the film jumps about 20 years forward and the second part concerns the lives of the characters at their late 30's or early 40's. The first time you see this movie most of the interest is how did the lives changed over the 20 years and what kind of an end the movie has. But it turns out that almost every scene and cite play an important role there and after seeing it a few times I noticed that the movie is not just about the tales of the three girls and how does lives change.For example each of the parts is built by a pattern where the first half tells about the lives of the three girls and the second half tells about Katya's main character's relationship with a boyfriend. In each of the parts the relationship isn't built in a pure way since Katya must hide some facts about her and even lie to make sure everything will go on I think this is the reason for making Gosha a macho man and seeing it again you may find out what makes him behave like that. But in the two parts there are different kind of lies and relationships and I think that makes the writer to put different endings at the parts. Although the first part has a sad end what also reflects Katya's life further in the second part the relationship doesn't break after Katya's boyfriend finds the truth about her.Besides this example there are many other topics about life which this film concerns. Seeing it enough times makes you sure that Gosha isn't as awful as he seems to be at the first time you see the movie his past is barley mentioned but when you find it out it clears the scene where he meets Nikolay and what will be afterwards and therefore the ending may be concerned good.Again this film may be watched again and again in a very entertaining way and each time telling you more about the plot.

	schema:reviewBody "This film makes one wonder what exactly the heroine worked so hard for.  A young girl from a small town comes to Moscow and becomes pregnant.  Her lover repudiates her the lover's mother humiliates her telling her that she is not a good fit for her bigcity dandy son.  Rather than leave Moscow and go back to her parents or try to perform an abortion on herself the heroine has the baby.  She works hard at the factory getting up at 5 AM every morning passes grueling entrance exams into college becomes an engineer  all while raising her little girl as a single parent and an unwed mother.  Bold subject matter for a Soviet movie made in the seventies.Then  a compromise the heroine who sixteen years after her ordeal has a good life a good home and a prestigious managerial job falls head over heals for a man who treats her like dirt.Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears was made almost at the same time as the equally celebrated Workplace Romance Sluzhebnyj Roman and they are in a sense competitors.  Both movies are about single women in their mid to late thirties who made a brilliant career but were never married.  Both heroines are presented as strongwilled independent individuals in managerial positions whose lives are nevertheless missing something.  But if Sluzhebnyj Roman says that life is incomplete without love Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears says that life is incomplete without a man.Women of the older generation are all in love with Moscow's main male character  the heroine's ultimate husband.  I cannot fathom why  the actor's cute but his character is unnerving.  One does not need to be a feminist to have a strong urge to throw this man down the stairs.  He stifles every impulse of individuality in her he presumes to know what she wants what's proper for her and what's not he patronizes her he pushes her around.  On the train he begins their acquaintance by commenting You have the eyes of a woman who is not married. What kind of eyes are those? I cannot see why one would find any charm in such familiarity and cocky selfassurance from a stranger.It's worth noting that the corresponding character in Sluzhenyj Roman  an excessively mildmannered shy man  learns to stand up to the bossy heroine but does so without disrespecting her.  The character in Moscow on the contrary puts the heroine in her proper place  which is to be quiet and follow orders.I think that a Western critic would perceive the ending of Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears as ironic and sad.  The heroine a woman who spent her life making something of herself by overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles is last shown fussing around her kitchen for the benefit of a man who was not with her on that long journey who dares to raise his voice at her in her own home while eating her food and who acts as if his very physical presence at the table confers a rare privilege  on a woman whose clock is ticking.".

There is not much to this movie if we compare it with fast paced action thriller of Hollywood or intense drama but instead this is a simple movie of three women friends in general or more specifically of Katerina who is a hard working women then successful women unmarried mother and raises her well too. So this movie starts with the friendship of three women characters then shows how their lives are changed when two gets married and other didn't as she got pregnant and her boyfriend left her and then goes to their later stage of lives when they are not young any more and how their lives have changed. In short I can say it is kind of character study from start to end as characters grow at every segment of the movie like in the beginning they are in hostel having fun partying and all working then get married become mother and then later stage when one is successful but not that lucky in love other lucky in love others having mixed life. Acting by the main character is very good and believable as fun loving girl traditional at times working women working in factory with men's and even better at her job than others she even repairs the machines mother and at the end lover. Other casts too are good and works well. Direction is good too. I think the reason for me liking this movie is its simplicity in the story the way it is presented in down to earth characters one someone can relate to easily. So if you like such movies then you might like this one. Watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films from a Communist nation can be Propaganda but this is a Fairy Tale and Novella in the idea of so many Mexican Telenovellas that have been shown in Russia. This Film deserved its Oscar and Vera Alentova as Katya is wonderful let alone her being a beautiful Lady. The story begins in Moskva Moscow in 1958 and Katya is a student who failed her Finals and her roommates are Lyudmila and Antonia. This story talks about the decisions that they made at a young life and how they haunted them as Katya came out Pregnant and Lyudmila married a future Drunk who still cling ed on to her even after they divorced. Antonia married and had children when Katya raised her daughter Alexandra alone but longed a relationship. She finds it in a man named Gosha and falls madly in love with him but they get into a Fight and for a matter of days Katya is desperate to find him. Antonia's husband finds Gosha and become the finest of friends with it ending happily for Katya as her Knight in Shining Armor stays with her forever. The songs are wonderful and the actresses of Irina Muravyova  who played Lyudmila and Raisa Rayazanova who played Antonia were amazing. The Film has many scenes of Moskva in many parts of the residential parts of the city as well as the countryside. When I think of this Film and as wild as this is I think of various Bryan Adams songs for his idea of Songwrighting is romantic and Blues saturated. Russia is a land of Blues through and through for especially today Moskva can be as mean as Chicago and Saint Petersburg is the same despite their beauty for Chicago is also beautiful but cruel and the trials and tribulations of the three Girls in the story are a perfect setting for Adams' Songs.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Oscar winning Russian film from 1979 begins the action in 1958 when we get to know three young women who have come from the provinces to study in Moscow and are now living in a student's residence. While they are studying they work in blue collar factory jobs but dream of escaping that life by marrying some powerful men. When a professor asks them to take care of his nice apartment while he's traveling they see this as a perfect opportunity to impersonate women of higher status than they are and woo some eligible man into the apartment. One of the girls woos a famous athlete another named Katya who eventually becomes the center of the movie and is played by the beautiful Vera Alentova gets involved with a cameraman in the then new medium of television. Eventually Katya gets pregnant from the encounter with him and when he realizes that she is a factory girl instead of a professor's daughter decides to have nothing to do with her he is in part afraid of the rejection of his snobbish mother and the subtext of this of course is that the Soviet Union was far from a classless society. She thinks about aborting her baby but eventually gives birth to a daughter and decides to raise her alone.The movie then cuts to twenty years later. While her friends have married but remain trapped in a drab working class life Katya has remained single but has prospered professionally. She is now a director in a factory a prestigious job in Soviet times and lives in a nice apartment with her daughter who is now a young woman. Despite her professional success Katya is still looking for love though she usually ends up in doomed affairs for instance when she gets involved with a married man. Eventually she finds a promising prospect with Gosha a masculine blue collar worker she finds on the train. But just when the relationship starts to develop the long forgotten cameraman reappears in her life.One of the interesting things of this movie is to get a glimpse of Soviet life at the late Brezhnev era a time of relative prosperity Sometimes the director goes for the easy reaction of the public and modern audiences might not always approve of some of the cultural mores. But this is an interesting and entertaining film if somewhat overlong two hours and a half.".

This film bears as much resemblance to Soviet Russia as 'Midnight Cowboy' resembles America. It became controversial because it accepted officially that a woman's life in the Soviet Union was not perfect. Duh?Nevertheless the music at the beginning is great Alexandra Alexandra... and the film is simply good fun if you're curious about Soviet life. Any Russian born in Soviet times will enjoy it. If you have an older Russian visiting and you want to be a good host mention this film or make it available. A cure for homesickness. In 100 years will Russians or anyone else watch this film? Maybe but I suspect that a Russian filmmaking Emile Zola will appear between now and then. And anyway there are better film records of Soviet life.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing I got from this movie was its honesty. I think this is a pure piece of cinema and I don't know if this is true but I suspect the movie shows exactly what the director meant to and that's why I say it is honest.I am from Portugal therefore a western and so there were some attitudes and things in the characters lives that I found at first strange and inadequate even 23 years ago and so this movie was a good document for me to understand a bit more of the great russian people.The movie debates many questions moral questions social questions inserted in a different society from mine which presents diferent solutions and different postures in front of the problems. So we have the typical case of the single mother with all her difficulties to be accepted and to suceed. But the message of the film comes in the end. She doesn't do what the public would like her to do which would be either to remain single or to marry only if she really loved the husband and him to her. She doesn't do that. She marries in the end a man who is not what we might call an ideal man quite far from that. He is a machist guy who what's to rule her wife. But maybe that's the true happiness for her since she spend a hole life alone fighting against rejection for being alone with a child maybe she now just wants to enjoy a married life to do now what was the concept of a normal life when she was young. Or maybe not... Maybe she has just stopped fighting and left herself into the hands of a man who not being perfect is at least a man. There is a third option which is what I think it's right she loved the man she even said he had no bad things and he loved her the machism and the attitude are due to society we maight say... and so in this case this would be a love story very sensitive in my opinion but a different love story. Still other ways of seeing the meaning of the movie should be accepted the true piece of art is the one which allows herself to be interpreted in inumerous ways....I also noticed the very interesting contrast between the three girls among which the first one to marry seemed to have the more regular and happy life of all. The other girl who married the sportsman didn't suceed and seems to have a decadent life in her middle age. Then we have the main character who has already been spoken.Also an excelent not to the soundtrack... and this the way a post cold war portuguese educated person sees this movie...810".

	schema:headline " A great insight look of what life was like for Soviet women. It's has a lot of dush.";
	schema:reviewBody "During the Cold War not much was known about life in the Soviet Union to western audiences. Even least was known about life for Soviet women. There were very few movies at the time that capture how Russian women were treated. Most films from that era were highly narrow formula propaganda stories of socialist realism. It wasn't until Brezhnev Era that cinema got expand its boundaries and begin work on a wider range of entertaining and artistic films. It was here that filmmakers started to developed stories that intense focus on Soviet personal life. One of those films was 1979's Moscow does not believe in tears. Director by Vladimir Menshov and written by Valentin Chernykh the movie tells the 20 years story of three Russian women who come to Moscow from smaller towns Katerina Tikhomirova Vera Alentova Lyudmila Irina Muravyova and Antonina Raisa Ryazanova in search for better life. Only to find that the search is more complex than they thought. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say that the first half of the film set in the 1959s during Khrushchev Thaw was really dull and boring. It's really a shame because it would be nice to see more on these women's reaction to the change in reform in their country since DeStalinization. It would have been better if the movie set the events during the 1963's Cuban Mission Crisis. It would be nice to see how the average soviet citizen was thinking of the event. Sadly film content like that would more likely be heavily circumscribed and subject to censorship and bureaucratic state control. Instead the film doesn't get good until the movie took a 20 year leap forward in time to 1979. It's here that one of the women's stories really outshine the others. In my opinion the movie should have been all about Katerina's struggles. Not only is the actress the better of the three women but her character has the most complex and entertaining storyline. Even with a huge time jump you see her character transform from a weak factory worker in the beginning of the film into a strongwill single mother factory director by the end. It just sucks that the movie gloss over how she became so mature. It would been interesting to see the years that she had to go through the double burden of a job and familyraising responsibilities. It really surprise me that they didn't focus on that because it was very common for Soviet women at the time. Still I like how they shown a working woman was able to reach the executive level in a maledriven field. It's very rare to see a film like this both in the Soviet Union and the United States at the time. I just wish they show how she rose the ranks to become the woman that she was toward the end of the film. The movie could have been easily just be about that but the movie didn't want to seem too extreme in its Feminism outlook. So the movie focus more on her trying to fall back in love after a previous man have left her to rise a child on her own. It's here where the audience is introduce to Gosha Aleksey Batalov a toolanddie maker. He's one of the better characters in the film. He is a very complex fella that's mostly entertaining. The only complain that I have about his character is the weak conflict. Despite that the movie still shows that he's a good man. Aleksey Batalov plays him very well. One of the bigger faults about watching this movie today is how dated it is. Not only does this movie have some really questionable oldschool beliefs about relationships and gender roles. It's somewhat offensive when you think about it. Still I can understand that it's a product of the times. One of the funnier moments in the film is when RudolphRodion Yuri Vasilyev makes two speeches about how TV is the wave of the future and will eliminate theater movies and books. I guess he didn't count on the internet being made. The true value of the film is its reflection of the Russian culture and traditions. Anyone interested in better understanding the Russian way of life should see this film. It's nice to see that not everything in the Soviet Union wasn't so gloomy. Even US President Ronald Reagan watched the film several times prior to his meetings with the President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev in order to gain a better understanding of the Russian people. So it's clear that this movie does work but it's still questionable to me if this movie should have deserve the 1981 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1980. I mean it's alright but it's no way beats 1980's Kagemusha. After all if you take away the fact that it was made in Soviet Union it feels like a generic soap opera or chick flick. There wasn't much substance. While the movie was shot pretty well. There were hardly anything great with them. The only one worth noticing is the park scene with the long panning shot. In my opinion it was just alright but it's pretty eerily how close this version is with the shot in 1979's Kramer vs Kramer. Another problem with the film is the DVD quality. I have not yet seen a good version of this film. Most of the audio kinda sucks. I can barely hear what's going on. The English subtitles are bit questionable. I really doubt the Russian language have a word for Hillbilly or Hicks. I would rather take the Russian slang than it trying to be go all the way with the English language. It was a bit jarring. Overall This is not your typical Bolshevist movie. It's very unique. A mustwatch for anybody trying to understand Russian culture. If that's your cup of borscht more power to you! Check it out!".

But one of the things that made this film enjoyable was to see all the kids who were just participating with this film I mean I felt like I was in a concert the kids were clapping with the songs screaming for their idols and just having fun it was cool to see their reactions to remember a more innocent time of being in love that much with something. But I felt like this was just a cute movie that is getting too much criticism just because it is High School Musical give it a break and take it for what it is.The gang is back for their senior year and everything is just perfect they came up with a great idea for a musical to represent all that they're going through in this exciting year. But there is also a lot of pressure Zack is facing a tough decision of which college to go to while Gabriella is planning on going to Yale University so far away from him Sharpay and her brother Ryan are competing for a scholarship to Juliard and Chad and Taylor are learning what to do with the rest of their lives while loosing their best friends to different schools.Granted High School Musical is never Oscar material in fact it's downright like having a soda after school with the hot quarterback or sexy cheerleader but like I said it's for the kids. Seeing their reactions to this reminded me and my coworkers of a more innocent time when I had the same excitement to see Spice World when I was 12 years old. We all had these silly things we loved at a young age and for some reason we become more cynical as we get older criticizing everything that the new generation has so I'm cutting this movie some slack. It had fun songs cute characters silly situations but great dance numbers and is just over all a nice film for the family. I do recommend it just for the fun of being with the fans and just having a good time no matter how cheesy it is.610".

	schema:reviewBody "The lights dimmed and the children became quiet. With a theatre packed with children aged under 10 years of age i could sense the excitement as the much long awaited High School Musical 3 Senior Year was about to come on screen.The screen lit up and there it was. The face of Troy Bolton Zac Efron sweating from ear to ear. The movie had begun. I squealed like a two year old when i first saw his face. Believe it or not but i had been waiting several months for this movie to come out. The night before i had hardly slept as i was just too excited.In all honesty this movie blew me away. It really took my expectations out of the water. For a cinema release the actors had to step it up so much more from the first and second movies and they did exactly that.Each dance number had amazing choreography and lots of glitz and glamour. The story was beautiful and in some parts it almost had me in tears.High School Musical 3 Senior Year was nothing but an amazing entertaining and fun loving film for the children and even teenagers to love. It was not made to win any Oscars or make history it was made to entertain and it just did that. I don't understand the people who criticize this movie. It may not be something you're going to enjoy but sure as hell the little one's are going to love it.People say it's unrealistic that no high school is this perfect. Which is true but why criticize this movie for stepping out of the boundaries and letting people's imaginations run wild for a couple of hours. The story was touching the songs were beautiful and the actors really tried their hardest and as the words High School Musical came down and the six main characters jumped in the air for the last few seconds of the final song and movie i couldn't help but wipe a tear from my face.A perfect ending to the High School Musical trilogy and i thank them for bringing something new in to the lives of younger children for the first time in a long time. High School Musical 3 Senior Year had me wishing that my life could feel just like a musical.".

Well duh! You were young once too and no one constantly dissed the Lion King or Cinderella or Rugrats or whatever your show was as a naive innocent kid. Lions don't talk or dance or sing there are no such things as fairy god mothers and talking mice and babies don't have imaginary worlds where they can talk in front of adults yet no one hears them. What do you want Disney to do turn High School Musical into a movie about kids who are sexually active backstage and smoke weed after rehearsals? There's nothing wrong with a nice innocent family movie people! If Disney turned High School Musical into that you'd be complaining WAY more trust me! And yes High School Musical may be like a fantasy high school world that we all WISH could exist but it's not destroying the kids' brain cells or anything. Once they get to that certain age level they'll realize that the perfect happy HSM life was all an illusional element created because it's Disney. So chill.If you went in with that perspective you'd see that High School Musical 3 was pretty enjoyable and that HSM actually has underlying themes that good do the kids some good! The songs were actually cool and different and were fun to sing along to. It's also sad watching the Wildcats grow up if you're really a fanthey're hearts can't seem to tear away from East High. Oh and Zac Efron isn't too hard to look at either! Take your kids and have a NICE innocent enjoyable afternoon at the movies to see this!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review High School Musical 3";
	schema:reviewBody "My only exposure to High School Musical was from a chalet gathering last Christmas where a friend who was a fan brought his DVD and shared with us what's there to like from this highly popular franchise. The DVD has countless of versions released to milk its fan base that I've really lost count just how many variations Encore? Extended Dance? there are out there in the market. Even then I didn't really watch High School Musical 2 completely only zooming into the catchy song and dance numbers and as for the first movie I was only familiar with one or two songs that became like anthems for working together?Anyway I'm not a fan and the reason why I would have watched this is because Disney decided it was good enough for the big screen. Either that or they actually did their sums and realize that the huge fanbase would turn up in droves to support it in the cinemas. And I guess they were right looking at how it opened at 1 at the US Box Office. Is it any good then? For the uninitiated like me the story's nothing spectacular as it deals with growing pains of students and decisions that come with the end of high school having choices presented on where you would want to go next for further studies. This would naturally mean a split amongst established friends as you'll be geographically separated and temporarily close a chapter in your life.Central to the story would be the possible insecurities and impending long term? split between lovebirds Troy Bolton Zac Efron and Gabriella Montez Vannessa Hudgens due to the latter's brainier character being accepted by Stanford. In fact just watching this movie alone I thought Gabriella was the psychologically tougher of the two with Troy being your typical indecisive jock who's a bit wishywashy about his own development path ahead. The other subplot would be the usual resident evil Sharpay Evans Ashley Tisdale and her antics in wanting the limelight all for herself this time though with her personal assistant thrown into the mix and having the audience judge who's the biggest bitch out there.But of course this is Disney so don't expect too deep a theme to be dwelled upon. It's still fairly light stuff that is meant for enjoyment by kids and supposedly with wholesome values thrown in too that would meet parental approval. It's fairy tale stuff that would seem like a cop out with its perfectly ideal ending though some may find such saccharine positivity a refreshing change for once.The song and dance numbers are wonderfully choreographed though one can cringe at some of the lyrics for the slower numbers. A pity of course that we don't get to see the centerpiece of the show within the show and only bits and pieces of the graduation play that the characters designed as something to commemorate their time at East High by. But of course I suspect that this is probably reserved in advance for the DVD release where you can sit through the entire thing in one sitting.".

There's Troy Bolton Zac Efron the school basketball champ who secretly wants to sing and dance.

I laughed out loud at a few of the dumber lines and was constantly either rolling my eyes or smirking at the plot developments. However I'm not the target audience for thisI'm a 46 year old guy. I saw it cause I love musicals and this has gotten raves from the critics. It's pretty obvious they're not cheering on the ridiculous plot but the musical numbers. They come out of nowhere but they're full of energy and life. They're also beautifully choreographed and some are really eyepopping. The whole cast can sing and dance and give their all to every single song. The Boys Are Back number between Chad and Troy is a true showstopper. None of these songs will become classics but they're good enough. This is a musical aimed squarely at teenagers and preteens. The language is very clean the G rating should tell you that all the teens look clean and fresh all the plots are predictable and family friendly and the whole cast goes at this full blast. This is truly a movie that the whole family can watch. A lot of people are jeering at this movie notice the poor rating it has but why? It's just an update of those stupid Beach Party movies of the 1960s. It's no masterpiece musical but it's fun friendly and full of energy. I give it a 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "The thing about the High School Musical franchise is that you either love it or hate it. Ever since the first movie it has always been like that. I for one will now be standing in the middle because I will review this film unbiasedly. I've to say the movie was fun to watch. It has a very simple storyline which was made complicated later on in the movie. The characters whom are now in their senior years has to choose where they have to go after they finished high school. This is the story about their hope and fears and choices they have to make. Simple enough...What amazes me is the dance numbers which had me completely blown away. It was choreographed so sophisticatedly and so beautifully that it will leave the audience enthralled. From a simple waltz during the rooftop scene to a very complicatedsortabreakdance in the junkyard scene. I give my applause to the choreographers and the dancers. Well done!The songs I've to say are good and most are very catchy and fun to listen to. The lyrics have matured. They are mostly better than the songs from High School Musical and its sequel High School Musical 2. The lead singer of each songs sings the song greatly. My compliment to Efron for his rough and edgy voice and Grabeel for some nice and melodic pitch. Although I'm not quite fond with Hudgen's nasal highpitch voice.One thing that I'm not happy with this movie is the fact that most of the musical numbers and songs are performance scene. Whether they're rehearsing the play or the play itself. In a true musical the dancing and singing are the way the characters express their feeling or just a way they talk. It is apart of the story the dialogue. But in HSM some of it are performance scene. For example the prom scene is actually the rehearsal of the actual play. This slightly takes away the musical feel to it.A bit of a warning though. This movie is made FOR THE FANS ONLY. If you're not a fan you might want to start with the first HSM and work it up or just stay away from the franchise. Because if you're not a fan you might find some of the scenes quite cheesy. From some of the dialogues to the ending where the camera focuses on the characters' faces before the big red curtain closed even the last song entitled High School Musical during the graduation is slightly cheesy.Other than that I'd say it is a great movie for all ages especially the young ones. And it is a great family movie if you want some times to relax from the rough actions and romance or even politics of Hollywood.The songs and the dance moves will keep you glued to the screen.".

	schema:headline " The stuff anorexia and high school massacres are made of.";
	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen the first nor the second film but with films like Dirty Dancing Footloose even Grease in the back of my mind it makes High School Musical 3 look like a propaganda film made by reactionary parents and the U.S. Department of Education. The film has been clinically cleansed of losers or people who are a bit unusual and it's a great example of a pedagogical motivationform based on fear. Fear of defeat fear of inadequacy fear of humiliation. There is no room for mediocrity or small ambitions so straighten up while you are young and go to school and allow yourself to be great as it says in the film This is the stuff anorexia and highschool massacres are made of. High School Musical makes me think of what one of the creators of South Park Matt Stone said about the American school system They scare you into conforming. If you're a loser now you're gonna be a loser forever. High School Musical preaches that every moment is crucial for the rest of your life. And this is a 'wonderful' achievement pressure to put on children and adolescents. Let's take a few quotes to understand the rhetoric. In the changing room the coach says Make this moment last. Prom night is A night to live forever so one must hope one has a date that night. This is our last chance to get it right This is our last chance to make our mark History will know who we are etc.. This is the pupils last chance to write themselves into history and they are just 17 years old.Children and adolescents may be what they want to be as long as the result of their efforts is in one form or another of absolute greatness so the film tells us.Rolecomposition is cleverly put together so that the largest minorities with the highest purchasing power are represented Blacks and Hispanics. It is so to speak uncontroversial and thoroughly tested minorities. Chinese and Indians are there however non of those 'strange' minorities who uses ginger in their cooking.You can of course choose to shrug your shoulders over a film such as High School Musical and think Oh how kitsch and fun in a 'Beverly Hills 90210'kind of way but I don't think it's unimportant what we teach our children. I am not so concerned about the Danish children exposed to High School Musical.

	onyx:emotionText "I haven't seen the first nor the second film but with films like Dirty Dancing Footloose even Grease in the back of my mind it makes High School Musical 3 look like a propaganda film made by reactionary parents and the U.S. Department of Education. The film has been clinically cleansed of losers or people who are a bit unusual and it's a great example of a pedagogical motivationform based on fear. Fear of defeat fear of inadequacy fear of humiliation. There is no room for mediocrity or small ambitions so straighten up while you are young and go to school and allow yourself to be great as it says in the film This is the stuff anorexia and highschool massacres are made of. High School Musical makes me think of what one of the creators of South Park Matt Stone said about the American school system They scare you into conforming. If you're a loser now you're gonna be a loser forever. High School Musical preaches that every moment is crucial for the rest of your life. And this is a 'wonderful' achievement pressure to put on children and adolescents. Let's take a few quotes to understand the rhetoric. In the changing room the coach says Make this moment last. Prom night is A night to live forever so one must hope one has a date that night. This is our last chance to get it right This is our last chance to make our mark History will know who we are etc.. This is the pupils last chance to write themselves into history and they are just 17 years old.Children and adolescents may be what they want to be as long as the result of their efforts is in one form or another of absolute greatness so the film tells us.Rolecomposition is cleverly put together so that the largest minorities with the highest purchasing power are represented Blacks and Hispanics. It is so to speak uncontroversial and thoroughly tested minorities. Chinese and Indians are there however non of those 'strange' minorities who uses ginger in their cooking.You can of course choose to shrug your shoulders over a film such as High School Musical and think Oh how kitsch and fun in a 'Beverly Hills 90210'kind of way but I don't think it's unimportant what we teach our children. I am not so concerned about the Danish children exposed to High School Musical. We have a strong Danish television and children's films tradition to counterbalance and tell the children that it is totally okay to fail. But I am nervous on behalf of American children. Because if this is an expression of a dominant American pedagogy it is not the last time they will see a pupil formulate his or hers feelings of defeat with an automatic riffle.

	schema:reviewBody "The low score on IMDb is representative of the majority opinion of those that are not really within the target audience of this film however it is also the opinion of those who have never watched any of the High School Musical films for themselves. Rather than accepting that the film is not for them they also feel the need to deride it as worthless when really they mean that nothing about it holds any value for them. This is not the same as the HSM films being brilliant though  just I think that they come in for some overly harsh criticism by those that seem surprised that they do exactly what they propose to do. In a way it is like complaining that Star Wars is an awful film because it is a scifi.OK there is plenty wrong with HSM3. The plot is obvious but yet full of sanitised relationships and situations cloying moral messages and forced sentiment and certainly if you are watching it as a film then yes there is plenty that is clunky. However it is probably not fair to pick holes in all of the obvious stuff while ignoring that it does actually do a good job as a musical. Have you been to a musical? It tends to bring cheesy overacting big smiles easy sentiment big musical numbers and not a lot of room for gritty reality of teenage life and the messy business of teenage relationships  that HSM3 has all these faults is not really something that I'm going to kick it about. It is a bit overlong though and at almost two hours it does have sections that appear to have little forward motion and perhaps lack pace or a sense of fun that it does when it is in good form. It could and should have lost at least 20 minutes in there somewhere and would have been better for it  although I know that Disney see it as a flagship product recently so want to do more with it. It must also be said that several of the musical numbers are not as fun as they should have been. Some don't inspire in terms of choreography and several of the songs come over as rather bland and samey.The cast do well although I understand why some viewers do not like the performances. Efron may not have a great range to expand out of this but he is a great presence in the film  he does singing and dancing really well and has a light touch that makes him easy to like. Likewise Hudgens for all her photographic scandals delivers a wonderfully light turn that is nothing but sweetness. OK neither of them come over as real people but they are sweet and enjoyable couple at the heart of the film. As before Tisdale is fun and bitchy without being unlikeable and she works well with Grabeel. Bleu has less to do than before and I didn't think he was used that well  likewise Coleman.Overall HSM3 is far from a great film. It is clunky and obvious overlong cheesy and is not the sort of thing that will win over viewers who do not like cheesy musicals  but it is a bit harsh to blame that on the film when it is pretty clear from the start that this is what it is setting out to be. It should not be given total forgiveness for its flaws and of course the casual viewer may be left a bit cold by aspects of it but if you are happy to meet it on its terms then it is a reasonably good if sanitised and soullessly packaged product.".

There are no catchy songs as the songs have a more contemporary feel ditching the previous bubblegum formula. Many of the songs are not related to high school at all such as the dance that occurs in a car dump which is so random. It seems the filmmakers want to revamp the High School Musical cast to become more mature to prepare for possible sequels.

Main reason I watched the first and second on the telly over Christmas and Easter respectively? Go and ask my nine soontobe ten family friend's daughter who always asks if I've seen it. Yep you guessed it she's a big fan.So since the first was such a success thanks to those under 12who probably in secret rule the world Disney milk the cash cow for the last few drops and bring out another one.Possibly the only one in the cast that can act with a shred of conviction given the superficiality of the material is Efron. And no I don't harbour a fancying towards him it just seems the other cast members are either too OTT and annoyingSharpay Tiara the new London schoolgirl transfer Jimmy etc or come across as unconvincingly with their 'cute' personals Hudgens especially.And I can't nor do I even imagine I can speak for everyone but there were too many 'pass me the bucket I'm going to throw up' romantic moments with Troy and Gabriella that were so saccharine they could cause diabetesand they get most of the songs. The first one had less of these moments and was better for italthough I'm not claiming any one of these films is very good as I don't think they are.The cinematography has such bright bold colours with the trademark red and white that near the end I was hoping maybe the sunny attitude the clothing has would be turned down a notch. The Barbie pink wardrobe adorned by Sharpay may suit the character but still looks ridiculous  I hope no ones getting ideas to copy this look in their hoards ....Now or Never is my fave song can't get it out of my head just like how We're All in This Togetherwhich gets a slower arrangement for the colourful graduation in this film and What Time is It? were my faves of the first and second films respectively. As mentioned before I'm not keen on the ballads shared by Troy and Gabriella. Another song I liked was the I Want it All and the dream stage scenes with the song I laughed at the boyband popvideo wannabe that was Boys Are Back. Anytime a song begins to play and the cast start to sing I can help but laugh unintentionally  it's obviously all very cheesy.Overall It's not everyday you see a group of young kids under seven all dancing around near the big screen itself near the front in the cinema when the film ends or slapping their hands on their thighs in time with the music for one of the last songs High School Musical. I even saw some jumping around pretending to do the moves show in some of the musical numbers!It's squeaky clean and about as deep as a puddle yet who am I to cast the first stone for something harmless children enjoy as I had my moments aged 810 when I loved something equally as cheesy  Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers anyone? The plot hardly has a chance to get into depth even if it wanted to though with more than ten songs to squeeze in and some references to other musicals with the big stage set pieces so when it does start with the drama it all seems contrived and I wanted a catchy song to bop my head to.Yes it's a guilty pleasure of mine and yes the opening is cringeworthy with a closeup of a sweaty Efron in grimace playing basketball as are some other scenes but in terms of feel good throwaway entertainment it works alright. Don't go in expecting hilarity as it only has a handful of mildly amusing and one laughoutloud funny moments with Jimmy near the endnot including my unintentional giggles. Oh and stay behind a few minutes for some few bloopers.Nothing brilliant and this definitely doesn't top Grease which I think still portrays high school a bit more realistically and with better songs to me but I don't strongly dislike this nor would you catch any of the merchandise or even the DVDs in my room never mind my home. It's a cheesy craze that's having it's time so let the kids enjoy it for it's inoffensive happy persona. And ... Go wildcats! But please let it end with the hats being thrown in the air  no more sequels Disney! Aren't the houses of your execs big enough?!".

But it was slightly different if a little predictable.Also the new characters were a bit pointless. Tiara was pathetic and a really bad show for us English people. Jimmy was better and added comedy so I actually liked him. However these being the characters in the 4th film will be a bit strange so I'm not gunna hold my breath.But allinall wicked my fav song being can i have this dance and the gorgeous scene on the rooftop. Boys are back is a close second though. And the ending Go see it  Everyone. You'll all love something about it.".

And I personally think that it was better then the second movie because they were once again preparing for another High School Musical hence the name High School Musical as well as preparing the end of their High School career.The teens or actors playing teens are going through a tuff time with the fact that that they have to leave there High School life behind and make some new choices and by doing so they each learn a little bit about themselves as well as how to keep friendships. It is not just a movie about music it is a movie about friendship making choices getting through what they need to get though making the right choices for themselves and enjoying what they have left of high school. They make the best of what is left of their high school career and go out with a bang.I don't see what all the fuss is about. It is a good movie a great musical and excellent for kids young adults teens that like movies and musicals. Therefore it cannot passively be bad at all. I will agree that this one is not as great as the original movie but I would say it is just as entertaining as the first two movies. And I really enjoyed the songs.

But as to HSM 3 it started out fast paced and had me hooked. The music was great and I went and bought the soundtrack right after I left the theater. The songs have always been good but I think they did better with the lyrics in this one. I think Zac Efron improved his acting in this film and everyone else did just as well if not better as they had before. I would love if they made a HSM 4 but only if they kept the main 6 charactersactors Troy GabriellaSharpayRyanChadKelsi. They all are the ones that keep me interested though it wouldn't be right without other key people like Mr. Bolton or Mrs. Darbus.Overall Very impressed".

I would love if they made a HSM 4 but only if they kept the main 6 charactersactors Troy GabriellaSharpayRyanChadKelsi. They all are the ones that keep me interested though it wouldn't be right without other key people like Mr. Bolton or Mrs. Darbus.Overall Very impressed";

	schema:reviewBody "Satantango 1994  Satantango Bela Tarr's 1994 7.5 hour masterpiece is incredible first and foremost in that despite its length and multiple shots of literally nothing taking place it is never I repeat never boring. This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. Complied of only 150 shots many of which last for over 10 minutes Tarr and his cinematographer manage to create a hypnotic and beautiful depiction of a desolated communal farm in postcommunism Hungary. The scenery is at once withered and ugly yet compellingly beautiful. The land is muddy and the buildings are in shambles. There are two scenes where main characters walk with the camera following as multitudes of trash blow along with them in the wind creating a somehow hypnotic effect.The film opens with literally a 10 minute shot following a herd of cows wandering through a seemingly rundown farm town. The camera makes what has to be one of the most incredible pans in cinematic history panning to the left for most of the ten minute scene. Who else but Bela Tarr would try such a thing and who else but Bela Tarr could make it work so well.The film follows the people of the farm in essentially three sections. The first section begins by showing Futaki having an affair with Schmidt's wife. Schmidt we find out is planning to run away with the money the town has made over the past year but comes home and is confronted by Futaki who has suck out only to come right back and knock on the door. They hear that the smooth talking Irimias and his sidekick Patrina who have been believed dead by the town are on their way back to town. The other residents who all plan to take their money and leave town seem to be under the thumb of Irimias and after hearing of his return meet at the local pub and discuss what to do and wait nervously for Irimias's arrival.The scenes are broken down into 12 steps such as in a Tango. Nearly all of which are connected in that we see what has already happened from another perspective. The first section as noted involves Schmidt and Futaki the second and one of the most hypnotic in the film is of an overweight and frail doctor who sits in front of his window documenting the actions of the townspeople. He details how Futaki is slipping out of Schmidt's house and then goes back in a scene which we've already seen except this time it's from the window of the doctor's house. The doctor hulks around and then realizes he must leave his home to get more alcohol. Scenes go on like this weaving in out and out the story line from different points of view. The first third of the film deals with the realization of Irimias' return and exposes the corruption of the citizen's capitalism by their greed. The second third is the post powerful. It documents a little girl who is conned by her brother and ignored by her mother. The only thing she has power over is her cat and in order to feel that superiority she tortures and poisons the cat. I will not reveal how but this section turns to tragedy which will be exploited by the smooth talking Irimias.The final third deals with the corruption of Irimias's communist plan for the farm. He convinces them to give him the power and all the money that has been saved up only to con them. This section is brooding with satire as is the first in some ways and has shades of Orwell's animal farm  the dumb and obedient townspeople conned into subjugation by the charming Irimias.Essentially Satantango is a 2 hour movie shown without its cuts bringing it to 7.5 hours. The film never uses its drawn out scenes to further the narrative but neither does it use them for simply aesthetic purposes either. The film's length and incredibly long shots seem to be rubbing the atmosphere right in our nose. Many shots have the camera move raising and weaving and circling defining space like no other film. Some of the extended scenes are incredibly funny in bizarre ways such as an extended dance seen from which the film gets its title where the villagers get drunk waiting for Irimias and Patrina dancing to accordion music while the little girl peers in through the window and another scene that circles the room while two officers dictate and type out Irimias's statement cleverly changing vulgar statements which I found hilarious and in the middle of it all sitting down and having a snack in real time! These scenes sound perhaps boring but somehow Tarr makes them seem riveting and when they end it's almost sad to see it. Another incredible extended sequence sees the camera facing down at the sleeping villagers circling them ever so slowing as a narrator describes their dreams.Satantango is a film like no other. Its scope is breathtaking and its style is beautifully crafted. Tarr's films are almost like ballets the camera moves always gracefully and in ways that we would only imagine that a cut was necessary never faltering and always creating incredibly beautiful dances and they set a mood perhaps better than anyone else. Satantango is Tarr's masterwork epic in every sense of the word. If you get the chance to see this one do yourself a favor and experience all 7 and a half hours of its majestic and drab atmosphere. Satantango is film for the sake of film and art for the sake of art.44".

	schema:reviewBody "Goaded on by curiosity I saw SATANTANGO at the Pacific Film Archive several years ago. Critics gushed that SATANTANGO was without parallel  but two hours into the movie I was less than impressed. Very little plot. Black and gray photography. Segments that went on seemingly forever with no clear point. Much of the audience filed out early and I left early too. Was the director Bela Tarr trying to make the film an endurance contest? More recently I consulted the Internet Movie Database to see what was written about SATANTANGO. The cumulative rating of 8.5 of 10 was impressive as were the writeups. A stunning experience says one viewer. Biggest cinematic experience in history says another. The kudos go on and on. But if you scroll down the database you'll also find the negative reviews. Self indulgent annoying one writer says. One of the more measured responses is I do not regret that I saw this movie but I certainly to not think it was a day wellspent  after giving the film a 1 of 10 rating. So I decided to see the film again  this time on DVD  to determine if my initial dismissal at the PFA was warranted. And I learned how to appreciate a different kind of movie  and even come to enjoy it. My hints to a naive viewerCalibrate your attention span. The individual takes of SATANTANGO are unusually long the first scene set outside a pen for steers and chickens lasts over eight minutes with no cuts. Just a single tracking shot. This happens through the entire film in fact the long takes and slow tracking shots give the film its rhythm and style. If you go into SATANTANGO expecting a film paced to contemporary standards you'll be disappointed. If you can take a few breaks between segments  and ask questions.Learn about recent European history. It's possible to enjoy SATANTANGO on its own merits but understanding recent history helps greatly. The film dramatizes the economic depression that gripped the breakup of the Soviet blok and things gone very bad indeed. There's crumbling infrastructure everywhere. People struggle to get by just barely by depending on agricultural collectives like the one depicted in SATANTANGO. This gray depressing worldview would eventually engulf the region. Structure structure structure. The key to appreciating SATANTANGO lies in understanding the film's structure. Another reviewer here aptly mentioned Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON wherein the film's narrative is defined by a single event  told in entirely different ways by the main characters. SATANTANGO uses a similar technique several characters experience the same segment of time from different points of view. The eightminute preface introduces us to the collective itself  where the barebones infrastructure is shown. From here each segment of the film is separated by an intertitle when a new segment starts we see the same action  from a new character's POV. But nearly every segment involves leaving this wet cold impoverished piece of hell  or try to exploit it. Dance the Satantango. The musical segments can open the way to appreciating and even enjoying SATANTANGO. Music is important for Tarr and the repeating figures of dance are a metaphor. The tango is a repeating dance that abides by the rule one step forward two steps back. It's reflected in the lives of the characters who take one step forward in their lives but always end up two steps back. The chapters of the film don't move forward like a typical narrative work it repeats the same segment of time over and over again. If you're frustrated by the fact that the movie seems static  that's the point. SATANTANGO is a story that can't move forward it repeats the same familiar song over and over  until a development determines a new course of action for the characters.I didn't enjoy SATANTANGO when I saw it the first time but I've since become a fan. The investment of time may seem extreme to some but it's more than worthwhile.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was mesmerized by this 7hour long 1994 Hungarian film called Satantango.  Filmed entirely in black and white director Bela Tarr has created some of the most stunning images I've seen on film.  The opening shot about 10 minutes long is an enormous tracking shot following a herd of cows wandering through an otherwise desolate village.  Then there's this 10minute take of a window at dawn.  Everything but the window is dark then ever so slowly morning light brings the objects in the room into view a character finally enters peers out the window then goes back to bed. There's a 5minute tracking shot of two characters hurrying down the street in a horrendous wind while a veritable tornado of garbage and litter whirls about them.  There's a stark almost surreal woods strewn with fog.  No take is less than a minute long and there are about a dozen around 10 minutes. The average edited shot in a Hollywood film is less than 10 seconds.  It's almost mindboggling the logistical and practical difficulties of sustaining such long takes.  In a great many Tarr utilizes extensive camera movement. The camera tracks and weaves and gives you a sense of space found in few other films  maybe those of a Welles Ophuls or Kubrick.  The dance in the middle of the film from which the film takes its title is shown in one 10minute take.  It cuts away to a little girl watching the dance for a few minutes then cuts back to the dance for another 10minute take.  And nothing about this sequence is boring.  The eight actors in the scene carry on heartily.  Another inspired shot has the camera revolving around seven sleeping characters while a narrator describes the dreams of each.The story concerns a group of poor villagers who gets conned by a smart talker who was once one of their own into giving up all their money to go live on a nonexistent communal farm.  The first 412 hours is made up of 5 stories from the perspective of different characters over the course of the same day.  Some of the events in each story overlap so you see them occur again and again but each time from a different perspective since they occur in the context of a different character's life.  It is not unlike what Tarantino does with a segment in Jackie Brown but whereas Tarantino's technique is tiresome because it is plotrelated Tarr's is a grand achievement in tone.The first story shows us Futaki who while having an affair with Mrs. Schmid finds out that her husband is planning to make off with the money that eight villagers have come into through one of conman Irimias's schemes. Then they both discover Irimias who was thought to be dead has returned to their village.  The second story follows Irimias and his trying to evade trouble with the law.  The third shows us a doctor who observes the other villagers and who writes down everything he experiences in journals that he keeps.  The fourth has a young girl taking out her miseries in life on a cat and contemplates suicide.  The fifth shows all the pertinent villagers gather together at a bar and drinking and dancing until they are all in a drunken stupor.Satantango is one of the grand achievements in cinema of this decade.".

Also I reckon this is one of the very few films you actually have to see on a big screen so even if it was available on DVD it wouldn't do much good. I've seen it three times so far and I got blown away every single time. So I really urge you to give it a go if this epic masterpiece comes anywhere near you. First time I saw it was on the Berlin Film Festival in 94 and I have to admit I wasn't really prepared to sit through the whole thing but after three hours I was completely hooked and when the credits finally rolled in I was rather sad that it was over. I would have liked to spend another few hours in this strange and compelling world. OK the plot in itself is kinda depressing and bearing in mind that it runs for so many hours not that much happens but to complain about the absence of jolly dialog and action packed stunts would be completely beside the point. You just have to be willing to go along with Tarr's approach and once you accept that storytelling here is a bit different to what you are used to the whole thing it is more exciting entertaining and gripping than everything you've ever seen. Tarr's main achievement in my view is that he creates a completely new form of imagery and its so utterly convincing that I still wonder why it never caught on big time. Instead of editing the takes into a scene during post production he shots almost everything in one go with the help of a steady cam. As the takes are as long as 7 minutes just a spirited guess I never timed them and involve occasionally more than 9 actors its just utterly amazing how Tarr choreographs actors and camera in a way that it seems perfectly natural and you get to see exactly what you need to see. Well its pretty hard to explain if you haven't seen it as it really is so different from everything else. What can I tell you? Every single frame is aesthetically a revelation thus making this an utter delight from start to finish. I could harp on endlessly about why I love this film so much. About the absolutely convincing atmosphere the great acting the inventive use of lighting how the story unfolds the subtle use of humor but as it is with all great love affairs words fail to even hint at the magnificence of Stntang. Go see and believe.".

There really is no way to spoil this film because it barely has a plot and does its best to divert itself from it once it gets going. Even if you know the sort of repetitious psychological torture you're about to subject yourself to you still have to endure it.Although I certainly took it as a tantric cinematic experience I won't say that I enjoyed it nor that I particularly expected to enjoy it. So far as I know nobody has ever been forced to sit through this film Clockwork Orange style. As a voluntary experience the film is just a method for the audience to confront its own masochism and the dreariness of its existence.That said I think that in the 7 hours I spent watching it about 25 minutes were lost due to it being a Pal conversion and running imperceptibly faster than usual maybe 2 12 hours were brilliant. Of course I can't assess whether those moments of brilliance coming later on in the film were actually brilliant or of I had just begun to submit to the film the way interrogation subjects start to crack after sleep deprivation.The film has some very strong suits namely the cinematography and setting. There were some moments where I laughed more than I had ever laughed in a film but I think that might have just been from cracking under pressure. I did think the last shot was perfect although it would have been better without the final voice over.Also the one game that I played throughout the film that kept me going was Which Andrei Tarkovsky film does this most resemble? While I do think that Bela Tarr has certainly championed his own form of patent miserablism I did notice about eight shots amounting to about an hour of the film if not more that looked entirely cribbed from Tarkovsky's repertoire. Maybe someday I'll edit out the Tarkovsky film located within this film and see if I can pass it off on anyone unfamiliar with Tarr.That said I'm... happy??? that I sat through the whole thing if only because afterward I got to go for a nice long bike ride and enjoy the fact that the world is in color and I don't live in a post communist society. Maybe that's how Albert Hoffmann felt.I will say that I was disappointed in the film. Although that's kind of like being disappointed with the melody in a John Cage piece. I really loved Werckmeister Harmonies but I despised Damnation. This one falls pretty evenly between the two it just happens to fall from space burn up on reentry and take seven hours to hit the ground.In the end the audience only has the same thing to hold on to as the characters living in these miserable conditions that they endured.".

I also know nobody in my social circle who would watch this with me. Sadly I am not able to talk about with this film with them so I came to this website yet again. I am not one of those people who are going to claim the film a masterpiece and the most amazing film I've ever seen. Nor am I going to be one of those people that call this film a boring self indulgent mess. I can see both sides and I think both opinions have some merit. I like art cinema but I too have limits. I didn't sit through an entire Tarkovsky film at a theater and I found David Lynch's Inland Empire excruciating. But I saw Werkmesiter Harmonies and I was so mesmerized that I had to check out Satantango. The movie is basically a series of beautifully stark and minimal black and white photographs that move. The heavy atmosphere is quite palpable and I appreciated visiting this world where no technology cars or plumbing exist and when you see a static laden TV later in the film you will be startled by it's seemingly alien presence in this film's environment. I liked the score which was alternately eerie pretty and even zany. I was impressed by images of tumbling windswept litter roaming cows in what appears to be an abandoned farm village perhaps my favorite shot the gradual emergence and gradual dimming of light a stark journey by foot into darkness and rain by a character who seems to border on death more than once and an owl spying on some sleeping newcomers. I also loved the same periods of time being revisited from different points of view. This film was indeed boring in places. Anyone telling you that they were not bored at all during this film is not an ordinary person. For the most part the long tracking shots and real time pacing create a hypnotic effect or give you a heightened sense of really being in the here and now with the film but there were many scenes that were simply mundane getting dressed breaking for lunch packing for a trip or absurd long silences with actors simply looking into each others eyes before finally speaking. Finally I absolutely hated the cat torture scene which lasted much longer than I expected. I almost quit viewing the film as I felt privy to a feline snuff film. The director has told people that the cat did not really die and he actually owns the cat as a pet. Be that as it may you will still be watching a vulnerable and innocent animal being brutalized for an extended period mind you and I can't abide by that. This part of the story was indeed one of the more fascinating elements but the treatment of this animal for the sake of the film was rather inhumane. I wish more people would criticize this directorial choice but many don't even bring it up. I'm glad I made it through the film. I wanted to test my patience. I wanted to meditate on the images and the unique sense of time. But I can't say that I was moved by the story or it's characters. It was a fascinating exercise for me and nothing more. I enjoyed Werckmeister Harmonies much more and consider it a superior but less ambitious film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Bela Tarr. Adapted from a novel the movie if it can be called such  it is so slow in places it can hardly be called moving  is more like a series of portraits. l came to this movie without knowing a single thing about it l had no prior knowledge of it l left it wanting those stolen seven and hours of my life back. This film will appeal to those interested in the technical side of film making but the technical tricks do nothing to hide the lack of substance. l know in advance my views on this film will not be popular here well popularity is not something l am seeking. Set sometime in the 1980's the movie has more the look and feel of the 1950's when Hungary was under Soviet control. Since there is little context given l have to think this is a deliberate construct of the director to remove the characters from any set time or place. The end result is that much of the film takes place in a featureless landscape where the gray tones are unrelenting just like much of the film which l found tedious to the extreme. There are a few characters but most of them are made out to be grotesque figures in hand me down clothes whose only real past time is drinking copious amounts of alcohol and falling over often. No one really works there is no work to be done. It is as if they are all waiting for the Hungarian equivalent of Godot but Beckett does not translate well it appears. The dialogue as such is sparse and contains few gems. One of the style devices used in the screenplay is the repeating of certain lines over and over. This is particularly annoying in one scene when that is all an old drunk does for about 10 minutes over and over while other characters are trying to speak. No one tells him to shut up the characters keep on talking even though he is just relentless. Many things about this film are also relentless. The rain being the most obvious. More than half the running time of the film is during the rain. Another relentless device is the over use of tracking shots. Characters are shown walking great distances in the rain or the wind  more on that later  with the camera showing them walking the whole distance to where they are going. The most noticeable of these is perhaps the first shot of the movie when cows are shown walking through a farmyard. The cows are quite loud and yet no people come to attend to them. After a while the cows get the idea that no one is coming so they just wander off to wherever it is they were going in the first place and are never seen again. People are also shown in the same manner walking everywhere as there is not only a lack of people in the derelict towns depicted but only a couple of motorized vehicles in the entire film. This lack of technology is one of the things that removes the film from any narrow context. The only thing that really can be used to date the film in any way is an electric type writer and that is not shown until almost at the end. A wind machine is also used or in this case over used in a couple of scenes to blow an absolute storm through the town as the camera follows certain characters down the deserted streets. A few times music is used on the soundtrack but like much of the dialogue it is sparse and the badly played tunes are repeated often most notably on a Hohner piano accordion. At other times some bells are used and they have an eerie almost menacing effect. l say almost menacing as you would have to care about the effect of the bells first but by the end of this film l really could not have cared less. Yes the film has some neat stylistic devices none better than when two clerks get together to rewrite an official report on the main characters  with some hilarious results  where the camera circles twice around the desks of the two men first in a clockwise motion then it stops and does the same thing in reverse. Neat but it does nothing to enhance our understanding or appreciation of the film itself like so many of the other tricks used in the film it becomes a self conscious aspect of the film that we notice more because there is a lack of other things that would be of more benefit to the film itself such as plot development narrative more decent characterization or even a decent script. Perhaps this film was made to inspire us to seek out the original text. lf so it is an abject failure. There are no memorable characters there is no one really deserving of any type of sympathy here or who commands audience interest. The whole film is a massive exercise in self indulgence. The end credits indicate that it took 3 years to make that is about 2 years and nine months too long. So what is so important or riveting that it takes over 7 and a half hours to depict ? The answer is nothing. Masterpiece ? Spare me.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a 7 hour long film whose long takes slowly start to creep under your skin and ultimately leaves you enchanted. In an almost abandoned village the remaining villagers plot and scheme to get away with the money but are all conned out of it by the false prophet Irimias. The story might appear to be about the end of communism or the exploitations of capitalism but this is not the case. At the heart of this story lies the plight of a traumatized child Estike and an old recluse Doctor. They are the true victims of a monstrous scheme which deprived them not of their money but of their hope for a full rich and human life and ultimately of their lives as such. What they were confronted with was a picture of a society in which cold heartless human beings destroyed their own lives and those of others through their lowlife plodding drinking fornicating  in short  through their unrelenting drunken dance of Satan. It was this picture that killed them.What is perhaps most striking is the relation between this film and Tarkvosky's work. I think that although this remains highly speculative Tarr has taken up Tarkovsky's work as the thesis of a Hegelian dialectical triad. The thesis is the subjective poetic and intimate splendor of a girl Estike sitting perfectly still with a purring a cat on her lap a scene which lasts for minutes! So far Tarr's images are the offspring of Tarkovsky's work although Tarr's long takes seem to capture the core of someone's existence with concrete textures in an almost sculpturelike way whereas Tarkovsky's images seem to revolve entirely around their poetic nature. The antithesis however is the introduction of an ethical dimension we learn that Estike is not only a deep girl who has an openness towards the sublime but is actually a traumatized child with very very deep psychological problems because we actually see her torturing and killing her cat and finally killing herself. Thus the poetic image is suddenly interrupted by an objective antithesis although this ethical moment is also revealed as something which was always already present in the existential renderings of the film's characters this is perhaps Tarr's critique of Tarkovsky! This ethical moment ultimately solidifies itself as a social and political moment in that society's nihilism is identified as the cause of Estike's tragedy. However the ethical the social and the political are ultimately dismissed as onesided because the conduct of Irimias and the total abandonment of Doctor shows us that the ethical fate of society and the individual human being cannot ultimately be determined by political means alone but also demands a more radical transformation of man perhaps an openness towards the sublime which yields a synthesis between the poetical the intimate and the sublime with the ethical the social and the political. What is thoroughly unHegelian however is the way in which Tarr ultimately sketches a very bleak picture of society in which this synthesis is far from realized and gives us nothing in the way of assurances that it is in fact realizable on the contrary it shows us only the dance of Satan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bela Tarr's film Satantango is indeed one of the visually most intense beautiful and hypnotic movie experiences in cinema. Not only does this film offer amazing cinematography camera and technical skills it also gives the audience one of the most fascinating honest and deepest character studies. Yes it is 7 hours long but it does never feel stretched boring neverending or exaggerated. Ever single minute fits every frame and every additional camera angle is necessary to provide this unique experience. The mind of the spectator very soon adapts to it's glacial movement and even though some cuts are of unusual length they are so subtly placed so carefully directed and so rich of details that it will hardly be realized let alone feel long or boring. The film is set in a Hungarian village in the 80s. It is one of those villages which used to prosper be rich and have a very high status of social interactions before the onset of Communism. However this film as many describe or try to explain is not about Communism or politics. It is about humanity. For people who haven't experienced the changes Communism made a prequel to this film would actually be quite handy. Those villages haven't always been poor dark and stripped of every hope for prosperity. This movie shows how the human mind and soul fall apart and get lost practically parallel to the surroundings they are set in.Satantango is a film to be seen witnessed and felt. However I do have to make clear that this film is indeed not for everyone. The audience for this film has to be ready to be very slowly but very intensely be pulled into a place that seems to have lost every last bit of hope. To fully understand and appreciate the movie it helps to have some ethnic knowledge on rural life in Eastern Europe during the second half of the 20th century. Or on the other hand this is a cinematic piece for people who want to experience a film created with sheer beauty full of detail patience and breathtaking visual strength.Undoubtedly it is one of the biggest achievements in the history of cinema.".

This movie shows how the human mind and soul fall apart and get lost practically parallel to the surroundings they are set in.Satantango is a film to be seen witnessed and felt. However I do have to make clear that this film is indeed not for everyone. The audience for this film has to be ready to be very slowly but very intensely be pulled into a place that seems to have lost every last bit of hope. To fully understand and appreciate the movie it helps to have some ethnic knowledge on rural life in Eastern Europe during the second half of the 20th century. Or on the other hand this is a cinematic piece for people who want to experience a film created with sheer beauty full of detail patience and breathtaking visual strength.Undoubtedly it is one of the biggest achievements in the history of cinema.";

This movie uses this little nice trick and every time i see that in movies i think is it REALLY needed it? does it REALLY add value to the movie? but especially i think what is wrong with Bela Tarr and all those directors who speculate on the lives of animals for a movie's sake? And btw im not a PETA guy... What is wrong with all you people giving 10 stars to this marathon of stale cinema? It's true that the movie has something appreciable and quite rare to find compared to what can be found by the average movies nowadays but I also think after reading most of the comments. it's been WAY WAY WAY OVERVALUED..FAR FROM A MASTERPIECE... Let's face it.. all that length was not necessary... 5 in my opinion.".

Any negative criticism of this movie comes from the audience's lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge as to what a true film going experience should be. Not about entertainment but about showing you a whole new way of looking at the world. For 7 12 hours you see the world through the eyes of Bela Tarr. And it's a fantastic deeply meaningful world with so many layers of meaning built within a single image. This is why the shots go on for so long. Because Bela Tarr wants you to see all those layers not just the ones on the surface. If you see one more movie in your life see Satantango. Don't watch it in multiple sittings watch it all at once in a dark room on a big screen Without any interruptions except for the bare essentials. For a rating It deserves an 11 but I could only give it a 10. An 11 because it goes further than any movie has ever gone with the exception of a few To show you something truly incredible something you've never seen before. Breathtaking Devine Surreal Utterly beautiful. I can't recommend this enough. wow.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant masterful ad infinitum scarcely begin to describe the unbelievable experience that is Bela Tarr's gargantuan Satantango. It's obvious from the outset that this will be unlike anything seen previous and this is due to an entrancing 8 minute dolly shot of cows strolling through a dilapidated village corral. There is no excuse for something like this to work this well and in fact would blatantly invite criticisms of pretentious! and self indulgent garbage! But alas every single shot with an average length of 68 minutes in all 7 hours serves its purpose of enveloping the viewer into the murky bog of Irimias's treachery. The fascistic control exerted over every glide and push of the camera besides never ceasing to impress gives extended takes of craggy male faces to be little else than riveting. This is a tale that could easily be told in two hours with conventional methods but would never once exude the power that it can with an epic length.There is a tension that I've never experiences previous to my marathon viewing of this picture. Granted many filmmakers use slinking dolly shots slow pushins etc. to create to intensify moments but it has never succeeded so fully before or since Satantango. The movement never exceeds a certain speed and even though you begin to beg for it to dart over to where the action is it would never nearly be as effective if done so. The trudges across peeling walls become an adventure in and of themselves while you hear the conflict off to the side making the eventual completion of the journey like a visual exhalation where you think you can relax but then realize the uncomfortable conflict must now be witnessed in staggering detail.There is a pervading sense of dread percolating under every frame and outside of the unparalleled cinematography this can be attributed to the trancelike performances of all the actors who slow down speech to point of making Kubrick's characters seem like they are starring in Brick. Their zombified line readings often behind mustachioed frowns created an unrelenting atmosphere of both despair and wonder. It's a fantasy world that seems absolutely acceptable and true to life. This kind of dichotomous thinking is inevitable with such an obtuse yet simple film. There is no cinematic experience comparable.".

This is partly a relentless satire of SM personalities but intentionally unrealistic and much more. A world where lust is orgasmic and corruption of ethics and loss of dignity are ... funny! This is by no means for those who are offended easily. This is a movie which disregards ever good manner every culture's rules. Almodovar humour is heretic.

A bit dated now but still a brilliant deconstruction of Spanish culture with zany characters taken straight out of a John Waters movie. It's also the only one of his movies where Almodvar looking VERY young makes an appearance himself as the judge of a penis size competition no less. Considering that this movie was made in less than a week with a budget of around 5000 it's actually quite well done. The cinematography is probably the weak point but the story is great and the characters a parody of everything good and bad about Spain in the 80's. It is full of inyourfaceirreverent kind of humor as well as great little cultural bits and references that only native Spanish speakers or people familiar with Spanish culture will get. One of my favorites is the song Murciana Marrana that Alaska and her punk rock band sing as an ode to her new found lesbian lover and repressed house wife  hilarious lyrics and pure 80s punk rock at its best. The movie itself is really genius and despite some technical shortcomings it's a real gem.".

Pepi seeks revenge and she lets her friends beat the guy up. It seems they have beaten his twin brother so Pepi must come up with another plan. She tries this through the policeman's wife named Luci Eva Siva who turns out to be a masochist perfect for Pepi's friend Bom Olvido Gara who likes to disparage her.A film about nothing really like I said. There are some nice little jokes here sometimes because they are quite unexpected and therefore shocking. When Luci turns out to be what she is it is Bom who pees all over her Luci likes it a lot. May be it is shocking it is pretty funny too. There are more gags like this. One of the best moments is when Pepi has to make her own money her father has cut her off and she has an idea of producing menstruating dolls.Filled with things like this a sloppy editing and a cinematography that is as good as any amateur would do it can not prevent that this film is simply entertaining.

But he learnt later to build up his stories mastering pace all along. As for then he steps out from underground flicks yet displaying great skills.He will be back.";

	schema:reviewBody "i suspected i would get something like this before i saw it. I was interested in understanding the roots of Almodvar as a filmmaker how he started developing his kind of visual storytelling which is so unique today. At the same time i wanted to understand and feel some of the pulse of the underground spirit in Madrid of those days. Both these issues are personal. I wanted to understand how one can use a force of available young and inexperienced talents and give a faithful expression of a certain moment in time and space. I also wanted and still want to get to first works by directors i admire so i can understand how they used their technical and budget limitations to pursue ideas they were after. This is not Almodovar's first film but it is the oldest to which one can have access in legal and i suppose illegal market.I think this is a failure. Not because it's technically and formally very flawed. I actually enjoyed watching all the flaws passing in front of my eyes i think some times a project can work out stronger if its amateurinexperience face shows. This is that case. Anyway i think this is a failure because it is a film where Almodovar is not yet capable of turning his soap operish stories into something intelligent from a visual narrative point of view. The story here is not more or less poor than in many other successful Almodovar features. But here he couldn't find a device that can with intelligent turn the experience into something purely visual the way he does in his best works. So i tried to see the positive side of this. The film proves to me how intelligent Almodovar is for the paths he pursued after this adventure intelligent in what concerns storytelling and visual narrative and how he always searches for new ways to fold his stories and deliver them to us as visual products.Actually we have hints here. In between the scenes the girls suggest the production of a film about their own lives. That film would depict precisely the events we get on screen. I decided to understand i think this is a matter of choosing which interpretation you want to give that i was watching the film they were discussing as if the story was in fact things from the real world that actually happened and i was watching women representing those lives. But there's an important statement Carmen Maura's character warns that for those girls to interpret their own lives they have to perform. They have to act in order to be themselves. Intelligent. Almodovar would go on depicting women who act many times act like themselves other times they act like actresses Todo sobre mi madre was all about this. This possible film within a film and the denouncing that we may be watching a film depicting characters who represent themselves was to me a hint to layered storytelling and narrative invention. Almodovar's career to me has everything to do with that.La movida is here. In a moment i'm willing and trying to move into creating something in the visual world of images call it cinema if you want i really care about understanding how in this moment of Spanish pop culture so many talented people were able to come out and produce important work. I'll search for other visual proof and important documents from this time i'll try to understand how this and other films were possible. This is a bad film which i envy. I which i could one day gather such a crew.My opinion 25httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Drop Dead Fred is a difficult film to review. I saw it for the first time when I was 13 years old or something and I absolutely loved it because I was right in the middle of the age group at which the film is directed. I watched it again recently and while the film's slapstick comedy did not hold quite the same massive appeal although I was still hugely entertained as it did when I was younger I regretted to discover that I had grown out of a lot of the goofy antics that went on in the movie.However I was reading through some of the reviews written on the IMDb by other users and was amazed at how offended a couple of people were by this film revealing in their reviews a total detachment from their own inner selves and a complete misunderstanding for the little people that we call kids. No for example I would NOT recommend a seven year old girl to psychiatric help for making a mess. This is arguably one of the most ludicrous ideas that I have ever read on the Internet Movie Database in my entire life and believe me I have read some jawdroppingly moronic comments on this beloved site.If you read through the user comments for this movie you can so clearly see the difference in the people who liked it and the ones who hate it that it almost makes you laugh out loud that these people can't see that they are exactly the kinds of people that the movie rebels against. Drop Dead Fred begs Elizabeth not to let her mother turn her into one of them because he doesn't want her to turn into the kind of person who is so uptight and frigid and barren that she would be incapable of enjoying exactly the kind of entertainment and fun that Drop Dead Fred is.This is a movie that was made for people who are still in touch with their inner child people who realize that a little girl with a mother who has absolutely no understanding of the mind of a child has every right to escape into the world of an imaginary friend if it will help her escape the grayness and responsibility imposed on her by her mother who demands absolute perfection and hasn't the first clue about how to raise a child. Very similar things can be said about various IMDb users such as ones who refer to Fred as a product of a deranged mind or say anything about psychos or brutality or insanity.Drop Dead Fred is not a film about an insane little girl. Indeed I like to think that the world is populated mostly with people who understand that the minds of young children operate slightly differently than their parents'and our own and that they can be forgiven for getting into a little mischief. I am generally against grouping together people who did not like a certain film but in this case it seems overly obvious that the people who wrote negative reviews of this fun comedy are simply the people who resent being pointed out as the kinds of people that they are.Drop Dead Fred is a movie that was made for fun to be enjoyed laughed at and respected for reminding us that we need to lighten up occasionally and while not necessarily flinging spaghetti in a nice restaurant act like children every once in a while to prevent ourselves from being driven insane by the fastpaced society that we live in. And if you can't do that if you hated Drop Dead Fred because you simply can't understand that concept if indeed you think that Elizabeth is in dire need of psychiatric care you may want to step back and look closely at your life and your views.YOU may be the one in need of therapy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am amazed by the amount of people who have discussed this movie in the terms of being about mental illness.... it should become clear by the end of the movie that this is a fantasy Fred is not an imaginary friend he is real he exists and his sole purpose in life is to help children in a dark place and bring them out of themselves.  Imaginary friends do not move on to another child imaginary friends are the property of those who imagine them. I wouldn't be at all surprised if I saw a review of Gremlins on here by the same people who said nasty little creatures who create distruction around them are not funny.  This is a funny movie plain and simple.  Rick Mayall is outstanding as Fred and Phoebe Cates gives the perfect performance as the downtrodden daughter and wife.  Anyone who says bad things about this movie has obviously never seen a fantasy movie before and taken it for what it is.  I am surprised that they didn't call Demi Moore delusional in Ghost because she was refusing to let go of her boyfriend and imagined all the stuff that went on.  This is a fantasy folks a pure unadulterated fantasy and it is a bloody funny one at that.  Watch it it will make you laugh it will make you smile and it will make you chuckle.... what more can you ask and again Rick Mayall is brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Isn't it funny how this film whilst massively dismissed as rubbish by critics when it was first released has attracted a very loyal following of people who hold it very dear to their hearts  isn't that basically the definition of a cult film? Why? The special effects are terrible it's basically a breaking into the USA market vehicle for Rick Mayall and Marsha Mason looks exactly the same in the 21 years ago flashbacks as she does in the current timeline.This film is special because it has that certain endearing uniqueness to it that makes it very personal. Those who love it have watched it many many times. I've never seen anything like it before or since. It's a Hollywoodstyle comedy about a mid20's dippy girl that is revisited by her childhood imaginary friend when her life starts falling apart... or it's an increasingly dark study of a girl descending into madness only to choose reality over fantasy in the end.Phobe Cates is fantastic in this film. She reacts to Mayall's familiar but still funny Rick routine in the sweetest and cutest way. The comic timing of both is excellent. Check out her expression when she asks her mother to sit down after Mayall has just delivered his Cobwebs line... Adorable.A curiosity is after Fred's first encounter with Elizabeth's mother. After having his head squashed flat by a fridge door Oh no my head the Megabitch squashed my head! The Bitch! She squashed my head! The evil one reigns supreme! the following references by Fred during the rest of the film refer to her as the Megabeast. Perhaps half way through filming the producers thinking this would be a lovely summer kiddie film thought it was a tad too adult to appeal to a young audience and told the makers to tone it down a bit.. The opening scene where Marsha Mason reads a bedtime story to her 4 year old daughter only to be told What a pile of St pretty much sets the scene. Hilarious! There are so many genuinely funny and heartwarming scenes in this film. When Fred makes a real mud pie with the 4 year old Elizabeth the little girl seems to be genuinely enjoying herself it's so fun!. You can't help but smile. And whilst the final goodbye between Elizabeth and Fred is pretty formulaic Hollywood it still tugs at the old heart strings.Some people perhaps read too much into the film when they see it as a study of schizophrenia etc but then again you can't help think that underneath the zany comedy the writers are subtly giving the film a deeper edge. The scene that really hinges Elizabeth's descent into madness is when she finally despairs of her cheating husband's hopeless ways I'm scared to be alone by Fred who beckons come with me with a very creepy invitation to succumb to insanity.To me this film succeeds because it naughtily mixes Hollywood's clichridden niceynice family comedies with the anarchic British alternative comedy of the 90's. You'll either get it or think it's crap. The choice is yours. To those that love it perhaps it just sparks that missed childhood innocence that runs throughout as well as our desire to be more rebellious and independent than we are now as adults. The ending is lovely too... Fred carries on helping kids in his own way.P.S. Carrie Fisher will always be remembered and associated with Star Wars but she is a superb comedy actress. But didn't Elvis kill himself? Yes but before that he was really interesting!... Superb!".

There have only been a couple of movies that I have judged so harshly without seeing them and was enthralled by them and Drop Dead Fred was one of them.  This movie was hilarious but it was more then just that.  A lot of people did not understand this movie because they were searching in the shallow waters and never dove deep into the meaning of it. Fred may or may not be a figment of Phoebe Cates imagination that is left for the viewer to decide.  He was obnoxious he was mean and selfish but was their any other way to portray him?  Cute and cuddly maybe?  Sweet and likeable?  Now that would have annoyed me.  Fred was a troublemaker he was the wild uncontrollable child in Phoebe Cates.  He represented the ounce of child left in her. This movie was made to show that adults abandon the child within to live a bore of a life.  This adult was portrayed in Cate's mother to contrast with her character.  People who deny their inner child can never live an entirely fulfilling life.  Rick Mayall did an incredible job as Drop Dead Fred.  Without him the movie would not have survived.  But everyone else in the movie did a great job too.  This movie is very enjoyablewatch it with an open mind.".

Phoebe Cates who plays Elizabeth now has a whole new load of trouble on her hands. Fred is her childhood imaginary friend  and only she can see him! There are so many funny parts in this film it's impossible to name them all but Rik Mayall never fails to bring up the laughs in any scene as he gives a highly energetic enthusiastic performance. The ending is really touching and I can never forget how when I was younger I always got upset by it. It beautifully concludes the movie and will make you feel warm inside. Watch it and try not to laugh. It's near impossible.".

	schema:headline " Sweet Fantasy with a Beautiful Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "I originally saw this in my late teens. A few years ago it started getting good play on cable and I rediscovered this treasure.I won't rehash the plot you can read that on the main page but the premise has a real interesting idea. What surprised me most by the other comments were things about Elizabeth's emotional state? She's not nuts and she's not delusional. Just because her mother mistakes Fred for a psychological problem doesn't mean she's right. That's the whole point. While we might have some questions in the beginning by the end it's quite clear that Fred is real. This is a fantasy after all.Elizabeth is such a sweet child it's just such a shame her father never gets a backbone to stand up to her mother. That's the one thing I didn't like about the story. It would seem her father simply abandoned them which you simply wouldn't believe based on the sweet caring man they depict him to be. I've always adored Marsha Mason and it was hard to see her as such a cold manipulative woman. You can see underneath at least at the end that she has her own issues that cause her to treat her daughter as an adversary. But it's hard to forgive.Ryk Mayall is hilarious! He's an absolute gem and I really wish we would see him in more mainstream movies so I could view his talent without video hunting. He is brilliant in the physical comedy and a riot even when his jokes aren't all that funny. He also shows some really tender moments. He reminds you a touch of a teacher who really loves a student with emotionally inept parents. He's supposed to be showing her what's wrong with her life making her wake up to the shell of a person she's become but you can see what he really wants to do is hold her kiss the top of her head and tell her it'll all be alright and that at least he loves her.Phoebe Cates turns in one of her best performances second only to Shag. She plays the vulnerable young woman who's been cowed by her mother and squashed by her husband with realism and depth. You can understand her attachment to her philandering spouse cleverly portrayed by Tim Matheson when you recognize that she just desperately wants to be loved by someone. But after being abandoned by her father and seemingly Fred emotionally battered by her mother and losing her only other real friend Ron Eldard is really charming in this bit as a child who wouldn't cling to any shred of love they can get?While this movie is so funny and energetic it's at the end it really pays off for the grown ups. Elizabeth comes to terms with the fact that her husband really doesn't care that she can live her life without the approval or permission of her mother and that she'll never really be happy until she regains the inner child her mother stole from her. The fantasy scene where Fred helps her step back and face all this is really interesting I particularly LOVE the metaphor of unwrapping the young Elizabeth from the bed where she's trapped by the same masking tape her mother used to lock Fred in the JackintheBox. The final moment of Fred's departure with a warm kiss and hug is heartbreaking but fitting. And closing the film with Fred continuing his efforts by befriending Mickey's daughter proves the whole point that Fred is very real and that the imaginary friends in this story have a real purpose. They are there to help children in need in the only way kids really can be helped with fun.".

But then we'd get home and he'd always be there to play with me and be a good friend.Which is what Fred is all about. He is releasing the wild side inside of you that you didn't know you had.Most people when they watch this movie have a pretty open mind and enjoy it. But some seem to go into it far too seriously. Yes it was probably Lizzie's imagination yes Fred probably wasn't real yes the humor was tasteless and annoying. But it's those people who didn't have an imaginary friend as a child who can't understand what it's like to have a friend who'll annoy the crud out of you but still be the one you want to spend time with everyday.I saw Drop Dead Fred when I was six years old and now at fourteen i'm still watching it with friends who i've shown it too. If a fourteen year old and her friends can understand this movie from a psychological standpoint why can't the critics? Fred is Fred. Most of us had him as a child in some form or another and this movie PROVES that they can always come back if we need them no matter how old we get.1010 for my favorite movie of all time. ".

My wife and I loved it and we're in our 40's.If you're not willing to temporarily 'suspend disbelief' then you're cheating yourself. This is a great little film. Beyond the silliness it has the subtle adult theme And no it is NOT mental illness some people are so thick it's harder to believe in their existence than in this movie's premise. It's not War and Peace either but just great fun with a bit of substance. 9 out of 10Here's a good test If you thought 'Hook' with Robin Williams was stupid and boring and just for kids you probably won't understand this film either. But if like me you started to get angry when the ending of 'Hook' started to leave room to rationalize the whole thing as dream and you cheered when what'shisname got his marbles and that film embraced the reality of it's fantasy then rush out and find 'Drop Dead Fred.'

Maybe I expected too much of this film but I was looking forward to a slick piece of speculative scifi that was thought provoking realistic and fairly deep. Instead I got a lazily strung together generic action movie with a splash of time travel and super powers.I don't want to talk time travel sht or something along those lines is commonly used in this film to breeze past any plot holes and presumably stop the narrative become too complex. This irked me as it was one of the main draws in my opinion.I was very frustrated by the little amount of effort that was put in to creating a futuristic society. Forget the realistic nearfuture depicted spectacularly in films such as Children of Men. This world is more akin to the recent Dredd 3D film. Shallow and lacking in realism. Personally I would love to have had more information on the state of government etc as the mobs seemed to be running everything but there really isn't any explanation given to this at all.The dynamics of time travel in this film are completely unbelievable. The notion that you can chop someone leg or whatever off and their future self will lose it is completely absurd. You're clearly creating a brand new entity when you come back in time. Put it this way. If I created a copy of myself from 0.1 seconds ago next to me. Are we going to be magically linked? Probably not. It also presupposes some sort of multiverse scenario in which case Bruce Willis's character shouldn't even exist in that eventuality. I don't want to rant about this too much but I thought of all the ways they could depict time travel. This was one of the worst. And then there are the superpowers. Come on. Everyone has pretty much agreed biological evolution is basically over for us and it's all about technical augmentation now. The idea that in 33 years we'll be developing telekinesis is laughable to the point where the fact you're meant to accept this is almost offensive. On top of this the whole plot in general is very hard to swallow and lacks in verisimilitude. Again I find myself being forced to accept these absurd scenarios such as the fact that the mob can't dispose of bodies but can set up secret time machines?? Or that they have to send them 30 years back in time and not just 2 billion years or whatever. And then there's the 30 year montage. Oh dear lord. I turned to my girlfriend and said. Man don't you just hate it when you get old and suddenly you're Bruce Willis. There was actually laughter in the cinema when Levitt morphs into Willis. All in all I really wouldn't agree with the reviews saying its clever etc. In my opinion the plot is extremely lazy and is secondary to the action. Which is fine. If you want to watch an action film. One of the main reason's I've even written this view is to counterbalance these reviews raving about this very mediocre film calling it a masterpiece. I read reviews touting it's cleverness or how it goes to extra lengths to not leave plot holes and I think am I even watching the same movie here?Personally I found myself rather disappointed.".

	schema:headline " A disappointing let down from start to finish  caused by bad plot";
	schema:reviewBody "!SPOILER ALERT! Contrary to the trailers this is NOT a film about time travel. It IS a film about a telekinetic toddler who is not in the trailers.If you are expecting this film to be like Blade Runner Primer or 13 Monkeys then you may well be VERY disappointed.Only about 5 minutes of the film seemed to actually involve time travel or Bruce Willis fighting his past self. When the story does attempt to explore these issues it does so embarrassingly badly. Half way through the film the plot changes AWAY from time travel and becomes a film about trying to kill a telekinetic little boy in the current day. A boy who has only a very weak connection to the initial plot about time travel.This is really two entirely different plots badly mixed in to one. One plot is about time travel. The other plot is about the dangers of toddlers with uncontrollable telekinesis. Unfortunately the film does neither of these plots well and ends up ruining both.To make matters worse the film moves very slowly in certain places. This just gives the audience time to think about how bad the plot it is.There is virtually no action either  unless you count Bruce Willis's character shooting defenseless toddlers for which the certificate should surely be more than 15 or needless torture and execution scenes. There is just a lot of running away from people taking badly aimed pot shots. This happens a lot. Apparently nobody can shoot straight in the future. The only action scene worthy of the name comes in the last 5 minutes where Bruce Willis suddenly turns ninja and takes out ALL the bad guys in about 30 seconds and then walks off. It's almost as if the writers got to the end of the story and then thought Oh yeah  we should probably have Bruce Willis firing some guns or something ... This film fails so pathetically to deal with time travel that it is frankly insulting to the audience. They don't give good explanations about why time travel exists or how it works. Fair enough. There is a certain suspension of disbelief in any time travel movie. However they DO establish certain rules about time travel during the film which they then break reestablish and break again whenever it is convenient for the writers.Bruce Willis attempts to explain time travel and give a justification for the writer's itinerant stance on the matter only to then smash is hands on the table and angrily shout It doesn't matter!. This makes it clear that the writers didn't even think they were being clever or original. They clearly knew the plot made no sense and they were just making a pathetic excuse about time travel being flaky to justify their random plot lurches and inconsistencies.The whole premise of a Looper was never satisfactorily explained 1 Why did the mafia boss who supposedly owned the city live in a little basement? In his pajamas? 2 It is almost impossible to get rid of a body in the future because of tracking ... cough ... something ... coughcough. So NATURALLY using time travel is the EASIEST of the available options to dispose of a body!? If a body disappears from the future for example in a furnace then surely it also disappears from the future in time travel? Same difference. 3 If mafia in the future are the sole owners and users of time travel then why don't they just use it to take over the world so that they don't need to even worry about disposing of bodies? 4 Why didn't they just send the loopers back already dead when closing a loop so that there was no possibility of failure? 5 Why did they always get THE SAME looper to close THEIR OWN loop? Asking for trouble. 6 Why even have more than one looper? Surely the job wasn't that strenuous that they needed to take shifts? They broke their own rules on time travel and made the ending of the film impossible and irrelevant given the events in the middle As soon as the younger version shot himself at the end then he couldn't have lived to meet the woman in China and eventually travel back in time which means he couldn't have ever caused his past self to meet the rain man and so the rain man would not be standing there in the corn field. Everything would have reverted back to how it was before  in exactly the same way that it DID DO EARLIER on in the film when he fell off the balcony and died and the bit where Bruce Willis traveled back in time got repeated. The rain man would have grown up and taken over the world in the same way he did before and Bruce Willis's wife would still be dead.They never actually explained WHY the first thing the rain man wanted to do was to kill the loopers in the future. Presumably it was because they were the only people who could go back in time and possibly stop him? So why didn't he just kill them with telekinesis like he did the rest of his enemies? Why did he chose to kill them in the ONLY method which would actually give them the opportunity to stop him in the past  namely by sending them back to the past alive. The story never really addressed or capitalized on Bruce Willi's character being evil. This could have been a great angle to really explore but instead they just washed over it.This film was a dismal train wreck of ideas with great potential.".

It IS a film about a telekinetic toddler who is not in the trailers.If you are expecting this film to be like Blade Runner Primer or 13 Monkeys then you may well be VERY disappointed.Only about 5 minutes of the film seemed to actually involve time travel or Bruce Willis fighting his past self. When the story does attempt to explore these issues it does so embarrassingly badly. Half way through the film the plot changes AWAY from time travel and becomes a film about trying to kill a telekinetic little boy in the current day. A boy who has only a very weak connection to the initial plot about time travel.This is really two entirely different plots badly mixed in to one. One plot is about time travel. The other plot is about the dangers of toddlers with uncontrollable telekinesis. Unfortunately the film does neither of these plots well and ends up ruining both.To make matters worse the film moves very slowly in certain places. This just gives the audience time to think about how bad the plot it is.There is virtually no action either  unless you count Bruce Willis's character shooting defenseless toddlers for which the certificate should surely be more than 15 or needless torture and execution scenes. There is just a lot of running away from people taking badly aimed pot shots. This happens a lot. Apparently nobody can shoot straight in the future. The only action scene worthy of the name comes in the last 5 minutes where Bruce Willis suddenly turns ninja and takes out ALL the bad guys in about 30 seconds and then walks off. It's almost as if the writers got to the end of the story and then thought Oh yeah  we should probably have Bruce Willis firing some guns or something ... This film fails so pathetically to deal with time travel that it is frankly insulting to the audience. They don't give good explanations about why time travel exists or how it works. Fair enough. There is a certain suspension of disbelief in any time travel movie. However they DO establish certain rules about time travel during the film which they then break reestablish and break again whenever it is convenient for the writers.Bruce Willis attempts to explain time travel and give a justification for the writer's itinerant stance on the matter only to then smash is hands on the table and angrily shout It doesn't matter!. This makes it clear that the writers didn't even think they were being clever or original. They clearly knew the plot made no sense and they were just making a pathetic excuse about time travel being flaky to justify their random plot lurches and inconsistencies.The whole premise of a Looper was never satisfactorily explained 1 Why did the mafia boss who supposedly owned the city live in a little basement? In his pajamas? 2 It is almost impossible to get rid of a body in the future because of tracking ... cough ... something ... coughcough. So NATURALLY using time travel is the EASIEST of the available options to dispose of a body!? If a body disappears from the future for example in a furnace then surely it also disappears from the future in time travel? Same difference. 3 If mafia in the future are the sole owners and users of time travel then why don't they just use it to take over the world so that they don't need to even worry about disposing of bodies? 4 Why didn't they just send the loopers back already dead when closing a loop so that there was no possibility of failure? 5 Why did they always get THE SAME looper to close THEIR OWN loop? Asking for trouble. 6 Why even have more than one looper? Surely the job wasn't that strenuous that they needed to take shifts? They broke their own rules on time travel and made the ending of the film impossible and irrelevant given the events in the middle As soon as the younger version shot himself at the end then he couldn't have lived to meet the woman in China and eventually travel back in time which means he couldn't have ever caused his past self to meet the rain man and so the rain man would not be standing there in the corn field. Everything would have reverted back to how it was before  in exactly the same way that it DID DO EARLIER on in the film when he fell off the balcony and died and the bit where Bruce Willis traveled back in time got repeated. The rain man would have grown up and taken over the world in the same way he did before and Bruce Willis's wife would still be dead.They never actually explained WHY the first thing the rain man wanted to do was to kill the loopers in the future. Presumably it was because they were the only people who could go back in time and possibly stop him? So why didn't he just kill them with telekinesis like he did the rest of his enemies? Why did he chose to kill them in the ONLY method which would actually give them the opportunity to stop him in the past  namely by sending them back to the past alive. The story never really addressed or capitalized on Bruce Willi's character being evil. This could have been a great angle to really explore but instead they just washed over it.This film was a dismal train wreck of ideas with great potential.";

	schema:reviewBody "The near universal critical acclaim for 'Looper' is something I'm having a hard time fathoming. I suppose we haven't seen a great scifi thriller in such a long time that as soon as a mediocre to average flick such as this one comes along everyone is jumping on the bandwagon practically calling it a masterpiece! My first problem with 'Looper' is the overall concept. A crime syndicate in the future 2074wants to dispose of its victims by sending them 30 years back into the past and have them disposed of by hit men who they pay with bars of silver. Once these hit men the loopers live their lives for thirty years the syndicate decides to dispose of them by sending them back to 2044 where they'll be disposed of sometimes even by their younger selves.It's explained that in the future bodies are 'tagged' so by sending them back in time they cannot be traced. But why can't the syndicate send their victims in the present immediately back to 65 million B.C. where they would probably be immediately eaten by a dinosaur or other prehistoric animal thus preventing the timeline from being tampered with? And by cutting out the middlemen i.e. the loopers in this way the syndicate can keep all the profits for themselves.Once we're introduced to the novelty of the how the looper scheme operates the novelty soon wears off. We see Joe Joseph GordonLevitt traveling to the cornfield and then performing executions one too many times. Finally there's a plot twist fellow looper Seth appears at Joe's apartment explaining that his 30 year old self from the future appears in the cornfield and he's unable to finish the job. Abe the enforcer from the future forces Joe to betray Seth who's tortured and his alter ego from the future is hunted down. You might ask what this has to do with time travel or sciencefiction. Actually nothingit's simply all actionthriller at this point in time in the script.Soon Joe finds himself in the same position as Seth. His 30 year old future self Bruce Willis appears but manages to prevent younger Joe from doing him in. In a rather derivative idea borrowed from the 'Terminator' series Willis must dispose of a child who will one day grow up to be the 'Rainmaker' the sinister figure in the future who is now bent on eliminating all the loopers.It might have been interesting had we seen what this Rainmaker character looked and acted like in the future but that never occurs. We're asked to be content with meeting little Cid our future Rainmaker who has telekinetic powers coupled with a severe anger management problem. One is immediately reminded of Billy Mumy in the Season 3 Twilight Zone episode It's a Good Life who plays a mutant who terrifies adults by 'wishing them away to the cornfield'. So the second half of 'Looper' feels much more like fantasyhorror than Scifi action thriller.The meeting between the younger and older Joes in the diner is perhaps the most interesting scene in the film as it underscores the contrast between the more impulsive younger self with the more seasoned experienced older one. Unfortunately there is hardly any additional interaction between the two altar egos with older Joe stalking off to blow away Abe and his crew of malevolent meanies. In true Bruce Willis fashion the aging 'Die Hard' legend is up to his old tricks by machinegunning most of the bad guys sans Kid Blue who appears out of nowhere on his flying motorcycle and immediately gets himself killed instead of Joe who is his intended target.If the Looper second half feels a bit slower than the first that's because director Rian Johnson spends a little too much time out on the farm with Joe courting Sara Emily Blunt. Although there's a feeling that we've seen this before the ending proves to be passable as we finally have something to feel good about. Younger Joe sacrifices himself preventing older Joe from killing Sara. He does this after he's able to foresee that Cid growing up as the Rainmaker will hold a perpetual grudge due to the murder of his mother and will take it out on all of humanity including all the loopers in the future.Unfortunately Joe's sacrifice is not enough to make either young Joe or older Joe likable. Younger Joe before he takes his own life is a criminal and a drug addict and older Joe is responsible for murdering the second child on his list of three potential Rainmakers. In terms of a sympathetic protagonists there's little to like here at all.'Looper' is also unable to score points with its look at the dystopian future. One feels that one is simply viewing a second hand set from 'Robocop'in that film 'Old Detroit' looks remarkably similar to Looper's Kansas City of 2044 including the grimy 'futuristic' cars and emphasis on vagrancy as a national blight.The performances in Looper are all acceptable with an honorable mention going to little Pierce Gagnon as Cid who manages to handle a number of complicated lines and take direction in a fashion way above his chronological age.In the end Looper proves only mildly interesting. While some of the action sequences are entertaining the scifi premise is not developed into something clever enough to deserve all the the accolades that have been heaped upon it to date.".

To follow the story and recognise characters motivations does require a little concentration but not to the point that you wont enjoy the action beats and other more visceral elements.The story is well constructed information and plot points are presented at an entertaining and well judged pace. There are some nice little throw away visual references and metaphors which if you catch them add a nice texture to the story and stop it feeling too clinical in its plotting.The script is tight hard edged and very dry in its humour the actors are fantastic. I think its fair to say that Joseph GordonLevitt is well on his way to being one to watch Bruce Willis pops back to life here clearly enjoying himself again although i wouldn't say this is solely a Bruce Willis movie in that definition.This is a brilliant movie experience its an wholly original and entertaining idea that the writerdirector has managed to successfully transpose to film without it would appear to a layman pressure or interference from external sources.No matter how much of a good time you will have watching this film and you will Hollywood could stand to learn much more from it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson's Looper parts of it are still falling in to place. Standing out amongst this years crop of mostly underwhelming sequels and comic book adaptations Looper thunders onto the screen showing much like Inception did two years ago that there is a place in 2012 for fresh material and just how good it can be when it's done right.The film tells the story of Joe Joseph GordonLevitt a hitman for an organised crime syndicate tasked with assassinating targets sent from the future. After being confronted with his future self Bruce Willis and failing to perform Young Joe is forced to track down Old Joe and finish the job before being tracked down himself by the nefarious mob led by Abe Jeff Daniels. However there is much more to the story than the basic premise and Johnson isn't afraid to keep details close to his chest until later in the film than most movies of this type so I won't spoil them here.While certainly paying subtle homage to its predecessors Looper is a stunningly original scifi masterpiece vastly superior to any of the higher profile action releases this year. While certainly made on a much larger playing field than Johnson's previous work Brick The Brothers Bloom there is still a smallscale independent feel to the film and it benefits from clearly staying completely under the control of the young director. Delivering excitement sprinkled with thoughtful themes of personal sacrifice he offers us much to chew on.Johnson understands that a successful action film doesn't need an explosion every ten minutes and allows ample time for developing character and story something which will likely divide audiences. Looper is very deliberately constructed and after the highly charged opening establishing the intricate timetravel premise and direction of the plot Johnson scales back the action almost too much as he ambitiously juggles the many and varied story elements he has created. Thankfully any weakness in the middle of the film is largely overshadowed as Johnson launches the third act with such ferocity that the stark change of pace leaves you breathless.Despite the problems in the middle of the film Looper overcomes its flaws purely by being that rare beast in Hollywood nowadays the totally original script. Not an adaptation not a sequel or remake but a fresh idea from the mind of an immensely talented young filmmaker. In a perfect world Looper would be the game changer it deserves to be slapping Hollywood studios across the face and announcing that not everything has to be a PG13 franchise based on a comic book. It's unlikely that this will the case and it remains to be seen whether or not the film will even be a success but it's encouraging to see that there are young auteurs at work who are fighting to craft new and exciting stories even if we only get to see the results every year or two.tinribs27.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Plenty of reviews here go into detail on this movie but I thought I'd add my two cents.Before seeing this movie I saw the plot summary listed by the Media Center TV listings and thought it a pretty lame idea. Bored I turned it on anyway at one point. The acting the direction the entertainment factor are all good but the base plot line stinks.Why would you have an mob assassin kill his future self and why would you pay him so much better for that hit than others? He just shot his future self him. He knows that he is going to be murdered by the people for whom he works. Why would he continue or want to work for them? The premise of murder in the future being too difficult to deal with bodies ... just because you can't hide the body doesn't mean people stop killing each other. Either they get caught more often or the number of disappearances reduces and more unsolved murders are on the books. The Mob could still kill people all sorts of ways.And why send them back 40 years earlier to be killed? Why not send them to the middle of the Atlantic rather than some cornfield. You wouldn't even need the assassin in the early years. Just drop your victims in the middle of the Pacific. Much cheaper and cleaner.The handling of future self verses younger self is very poorly handled. Everything that happens to the younger self would be in the memory of the older self such as the identity of the Rainmaker and he would never go after child 1 and 2. The rainmaker is supposed to have a plastic jaw from the gunshot at the closing scene. If is jaw had to be replaced how is it he is still talking?! With young Joe falling for Sara and Cid why would he ever continue his life to become old Joe in the first place? And how is it these GAT men of 2044 act as almost a police force and so brazenly? Jesse for example carrying a large caliber handgun at his waist in a front holster. And why would 2044 be so much easier a place to dispose of bodies than any other like a war zone or the black plague? Why even transport the back alive? There are far too many problems with the plot of this movie to warrant any sort of rave praise or recognition but it is somewhat entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "This story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the basics of time travel problems and paradoxes. It is a mystery why this chaos received so high grades. The plot in short mafia from the future sends their assassination targets into the present to be disposed of in the present there are killers so called loopers organized by a sadist from the future who await their targets and kill them. Before or later the looper receives a mission to kill his future self. Some of them fail to do so. And then the chase begins. First of all the premise is pretty stupid to use such advanced technology for such mundane goal. In the movie they have explained that in the future it is impossible to get rid of someone without being tracked. It is as it seems far easier to build a time machine then to avoid tracking technology from a collapsed society. Then we have a pretty horrifying and illogical scene of punishment for a failed looper. His present self is mutilated and his future self loses his limbs one by one. This is wrong all his wounds have been inflicted in the past so they would appear all at once in the future. And it is unresolved if his present self has been killed or will they keep him alive for the next few decades without his limbs until he is sent into the present. Then we have our hero Joe who escapes his captors in the future escapes his present looperself and begins his search for a mysterious future mafia boss the elusive Rainmaker who in the future has killed his wife. Then begins a Terminatorripoff. TerminatorJoe from the future does not have exact information about Rainmaker only his date of birth and he manages to narrow his search to only three kids he will have to kill. He eliminates two targets and of course his past self protects the real Rainmaker the fact that it HAS TO BE KNOWN to his future self even before his trip to the past because it is past no matter when the audience has find out this. Then the TerminatorJoe eliminates his entire exgang and there is a showdown between him his presentself and the RainmakerKid. The situation is resolved when the present Joe kills himself and the TerminatorJoe disappears. Which would set in motion time traveling paradox Terminator Joe does not exist so he cant be sent into the past and all his actions would be reversed. But no all his actions in the movie remain. The Rainmakerkid survives and he will grow up not to be mafia boss but exemplary member of future society. The end. Oh and this Rainmakerkid has a Carrielike telekinetic abilities which has nothing to do with a plot and is complete superficial. As for the pacing of the movie it is horrible. We begin with a bang literary then a movie comes to a halt and we have an hour or so pure boredom or character development. Then we have a final shoot out. All in all a very bad experience caused by a fanboyhype. If you want to see Bruce Willis travel through time watch 12 Monkeys a far superior movie in every sense.".

	onyx:emotionText "This story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the basics of time travel problems and paradoxes. It is a mystery why this chaos received so high grades. The plot in short mafia from the future sends their assassination targets into the present to be disposed of in the present there are killers so called loopers organized by a sadist from the future who await their targets and kill them. Before or later the looper receives a mission to kill his future self. Some of them fail to do so. And then the chase begins. First of all the premise is pretty stupid to use such advanced technology for such mundane goal. In the movie they have explained that in the future it is impossible to get rid of someone without being tracked. It is as it seems far easier to build a time machine then to avoid tracking technology from a collapsed society. Then we have a pretty horrifying and illogical scene of punishment for a failed looper. His present self is mutilated and his future self loses his limbs one by one. This is wrong all his wounds have been inflicted in the past so they would appear all at once in the future. And it is unresolved if his present self has been killed or will they keep him alive for the next few decades without his limbs until he is sent into the present.

This is precisely what Loopers does not have. There where so many holes in the plot that it became impossible to go with it. If your going to beam someone to the past to be killed why do you need a Looper. why not beam them straight to the furnaces. And if you have to use a Looper why rely on him to kill himself  let someone else do it. Seriously this was just a few of the canyon like proportions of the gaps in the plot of this flop. If Bruce was not in this i would have walked way before the end. I was fooled. You don't have to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rian Johnson fiction film as it contains no science Looper should be the line in the sand to say enough. Cinema going has turned into such a trite state that a film like this could be critically acclaimed and mass released. In the day and age of no heart films torture porn and saccharine dramas we again have to endure the waste of time resources and column space that a films like this garners. At a time when other worthwhile films slip into obscurity of small openings and DVD bargain bins.Looper commits the most atrocious of cinematic crimes it abuses the viewers trust in a way that even Von Trier would be embarrassed by in all his emotion manipulation. Looper's first thirty minutes run by smoothly. It appears selfassured paced confidently and even though the science and exposition is at best first grader and a worst lazy film making we can forgive all of this and just go with it. Taking in the substandard portrayal of the future with none of the background social commentary of other genre films. Apart from some lazy shorthand referencing Doretha Lang's depression photograph of Mother With Seven Children replaced with future vagrant mother and child leaving behind any social cause and effect. Then as Bruce Willis Old Joe meets Joseph Gordon Levitt's Young Joe the prosthetics take on a comically feel recalling Pachino's villain in Dick Tracy. We feel we are getting to the meat of the story instead we find derivative shootouts chases and uncompelling dialogue. At this point it all falls apart and the film runs into the dangerous space that modern cinema is not only touching on but beginning to permanently occupy. The portrayal of females in the film is typical of the misogynistic movement in modern America's cinema. Women are passive objects to be both lusted and tortured. In Lopper all the women portrayed are Whores or Junkies or have a perverse struggle with motherhood. Emily Blunt's character is given a backstory from a daytime drama. She shown to have no motivation apart from giving into compulsion. Any chance at positive female representation is at utter loss when she makes anoutof nowhere unconvincing booty call with her child's adapted frog toy to Young Joe. This scene is complete with ridiculously out of place romantic piano score. One gets the feeling the filmmakers have misogynist issues that should have been worked out in therapy and not in celluloid. Before all of this trite we get Bruce Willis's terrible act of killing a child an act in cinema that Hitchcock in his conversations with Truffaut remarked is a guaranteed way to lose an audience. It has been done with a level of respect in films such as Afflecks Gone Baby Gone. In Looper it is unforgivable not only because of the act but also in the way Johnson manipulates the audience and scenario for maximum effect making him parallel with pushers of Torture Porn.We are asked to believe that a child straight off a Disney set walks into the wrong film and towards a pretty suburb home which is unguarded in this state of societal collapse and mass crime. All this is for effect so when Old Joe shoots him we are more shocked more horrified It is one of the more distasteful and undoubtedly manipulative scenes in recent cinema. At the midway point the films personality splits and it turns into a horror film about telekinetic abilities? In what seems like a pinned on subplot brought to the fore because they didn't know how to end the film. The ending of selfsacrifice was a laughable attempt at catharsis. This infantile film should be laughed off the screens especially given the substandard performances Emily Blunts failure at acting 101 in the miming smoking scene comes to mind . Critics drawing positive attention even with the quip that it entertains should be ashamed. The role of the critic should be to enlighten. To shine a light towards the possibly unseen both within popular entertainment films and the unseen films that push the art form forwards.".

	schema:headline " Unfortunate this movie is getting so many negative reviews and comments";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been reading many reviews and the discussion boards on this site and after just coming back from enjoying it I was very disappointing to see so many negative reviews and comments. I'm definitely going to be responding to some comments in the discussion boards from some specific details of the movie but for now I will just write a review. And a positive review since there is so many haters out there.Firstly I have to say I am a big fan of scifi and specifically time travel. And as a huge fan I can see how since you're doing a moviestory about something that doesn't exist or something we don't understand of course there will be some plot holes and always ask why didn't he do this or why couldn't they do that or he could've just done this but being a film with only so much time to tell this unique story I think it did a great job with it. It takes a blacknoir sort of character and puts him in the year 2044 where time travel hasn't even been invented yet but eventually does and used by only secret criminal organizations. These organizations seem to gather future trash and are disposed by loopers who are told to wait at a specific time and wait to pull the trigger. Which so happens to be our protagonist who suspiciously reminds me of Max Payne. Now the kind of people that are sent back in time to be killed by loopers yes there is more than one we are given no prior knowledge of who they were or what they have done. What I really enjoyed was the fact of what they considered is bad? Who deserved to die? Anyway we are given a few glimpses of how the rest of the city looks in this time and how a first world country in some parts looks like a third world country in others. People thrive on scraps constantly stealing from one another and just surviving. While the rich are comfortable and most probably criminals or in some way affiliated with the crime land. Now I know this can be considered very cheap and clich but clichs are clichs for a reason. It's supposed to show how the world is brought down by it being run by criminal minds. People from the future who come from the past to make the past better and how these people are ignored for rich people to think of themselves. Which was the point of the movie because when you are talking about changing the future do you want to change the future to make it better for you? Or for the rest of the world? This would make more sense to people who have seen this movie but for those of you that haven't I just hope you don't read a lot of these reviews and decide not to waste your money. It talks about time travel different dimensions and for being a time travel movie leaves very little holes of course they are some but it's inevitable in a scifi. I can't finish this review without saying how great the cinematography of this film was. At time you could just feel how the character was feeling when he was giving narrating sections while showing all he did was murder faceless people over and over. And he actually has plans and start to care for who he is and what he becomes. I could probably talk about this movie all day but I don't want this review to be a novel so I'll finish it here but my main objective of this review is for people not to miss out on this great movie as the acting is top notch and at some part comical with a great new actor who is no older than 10! How the director makes Joseph Levitt's character act like Bruce Willis and either Rian or Joseph does a great job depicting it it's as if I was listening and watching Bruce Willis most of the film. My biggest complaint was the action sequences when it came to gun play. I found it lazy how everyone shot at Bruce Willis but the bullets flew all around him. There were times he took cover and I guess because his character is just smart enough he knows when to take cover and just shoot because the opponents he's dealing with are clumsy and inexperienced. Anyway small complaint for a very well done film. 910 Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Looper is a film that goes to extraordinary lengths to leave every base covered in its quest to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies and in my mind it deals with the problems associated with time travel very well. One thing I liked is that the older Joe is aware of everything the younger Joe is about to do which gives him an edge if they were to do battle. I also liked that the older Joe in true Bruce Willis style bypasses the whole idea of trying to work out how and why what is happening is happening by saying he can't be bothered to work it all out. As well as the older Joe having the advantage of memory over the younger Joe the younger Joe in turn has his own advantages which become apparent. There were several times when I thought I'd worked out what was going to happen or what a particular character's arc was going to be but the film cleverly manipulates its audience leading them down alleyways only to jump out at them from behind and spin them around. There is a nice early twist which gave me a smile and plenty more to keep you guessing right the way to the end. In the end it turns out that time travel plays second fiddle to another phenomenon which I was pleased by as there was no mention of this in the trailer which I've been trying to avoid for several weeks. The plot is multifaceted with each character having their own reasons for being where they are when they are and doing what they are doing. It is a dense plot which explores several different ideas and concepts both personal and scientific.As well as confidently dealing with a complex script which would have been very easy to either make too complicated or too full of holes WriterDirector Rian Johnson Brick also creates a very believable future and fills it with people and events which feel plausible. Cities have continued to expand upwards and outwards but they themselves are filled with tent cities in which a large vagrant class live. Life is cheap and hard in this world in which the have's and have not's are much more separated than today. There is enough in the film to make to world feel as though it is our near future and the technology on display feels as though it is a few logical steps along the road. I especially liked the ingenious solution to running cars after the inevitable the oil crisis and there's also a great line about China in there which had a lot of people laughing.The writing and direction are superb but another strength are the acting performances. Joseph GordonLevitt wears heavy makeup and prosthetics to make him look more like Bruce Willis and although this is occasionally a little distracting it looks unnervingly good at times especially closer up which is odd. The effect is actually better in close up than when JGL is in the middle distance. Underneath the prosthetics though GordonLevitt delivers a fine performance adopting a few of Willis' telltale mannerisms and affectations but avoiding pure mimicry. He appears confident and at ease in the dense lead role carrying off a mixture of hard edged killer and caring young man while switching from one to the other with ease. Bruce Willis equally is very good but we have seen this kind of performance from him many times before. Nevertheless he is on good form here. The chemistry between the two leads was great and really helped with the believability of them being one person. Emily Blunt was another actor who performed very well and in a departure from her more familiar roles. She adopts a convincing American accent drops a few FBombs and looks comfortable holding a gun. She brings to the fore the feminine caring side when it matters though. Probably the standout actor though despite the three A Listers is Pierce Gagnon a very young child actor who is incredible in a pivotal role. He and GordonLevitt have some funny and tense scenes together which work very well.Overall there was little I didn't like about Looper and it has gone straight into my Top 10 films of the year so far as well as being probably my favourite SciFi since 2009's Moon. It treats its audience with respect and isn't afraid to keep you them of the loop for a while as it teases them with false and sometimes seemingly false information. It is well designed and acted and features a wonderfully multifaceted and intelligent story which rewards patience and concentration with a fantastic ending.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Looper seems like it's inspired by Philip K. Dick's several works. It's a SciFi story that is set in the future with a quite interesting concept. The ads shows this as a typical nonstop action film. Surprisingly it's much better than anyone would expect. It's actually a mind blowing film that tells an unpredictable story and has a great amount of thrills. The performances are strong and the directing is solid. Unlike most modern SciFi films they depend on the action and the explosions. Looper is all about letting the audience intrigue all the way on the concept.The important thing you should expect in this film is the brilliance of the concept than the action. Yeah there's fighting and gunfights but it's mostly about the idea. The film tells it in a stylish and mind boggling way which makes it compelling. The story development is clever. The first half lets the viewers root for the film's world until the plot twists. It's great when a scene suddenly becomes confusing then it all make sense afterwards. Aside of its storytelling Joseph GordonLevitt did a great job playing the young version of Bruce Willis as he imitates Willis' accent and gruffness. He still plays the role with his own style. GordonLevitt is energetic and striking. The rest of the cast are excellent.The production design is decent. Its futuristic world looks magnificent and their weaponry looks awesome. The camerawork is one of the merits of the film. It makes the action look stylish and brings cool vertigo to the trippy moments. Every shot of the film is impressive. The most interesting one is when Joe was in the fields you prominently see a cloud trail on the sky remarking the scene. The script is smart enough for explaining its concept and making things gripping.Looper is one of those films that would stuck in your head in a long time because it's plain brilliant. It's so different to popular modern SciFi films. This film is not an action movie cookiecutter that leaves the high concept as the background of the film. This film simply narrates mindbends and intrigues which makes it amazingly interesting. The idea is original with some inspiration. Looper has the art the heart the tension and the brains that any science fiction fans would love.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another 'universally acclaimed' dud. Contrary to what critics claimed Looper is neither intelligently written nor competently executed and the blame falls entirely on Rian Johnson being both the writer and the director of this mess.The movie doesn't have a clear focus shifting halfway from being about the hero having to kill his own future self to being a mild Omentype horror featuring a little boy with frightening telekinetic abilities. The pacing is slow and uneven the cinematography offering plenty of particularly badly executed saturated blue lens flare effects is ugly and the poor establishing of timeframe environment and characters paired with the sloppy editing makes certain scene changes hard to follow. Even the casting choices are odd. Frankly I don't see any similarities between Joseph GordonLevitt and Bruce Willis. I feel sorry for the former as he had to wear prosthetics to make him resemble Willis more yet the result is utterly unconvincing. The film wastes precious time trying to round out Kid Blue's totally pointless character while glossing over Old Joe's much more important wife Suzie or Abe. In fact what we do get to know about Abe is conveyed through the laziest filmmaking device possible Joe's hurried voiceover monologue.Why Rian Johnson was given the opportunity to write and direct Star Wars Episode VIII is a mystery to me. His style is completely different and in Looper he failed to come up with a coherent script. The only thing he proved is he can't even handle an action sequence involving only three characters see the poorly edited final confrontation between Kid Blue and Joe 12  where did the Kid disappear?. The answer must lie in the lazy approach of the material. 'Time travel is messy' says Old Joe as if that solves the problem of the incoherent plot. Just like 'That's not how the Force works!' in the dismally bad The Force Awakens. OK I do understand. Lazy writing odd casting poor characterisation and worldbuilding choppy editing lens flares  check check check. Johnson might be a 'worthy' successor to Abrams.".

	schema:reviewBody "Time travel films open up all manner of questions because of the paradoxes every action and reaction produce. If X occurred surely Y would happen which means X wouldn't happen after all And so it is with Looper. Alas to avoid dishing out hugely unpopular plot spoilers I need to skirt around the concerns so you'll just have to come round with cake and we can discuss it in private. But there are some pretty substantial issues with Looper that cause questions to be asked and lead to more than a couple of possible explanations as to what exactly is going on. Don't see it alone you'll need a friend around to discuss it on the journey home.Equally don't be put off. You don't need to be Einstein to enjoy Looper as some of the audience proved In 2072 time travel is both possible and illegal and murder is more easily solved because corpses are harder to lose. However mobs and Mafiosi types are prevalent and have ingeniously devised a solution tie your victim up and send him back in time to a location where a looper will be waiting to blow hisher brains out. However when a looper's contract is up they find themselves blowing the brains out of their older self. Except when looper Joe Joseph GordonLevitt stares down the barrel at a version of himself that is thirty years older Old Joe Bruce Willis outsmarts him and so begins a cat and mouse chase where there are multiples of each species and most of them aren't called Joe.Confused? Good. Don't think any more or you'll confound yourself with your wondering and wandering along all the possible flows and tributaries that lead from them. Like Is he actually... Dammit.Along with the quirks possibilities and matters left to interpretation there are one or two clear booboos that cut against the rules writerdirector Rian Johnson Brick The Brothers Bloom has set himself. I'm sure you can work out from the subject matter that there are occasional murders so I'm giving nothing away by stating that a particular murder in 2027 cuts against the rules. It's not a major problem in terms of enjoyment but it does cast a shadow over everything if minor errors are not avoided.There's only one way to watch Looper suspend all disbelief put your logic in stasis and get on with enjoying the romp. With that frame of mind employed it's a superb film. No it's not as intelligent a film as Inception but it kicks the ass of Wanted and GordonLevitt is potentially a bigger star in the making than either Leonardo DiCaprio or James McAvoy.I'm not sure that I buy GordonLevitt as a young Willis but the transition is simple and effectively executed and it needn't stand in the way of a couple of hours of great entertainment. He's matured as an actor and though he's been stamping around Hollywood for a good couple of decades it's the last five years or so that have really seen him ascend the ranks and there's no sign of his climb slowing with both Spielberg's Lincoln and Don Jon's Addiction which he also wrote and directed in the can and Premium Rush earning plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic.As for Willis it's good to see him earning his fee again in a film worthy of his presence rather than phoning it in for a fat wad in the truly awful The Expendables 2. Emily Blunt Sara and Jeff Daniels ably provide support the former sadly barely stretched and the latter as Abe the loopers' boss clearly enjoying himself. Equally Paul Dano gives a wonderful trademark sniveling wretch performance that is all too brief. But Looper belongs to GordonLevitt and One Tree Hill's Pierce Gagnon as the child Cid whose middle name is probably Damian. Unnerving is an understatement! There is a very strong argument that the best person to direct a film is the writer because she knows it better than anyone. Clearly that wasn't the case with Maximum Overdrive Stephen King being the fine writer who should never be allowed either in front of or behind a camera again but with Looper it's a very strong case in point.Johnson though he bends his rules has created a multilayered rapidly paced trip that is littered with bodies and todiefor quips to wit I cleaned you up. And put a gun in your hand. He juggles the time zones effortlessly and maintains the excitement while allowing sufficient moments for us to pause cogitate and catch up before whipping us to the next sprint jump or shootout. Though he has nothing publicly on the slate there'll be plenty more from him in the next few years.As is increasingly the case my biggest complaint with last night's viewing has nothing to do with the film itself but with the screening namely the blown speakers all along one side of the auditorium big thumbs down to Cineworld and the moron in front who played with his phone and gave muted shrieks of excitement every time there was a shot or splatter of blood even taking the time to relive it with his friend. Who are these people? Why are they allowed to breathe? When will time travel come to my aid? Ah but these are niggles and hopefully you won't be subjected to such when you watch Looper. And do see it. Maybe you'll absolutely hate the confusion it causes you but if you don't mind giving a film some real thought and you enjoyed the possibilities of Inception then Looper is for you.Just don't think too hard.

However when a looper's contract is up they find themselves blowing the brains out of their older self. Except when looper Joe Joseph GordonLevitt stares down the barrel at a version of himself that is thirty years older Old Joe Bruce Willis outsmarts him and so begins a cat and mouse chase where there are multiples of each species and most of them aren't called Joe.Confused? Good. Don't think any more or you'll confound yourself with your wondering and wandering along all the possible flows and tributaries that lead from them. Like Is he actually... Dammit.Along with the quirks possibilities and matters left to interpretation there are one or two clear booboos that cut against the rules writerdirector Rian Johnson Brick The Brothers Bloom has set himself. I'm sure you can work out from the subject matter that there are occasional murders so I'm giving nothing away by stating that a particular murder in 2027 cuts against the rules. It's not a major problem in terms of enjoyment but it does cast a shadow over everything if minor errors are not avoided.There's only one way to watch Looper suspend all disbelief put your logic in stasis and get on with enjoying the romp. With that frame of mind employed it's a superb film. No it's not as intelligent a film as Inception but it kicks the ass of Wanted and GordonLevitt is potentially a bigger star in the making than either Leonardo DiCaprio or James McAvoy.I'm not sure that I buy GordonLevitt as a young Willis but the transition is simple and effectively executed and it needn't stand in the way of a couple of hours of great entertainment. He's matured as an actor and though he's been stamping around Hollywood for a good couple of decades it's the last five years or so that have really seen him ascend the ranks and there's no sign of his climb slowing with both Spielberg's Lincoln and Don Jon's Addiction which he also wrote and directed in the can and Premium Rush earning plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic.As for Willis it's good to see him earning his fee again in a film worthy of his presence rather than phoning it in for a fat wad in the truly awful The Expendables 2. Emily Blunt Sara and Jeff Daniels ably provide support the former sadly barely stretched and the latter as Abe the loopers' boss clearly enjoying himself. Equally Paul Dano gives a wonderful trademark sniveling wretch performance that is all too brief. But Looper belongs to GordonLevitt and One Tree Hill's Pierce Gagnon as the child Cid whose middle name is probably Damian. Unnerving is an understatement! There is a very strong argument that the best person to direct a film is the writer because she knows it better than anyone. Clearly that wasn't the case with Maximum Overdrive Stephen King being the fine writer who should never be allowed either in front of or behind a camera again but with Looper it's a very strong case in point.Johnson though he bends his rules has created a multilayered rapidly paced trip that is littered with bodies and todiefor quips to wit I cleaned you up. And put a gun in your hand. He juggles the time zones effortlessly and maintains the excitement while allowing sufficient moments for us to pause cogitate and catch up before whipping us to the next sprint jump or shootout. Though he has nothing publicly on the slate there'll be plenty more from him in the next few years.As is increasingly the case my biggest complaint with last night's viewing has nothing to do with the film itself but with the screening namely the blown speakers all along one side of the auditorium big thumbs down to Cineworld and the moron in front who played with his phone and gave muted shrieks of excitement every time there was a shot or splatter of blood even taking the time to relive it with his friend. Who are these people? Why are they allowed to breathe? When will time travel come to my aid? Ah but these are niggles and hopefully you won't be subjected to such when you watch Looper. And do see it. Maybe you'll absolutely hate the confusion it causes you but if you don't mind giving a film some real thought and you enjoyed the possibilities of Inception then Looper is for you.Just don't think too hard.

Honestly I can't imagine how deceiving Hollywood has become with flashy trailers. There's nothing there in the story. As you guessed from the trailer it's about a guy who is hitman who kills random peoplewho are masked for money. So these random people are from the future apparently as disposing bodies become impossible in the future the criminals transport these random folks from 2072 to 2042 where this guy kills them and cremates them. The guys who kill these randoms are called Loopers. And then there comes a time when his company wants to shut down and wants to terminate all the loopers. So this is where he meets his future selfolder self and has to kill. Of course he doesn't kill him because the future self knows every move he could think of. Finally after 118minutes of nonsense this guy finally realizes  oh wait I could just kill myself and the future self dies with me . With a poor storyline such as this one there was no way in hell the producers would have agreed to invest so the writers create a few more characters  such as a 2year old kid and her mommy to prolong the movie with some emotiondrama some telekinesis diseaseit's like HIV of the 2040s and more bla bla bla. This was the time I felt like walking out of the theatre if I hadn't paid 16. Absolute rubbish.".

It is nearly impossible to kill someone in the future and get away with it so they send them back to the past to be killed and disposed of. Why not kill them in the future and send their remains back to be disposed of.The movie dragged on and the ending was anticlimactic. It left me with the impression that he was the young boy on the train and he too was from the future a kind of echo. If that were the case then why did he not disappear too? Why would the gold stay when Willis disappeared. His disappearance indicates that he was not sent back and neither was the gold. Finally why would you leave a kid alive who you know is going to turn into the most monstrous person in history? Are we to believe that a kid with those powers will turn himself around with the help of his mother? Had he changed the time line that much? The kid already turned on of the gats into mush!OK...

	schema:reviewBody "Looper qualifies as a sordid science fiction thriller about time travel with an awful ending. Stir a little H.G. Wells in with some Stephen King and add a pinch of The Sopranos and you've got the basics of Brick director Rian Johnson's contrived unconvincing chronicle. Bruce Willis and Joseph GordonLevitt are cast as one in the same character in this disappointing actioneer that pits them against each other with a nowin outcome. Furthermore both protagonists emerge as more antiheroic than heroic. If you dismiss the fact these talented thespians bear scant resemblance to each other you must still consider the scarcity of information about a distant future as well as a warped premise. These shortcomings constitute the chief flaws in this imaginative but predictable scifi saga that unfolds in an erratic manner lacks quotable dialogue and features one character with no qualms about shooting innocent adolescents. By the time this uninspired Rrated 118minute spectacle has worn out its welcome you have no reason to care about anybody including an obnoxious telekinetic tyke who doesn't know when to keep his trap shut. Mind you the future has never appeared more dystopian. Some people are born with a mutation that enables them to levitate objects and these fellows find that they can lure facileminded babes into bed by making quarters float above the palms of their hands. The economy has hit bottom and vagrancy has become epidemic. Citizens can execute vagrants on the spot if they feel so inclined. Any time Hollywood undertakes a time travel tale the filmmakers conjure up some of the ugliest vehicles. While the cars and trucks look hopelessly tacky the motorcycles resemble something Luke Skywalker might ride. Basically you see a guy straddling a cylinder with handle bars. Computergenerated special effects blur everything beneath his feet so he appears to be cruising on a cushion of air.Johnson's screenplay is as amoral as his narrative premise is warped. Imitating the best Mafia movies of director Martin Scorsese Johnson relies on the voiceover narration of his lead character to acquaint us not only with his unusual profession but also with the seedy world in which he thrives. Kansas in the year 2044 serves as the setting. Presumably Johnson is making an ironic Wizard of Oz joke with his futuristic fable. The premise of Looper is that a guy can live the high life by killing individuals from the future who have been sent back to the past. Joseph Simmons Joseph GordonLevitt of The Dark Knight Rises is a killer who was brought up the ranks by his boss Abe Jeff Daniels of Blood Work to do his dirty work. Actually Abe was beamed back from the future to coordinate the equivalent of Murder Incorporated. In the 1940s the Mafia relied on outoftown gunmen from to ice enemies on their own turf. For example if the New York Mafia wanted to dispose of an adversary they contracted a Chicago gunsel to eliminate him. The rationale was that the authorities always sought a motive. What motive would a Chicago mobster have for killing New York mobster that he didn't know? This remained standard operating procedure until the authorities figured out the connection. Mobsters in the year 2074 cannot murder their adversaries because humans have become too easy to track. Since the mob cannot kill their own they contract hits out to mobsters from the past. Gunman designated 'loopers' kill and dispose of these victims that the mob has beamed back so nobody can find them. Our hero wields an exotic shotgun called a 'blunderbuss' and the looper waits near a cornfield in the middle of nowhere with his weapon and a tarp spread on the ground. Eventually a bound man with a bag over his head and silver ingots strapped to his back materializes. After he murders his prey Joseph incinerates him so no traces remain. When a gangland assassin in the future has worn out his welcome however the mob sends him back to the past so he can kill himself. They call this 'closing the loop.' After Young Joe botches the job of killing Old Joe he has to dodge the bullets of his former associatesknown as 'gatmen'until he can corner and kill himself. Losing one's older self is referred to as 'letting his loop run.' Joe's quickwitted alterego from the future Bruce Willis of Twelve Monkeys escapes and searches for a mysterious person known only as the 'Rainmaker.' This enigmatic individual wants to eradicate any trace of the loopers. Older Joe has been given a map with three possible addresses for this 'Rainmaker.' Joe wants to wreak vengeance on the 'Rainmaker' because the ladder dispatched triggerhappy gunmen who accidentally murdered his Asian wife. Instead of keeping things simple Johnson complicates matters with a subplot about a kid with telekinetic powers. Cid Pierce Gagnon of The Crazies lives on a sugar cane farm with his mom Sara Emily Blunt of The Adjustment Bureau who runs the place by herself. One of the locations that the Old Joe has is Sara's farm. He suspects Cid may be the reason that assassins are knocking themselves off. Essentially what we have here is a good assassin and a bad assassin who share the same body from drastically different decades. Young Joe stakes out Sara's farm so he can terminate Old Joe with extreme prejudice. This uneven high body count stinker doesn't flow well and is often confusing too. Moreover the logic is questionable. Wouldn't it be easier for the future mob to kill their enemies and send the remains back to the past for disposal? Furthermore what would happen if the victim that they sent back managed to escape like Old Joe and gum up the works? In most movies you look for a character that you can either love or envy. Nobody is lovable in Looper and parts of this movie are just plain downright dull.".

Elizabeth Knightly becomes captain of the Asian crew Orlando bloom becomes captain of the squid crew and Jack bounces between every crew as he is traded and captured for dealmaking. Orlando bloom's character wants to free his father Jack wants to be immortal Kiera Knightly's character wants to be with Orlando Bloom again the squid wants the sea goddess Elizabeth wants to kill the British captain for killing her father the British crew wants jack dead and the Asian crew wants to be a part of whichever crew is getting the treasure. but is there even treasure?!! the object they're all after is a beating heart. and yes it's as confusing as it sounds.OLD JOKES. just like the second all of the comedic moments in the third movie relied on recycled material from the first movie. the humor in 'pirates' can be attributed to six subjects 1 the wooden eye kudos to whoever thought to give that guy a wooden eye because you added 30 pages of plot to each film!! 2 jack the monkey the only character whose acting improved by the third film. he's also in a lot more of the scenes in the third movie. my boyfriend thought he was the best part. and he was right. 3 rum jokes the first movie relied heavily on rum jokes. since the third movie didn't know what the hell it was doing it hit up the booze too. 4 the sexual tension between jack and elizabeth. the clich trust me it would have never worked between us... lines return again. 5 jack getting slapped yes women love to slap jack sparrow. we got that one already thanks. 6 sheer stupidityslapstick humor the other nanoseconds of anticipated but unreceived humor relied on the dumb antics of the fat guy and the skinny guy with the wooden eye. CONFUSING PLOT. it felt as though the writers made this movie up as they were filming it and when they were running low on plot someone said i know let's make one of the crew members turn out to be a sea goddess!! and since there are only two female main characters one being Kiera Knightly the Jamaicansounding chick landed the role of sea goddess. this made the plot entertaining for about 20 seconds when the Jamaican chick turned into the 50 ft. woman and started talking like the StayPuft Marshmallow Man and then exploded into millions of crabs at which point i leaned over to my boyfriend and said haha she had crabs!! needless to say i don't plan on seeing the 4th or 5th or 6th Pirates movie. but i will be curious to see if Depp stays aboard. bottom line if you were planning on seeing pirates go see Waitress instead. written by Jena Ardell".

	schema:reviewBody "AWE was a decent close to the trilogy although they did leave it open for the possibility of a 4th.Lets go down the list 1 Holy cow. The CGI is breathtaking. The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. The filming sites were beautiful. These are a talented group of folks I tell ya. GREAT job.2 Acting .. both good and bad. Sparrow Barbossa Beckett Norrington Jones and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments. However they were offset by Pintel and Ragetti they got annoying in the 2nd film and it didn't stop here. While I enjoyed the idea of Tia Dalma's character I wasn't impressed with the performance by beautiful Miss Harris. I haven't especially liked Keira all that much in other things she has done and it was the same here. Decent actress but not overly impressive. Stellan's portrayal of Bill Turner was decent enough but a notch down from what we KNOW he can do. Now the best for last. Im a 100 hetero male and even I can say that Orlando Bloom is a VERY good looking guy. But for the love of pete this guy is one of the most terrible actors ever and strangely he was cast in two of the biggest most profitable trilogies ever. He has essentially played the same character in every movie just with different costumes. His mannerisms his low sexy voice his facial expressions .. ALLLL the same all the time. Sooo blahhhhhhh.3 The story was good but there was too much of it. It has been said here but I will say it again. At one point I just stopped trying to follow along and just enjoyed it. Everyone stabbed everyone else in the back at least once. It wasn't hard to follow but a movie like this isn't supposed to make you think. You want that go see .... Clue P the whole Singapore thing was just unneeded. While it did add a new element to the film it just seemed too forced.4 Running time was a tad bit long but it passed fairly quickly due to the great action sequences.All in all .. I was impressed with the movie but it has its problems. Much like part 2.I say go and see it. You wont be disappointed but you wont walk out thinking you just saw a masterpiece either.Just my thoughts ...".

It's great unexpected fun quotable and a visual spectacle. The characters are surprisingly likable and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack.The problem with the third movie as well as the second is that it lost touch with it's roots. The first movie while heavy with the supernatural stuff was still pretty grounded in a fairly accurate real world. The characters were over the top yes but still believable and above all relatable. Their motives and predicaments all made a great deal of sense i.e. Elizabeth wanting to marry Will Barbossa wanting to be free of the curse Jack simply wanting to get a boat so he could live his life of freedom. Unfortunately in the new movies the writers have lost touch with the first movie's charm. The plots are so convoluted it's difficult to decipher much less remember a character's desires and motives. It's much less emotionally grounded. It has also become so thick into this supernatural fantasy land that it has hardly any link to the real world at all. This would not have been a problem were the filmmakers not so intent on special effects and visual spectacles that they forgot to tell a good solid story.I believe this movie would have been better if the writers had kept to a more straightforward plot and toned down much of the grand spectacle stuff which really dominated the movies.".

Characters would change sides without any apparent reason or consequence. Chow YunFat was around for about ten minutes of screen time and did nothing. And the love angle between Keira and Orlando was nonsense. The final beach scene anyone? And Johnny doesn't even show up for at least 20 minutes! His first scene was the best one in the film in my opinion. And the thing is I really enjoyed 1 and 2. Pirates 1 was great and 2 was tolerable. But for some reason this installment triggered something in my mind that I could not let go.And SPOILER OK they have a god. What do they come up with? Let's turn her into a giant have her grunt in low bass tones and then turn her into thousands of crabs... Hmmm... Right.But... everyone's going to see this anyway. I mean they got my 10 right?".

The film should be great given a three hundred million dollar budget huge anticipation and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.Even in an action packed pirate movie overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.All the acting was perfectly fine with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite as well as the scenes at World's End which somehow involves a giant deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for he does a decent job but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing in order to encourage repeat viewings but honestly at nearly three hours the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic shots are wide locations are vast costumes are extravagant and the scope is large. However the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine as that's what makes these films unique.".

	schema:reviewBody "The more I think about this movie the more I like it. This is strange considering my low expectations. The first film was fun and I was very happy to see swashbuckling returning to movies but I never really bought into the script. I wasn't convinced that pirates were some sort of bloodbound race and I was powerfully confused by the distance between and physical relationships of various locations. But still good fun. The second film just kind of made me mad I loved the ending but it was just one example of how much it was a standard sequel every single quirk of the first film was referenced every single character had to return and it HAD to be structured  nay plotted  like Empire Strikes Back. This included reintroducing the Han SoloLeia love story where the female lead wants the antihero just to appease all the screaming Johnny Depp fans.

	onyx:emotionText "The more I think about this movie the more I like it. This is strange considering my low expectations. The first film was fun and I was very happy to see swashbuckling returning to movies but I never really bought into the script. I wasn't convinced that pirates were some sort of bloodbound race and I was powerfully confused by the distance between and physical relationships of various locations. But still good fun. The second film just kind of made me mad I loved the ending but it was just one example of how much it was a standard sequel every single quirk of the first film was referenced every single character had to return and it HAD to be structured  nay plotted  like Empire Strikes Back. This included reintroducing the Han SoloLeia love story where the female lead wants the antihero just to appease all the screaming Johnny Depp fans. It begged to be liked but aside from a great score great effects and some very funny moments it just came off as trite.And then we get At World's End which has everything you could possibly want in a pirate fantasy film Legendary ships riddling each other with cannon fire in a whirlpool screaming buccaneers swinging from one ship to the next swordfights on crow's nests and all that in about fifteen minutes.

	schema:reviewBody "The Pirates of the Caribbeanmovie serials is probably one I'll never grow tired off. The characters are fun and great always adventurous and spectacular to watch. It's really too bad that this time they felt the need to make things even bigger more complex and conclusive than the previous two movies. Really not needed. In my opinion the first movie Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl is still the best because of the reason that it's simple fun and choices to be purely entertaining. They already went wrong with this approach during the second movie Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest when they put in more new characters and different hard to follow plot lines. Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End goes on in the same trend as the previous movie. There are more new characters and as far as the new many plotlines are concerned...well let me just say that after a while I just gave up trying to understand the movie and just let the movie take me away with its visuals humor and other entertaining elements. And this movie regardless should really be able to take you away on a rollercoasterride of pure entertainment.No doubt in my mind that this movie could had become the best one out of the series. It had all the potential and budget for that now if they had only cut down about halve of the script...Most of the plotlines seem redundant and are actually far from believable because they contradict from what happened in the first two movies. The many betrayals among characters and sidepicking became really confusing after a while till it reached a point when you just didn't knew who was fighting for what. But like I said before after a while you just stop caring about it and simply enjoy the movie for what it brings you. It all is also the reason why the movie is now nearly 3 hours long. Now the movie is not as good and entertaining as the first but maybe just slightly better than the second one because of the large scale of this movie. The movie is definitely big. There is no lack of action as some people claim there is. There is just as much action as there is in the first two movies only difference this time is that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and therefor the movie also has some more talkingsequences and slower moments in it.The movie is also big with its musical score by Hans Zimmer and he actually succeeded in composing a new great theme for the movie. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score.The action sequences are definitely well constructed and at times pure eye candy. So are the special effects although I feel that the second movie was still better on that. It seems like they tried to overdo things this time and I'm mainly talking about the end battle when it comes down to its special effects by putting in some complex shots. No matter how good CGI is these days you still see that it's CGI. Most roles get extended in this movie. Marty Tia Dalma and even Jack the monkey and Cotton's parrot. But of course the movie still remains the Jack Sparrowshow. Really one of the best characters in recent years all thanks to Johnny Depp who provide the movie with its biggest laughs and most hilarious absurd moments. He still plays the character as good and fresh as he did for the first time 4 years ago. You can't just ever grow tired of Jack Sparrow. I was also very pleased to see Geoffrey Rush back as Barbossa. His role was bigger which allowed Geoffrey Rush to shine even more. Bill Nighy was also as good as always as Davy Jones. Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting also has really improved over the years. I was actually surprised to see how much of the movie Keira Knightley carries this time and how well she does this. Even in the sequences with Geoffrey Rush she does. She also gets to do more interesting in the movie when it comes done to action. In a way she has taken over the Will Orlando Bloom role in this movie this time and Will himself gets pushed more to the background this time compared to the first two movies which really shouldn't bother most people unless you're a teenagegirl of course. She handles both the action and comical sequences really well. And even Keith Richards shows up in an already classic cameo as Jack's father. But some role also got narrowed down to my regret such as Jonathan Pryce's and Jack Davenport's and lets not forget the Kraken.Still I really wouldn't mind seeing more Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the future if needed with new actors and characters as long as Johnny Depp stays as Jack Sparrow. The serials still have more than enough potential and haven't dried up yet.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Well after seeing Pirates II I didn't think it was possible for III to be any worse.... I was wrong. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I understand that some movies are made just for ridiculous but fun action sequences and little or no plot line and you can definitely tell which movies those are but this one tried to have a decent plot and failed miserably. Yes the action sequences were fantastic and full of some of the most ridiculous stunts imaginable but they in no way saved the horrible attempt at a plot line. With hardly any character development far less Jack Sparrow than there should have been the abandonment of the love triangle the overlydramatic attempt for an epic and the complete lack of trying to be at least somewhat historically correct the writers have caused cinema to reach a new low.The first problem with the movie is that Jack Sparrow isn't seen for half an hour. Johnny Depp is pretty much what has made the Pirates films. And when you do finally get to see him he has been downgraded to the status of comic relief rather than the humorous hero he has played in the past. It is because of this that you actually start to wish that you see less of him. The corny oneline jokes that just seem to perpetually flow forth from his mouth get old very very quickly.The second problem is of course the total lack of true interaction between the characters. Most of their speech is devoted to furthering the already failing plot and the little that is actual development of their relationships is poorly written. Though I hated the idea of the love triangle between Will Elizabeth and Jack introduced in Pirates II I was sad to see them completely abandon that idea acting almost as though it had never happened.The main problem that I had with the plot for this film is that it never really settled down. It was either moving forward far too fast for most of the audience to keep up with or so dead still that half the audience was falling asleep though the latter was far rarer. Plus the introduction of so many different plot devices and magic just made the story seem so implausible. I mean I am a firm believer in the willing suspension of disbelief in small doses such as the amount of disbelief I had to suspend in the first film but if I was going to actually enjoy this movie I would have had to have suspended it for almost the entire length of the film and that's hard to do for near three hours.And finally the first film as far as I know was pretty much on par in terms of historical accuracy and pirate mythology. That is it was very true to the era it was based in and didn't have to add in all sorts of fantastical magical things to give the film a sense of adventure. The only magic involved was the curse of the medallions. Which while it may have dominated most of the plot was rooted in some history and was presented in a plausible way. For that I can suspend my disbelief. But when they start giving physical manifestations to Davy Jones granted that was introduced in the second film but still and start calling Greek seanymphs Calypso Pirate goddesses I'm sorry but I just can't do that. Not to mention them trying to claim that the pirates as treacherous and murderous as they were were actually all united under one flag is just ridiculous. No historical value and very weak story value whatsoever.All in all this film surpassed how terrible I expected it to be so horribly that I am honestly considering walking back to the theater and asking for compensation for the three wasted hours of my life.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't understand what happened here. I absolutely loved part 1 and 2 but this time things went very wrong. A couple of things I want of my chest  As mentioned before by other people the movie has too many subplots making it hard to follow as you are constantly thinking about what the last scene meant.The whole calypso character is a joke. In part one The Black Pearl was 'da bomb'. In part two it was the flying Dutchman and the Kraken. Now in part three they needed something that could top that all and they come up with some fake God which does nothing in the end except make the weather bad. How cool is that? Not  All the action in the film is stuffed together making the biggest part of the film very boring and the 'exiting' part is over the top. I like action a lot but this was just too much. Especially with the rest of the movie having only a few small action moment.I swear that if Lord of the rings hadn't happened we wouldn't have seen such a stupid armada of battleships at the end. How unrealistic.Especially for a Disney film How lame to let Will die. Everybody would like to see that couple Will and Elizabeth together! For God's sake Capt Jack even wanted to be the next captain of the flying Dutchman why not let him? Everybody happy!  The worst thing is that because this movie disappoints me a lot part two has become useless as well! That film part 2 ends abruptly so we are forces to watch or even buy part three or else two is unfinished.You probably will watch this movie anyway I can't blame you I made the same mistake but if you don't need to at least don't watch it at the movies. Just rent it some day. They don't deserve the money.Thanx for reading!".

	onyx:emotionText "I really don't understand what happened here. I absolutely loved part 1 and 2 but this time things went very wrong. A couple of things I want of my chest  As mentioned before by other people the movie has too many subplots making it hard to follow as you are constantly thinking about what the last scene meant.The whole calypso character is a joke. In part one The Black Pearl was 'da bomb'. In part two it was the flying Dutchman and the Kraken. Now in part three they needed something that could top that all and they come up with some fake God which does nothing in the end except make the weather bad. How cool is that? Not  All the action in the film is stuffed together making the biggest part of the film very boring and the 'exiting' part is over the top. I like action a lot but this was just too much. Especially with the rest of the movie having only a few small action moment.I swear that if Lord of the rings hadn't happened we wouldn't have seen such a stupid armada of battleships at the end. How unrealistic.Especially for a Disney film How lame to let Will die. Everybody would like to see that couple Will and Elizabeth together! For God's sake Capt Jack even wanted to be the next captain of the flying Dutchman why not let him? Everybody happy!  The worst thing is that because this movie disappoints me a lot part two has become useless as well!

To bad the plot is to massive for its own good.Believe it or not but it would take me at least twenty pages to summarize the plot. Yes it has that much to it. I'm not even going to bother to try and explain it. Short to say there is a new plot point about once every ten minutes and sometimes three or four all at the same time. This makes the film next to impossible to fallow. By the end I was so lost I just didn't care anymore.Also many plot points were simply added to add spice and were not thought threw. There is a massive goddess subplot that ends up going no where and when they at last bring forth the goddess she does nothing more then explode into crabs and doesn't really help anyone out at all making the whole plot line unneeded. It simply had no pay off.Also since a lot of the story lines weren't thought threw they come to moronic conclusions. The ending with Will is so dumb I don't even know where to start. Plus there's the ending to the love story which has Will and Elizabeth getting married in mid battle. The scene is so corny I can't even put it into words. It felt like a school play with a big budget at that point.Lastly there are no more heroes in the series. Everyone is now stabbing each other in the backs to get what they want and they all secretly want to kill each other. Will who in the first film was a noble man trying to save the love of his life has now become a heartless backstabber who only wishes to save Jack just so he can kill him and get his ship. Elizabeth is also heartless and betrays all she meets. These are not the heroes you came to care for at the start of the series. They're all just greedy brats in things for their own gain. Will use to be a likable guy. Now he just comes off as well mean.Other then that there is not much to say. The film simply is a confusing end to what could have been a great series. Sad really.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked POTC At World's End very much. Let me explain to you whyI liked the scenario. The first time I saw the movie it didn't seem right and I felt that it was made up to cover plot holes. I though that Will taking Davy Jones's place on the ship was just a petty excuse for a plot twist and most of the stuff that happened seemed pointless. But I went to see it again just to give it a second chance. In the end it seemed to me that the scenario was logical. You can finally understand why Tia Dalma brought Barbossa back to life and helped him find Jack. It was all because of the fact that she wanted to come out of her human bonds. Also Davy Jones's death can be explained. First of all if he hadn't died Will would have died instead. Secondly if he hadn't died Tia Dalma would have probably killed him since she was so angry with him for imprisoning her to her human body. After dying and falling in the whirlpool it was like he was falling in the arms of Calypso since she was what made the whirlpool. But it is a tragic irony that Davy Jones did not know that Tia Dalma was mad at him. So after Jack gave his sword to Will to stub the heart Will should take his place on the ship. So Elizabeth stayed with Will or at least with nobody other in her heart but Will. I believe all the above was a smart way to end every love story. Everyone was finally where he or she would be happier sort of. But the true ending of the story was really the last scene. The scene where Jack is on the port of Tortuga once again marooned by his crew and Barbossa. Gibbs is not among those that betrayed him just like it happened in the first movie. Also Barbossa is after some treasure that gives eternal life but Jack knows the only way to help him find it since he stole the map. Just like it happened in the first movie when only Jack knew that it was William's blood they needed not Elizabeth's. Jack and Gibbs repeated that line they said at the first movie Take what you can Give nothing back. Also I think that the way the movie ended with Jack humming the song he was humming at the end of the first movie was a great way the writers came up with to tell you Know what? This is not the end. It is the end of the onscreen trilogy but not the end of the lives of the characters. It's just another beginning. And one last element that made this movie the best way to end the trilogy is the filling that it gives you. It's the feeling that Captain Jack is always going to run after his precious Pearl never quite being the captain for a long time. But come on! You can't expect this movie to be like the first POTC movie especially since Pirates 2 seemed to be selling more Hollywood than pirates. If you don't want to like it it's your right to do so. I am just suggesting that you give the movie a chance to impress you. I did give it a chance and you know what? I loved it. Sorry if I made you have a headache with all that I said about Pirates. I just think that it is a misunderstood movie.".

The first was good but too long by a half an hour the second bad and too long by 45 minutes this one was god awful and shouldn't have started in the first place. Orlando Bloom's character doesn't really die which is a joke and I didn't care about anything that happened in it for a second.

An incoherent plot insipid cinematography contrived comedic timing and uninspired acting all add up to two hours of pure torture. The premise of the first two movies were gripping and compelling and it was no surprise that At World's End enjoyed very successful opening weekend box office sales given that people were ready for a fabulous final installment of the trilogy. At World's End however is the cinematic equivalent of garnishing an exquisitely made souffl with a piece of lard.The overreliance and overemphasis on Jack Sparrow's drunken stupor silliness becomes old after 17 minutes. The maelstromfighting scene lasted no less than 45 minutes by which time most of the audience were actually struggling to keep the coke and popcorn down. Keira Knightley's stubborn refusal to display emotion of any sort was equally vomit inducing. I've also seen pedalpowered wheelchairs that had more relevance than Chow Yun Fatt's random bizarre appearance.Perhaps the only redeeming factor of the movie was the fact that the set and props were admittedly intricate and very wellcrafted. The CGI was topnotch as well. But if Mr Bruckheimer and Mr Verbinski sunk into the backseats of their Bentleys and thought Okay the plot's rubbish the acting is beyond awful but hey! The CGI's great and we've got Jack Sparrow that's enough to plaster up the festering wounds of this horror show they were sorely mistaken.No warmblooded human being will walk out of this movie feeling satisfied and entertained. If you're looking to get some great swashbuckling underwater action with oodles of creepy sea creatures and brazen barnacles I highly recommend any episode of Spongebob Squarepants.".

Whereas the first movie was fun and original and the second one a little more cartoony but just as entertaining this third Pirates film just nose dives completely missing that mark each and every time.Jack Sparrow was such a cool character in the first two pirates films. He seems so uncomfortable here. Depp almost appears bored with the part. Orlando Bloom is not a good actor. He's annoying and I have no idea why. Furthermore his character is a pain to watch. Whose side is he on? What is he fighting for? Why should I care? He is at this point the only thing making it possible for there to be an overblown clich love triangle between Jack Elizabeth and Will. And folks men and women you're not watching Keira for her acting. She's not good at that. But looking hot in just about anything less is more in this case is something she does exceedingly well. I'll watch her for that. Other performances  dull. Drawnout. Uninteresting. But I will say this the best overall performance in this film comes from Jack Davenport as Norrington. He plays it with such conviction such sincerity than even the dumbest of lines sound decent coming from him. The storyline sounded as though it could open a unique chapter in the story when he reappeared in Pirates 2 but I believe audiences will be very disappointed in how he's handled in this film.The plus side  good special effects. Negative side  everything else. Boring and dull performances all around except by Davenport a very slow and often confusing storyline that went no where without explosions or action sequences the movie could lose fortyfive minutes and the broad sense that this film was both too rushed and too poorly conceived. Had the writers been given a couple years to really pound out a good script the movie would have been as good as the other two. Instead it truly stands out as being one of the worst movies I've ever seen.".

Men are extinct all living men were killed by a bomb and the surviving women have to leave under the Earth's surface in complexes. One of the women says Encounter with men are areal. Our heroes don't panic however... they have only one goal reestablishing somehow the old regime. Not an easy task considering they are the only men alive surrounded by manhating maneating fanatic women whose goal is either to naturalize or to kill them.One can't forget that this movie was made in 1984 when communism was in its place and didn't seem to melt yet. Nowadays I wonder a bit that it was allowed to show in the cinemas because this movie is a perfect satire of any totaliarist regime including communism and blind fanaticism. There is very subtle humor between the lines and this humor is what makes this movie a cult movie. However serious the theme the movie catches the mood and the movements so easily and with such wit that you can't help but laugh. Making fun of something is the best way to criticize it and Seksmisja is a perfect example.This movie is highly recommended for anyone in the world. Seeing it only once isn't enough... to get the whole idea and the subtler humor you have to watch it several times. If you want to enjoy it fully get the original Polish version with subtitles.Someone hurts you? You're in trouble? You can count on Women's Council!".

The film operates on several levels appearing to be just an excuse for a sexist pile of nonsense but in reality it's a very funny film with quite a bit of sociopolitical comment but not too much to spoil it.The basic plot is of two regular guys who get the cryogenic treatment having sneaked cigarettes and a hip flask into their sleeping tubes. They are awakened many years later to find that they are the last two men on earth an Mbomb having killed all the men in the world! The existing women all live in underground complexes and have discovered how to make babies without men somehow. Our two fellas are allowed to live just so long as they have the offending items between their legs removed.

Growing there is a solitary apple which they pluck and bite into and immediately spit out as it's sour. This turns out to be the last apple on the last tree in the world and does not go down too well with the lady president.There is some quite bizarre incidental music which did start to grate but this is the best of all those films you trip over late at night when you really ought to have gone to bed Moon 44 anyone?you'll laugh you'll wince you'll not hurl but you might think.".

It was a little difficult to find it because of its title.There are at roughly two types of science fiction. One type focuses on the fascination with science and tries to depict the future. Another type seeks to satirize or criticize contemporary society by simplifying the problems in futuristic settings.This movie is of the second kind. Two men are frozen down and wake up 50 years later in a society populated only by women. Not a very credible story but that's not the point of the movie. The movie is full of funny dialogues as well as satire of questions of sexuality and the meaning of equality in contemporary society.The movie is highly recommended. It also gets away with the special effects quite well despite a low budget.".

The two men have to rely on their better features wit courage honest male friendship and strong faith in humanity in their pursuit for freedom and restoring the laws of nature.The political satire is very well constructed since the women's society as presented in the movie has all the features of the totalitarian regime. The loyalty to the League equivalent of the Party is superior to all interpersonal relationships and what is the most significant the League's propaganda purposely misrepresents reality as well as history.The gender stereotypes are explored with rather positive attitude showing that there's no use of denying our own nature and that the differences between the genders even with their weaknesses is what we are attracted to.The outcome of these ideas is that you definitely become a better man and a better woman when you are allowed the freedom of thought.I believe you don't have to know Poland to understand the movie but in fact any experience with political science fiction is enough.

Sexmission is full of lighthearted humour interwoven with deep psychological insight and even prophesy. If it is not enough there are beautiful sets and costumes. The quality of the production amazes me. I expected it to be a lowbudget childish comedy shot on a paper set but it turns out to be a hightech thoughtprovoking scifi with an artistic concept and a wonderful handmade background.While it is a Polish movie I think that during its translation into English lots of slight shadow meanings of the genuine cutting remarks will be lost while Russian as an example does a perfect job. Such phrases as babskiy tribunal are perfect translations.This movie reminded me of the following cult dramas Underground Road Warrior and Planet of the Apes. But as to this one I don't remember last time laughing throughout the whole picture. This movie turned my usual evening into amazing experience.I've got four films by this director in my home DVD collection already and they all are outstanding comedies.10 out of 10.

It's hardly known at all here in the West but if any Polish movie is ripe for rediscovery it's this for here is a comedy that is laugh out loud funny and consistently charming from beginning to end with something of a fairytale quality to its ridiculous plot.The title says it all really. Eve a penniless or should I say zlotyless young student has nowhere to lay her head for the night and all her efforts to find a bed including a potential spell in jail amount to nothing. It may be a slight little picture but it has a very sweet nature and is beautifully directed. The smile never really left my face.".

	schema:headline " Polish classic World War II comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is one of classic Polish comedies often aired in Polish TV and I like it quite much. The main hero is a Polish soldier Private Franek Dolas a charming wangler who is convinced that he had started World War Two by his accidental shot it is a bravura life role of Marian Kociniak. He escapes from a POW camp and then desperately tries to join the Polish Army organized in Great Britain. The film is quite long being a threepart trilogy but we follow adventures of Private Dolas from 1 September 1939 towards the end of the war across Nazi occupied Europe Middle East and North Africa. And there is also a romance plot in last part. The whole story is inspired by fates and stories of many Polish soldiers who escaped from occupied country and got to French or British allies to continue fighting which was truly a difficult task during the war in a lack of common borders. Many of them found themselves eventually in North Africa where Polish units fought on British side in 19411942 against Germans and Italians. One patrol even captured Italian military bordello indeed...Since Franek Dolas travels through different countries a humour mainly explores national stereotypes and cultural clashes but in rather gentle and nonderogatory way. So the Germans are unable to write down an overcomplicated Polish name Brzeczyszczykiewicz the Yugoslavians are hospitable while the British are stiff and care about nothing during a tea time it also was an experience of Polish soldiers. On the other hand Poles personalized by the main hero are reckless and always get into trouble. In fact Private Dolas succeeds in many things only by accident. French captain is always drunk and wants to fight for Marshall Petain  but on the other hand his soldiers join the Free French to continue fighting. The Italians try to surrender or they fight only for their women  but we also see brave Italian commandos. A great and remarkable thing in this film is that all characters speak their own languages what makes language barriers obvious and increases reality feeling.The film was made as black and white but gained much thanks to a digital colorization.".

There is a second and third part to this film. We ordered both parts 1 and 2 and we ended up watching both but we almost gave up in the middle of the second film and promptly canceled part 3. There is nothing funny in this supposed comedy. It's stupid. Worse Polish films we saw. It reminded me a little bit of Hogan's Heroes but this was worse. Why would we want to make a comedy about WWII in Poland? There was nothing funny about WWII.

He gets himself into a much deeper situation throughout the movie. There are several real funny lines in the movie but I doubt they are quite as funny when translated into English. Jerzy Stuhr arguably Poland's greatest actor plays the lead detective and anything he says is funny. In Polish comedies the humor is not so much in what is said but how it is said. The humor for the most part comes from the ironic tones and facial expressions of the actors. For those who are not familiar with Polish film history the first and for a long time only film making academy was in Poland. Many of the camera crews set directors and props directors from Hollywood were actually educated at this Polish institute. I hope you enjoy the film. Cheers.".

When Siara orders that TV whore to be killed the viewer believes him that he was annoyed enough by her while human life does not mean much to him. Nasty people usually are not cowards they expect their bad deeds will catch up with them. When Jurek Kiler announces to Ewa that he has orders from Siara to kill her she responds bravely then shoot. She is consistent in her nasty character  which means the actress that plays her is doing a good job.

But the absurdities make perfect sense in the political context of Poland of the 1970th. The movie shows Communism is its final stages of decay. The system becomes a game with complex and absurd rules. Only people who master these rules can be successful. The film's hero is one of them.The key to understanding the movie is the dialog between the hero and a film producer about a straw beara giant prop for the movie they are making. The producer uses common sense to try to minimize the movie's production costs. The hero explains to him how rational arguments don't apply in the system they are living in. The simpleton film producer is initiated in the ways of the system.There is a progression from George Orwell's stern an tragic 1984 through Terry Gilliam's tragicomic Brazil to the comically absurd Teddy Beara progression which reflects the various stages and versions of Communism. The Polish version is the most benign and tongueincheek and the film describes it perfectly.".

The system becomes a game with complex and absurd rules. Only people who master these rules can be successful. The film's hero is one of them.The key to understanding the movie is the dialog between the hero and a film producer about a straw beara giant prop for the movie they are making. The producer uses common sense to try to minimize the movie's production costs. The hero explains to him how rational arguments don't apply in the system they are living in. The simpleton film producer is initiated in the ways of the system.There is a progression from George Orwell's stern an tragic 1984 through Terry Gilliam's tragicomic Brazil to the comically absurd Teddy Beara progression which reflects the various stages and versions of Communism. The Polish version is the most benign and tongueincheek and the film describes it perfectly.";

The most amazing fact is that nobody even noticed the he can only speak Italian. However due to magnificent Polish hospitality he finds himself right in the middle of a big ceremony. And if this wasn't enough he is also dragged into an affair with a pretty Polish lady.In order to be able to fully understand all the dialogues comical situations and many sometimes very odd accidents one has to know even a bit about the history of Poland in the postwar era.

In current times the making of Nothing funny must be considered as a landmark event for Polish cinema as it has revealed itself as a comedy film with a difference. Firstly it is funny and even goes beyond the traditional definition of funny as it uses the medium of cinema to deride the profession of cinema. Secondly it shows that there is no other better authority than a film director to do justice to the portrayal of a director's mind especially all his weird fantasies including sexual fantasies. This is what we get to see in this film whose comical incidents derive their source from some very ordinary situations of one's mundane existence. It appears that Koterski has made a conscious decision of not hurting the sensibilities of his viewers as his film might appear a little mischievous but it never attempts to be offensive.

Fortunately there are better examples of Polish culture.Suggested solution recycle all copies.";

	schema:headline " Gem of Polish Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Similarly to greatly renowned productions of Italian Neorealism that aimed at depicting the postwar reality in a convincing manner this rarity of Polish cinema directed by Leonard Buczkowski appears to be a true surprise. Depicting the postwar period in the ruins of Warsaw it surprises us with its realism and humor that unlike many productions of the time still create a desirable effect. Buczkowski who made this film two years after famous FORBIDDEN SONGS supplies us with something different here but not at all less appealing. Bearing the same title as the famous silent classic by Georg Wilhelm Pabst THE TREASURE offers a brilliant display of witty situations and satirical glimpse of society not merely the society of the time.An interesting note is how finely the film mocks the social drawbacks like greed prejudice jealousy and celebrates the values like honesty youthfulness and determination. Let us have a brief outline of the content.A newly wed couple Krystyna Danuta Szaflarska and Witold Jerzy Duszynski are looking for a flat in the ruined Warsaw. As difficult as it may seem the enthusiastic young husband finds a seemingly suitable flat to live. They desire privacy no doubt about that. Luckily they seem to have found it in a beautifully equipped flat owned by distinguished Honorata Jadwiga Hojnacka. The silent witness of their joy is a little piece of paper where Witold notes...'treasure'...the spot where his treasure his wife will sleep. Yet problems arise when it occurs that they are not at all alone and will never be left alone. There are more residents of the flat some displaying exceptional humor some highlighting suspicion some depicting indepth interest in what is going on. They seem to be individual phenomena to a certain moment...when it occurs to them that a 'treasure' is hidden somewhere in the flat. The mutual quest combined with curiosity and greed will unite them...The storytelling as simple as it may seem addresses certain values that have always been deeply rooted in the society. The witty almost comical manner in which the movie develops that aspect may sometimes occur dated. Nevertheless it never leaves a viewer totally indifferent to its gist. However we can skip that point and see the film solely for performances where there is still much to be celebrated.The characters are exceptionally clear memorable and very convincing. They make the story vibrant and interesting. Danuta Szaflarska the actress who has herself experienced the tragedy of war does not resort to certain melancholy in her role but like in FORBIDDEN SONGS supplies us with a captivating portrait of a young wife with her dreams desires expectations. This role is very much alike the real Danuta Szaflarska with her ever present optimism and warmth. We feel the story with her. But as an actress she is never powerful alone and leaves much freedom to her costar Jerzy Duszynski who portrays Witold. His determination becomes transparent in many scenes and an almost symbolic reference to the young generation  the eyes of the future. They are the couple of hope amidst the ruins of the old society. Among the supporting cast a particular mention must be made of Adolf Dymsza who portrays Alfred Ziolko with excellent humor and some hilarious touches. His imitations of sounds animals' sounds long remain in the memory of the viewer. A great comedian! THE TREASURE is a film highly worth seeing because it is far from any post war propaganda but rather depicts the difficult reality with a necessary element of humor that is a true 'treasure' in our hands which always makes life more endurable. 810".

Elegant humor brilliant script impeccable play of all actors made this film a classic which it fairly remains to be now. It's hard to believe that it was filmed in 1982 in the middle of the political and social turmoil which besotted Poland that time the country was on the brink of a civil war but one will never even guess it while watching the movie. It's all thanks to the genius of Juliusz Machulski the director script writer and the brother of Jan Machulski who played the main hero Kwinto. The film takes place in the 1930's before the war and when Poland was still rich and booming. Kwinto is a famous bank robber as well as a prominent jazz trumpeter the soundtrack to the film is another winner main theme is a sheer elegant Dixie tune. He comes back from the prison and learns that one of his friends is killed that his wife had gone to another man and that the greedy and mean bank director Gustav Kramer is in fact the very man who had helped Kwinto to go to jail and who had helped his friend to be killed. Thus the revenge starts. Kwinto is helped by his old pal Dunczyk extremely funny and smart crook two slightly silly but workaholic bandits and a beautiful lady Natasza played by then young and now very famous Elzbieta Zajacowna. The whole gang starts a devilishly clever plan and finally Kwinto achieves his main aim  money is returned to all victims of Kramer's black deeds Kramer himself is in prison and the happy gang is merrily celebrating the event. This is a pale and colorless description you really have to see it to feel the brisk Polish humor comic gags and unbelievable twists of plot. Watch it this is the brilliant classic of Soviet era Polish cinema  breezy fresh and utterly smart".

He comes back from the prison and learns that one of his friends is killed that his wife had gone to another man and that the greedy and mean bank director Gustav Kramer is in fact the very man who had helped Kwinto to go to jail and who had helped his friend to be killed. Thus the revenge starts. Kwinto is helped by his old pal Dunczyk extremely funny and smart crook two slightly silly but workaholic bandits and a beautiful lady Natasza played by then young and now very famous Elzbieta Zajacowna. The whole gang starts a devilishly clever plan and finally Kwinto achieves his main aim  money is returned to all victims of Kramer's black deeds Kramer himself is in prison and the happy gang is merrily celebrating the event.

The actors' performances are very natural nobody is fighting in matrix style and nobody is showing off by shooting the whole supply of ammo into baddies. The four crooks who are the main characters of this picture are quite nice. The crime they are committing is understandable and can be justified by the standards of downtoearth human conscience. Though I think that I watched this film attentively I still cannot get at least one machination shown the one with the fingerprints. It means I will have to rewatch this comedy again and I've got nothing against it while the movie is a real treat.My vote is 10 out of 10  let me proclaim that this is the best crime film I have seen so far. Pulp Fiction has no chance it is like a teen music video if compared to this clever cinema. Thank you for attention.".

All is here  kidnapping murder fire in the garage terrible revenge of Kramer and the extremely interesting intrigue about Kwinto's death. You cannot say for sure if he was really killed or not. Humor is everywhere here  smart lines of each actor impossibly funny part of the prison director as well as of masqueraded Nazi officers. Up to the end you cannot guess what the final may be like. And the only sad part here is that you may see those Nazis and feel that very very soon the real fascist armies will take the whole Poland This film is so clever and bright that it may be praised as one of the alltimebest sequels ever made along with Matrix 2 or Star Wars. Highly recommended for the connoisseurs of intelligent humor and cleverly thought over plot.".

All is here  kidnapping murder fire in the garage terrible revenge of Kramer and the extremely interesting intrigue about Kwinto's death. You cannot say for sure if he was really killed or not. Humor is everywhere here  smart lines of each actor impossibly funny part of the prison director as well as of masqueraded Nazi officers. Up to the end you cannot guess what the final may be like. And the only sad part here is that you may see those Nazis and feel that very very soon the real fascist armies will take the whole Poland This film is so clever and bright that it may be praised as one of the alltimebest sequels ever made along with Matrix 2 or Star Wars. Highly recommended for the connoisseurs of intelligent humor and cleverly thought over plot.";

	schema:reviewBody "Vabank 2 is a sequel that follows the formula of the first movie . It's not strange that in the end the movie isn't as half surprising or funny as the original . It's more predictable and there aren't any interesting new characters . It seems that Machulski writer and director  has run out of ideas . The movie is quite surprising in the first 40 minutes . Later  it goes into standard and predictable territory  a bait  a trap and a repeat of the final of first movie.Still it's an OK sequel . There are some good jokes here . The music is as elegant and catchy as before and acting is still good . I would only complain about performance of Jacek Chmielnik Moks . He's overacting so much that I was annoyed every time he was on screen. In his defense he signs really well the Vabank song that appears here. The song is really cool and to be honest that's the only really new element here.It's no match for the first one  but still a watchable sequel. By the way  IMDb is wrong. This movie was made in 1984  not 1985.I give it 510.".
