Being a professional musician myself I can especially appreciate the symphonic ambience in which it takes place.  I can also appreciate the possible parody Sturges might have had in mind of the great British conductor of those days Sir Thomas Beecham.  The greatest and most memorable visual effect of the movie I've certainly remembered it all these years most vividly happened when the Harrison character has to look up the directions for using the recording machine on which he was going to fake the evidence of his wife's still being alive.  Onto the screen flashes the most outrageously complex electrical diagram comprehensible only to a professional electrician.

	schema:headline " Sturges Hits the Bullseye With This Great Dark Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "One of Director Preston Sturges' most enjoyable films Unfaithfully Yours is a dark comedy which uses the skills of it's leading actors Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell to perfection. Harrison plays Sir Alfred De Carter a famous symphony conductor who has recently wed the beautiful and much younger Daphne Darnell.  Upon returning from a successful concert tour Sir Alfred is confronted by his brotherinlaw AugustRudy Valle whom he had charged to look after Daphne while heSir Alfredwas away.  Merely wanting August to drop in on Daphne on occasion Sir Alfred is shocked to find out that August instead enlisted a private detective to shadow his wife around town.  Outraged when presented with the detective's file Sir Alfred refuses to even look at it.  However he is eventually confronted with the sleuth's findings which to his chagrin reveals that while he was away Daphne made a very suspicious late night call to a man's room wearing only a negligee.  He is further devastated to find out that the rogue in question is his own righthand man Tony Kurt Kreuger a handsome dapper fellow more closer in age to Daphne. Believing the worst Sir Alfred's pristine world is suddenly turned upside down and he becomes a man consumed with jealousy and suspicion.From here we watch Sir Alfred's gradual meltdown as the thought of his wife's infidelity haunts his every moment.  Even the concert stage can't provide him any solace.  While performing before a sold out audience his mind is less on the music and more on how he will deal with the adulterous duo.  With his baton wailing wildly his mind plays out various fantasies his first thoughts are of murder concocting an elaborate scheme which will leave Daphne dead and Tony framed as the killer.  In another scenario he sees himself as the forgiving saintly husband allowing his young wife to leave with his blessing even going so far as to write her a check to cover their anticipated needs.  Finally he envisions himself cast him as the crazed pitiful victim confronting Daphne and Tony and committing suicide before their guilty eyes.  As the music ends Sir Alfred has settled on murder as his method of revenge.  He abruptly ends his performance and proceeds to put his plan into effect.  Hilariously nothing seems to go quite as smoothly as it had in his vision. Harrison is masterful as the prim and proper husband who becomes the greeneyed monster bent on revenge.  Under Sturges direction Harrison succeeds in conveying the frailty of the male ego when faced with the possibility that the little lady may have found the grass a little greener in the neighbor's yard.  Darnell as Daphne looks ravishing as the suspected spouse.  She ably plays innocent enough to draw doubts about her husband's charges yet sexy enough to make you believe that the accusations just might be true.  A very entertaining movie I would definitely recommend Unfaithfully Yours particularly for Rex Harrison fans as this is one of his finest performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though he directed a few more movies over the years Unfaithfully Yours was the last great hurrah from one of Hollywood's greatest comedy writerdirectors Preston Sturges. But Lawdy what a way to go out.The movie stars Rex Harrison in what might be seen as a kinder gentler cousin of his egomaniacal diction professor in My Fair Lady 1964. Here Harrison is Sir Alfred de Carter a worldrenowned symphony conductor who is still astoundingly infatuated with the woman he refers to as his bride Daphne charming Linda Darnell. The movie never declares how long or short of a time the Carters have been married but judging from their passion level one would guess they're still in the honeymooning stage.The far more downtoearth married couple Alfred's inlaws August and Barbara are portrayed wonderfully by Rudy Vallee and Barbara Lawrence. Barbara gets all the great barbs off against her husband who is only to happy to show his ignorance of them. One day August accosts Alfred with the unfortunate news that he paid a detective to tail Daphne while Alfred was out of town. Alfred is so convinced of his wife's fidelity that his reaction starts at outrage and goes haywire from there. Little by little though Alfred is given reason to think that Daphne might have needed some spyingon after all. At his concert that evening Alfred conducts three pieces by Rossini Tchaikovsky and Wagner and with each piece Alfred imagines the stylish revenge he will extract upon Daphne for her presumed cheating.From this sobersounding scenario Sturgesas he always didgoes all over the place from sparkling dialogue to skittering slapstick to rich drenches of sentiment. And the melange has never worked better than it does here. Just for kicks take three of the movie's setpieces Alfred's achingly funny dressingdown of August for siccing a detective on Daphne the first fantasy where Alfred hatches an elaborate murder scheme and Alfred's drunken attempt to carry out the scheme. Three scenes of complete different tones and they all plausibly fit into the same movie. Now try to imagine any modernday comedymaker whose work would display the wit of any of those scenes.The Criterion Collection DVD of the movie does it full justice. It includes a seemingly irrelevant but nonetheless enjoyable critique of Sturges' work from Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones. And an interview with Sturges' widow Sandy as well as copies of voluminous memoes to Sturges from uncredited producer Darryl Zanuck demonstrate why the movie was initially a colossal boxoffice failure. Zanuck hounded Sturges to the point that the gifted creator of to name but two The Palm Beach Story and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek began doubting himself as a writer resulting in the final humiliation of Zanuck cutting the film on his own. Then a timely scandal involving Rex Harrison forever killed the boxoffice chances of a black comedy starring Harrison as an ostensible womanmurderer.Happily Unfaithfully Yours like Chaplin's similarly dark Monsieur Verdoux survived its prudish times and has become renowned as a great movie. Alfred's take on Delius might be delirious as professed by one of his fans played by the great Sturges alumnus Edgar Kennedy...but Sturges himself remains stupendous.".

Sturges' script is exquisite  it has one of the most unique structures I've ever come upon which I will not ruin for any of you. It's also quite hilarious as we can expect from the greatest comedy director of all times American or foreign.There are a couple of problems though. The situation and structure are brilliant but the main character while we can understand his mental anguish becomes too mean as the picture progresses. As much as he seemed to love his wife in the first act it is difficult to believe even under the circumstances that he would be that cruel towards her. Even if I did buy his awful temper this guy's worse than Othello it really is hard to forgive him for being such a tremendous sshole when he comes around at the end. The film also suffers from what has to be the longest extended slapstick sequence in film history. It starts out great especially the bit with the phone operator but as the guy breaks more and more stuff it just gets old. Also with the telephone bit the fourth time was the charm  it got a big laugh from me but the fifth time was really too much. All and all despite these criticisms it still comes off as a pretty great and memorable film from a true master. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sir Alfred DeCarter is a famous orchestra leader much in demand. After he returns from one of his tours he is told by his dense brotherinlaw August Henshler that acting on Alfred's request he engaged a private detective to follow Daphne his wife. That is the way for August to comply with an innocent request for 'keeping an eye on her'. DeCarter goes into a rage because he would never suspect his Daphne of any wrongdoing and rips up the detective's report.The famous conductor has everything working against him as a sudden attack of jealousy gets the best of him. Alfred begins putting a plan together as he starts to lead his orchestra into a concert. As each piece in the program is played Alfred begins planning how to deal with Daphne because he has reasons to believe she has been cheating him with Tony his handsome and younger male secretary.Preston Sturges the creative mind behind this enjoyable film was at the top of his profession. With this film he solidified his position as one of the most innovative directors of that era in Hollywood. He wrote and directed with impeccable style that characterized most of the work he did for the cinema.Rex Harrison gave an amazing performance as Alfred the conductor whose jealousy gets the best of him. The last sequence at his apartment after the concert is one of the best comic turns by this actor who goes through all the emotions and furniture in a frenzied manner. Beautiful Linda Darnell is excellent although her part doesn't allow her to do much more. Rudy Vallee who had worked with Sturges before shows an ability to bring to life his character. Barbara Lawrence Kurt Kreuger Lionel Stander and Edgar Kennedy are seen in supporting roles.A delicious comedy thanks to Preston Sturges.".

That is the way for August to comply with an innocent request for 'keeping an eye on her'. DeCarter goes into a rage because he would never suspect his Daphne of any wrongdoing and rips up the detective's report.The famous conductor has everything working against him as a sudden attack of jealousy gets the best of him. Alfred begins putting a plan together as he starts to lead his orchestra into a concert. As each piece in the program is played Alfred begins planning how to deal with Daphne because he has reasons to believe she has been cheating him with Tony his handsome and younger male secretary.Preston Sturges the creative mind behind this enjoyable film was at the top of his profession.

	schema:reviewBody "After 1944's MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK Preston Sturges and Paramount parted company. He was too independent a film creator in a period when film was made in a studio factory system with levels of producers watching how films turned out. Most of his movies had been profitable one exception was his attempt to do a straight dramatic story  THE GREAT MOMENT. But he was too big for this type of pressure. So he left the studio and proceeded to make two independent or semiindependent films. The first was THE SIN OF HAROLD DIDDLEBOCK with Harold Lloyd produced with Howard Hughes. The results were pretty good but certain flaws prevented it from being fully successful and Hughes recut the film when he rereleased it. The second done at Twentieth Century Fox was UNFAITHFULLY YOURS. Here he had problems with Fox chief Darryl Zanuck that mirrored the problems he had at Paramount. But the resulting film was one of his best works. As mentioned elsewhere it was his dark comedy his MONSIEUR VERDOUX which appeared a few years earlier.Rex Harrison is the great British conductor Sir Alfred De Carter who is married to the beautiful but somewhat younger Daphne Linda Darnell. Daphne is sister to Barbara Barbara Lawrence who is married to a billionaire August Henschler Rudy Vallee Leading a major orchestra on tour De Carter finds when he gets home that August hired a detective Edgar Kennedy to keep an eye on Daphne. There is a full report suggesting that her behavior was incorrect. De Carter is furious at August's actions and goes to confront the Detective. But he finds Sweeney the Detective a fan of his music and actually a fairly reasonable man. After an initial moment of anger De Carter decides to read the report. He finds that the evidence suggests that Daphne has been having an affair with his secretary Anthony Kurt Krueger. The background of the story and an interesting sequence showing Sir Alfred in rehearsal takes up about half an hour of the movie to set up the story. We see Sir Alfred deeply troubled and already snapping at Daphne and Anthony conduct Rossini Tschaikovski and Wagner in a three part concert. Each time he conducts he is thinking of his marriage partner and how to handle her. He imagines a perfect murder that pins the killing on Anthony. He imagines an overwhelmingly saintly version of himself being all forgiving and generous to his departing wife leaving a selfhating Daphne in tears. He finally imagines confronting Daphne and Anthony with his pistol and playing Russian Roulette ending with his own shocking suicide.The concert ends and the conductor goes home to put his schemes into effect starting of course with revenge by murder. Of course if this was a Lang or Hitchcock film the revenge would have been effectively carried out. It's Sturges however so everything possible to carry out the perfect murder goes wrong. My personal favorite is a recording device that will enable him to make a record of himself saying Help...Tony stop! Stop! or something like that and changing the pitch to resemble the voice of Daphne screaming! In the vision it was so simple. But the recording device falls through a window causes Harrison to fall through a chair keeps throwing the record off the turntable and when he tries to follow the easy to follow instructions the plans look more complex than an atom smasher.The same thing is repeated for the two other visions with equally embarrassing failures. It is only at the tale end of the film that Sir Alfred is able to find a quiet way out of the mess of his life without any real embarrassment.Sturges did very well indeed in this film. Harrison was quite pleased with this role which he felt with THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR was the best he did in Hollywood in the 1940s. He felt that Sturges' script was better than Shakespeare. The film also gave Sturges the chance to give Edgar Kennedy a splendid last moment on screen as the Detective who loves De Carter's handling of Handel and Frederick Delius. Kennedy is only in the film about five minutes but does well  even though he looks ill he'd die in 1948. Lionel Stander as Carter's business manager Hugo keeps the annoyed conductor from ringing his idiot brotherinlaw's neck several times. Linda Darnell is as sexy as she appeared in LETTER TO THREE WIVES and to the end we wonder if she and Anthony did have an affair. And Vallee appears as hopelessly incompetent in being helpful as he was in romancing Claudette Colbert in Sturges' THE PALM BEACH STORY.But the film failed. There is a downer atmosphere around it of death. First Kennedy's demise mentioned above and then the Harrison  Carole Landis Suicide Scandal as well. The idea to a 1948 American audience tired of death from World War II of humor from subjects like murder and suicide was too much. The film flopped and Sturges never regained his footing. Following it came the halfway decent THE BEAUTIFUL BLONDE OF BASHFUL BEND with Betty Grable which ended his Fox years then his living abroad in Paris and then the awful THE FRENCH THEY ARE A FUNNY RACE. One can only say that at least Sturges did do the string of great comedies that he was able to do while he could and be grateful for that.".

I've seen this film three times and I STILL laugh out loud at the last section. I saw it at a revival theatre two times and people were literally bent over in their seats helpless with laughter! This isn't for everybodyit was a critical and commercial bomb in 1948 and a lot of people still find it too sick to be funny. I can see their pointthere's nothing funny about a man trying to kill his wife but this is a MOVIEnot real life. It all ends happily also.My only problem and this is minor was Darnell. She seems miscast here. But the script is quick and witty the cast is great and they all go full throttle and the use of music is superb. Basically one of the funniest black comedies ever made.

	schema:reviewBody "Sir Alfred De Carter Rex Harrison is an aging British conductor who becomes extremely suspicious of his beautiful younger wife Linda Darnell and his handsome but boring assistant Kurt Kreuger after his wife's brotherinlaw Rudy Vallee brings him a detective's report. Harrison at first refuses to even look at the report but as his ego gets the better of him he goes to the original detective an unrecognizable Edgar Kennedy and is visited by their hotel's house detective Al Bridge who confirms seeing Darnell going into Kreuger's suite in the middle of the night. Harrison does what any brilliant music conductor doeshe plots revenge and that means murder and framing his rival for the crime. Harrison known for his own extreme ego in real life seems to enjoy spoofing the whole idea as Alfred just gets crazier and crazier first setting his dressing room on fire in an effort to destroy the detective's report then furiously conducting his orchestra for rehearsal as if he were riding the winning horse at the Kentucky Derby. By the time his concert begins he has decided to emulate Sweeney Todd as we learn in the first of three fantasy sequences where he plots the perfect crime. But dreaming of revenge and actually carrying it out are two different things and in one of the funniest sequences Preston Sturges ever directed Harrison goes deeper and deeper into madness as he destroys his entire hotel suite while trying to carry out his scheme. This is slapstick at its most intelligent.This is a film where you are not supposed to like the leading character. That makes his overthetop actions all the more funny and Harrison relishes every moment. Darnell of course is truly beautiful the most ravishing clothes horse of the 1940's but has nothing to do but look lovely and confused as Harrison's menace increases. Lionel Stander has some amusing lines as Harrison's pal while Vallee Barbara Lawrence as Darnell's sister Kennedy and Bridge offer fine support. Sturges responsible for some of the best screenplays and for directing some of the finest comedies in Hollywood's history adds another gem to his resume. The music too is wonderful furiously as part of the plot as Harrison's insanity is. This was remade somewhat successfully by Dudley Moore in 1984 one of the more obscure classics to be redone. It has grown in cult status over the years but was totally overlooked for awards during its release year. The film remains a showcase for its stunning leading man who in spite of 40's classics such as Blithe Spirit and The Ghost  Mrs. Muir wouldn't become legendary until he uttered those immortal stage and screen words Eliza where the devil are my slippers? years later.".

And sure enough on this second viewing I was reminded of a kind of crisp calculation that both of them have. Sturges makes amazing movies no question and the best of them Palm Beach Story is my favorite are hilarious classics. To see this one for what it offers you might first see a classic Sturges screwball from 1941 or 1942. But even those are clinical at heart if they have a heart so it's a little like sipping a very dry clean martini and getting drunk. Alone. No olives. Wit and sophistication do better in the hands of Cole Porter somehow but see for yourself.Harrison the actor overcomes his harsh demeanor in a movie like My Fair Lady because the music and the style there give him some kind of liberty but here he is supposed to be sympathetic in his demented cruelty and I only wish him failure. He is to be sure plotting the death of his wife. Three times. And then the fourth beyond the symphony podium with its madcap bedlam. It's funny in that zany way you have to laugh at. And you will laugh.I love classical music and like the structure of the film but as usual with Sturges this structure makes the whole process detached and too too clever. Sturges himself wrote the screenplay for this idea way back in 1932 and if it had been shot then before the Hays code before the real rise of screwball we would have had a very different movie. But what we have here is admirable and interesting for sure if not the zinger it could have been with a different tilt.".

Most of Sturges' other films are perhaps not brilliant but at least they were hilarious and make for fine comedy but this one strains for laughs that are simply not there. Often hailed as some kind of masterpiece I failed to see it. I'll take any other of his films for this one. At least they're funnier hands down.The film is beautiful to look at very stylish and masterfully scored but the main problem is I'm supposed to root for a deeply unsympathetic character in a story that seems to exist solely to marvel it's own genius and complexity. What's more Rex Harrison has no talent for comedy whatsoever. He tries hard but to no avail. All we are left with is supposedly witty dialog that has no purpose at all. I wouldn't dare to dismiss any Sturgesfilm and perhaps the genius of this film is beyond my reach but if you're looking for the oldfashioned madness of earlier Sturges you won't find it here.Camera Obscura  510".

The absolutely WORST moment in the film was the excruciatingly overdone segment where Rex kept breaking thingsstepping through several chairs dropping things etc. AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. The scene was just plain excessive and seemed to last forever. It absolutely ruined the movie for me. I believe if Preston Sturgis had not been the writer director and producer of this film he never would have gotten away with itsomeone would no doubt have questioned this repetitive and annoying scene. It reminds me a lot of the bad Jerry Lewis film CRACKING UPa movie so bad it was never released to theaters.

But the final scene back to reality is an uneven blend of slapstick and sight gags that simply go on too long before the windup which has him adoring his wife again.Not Sturgess at his best and it's the script that's the main weakness because the acting is fine. Rex Harrison seems to be doing a rehearsal for Henry Higgins and Linda Darnell is charming if unbelievably patient as the doting wife.

The remake of Unfaithfully Yours though not bad doesn't come close to the satire and farce of the original. Why Sturges even uses slapstick to spoof slapstick. Who else could take such a stuffed shirt item as classical music and the blatant arrogance associated with it and poke fun at it while at the same time giving the audience the treat of enjoying some heavenly classical selections that fit perfectly with the plot? Part of the fun in Unfaithfully Yours is to watch the ego of the pompous classical conductor Sir Alfred De Carter note the moniker being punctured and slowly deflating until all he has left are the murderous fantasies of an intensely possessive human being. Sturges' genius is to make us laugh at all this. Only Chaplin in his masterpiece Monsieur Verdoux can make the audience laugh at murder the way Sturges does in Unfaithfully Yours.Not to take away from the excellent performances of the two leads Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell but the marvelous character actor Edgar Kennedy nearly steals the show playing the private detective Sweeney who just happens to be a lover of classical music and worships Sir Alfred who could handle Handel like nobody could handle Handel. Rudy Vallee too shines under Sturges' guiding hand the way he shone in Palm Beach Story. Vallee was such a versatile entertainer that he could play just about any part but he was always at his best when Sturges was in the driver's seat.This is a film that the viewer has to watch several times to get the feel of what Preston Sturges is all about. Though Sturges left a gallant legacy of wonderful off the wall humorous works such as The Great McGinty The Miracle of Morgan's Creek and Sullivan's Travels this movie Unfaithfully Yours may very well be the best creation of them all.".

It was Fox who were to benefit from the breach with Paramount and Sturges got to feature Fox contract player Linda Darnell plus Rex Harrison who was still hanging around the Lot after shooting Anna And The King Of Siam there a couple of years earlier. In fact Linda Darnell played very much the same role she plays here  an ordinary girl who lucks into a rich older man  as she did for Mank the next year in A Letter To Three Wives where she substituted Harrison for Paul Douglas. This is at its heart a very bitter black comedy but perhaps because he thought it too dark himself or perhaps because he was 'persuaded' by the Front Office Sturges leavened it from about the seventh or eighth reel with some hopelessly unfunny slapstick involving Harrison who is above all else at home with verbal comedy. There are certainly fine moments and the beginning is studded with Sturges oneliners but the ultimate effect is of an unsuccessful meld of bleak humor and slapstick.".

	schema:reviewBody "This lopsided stunning comedy is Sturges' last masterpiece a bitter denunciation of culture and the most savage dissection of marriage in the cinema.  It is more shocking than 'Othello' sadder than 'Ulysses' both of which it alludes to.  Like Othello Sir Alfred de Carter is a celebrated civilised hero whom jealousy drives insane both men are linked to culture  Othello tells bewitching stories Carter conducts  and both are failed by culture which cannot elevate base murderous misogynistic instincts. Even better for a Hollywood movie by a till then popular director is that it attempts some of the formal daring of Ulysses.  One of the reasons the film's structure seems so strange is that it doesn't follow a traditional narrative movement eg of a play novel or film but tries to match the abstract patterning of music like the episode 'Sirens' the film's subject matter.  The development  of themes motifs antiphony repitition give the film the same fluidity richness and depth of a symphony and this plays havoc with our conventional narrative expectations.Further like 'Oxen In The Sun' which relates narrative in styles pastiching the 'best' clean proper elegant of English prose before collapsing in a babble of slang and dialect  UNFAITHFULLY YOURS develops its story through the history of popular classical Romantic music from Rossini to Wagner to Tchaikovsky from populist musical entertainment made for the people to solemn music drama more appropriate to cathedrals to sophisticated souffle dilution before Carter's narrative collapses into slapstick and farce wholesale destruction mirrored in the grotesque carnivalesque distorted music and the painful lashes of feedback.Sturges' view of marriage is alarmingly bleak not just including the reprehensible coupling of pompous sterile miser August Henshler a priceless Rudy Vallee and his bored sarcastic golddigging wife Barbara like her sister  Carter's misogyny is not without some justification and the film is a rare Hollywood analysis of class.  The film opens with symbolic ominousness as a wife waits at an airport for a husband who is lost somewhere in the sky possibly in danger.  Their reunion is sheer theatre complete with audience and critics and their first night together is rudely interrupted witnessed by the man whose intrusions will be central to the following plot Tony.  The film is full of this idea of theatre that the lives we lead are mere crippling performances for a society full of begrudgery indifference and contempt.The important thing about the early scenes is how much Carter is to blame how useless he is at marriage beyond the pleasureable physical duties.  He is almost always away from his wife or putting her off when he is there delegating his responsibilities to his secretary so that he might as well be her lover  Carter's jealousy is really only a hypocritical smokescreen for guilt and neglect.  He thinks throwing money and dresses at Daphne is enough  he is closer to August than he would care to admit. His abrasive ego and violent clipped wit is hugely amusing and full of a brisk energy but it consumes and negates all around him.  He is an allpowerful man a magician the centre of public attention  he can make a legion of men do his bidding and make hundreds more applaud him for doing so.  This necessitates a regulated life all the elements therein subservient to his will.  So when his wife is possibly having an affair he loses control.  His sense of wholeness is split but this is figured in the fragmentation of his wife when he first suspects she is reflected in a mirror in the next sequence she is divided into three by a double mirror so bound up is she in his self image.After a slow start this is monstrously funny and Carter's decline is dramatised in his change of comic registers from verbal 'intellectual' comedy to broad 'vulgar' slapstick from construction of neat sentences etc. to destruction from activity to passivity.   Decades before Cultural Studies came into being Sturges links Dead White Male culture to masculinity and the arbitrary brutal power of patriarchy is shown in all its unlovely violence.  The fantasy sequences are delirious wicked frightening and plausible with disorientating zooms into Carter's eye reminiscent of VERTIGO. and a thrill to see in a 40s Hollywood film but Sturges is well aware that the pleasure we get from Carter murdering Daphne explicitely eroticised is very real a release of what we men anyway feel but would never admit.  In this way YOURS is a forerunner of PEEPING TOM.  Although this is definitely the work of a misanthropist there are glimmers of humanity especially Sweeney the detective whose loneliness is genuinely moving he is the only character for whom music actually enriches.  It is odd that a late 40s American film featuring detectives should have that figure as a receptacle of hope and humanity and the man of culture breeding and nobility the noir hero.  There are some unexpectedly delightful bits of irrelevant business such as Daphne and August dropping things from the balcony on an old dowager. Sturges' use of space and architecture to dramatise emotion is once again masterly and Antonionian  the whole final third is a superb depiction of domestic alienation Carter's ignorance of his own home revealing about his marriage when he goes to confront Tony the corridor's geometry is a chilling vanishing point his mute walk through Tony's room is like the perambulaitons of a ghost.".

	schema:headline " HighQuality Espionage Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "What is most interesting about Body of Lies is that it manages to rise above the predictability and formula that plagues the vast majority of espionage films. It is postBourne wrapped up in a more mature Bond plot with a politically conscious edge. Yet it never feels like it is stealing elements of those more using them as a launchpad for its own ideas. Though the film itself is sometimes guilty of falling back into safety it remains consistently exciting and intently engaging even when those moments occur because of how keenly detailed and acted it is. It makes it standout as a cut above many of its contemporaries.We follow Roger Ferris a ground CIA operative who moves throughout the Middle East in an attempt to lure out and capture terrorist Al Saleem. Of course his practices involve plenty of lies and deceit as he tries to retain the support of the head of the Jordanian Intelligence. Ferris is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who makes an excellent centrepiece for the film. DiCaprio is a great choice for the role given his superb ability to convey emotion and his delivery making even mundane dialogue seem important. I'm not sure many could have been as appealing as he is here. Ferris grows into a more interesting character as the film progresses. His disillusion with the lies he has to sow and backstabbing from his superiors make for some of the most intriguing moments whilst providing some welcomed morality that never feels forced.His superior Hoffman is played terrifically by Russell Crowe whose weight gain and distinct accent allow him to become the character. Crowe is at his best playing characters like this. Confident forcefully honest almost egotistical yet understanding the importance of the situation. They're traits he always nails. Hoffman appears allknowing frequently surveying from the air keeping constant contact with Ferris as he aids him in setting up a fictional terrorist group to smoke out AlSaleem. He also clashes with the Jordanian head Hani Salaam who is convincingly played by Mark Strong a man who only asks that the CIA don't lie to him which is something that Ferris finds increasingly difficult to avoid. The interactions and differences between these three main characters is definitely the film's most interesting aspect. All three have distinct personalities that are well developed conduct their jobs in very different ways and are portrayed by actors who always convince. The scenes that bring them together are always gripping Ferris meeting Hoffman in Washington to devise a new plan Hani questioning how Ferris could lie to him the three of them discussing their mission. They all share a suspicion of one another that is fascinating to see play out.There is a romance between Ferris and an Iranian doctor that is nicely played out and expands the characters. It also offers us an interesting look at the perception of a relationship with someone from the West in the Middle East. However the issue is that it doesn't really fit in with the tone of the film and ends up becoming a plot device later on in the film which makes it feel rather forced. The action scenes and shootouts are always very fluid and exciting to watch. Notably there is a weight to them that makes the injuries feel painful these operatives don't just bounce back up like in so many spy flicks. There's a torture scene near the end that is brilliantly intense and really keeps you guessing as to its outcome.With Ridley Scott at the helm the film is fantastic to look at and his direction is as smooth as it's ever been. In fact I don't think the Middle East has ever looked this vibrant and authentic on screen before. Scott directs the film masterfully. He manages to make the dialogue driven scenes feel just as tense as the action ones. I especially like the use of aerial surveillance as it gave the film a much wider scope and added to the feeling of always being watched. Scott is saddled with a script that can be jargon heavy but he's able to make it understandable and technical without dumbing it down or filling it with dialogue that nobody would comprehend. The funny thing is that this is type of film Scott's Brother Tony would usually at home doing so it's nice to see him try his hand at it and go for a more subtle approach.Despite its amalgamation of various espionage tropes and some misplaced plot points Body of Lies is an exceptional genre film. It manages to work as both an exciting action thriller and as a more controlled politicallycharged piece. The story is packed with deception and intrigue just right for this type of film. The main characters are wellrounded and captivating to watch they guide us through the film and I always wanted to see what their next move was going to be. It is a layered story and it's impressive just how well it is conveyed. Plenty of praise should go to Scott his three leading men and script writer William Monahan. They have crafted a film that is well balanced a vivid portrait of the CIA in the Middle East and makes a number of potentially clichd aspects feel fresh again.".

They all share a suspicion of one another that is fascinating to see play out.There is a romance between Ferris and an Iranian doctor that is nicely played out and expands the characters. It also offers us an interesting look at the perception of a relationship with someone from the West in the Middle East. However the issue is that it doesn't really fit in with the tone of the film and ends up becoming a plot device later on in the film which makes it feel rather forced. The action scenes and shootouts are always very fluid and exciting to watch. Notably there is a weight to them that makes the injuries feel painful these operatives don't just bounce back up like in so many spy flicks. There's a torture scene near the end that is brilliantly intense and really keeps you guessing as to its outcome.With Ridley Scott at the helm the film is fantastic to look at and his direction is as smooth as it's ever been. In fact I don't think the Middle East has ever looked this vibrant and authentic on screen before. Scott directs the film masterfully. He manages to make the dialogue driven scenes feel just as tense as the action ones. I especially like the use of aerial surveillance as it gave the film a much wider scope and added to the feeling of always being watched. Scott is saddled with a script that can be jargon heavy but he's able to make it understandable and technical without dumbing it down or filling it with dialogue that nobody would comprehend. The funny thing is that this is type of film Scott's Brother Tony would usually at home doing so it's nice to see him try his hand at it and go for a more subtle approach.Despite its amalgamation of various espionage tropes and some misplaced plot points Body of Lies is an exceptional genre film. It manages to work as both an exciting action thriller and as a more controlled politicallycharged piece. The story is packed with deception and intrigue just right for this type of film. The main characters are wellrounded and captivating to watch they guide us through the film and I always wanted to see what their next move was going to be. It is a layered story and it's impressive just how well it is conveyed. Plenty of praise should go to Scott his three leading men and script writer William Monahan. They have crafted a film that is well balanced a vivid portrait of the CIA in the Middle East and makes a number of potentially clichd aspects feel fresh again.";

	schema:reviewBody "The main thing I was curious about with Body of Lies is what sort of film it would end up being. It could have been a postBourne action thriller a serious dramatic thriller with a political edge Munich Syriana one of those intolerably dull post911 films Lions for Lambs or something like Ridley Scott's brother Tony's Spy Game a movie with an interesting premise and disappointing execution.I would argue that Body of Lies is the exact opposite on paper of Spy Game. It's a movie with a questionable sketchy premise and damn good execution. I'd always definitely preferred Ridley's sensibilities and films to Tony's and his take on a story about a CIA agent working against agency politics is definitely superior as well although a very very large amount of my preference for Body of Lies comes from the script by The Departed scribe William Monahan. Body of Lies bizarrely manages to work as both a hugely entertaining nifty action thriller and as a sociallypoliticallyconscious drama. I can't believe I'm about to say this but it really does go from Syriana to The Bourne Identity in a second and does so without feeling ridiculous contrived or silly. It just somehow pulls it off and I'm crediting Monahan with most of this success although Scott certainly handles the shifts in tone extremely well.All you should know about the story going in is that DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris a CIA field agent in an important position in the middle east division just below the leader of the division Ed Hoffman played by Russell Crowe a snarky racist and mostly unlikeable man who leads the missions remotely through his laptop and cellphone. Ferris uncovers a lead on a major terrorist leader potentially operating out of Jordan and chooses to act on it involving Jordanian intelligence leader Hani Salam played brilliantly by Mark Strong. His performance is just the right side of slightly hammy and works wonderfully well. There are twists and turns and it's a lot of fun.Now here's where I'm going to start sounding really bizarre I know I just said it was a lot of fun but there's a good amount of substance here and a good deal to be learned about middleeastern politics having lived there for many years I can assure you that this film works as a primer on the mindset and cultural feel of the locations it is set in and of the political system there. Its observations on Jordanian intelligence in particular are very much spoton. There are scenes where the film gets really dark and serious and they completely work as well. In particular for a white American screenwriter's work this is incredibly perceptive and understanding of how Jordanians act and feel. Something like Rendition from last year while generally just not a good film was also hopelessly inaccurate on just about everything. There was no work there just a message the filmmaker wanted to send. With Body of Lies every second feels and is authentic and real outside perhaps of some of the details of the espionage aspects although the writer of the book it was based on was CIA and there's even some cultural jokes completely in Arabic untranslated on screen that basically no nonArabs will understand. It's a remarkably vivid real portrait and considering Hollywood's past of portraying Arabs generally in a 'dem Ayrabs we America' way which completely ignored the basic dress and attitude of real Arabs something like this is refreshing.The movie isn't perfect and there's a key scene at the end which feels very didactic and heavyhanded although judging by the twentysomethings who left the theater talking about how cool one of the torture scenes was even a message delivered this bluntly just isn't getting into their thick skulls but it somehow gets away with being an enjoyable genre piece and a genuinely thoughtprovoking and perceptive film but not one which focuses on these elements to the point of being overbearing with actual understanding of mideastern politics and culture wonderfully involving characters including the refreshingly nonsexual love interest Aisha played by Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani and even a surprising sense of humor. Body of Lies is most definitely a cut above most in its overall quite poor subgenre and one of the biggest surprises of the year. 810".

It's ironic to think that the last time these two actors shared the screen was back in 1995 with the clichdbutentertaining oater The Quick and the Dead. Of course at the time Crowe was a complete unknown and DiCaprio was a 21yearold newcomer with only a couple of notable titles under his belt. But oh how that's all changed now.It's not easy to describe the plot of Body of Lies without giving too much away. DiCaprio plays CIA operative Roger Ferris who is trying to flush out a terrorist leader named AlSaleem in Jordan. He gets his orders from Ed Hoffman Crowe a man for whom results are the only satisfactory outcome delivered with a fair amount of arrogance and a cocky Southern drawl. Ed plays the situation like a kid playing a video game and has the resources to change the rules anytime he feels like it dispensing his orders from his office from his backyard from his daughter's soccer game for Pete's sake! This of course infuriates Ferris to no end because he is the one who is in the trenches chasing the bad guys dodging bullets ducking explosions and procuring the badlyneeded intelligence that Hoffman needs. Ferris is also trying to build a productive working relationship with the head of Jordanian Intelligence Hani Salaam Mark Strong a relationship that is made even more tenuous by Hoffman's doubledealings and hidden agendas.There are so many ways that Scott could have screwed this up. A lesser director might have chosen to ramp up the action sacrificing intelligence for entertainment. A lesser director could have taken this story of espionage and twisted it into a convoluted and indecipherable Gordian knot. A lesser director would have gotten less convincing performances from his lead actors.But Ridley Scott is not a lesser director. Though the plot is indeed complex with many layers and sublayers deceit and treachery Scott never lets you lose sight of the overall picture. He tells a solid wonderfully entertaining story without the need to drive home its message with sledgehammer subtlety after all very few things are black and white. And most of all he gets electric performances from Crowe and DiCaprio whose symbiotic relationship with a thinlyveiled veneer of mutual contempt is a pleasure to watch.I don't know if Body of Lies will end up breaking through the barrier that every movie in this genre couldn't but for what it's worth I hope it does. One thing's for sure if anybody can Ridley Scott can.For this and other reviews please check out www.thelatestmoviereviews.com.".

Leonardo DiCaprio has really grown up and cast off his annoying persona which was so prominent in just about all his movies until 'Blood Diamond' came along.

	schema:headline " Too Complicated and dull for my liking";
	schema:reviewBody "Political thrillers are not really my bag to be honest  I watch them but do I enjoy them? Not really. So it needs to be a very special type of movie for me to give it the thumbs up. Body of Lies is not that special.DiCaprio is a good actor  you have to give him that  but I am not so sure about all his film choices. Of course he ain't gonna get them all right so I need to give him some slack  but this one falls on the wrong side. He plays a CIA man in the MiddleEast and essentially his plot point boils down to him on the trail of a hard to find terrorist bad guy. There are other complications in his way of course  explosions doublecrosses carchases and even love  and the plot permeates through all these items slowing everything down to a grinding halt. Crowe plays a soccer dad CIA HQ man calling the shots from his earpiece computers and satellite imagery. Neither Crowe nor DiCaprio do a bad job per se  but their very limited shared screen time bogs the film down. To be honest the whole thing is too complicated too complex and  a word NO filmmaker wants to hear said about his movie  dull. The plot is hard to follow and I felt myself looking at the movie and watching it for what it was  but not really understanding what the hell was going on? Throw in some Arabic dialogue and hey presto  total confusion. There is one good thing to come out of this though  Mark Strong's performance as Hani Salaam is impressive. His scenes with DiCaprio are  for me  the highlight of the movie and his dark polite yet menacing presence throughout the film is testament to his fine acting. I've never heard of this guy before but he looks like one to watch. Overall  the complex nature of the plot means there are a few scenes thrown in here that practically explain to the audience what is going on. This  although required as I guess half the audience won't know what the hell is going on  further slows everything down and looks contrived. Even DiCaprio himself looked like a guy playing the scene against his better judgement. In the end Body of Lies is a messy affair that turns into an uninteresting muddled tedious couple of hours. It's always a bad sign when you just want the film to end  and the sooner the better. The ending by the way is pure Hollywood  contrived and a nickoftime rescue thrown in for good measure.Scott too has to take a lot of the blame here  after all he is both producer and director. His flashy style gets a little tiresome after a while and even though he is a world away from his brother Tony's quickcut editing he seems to be getting closer to him rather than further away. Although the production values are spot on the locales suitably impressive and authentic  the formula for these type of movies lends itself to global manipulation of governments and also grandiose complex plots thus dragging the enjoyment factor way down.Body of Lies is a quickly forgettable film. 510.".

	onyx:emotionText "Political thrillers are not really my bag to be honest  I watch them but do I enjoy them? Not really. So it needs to be a very special type of movie for me to give it the thumbs up. Body of Lies is not that special.DiCaprio is a good actor  you have to give him that  but I am not so sure about all his film choices. Of course he ain't gonna get them all right so I need to give him some slack  but this one falls on the wrong side. He plays a CIA man in the MiddleEast and essentially his plot point boils down to him on the trail of a hard to find terrorist bad guy. There are other complications in his way of course  explosions doublecrosses carchases and even love  and the plot permeates through all these items slowing everything down to a grinding halt. Crowe plays a soccer dad CIA HQ man calling the shots from his earpiece computers and satellite imagery. Neither Crowe nor DiCaprio do a bad job per se  but their very limited shared screen time bogs the film down. To be honest the whole thing is too complicated too complex and  a word NO filmmaker wants to hear said about his movie  dull. The plot is hard to follow and I felt myself looking at the movie and watching it for what it was  but not really understanding what the hell was going on? Throw in some Arabic dialogue and hey presto  total confusion. There is one good thing to come out of this though  Mark Strong's performance as Hani Salaam is impressive. His scenes with DiCaprio are  for me  the highlight of the movie and his dark polite yet menacing presence throughout the film is testament to his fine acting.

Roger Ferris Di Caprio is the agent on the ground and Ed Hoffman Crowe is his remotecontrol boss in Washington. Their collective M.O. is to overreact and improvise at every turn aided and abetted by their deep attachment to hightech gadgetry and fundamental disregard for human lives. Their ally and foil the Jordanian head of intelligence Mark Strong prefers more patient methods informed by a less skindeep understanding of the peoples involved.All three are trying to penetrate and take out a shadowy violent Islamic fundamentalist group and its leader. The plot is serviceable the elements familiar but it all works well to coax out Scott's and screenwriter William Monahan's critiques of the American way of unconventional war in the Middle East. The movie itself is funny visually fine Scott's touch hasn't deserted him and engaging. Its center is the uneasy but highly entertaining partnership between Di Caprio and Crowe. At times verging on pure comedy their semiserious macho argument over which of them could beat up the other 10 years ago is a high point the film never tips too far in this direction thanks to the two actors' easy skill and Scott's sure hand at maintaining a certain tone.Is Body of Lies an antiwar statement? I don't think so  it's possible Monahan and Scott even think the Americans' grotesque imperial venture has a chance if only they could learn a few lessons from the likes of the selfpossessed Jordanian. But this seems unlikely. At the beginning Crowe makes the very good point that it's precisely the Americans' mastery of by? their hightech appurtenances that makes it nearly impossible for them to see their foes who use much more downtoearth techniques  like passing instructions by word of mouth. He then proceeds to ignore his own advice throughout the movie. Di Caprio rips into Crowe for his disregard of the lives of their local operatives then goes on to thoughtlessly place in mortal danger an architect and an Iranian refugee nurse with whom he's infatuated.They just don't learn. If they did they wouldn't be who they are the gallant spreaders of justice democracy and casual calamity. If that's what Scott and Monahan are trying to tell us it's antiwar statement enough the same news that Graham Greene brought us over 50 years ago with The Quiet American updated and just as pertinent.".

	schema:headline " Intense Political Thriller Takes More Cues from Hollywood than the Current Middle East Crisis";
	schema:reviewBody "The craftsmanship behind director Ridley Scott's 2008 convulsive political thriller is impressive but having acts of terrorism drive an intentionally labyrinth plot reveals how they impede the story structurally an insurmountable barrier that screenwriter William Monahan The Departed can't seem to overcome. The movie's first half is all the more bewildering for all the doublecrosses and coverups that serve to set up the central situation. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' 2007 novel the movie focuses on embedded CIA operative Roger Ferris who is on an undercover assignment to hunt an AlQaeda terrorist leader named AlSaleem. Ferris is not entirely alone as he is connected via cell phone with his stateside boss Ed Hoffman who is the head of the CIA's Near East division and directs Ferris toward lifethreatening tasks in a most nonchalant manner from his upscale suburban home.The plot's impetus is driven by the elusive AlSaleem's unblinking series of suicide bombings in Europe in response to the invasion by US and UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie gets more interesting when Ferris decides to work with Jordanian intelligence director Hani Salaam an erudite enigmatic figure who is well entrenched in the Middle East militia and appears to take a page from Mario Puzo's The Godfather when it comes to loyalty and betrayal. Of course it's a matter of course that Ferris' loyalty is tested when an elaborate plan is hatched to create a bogus competing terrorist group and use an unwitting Dubai architect as the head. The other complicating factor is that Ferris has fallen for pretty Iranian nurse Aisha when he gets treated for possible rabies at a clinic. It becomes inevitable that she also becomes a pawn in the political intrigue. Scott paints his canvas with a lot of graphic violence from largescale bombings to more intimate acts of torture.All of the external elements are fitting but they can't seem to masquerade the convoluted and often clichridden plot at the film's core. A solid cast goes a long way to compensate for the plot holes. As Ferris Leonardo DiCaprio applies his trademark wiry energy to an intensely compelling performance that could have shown a bit more variety. Adding fifty bellystretching pounds to his frame Russell Crowe Scott's favorite leading man Gladiator American Gangster A Good Year plays the Arkansan Hoffman as a scenestealing character part. The irony is that the Australian actor's Southern accent is more convincing than DiCaprio's. Their antagonistic interplay played out mostly on the phone is rather predictably developed. Fetching Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani provides gratefully calm relief to the ongoing mayhem as Aisha although her character comes across as a mere plot device. There is a nicely fractious dinner table scene with Ferris and her judgmental older sister although the movie plays down the more humansize hostilities in favor of the pyrotechnics.As Hani Mark Strong Sunshine Stardust leaves the most vivid impression of the cast but for the most oldfashioned of cinematic reasons  he plays what could be a villainous figure as a suave mysterious man of honor who is completely on top of his job an intentional counterpoint at least physically to Crowe's slovenly Hoffman. The film's resolution defies credibility but it finally becomes clear that Monahan is not interested in exposing the factors that have driven the Middle East political maelstrom into acts of escalating terrorism. Rather his screenplay shows that testosteronedriven Hollywoodstyle entertainment can take place anywhere.".

	schema:headline " DiCaprio shines as usual in a technically well made film that ranks amongst the better Ridley Scott films";
	schema:reviewBody "Ridley Scott has always been very consistent in my mind as a filmmaker. He has occasional flashes of genius Alien Gladiator but always seems to make steady good interesting and watchable films. The same applies here with Body of Lies. While the film will not be this year's major awards contender Body of Lies is among the better films by Scott somewhere between American Gangster and Black Hawk Down.One thing Scott always manages to do in his films is ground the film in reality very well setting a mood that allows us to get into the film easier. While it has its dark moments I wouldn't consider this a supremely dark or depressing picture despite the subject matter. In Body of Lies his take on the War on Terror in the Middle East is gripping and realistic especially the sets though not as thrilling as it should be. Though put in danger many times throughout the film I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat whenever those moments rolled around.As we already know the film features two of the most dynamic and talented actors working today in Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. Here Scott gives his usual tag team partner Crowe a break to let DiCaprio take the reigns. Leo has long been one of my favorite actors for his ability to bring intensity and grit to every role he plays outside of Titanic and Gilbert Grape of course making real and believable characters time in and time out. Again DiCaprio steals the show and makes the movie watchable as he's in almost every scene in one way or another. Without his commanding and charismatic presence the film would sink. He delivers yet another winner of a show showcasing his ability to grow into even more adult roles as he grows older. His role in the film is strikingly similar to his position in his career. He's in between young heroic roles and adult authoritative roles which is what his Roger Ferris is a young CIA agent dealing with new found authority and choices.Though on paper Russell Crowe's role is pretty weak he manages to turn in a great performance through an altered appearance and voice. Once again Crowe's character symbolizes who he is as a person a shaken soda bottle one twist from exploding. It is because our two leads I feel weird saying that as DiCaprio is the only true lead work so well together and hold our attention so well that the film succeeds. An able supporting cast adds to the film as well.Technically well made just like every other Scott films Body of Lies brings nothing new to the table while taking things we've seen before and oneupping the last to do it. The sound in particular was a plus for me as was the art direction like I've said these are always good things in a Ridley Scott film. The preview can be a bit deceiving in marketing the film as an action political thriller like Blood Diamond when in reality it is the thinking man's thriller without that plot twist I thought would be coming. While the film does have some marvelous and well done action it's few and far between as the film is more about gathering intelligence than intelligently blowing everything up.I also appreciate that the film rarely dragged or got boring and I credit this to yet another winning script from William Monahan scribe of The Departed. I think another Oscar nomination for Monahan is possible here. All in all Body of Lies is a well made film that would be nothing special again the lack of thrills in some parts if not for the commanding presence of Leonardo DiCaprio and the always consistent Ridley Scott. It's not worth losing your head over but it is worth giving the price of admission to your local theater.".

He delivers yet another winner of a show showcasing his ability to grow into even more adult roles as he grows older. His role in the film is strikingly similar to his position in his career. He's in between young heroic roles and adult authoritative roles which is what his Roger Ferris is a young CIA agent dealing with new found authority and choices.Though on paper Russell Crowe's role is pretty weak he manages to turn in a great performance through an altered appearance and voice. Once again Crowe's character symbolizes who he is as a person a shaken soda bottle one twist from exploding. It is because our two leads I feel weird saying that as DiCaprio is the only true lead work so well together and hold our attention so well that the film succeeds. An able supporting cast adds to the film as well.Technically well made just like every other Scott films Body of Lies brings nothing new to the table while taking things we've seen before and oneupping the last to do it. The sound in particular was a plus for me as was the art direction like I've said these are always good things in a Ridley Scott film. The preview can be a bit deceiving in marketing the film as an action political thriller like Blood Diamond when in reality it is the thinking man's thriller without that plot twist I thought would be coming. While the film does have some marvelous and well done action it's few and far between as the film is more about gathering intelligence than intelligently blowing everything up.I also appreciate that the film rarely dragged or got boring and I credit this to yet another winning script from William Monahan scribe of The Departed. I think another Oscar nomination for Monahan is possible here. All in all Body of Lies is a well made film that would be nothing special again the lack of thrills in some parts if not for the commanding presence of Leonardo DiCaprio and the always consistent Ridley Scott. It's not worth losing your head over but it is worth giving the price of admission to your local theater.";

	schema:headline " CIA made to look bad again in this mildly interesting spy thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Body of Lies is a story about a CIA operative played by Leonard Dicarprio and his boss Ed Hoffman played by Russell Crowe. Crowe gained about 40 lbs to play the middleaged supervisor Hoffman who spends a good deal of time on a cellphone from CIA Headquarters in Langley Virginia talking with Dicaprio's Roger Ferris who shuttles around the Mideast principally in Iraq and Amman Jordan. Ridley Scott the director makes use of pinpoint satellite images throughout the movie suggesting that the CIA has the ability to spy on various targets closeup through the use of overhead drones. It's very cool looking but can they actually do that? I wonder.Body of Lies is divided into three sequences the first taking place in Iraq where Ferris attempts to make contact with an Iraqi who may or may not have information about Al Qaeda. The informant's cover is blown and Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent the informant from being tortured and revealing Ferris's identity. The first sequence ends in an exciting shootout with militants in a rural area where Ferris obtains information regarding a safe house in Amman Jordan.The second sequence involves Ferris taking over CIA operations in Jordan. He meets with the Jordanian intelligence chief Hani Salaam played by the British actor Mark Srong. Hani is depicted as urbane highly competent and ruthless. He denies 'torturing' informants and when Ferris is brought in and observes them beating one of their own agents who hasn't followed orders Hani tells Ferris that the operative is merely being punished not tortured. Where Hani is smooth and calculating Ferris's boss Hoffman the CIA chief is depicted as impulsive and arrogant. He demands that Hani allow him to interrogate a contact Karami at the safe house who is already known to Jordanian intelligence. Hani adopts a patient approach and is content to leave Karami at the safe house and pry him later for intelligence.After a terrorist bombing in Amsterdam Hoffman feels compelled to get results. Without telling Ferris he orders some of his operatives to tail Karami. Somehow Karami's cover isn't blown but it's enough for the militants at the safe house to set it on fire and flee for parts unknown. Hani is angry at Ferris who denies knowing anything about what happened and is ordered out of Jordan.The third sequence is the most implausible and weakest part of the movie. Hoffman and Ferris meet and Ferris comes up with an absurd plan to capture the terrorist they've been after AlSaleem. Inexplicably Ferris who has been opposed to Hoffman's amoral and impulsive methods outdoes Hoffman when he suggests that they invent a terrorist to make AlSaleem jealous. With the aid of a computer geek employed by the CIA Ferris focuses on Omar Sadiki a hapless Jordanian architect who is set up to be the next Bin Laden. Incredibly they're able to convince Turkish officials to desecrate corpses obtained from a local morgue and use them as part of a plot to simulate a terrorist attack on an US Military facility. Meanwhile Ferris has a change of heart and finally realizes that Sadiki is at risk to be killed by terrorists. After the simulated terrorist attack the plot goes awry and Sadiki is killed by terrorists when they realize he's a harmless dupe.I haven't mentioned that there is a romantic subplot in this movie. Ferris falls for an Iranian nurse Aisha after she treats him at a local clinic for dog bites. At the climax she disappears and appears to be kidnapped. Ferris meets with the kidnappers who turn out to be AlSaleem and his henchmen. As it turns out the noble Hani was the one who grabbed Aisha all along and used Ferris so he could lead him to AlSaleem. In a harrowing scene Ferris is almost beheaded by AlSaleem's goons but in pure Hollywood style Hani and his agents burst in and prevent Ferris from being killed. AlSaleem is also taken into custody.In reading some postings on the internet some residents of Jordan feel that 'Body of Lies' maligns their dear country. This I can't understand true not all the scenes depict the natural beauty of Jordan but hey this is a movie about terrorism and not a travelogue. What's more Hani is the real hero hereintelligent smooth and coolheaded one who 'punishes' and doesn't 'torture'. Unfortunately the CIA once again gets short shrift. Just like in 'Traitor' and The Bourne series the CIA are either bumbling idiots or Machiavellian schemers or both.Body of Lies has some nice cinematography and its greatest asset is the depiction of the Al Qaeda wannabe AlSaleem. He looks and sounds like the real thing and Ridley Scott correctly doesn't sugarcoat his terrorists. DiCaprio has a nice speech condemning AlSaleem and his minions right before he's about to be beheaded.Despite this Body of Lies errs in sugarcoating the Jordanian intelligence service at the expense of the CIA. Are they so much better than the CIA in real life? I think they're built up in order to shoot the CIA down and it doesn't ring true. Furthermore Body of Lies features the ugly suggestion that the CIA would take an innocent man and set him up to be killed by terrorists. Of course if you're a conspiracy theorist then you'll believe the CIA is capable of anything. Body of Lies is a mildly interesting spy thriller. It's worth viewing once but due to its implausible moments and somewhat antiAmerican bent I wouldn't watch it again.".

The story is quite realistic. The cinematography is realistic and the editing and directing keeps this espionage action drama moving along.There are several violent scenes that might not be for the squeamish so be warned.

	schema:reviewBody "In a role that's tailor made for his preening selfinvolved public persona Leonardo DiCaprio plays an intense CIA agent who doesn't play by the rules in his fight against terrorism in the Middle East. Russell Crowe is his slovenly Langleybased boss. The overly complex plot in Body of Lies is often ludicrous with cardboard characters and a heavyhanded tone that attempts to paint a complicated situation in blackandwhite terms.DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris an undercover agent stationed in Jordan who also happens to be going through divorce proceedings. Crowe is Ed Hoffman his middleaged stayathome handler who talks to his agent while shepherding his kids to soccer games and the like. One is directly involved with covert operations the other manges the operations from a distance both physically and emotionally. Naturally this distance causes problems in their working relationship for how can Hoffman be able to tell Ferris how to handle things if he's too far away to get a feel for the situation? Ferris gets a lead on who might be behind some recent terrorist attacks so he decides to become friendly with the head of Jordanian intelligence Hani Salaam Mark Strong hoping to use Salaam's connections to help land his target. Ferris prefers a subtle approach when dealing with citizens of foreign lands embrace the culture and speak the language and the people will be more amenable to helping you. Hoffman prefers the more stereotypical American approach of rushing in demanding raising heck if demands aren't met. Such conflicting styles are bound to create...conflict.The ultimate problem here isn't really the plot however convoluted it is and no matter how many red herrings abound. The problem is DiCaprio himself an actor who seems hellbent on proving he can act by being as intense as possible at all times. They're not the same thing. DiCaprio as is his wont plays a character who is always trying to do the right thing but makes dumb decisions along the way. Which is fine if you're a wooden action figure like Rambo but it's pointless if you're in a heavily plotted espionage thriller. DiCaprio is a movie star not an actor and putting various cuts and bruises on his prettyboy face will change the fact that he's simply not up to the heavy lifting.In fact although I'm not much of a Matt Damon fan the truth is that Damon would have owned this role  had he not already played it basically in the Jason Bourne films. Which means that essentially this is a cheap knockoff of the Bourne films themselves except with fewer action scenes and even more hightech gadgetry.Here's something to look for Ferris's girlfriend a nurse played very well by Golshifteh Farahani. She's pretty of course and Ferris  in the middle of all this running around undercover in Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East  woos her speaking Arabic and observing all the customs of her culture. First of all you know as soon as they make cute eyes at each other that at some point she'll be kidnapped or killed or something and he'll have to rescue or avenge her. Second I found it interesting that while he's ostensibly undercover  an American in the Middle East normally sticks out a little  he doesn't seem to notice that people notice HIM interacting with her. If I'm a secret agent the last place I'd look for a relationship is in the same exact spot where I'm trying to be a secret agent because if the bad guys figure out I'm not on their side  always a possibility  they will also easily figure out that they can use my relationship partner against me. That would be stupid on my part and it's unbelievably dumb on Ferris's part.Skip Body of Lies. Crowe is mostly wasted in a showy slight role anyway and DiCaprio is hammy one dimensional and vapid. Ridley Scott should have passed on directing this socalled political thriller and stuck to more straightforward action movies like Gladiator.".

This is a well made film that just barely misses the mark of being outstanding.Russell Crowe is good in this movie and it's arguably one of the few Crowe movies in which he transforms into his character rather than simply playing himself. DiCaprio is good enough though he definitely suffers from his ongoing inability to play a character rather than being stuck in his same old mannerisms.The plot of this movie is quite intriguing. It's a film that revolves around post911 terrorism in the mideast with most of the movie taking place in the very places that make the news the most some eight years later Iraq Syria and Jordan. Sadly the movie predicts the spread of terrorism to Europe it was filmed after the 77 bus bombings in London and references them but shows an attack in Amsterdam that brings to mind recent attacks in Paris and Brussels. Its fictional drama mixed with real world terrorism makes for a compelling story. Unfortunately there's just something about the movie that makes it obvious that it misses the mark just a tad. It might be argued that the studio was trying a bit too hard to make an Oscar worthy picture but didn't quite pull things together enough. The romantic element of the film feels a bit forced and despite its strengths it comes across as being a bit more like a madeforTV drama series than an award worthy feature film.All in all I'm going with 610 stars. It's certainly worth the time to see but ultimately a good popcorn flick rather than a more substantive film.".

However after watching this movie one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy bloated conceited paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. Not exactly a pretty picture but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious noisy overacted action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. The locales change but the plots remain the same and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudocartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to runon interminably. When will this movie end? I repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA operative but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie the on site operative is lean and mean while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. An obviously nonArab American Mr. DiCaprio trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... speaking fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you get the point. Next time try casting an actual Arab in the role. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. In this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. Next stop for this movie  DVD land and oblivion. And one other thing. Dont let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The pay may not be great but the fringe benefits are excellent a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.".

All the while Ferris is relying on information relayed to him by Field Agent Hofman Russell Crowe but is he playing him for his own agenda? Ridley Scott is a dedicated player in the world of film bringing out a film each year without fail. The memory of last year's excellent American Gangster still lingers in my mind but sadly after Body of Lies it's all too bittersweet.The film plays on current affairs in relation to terrorist cells springing up all over the world a tale torn straight from today's headlines in fact. It also subtly highlights the scary American surveillance technology that keeps tabs on everyone around the world and of events that threaten it's national security around the world significant after 911 when suspected terrorists were taken from their homeland and placed in places such as Guantanamo Bay even more pertinent with yesterday's confession of the 911 plotters. Yet with all this interesting stuff involved Body of Lies is still an unbearably dull film. Maybe I'm a bit thick or just have a short attention span yeah that's it but I found the sluggish pace of the film to just make it all really uninvolving. Scott's typically long drawn out humourless direction doesn't help matters and you just feel someone more hip and modern may have been of more use here.One thing you can't fault is the performances and the dedication behind them. Di Caprio has truly made the jump from teen heart throb to serious actor with serious mature roles like this and he gives his role energy and gusto. Praise too for Crowe for immersing himself in the role of Director Hofman purposely gaining 40 ibs for the role. He seems determined of taking the method acting route of Robert De Niro with this and previous roles including his most recent American Gangster where he asked for tapes so he could get his voice to sound just like that of Det. Richie Roberts. Sadly they are not enough to raise this desperately dull take on modern fears regarding terrorism above it's roots. It's probably more my fault that I didn't like it but I don't have a Mouth of Lies. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally an above average political thriller that is effective and surprisingly politically neutral. That's not to say it won't irk those on the far reaches of either aisle in addition to the always irritable Iranian government. But Body of Lies is a plot driven espionage thriller that demonstrates the basics of what Western intelligence has done right and wrong in the post 911 era without being preachy or shoving too much at the audience.The movie follows Roger Ferris Leonardo DiCaprio an operative trying to gather intel on Islamic terrorist cells to get to the head Al Saleem. He works closely with local contacts wherever he goes only to find that his boss Ed Hoffman Russell Crowe finds them useful but disposable. After losing such a friend in Iraq Ferris travels to Jordan to head up the U.S. Intelligence operations there. In Jordan he befriends Hani Mark Strong the head of Jordanian Intelligence who places more value on patience and trust than speed and technology.Anyone who read the title of the movie can guess the basics of what happens next Ferris gets caught in a web of lies some created by him some by his boss and he struggles to do the right thing and break free from all he has constructed. The lies are actually relatively simple and easy to keep track of. There isn't betrayal upon betrayal which so many movies get caught up in these days but the pacing does suffer due to a plot that forces itself to be intricate when it would be better served by simplicity.There is a point about halfway through the movie where Ferris comes up with the idea to construct a fake terrorist cell to challenge the cell they are going after. The idea isn't all that bad but it basically restarts the plot instead of building it. The pacing of Body of Lies is suspect with plenty of these moments. Ferris doesn't seem to learn much from the err of his ways until the very end so the characters while compelling are also stagnant for most of the movie.Still the performances are excellent if not extraordinary. DiCaprio has established himself as the best young actor out there for quite sometime now. His command of different voices different languages I've never heard a southerner speak Arabic as well as he does in this movie and different mannerisms make him a consummate professional. Crowe in my opinion one of the top few actors working today is underused in what is really a smaller role than what the trailers showed. I guess every Ridley Scott movie just has to have Maximus in it. The two biggest standouts are Mark Strong who plays the Jordanian Intelligence Head just serious and slick enough to make you wonder what his interests really are and Golshifteh Farahani who is the first Iranian born actress to appear in a Hollywood flick since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Incidentally Mrs. Farahani can't return to her native Iran until the court sees the movie and then decides what to do with her passport.Admittedly the love interest of Aisha played by Farahani seems a bit forced. Are Ferris' feelings for a woman really the only thing that can humanize him and realize that maybe he hasn't been doing things the right way this whole time? Body of Lies does such a good job of injecting emotion into it's storyline unlike so many recent political thrillers think Syriana Munich The Constant Gardner etc. that it is disappointing to see it resort to such means in an attempt to humanize Ferris and give his life some real meaning.".

Ferris doesn't seem to learn much from the err of his ways until the very end so the characters while compelling are also stagnant for most of the movie.Still the performances are excellent if not extraordinary. DiCaprio has established himself as the best young actor out there for quite sometime now. His command of different voices different languages I've never heard a southerner speak Arabic as well as he does in this movie and different mannerisms make him a consummate professional. Crowe in my opinion one of the top few actors working today is underused in what is really a smaller role than what the trailers showed. I guess every Ridley Scott movie just has to have Maximus in it. The two biggest standouts are Mark Strong who plays the Jordanian Intelligence Head just serious and slick enough to make you wonder what his interests really are and Golshifteh Farahani who is the first Iranian born actress to appear in a Hollywood flick since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Incidentally Mrs. Farahani can't return to her native Iran until the court sees the movie and then decides what to do with her passport.Admittedly the love interest of Aisha played by Farahani seems a bit forced. Are Ferris' feelings for a woman really the only thing that can humanize him and realize that maybe he hasn't been doing things the right way this whole time? Body of Lies does such a good job of injecting emotion into it's storyline unlike so many recent political thrillers think Syriana Munich The Constant Gardner etc. that it is disappointing to see it resort to such means in an attempt to humanize Ferris and give his life some real meaning.";

The already illtempered Moss has his patience tested even further when he's ordered to chaperone a spoiledbrat Hollywood star Nick Lang Michael J.

Lang is a riot as the unhinged villain wait until you get a load of the kinds of things he does. Delroy Lindo is Moss' starstruck boss and Luis Guzman LL Cool J Mary Mara and John Capodice play his colleagues. A young Christina Ricci is amusing as Sciorra's daughter. Penny Marshall has a fun cameo as Langs' agent.As Nick notices Moss is a very quotable guy such as when he's lecturing the naive Nick on what being a real cop is like.

Another of the highlights is when Nick insists on playing the part of Susan as he attempts to tell Moss what he's doing wrong with his lady.It all culminates in one of those great movie moments where our heroes are doing battle with the psycho on an enormous replication of Nick's head and hand created to advertise his latest film vehicle.Highly recommended to actioncomedy fans.Eight out of 10.".

John Moss NYPD played by James Woods.When I first saw previews for this film I thought I knew what it would be another clichd film involving a snobby film star getting teamed with a cop who hates him. I was wrong.This film in a way blew me out of the water because when I viewed the film I realized that Michael J. Fox's character was not snobby nor ignorant. He was moreorless run by Hollywood instead of vice versa. He is what you would call simply put innocent. Not in a holy context like we are used to when we hear that word in films these days but almost like an innocent child. He really can't wait to watch hear and learn from John Moss. Granted he does usually mess up Moss' assignments but not from ignorance or not caring. He messes up the assignments trying to help Woods and learnWoods on the other hand is partly what I expected yet better. He fits into his character perfectly and plays it with such sickness towards Fox's character that you sometimes feel like yelling at the guy for being such a jerk. I have always liked James Woods' performances in films. He just fits into his certain 'trademark' characters.Unfortunately the end of the film seems to stain the rest of the film's surprises and slip into our average copbuddy comedy with a ridiculous climax. Luckily the very very end of the film is slightly predictable but Woods' outlook on Fox while he respects him more still hasn't changed a whole lot. He still doesn't really like the guy as a friend but almost puts up with him because of what he did for Woods. It's a bit hard to explain especially without throwing away the ending but when you see it you'll understand. So with that in mind the very end of the film redeems the short five minutes or so of Hollywood copbuddy film clichs.'The Hard Way' was a major surprise for me and turned out to be a very enjoyable comedy. I wouldn't really classify it in the 'copbuddy' genre. It's too unpredictable to a certain degree and enjoyable.".

Unfortunately the dialogue isnt the greatest thats ever been written for the screen with Woods tough cop spouting  Dammit  and  Fk  in equal measure . Take it from me that if someone curses with the F word they never EVER say  Dammit  and vice versa . Some people may also complain that THE HARD WAY is somewhat lightweight when compared to something like 48 HOURS and I suppose it is but theres no real jarring in serious scenes and the more humourous ones unlike some buddy movies THE HARD WAY isnt a movie thats going to change your life but it is entertaining  especially if you like James Woods or Michael J Fox".

So full of energy and vitality a very physical actor a gifted comedian Michael J Fox made even the more routine of comedies this one a take on the street police buddy action comedy so popular in the 80s palatable. James Woods has always been a star. A powerhouse as Leonard Maltin likes to refer to Woods he commands and impresses with that intensity and charisma at all times. Here it was his chance to play a copa good one who is after an unstable blondhaired wickedgrinned Stephen Lang he carved himself a niche for villainy of all sorts the moment he shows up in Seagal's Fire Down Below you know he's no good or his military hardass in Avatar picking off street criminals pimp drug dealer underground gunmakertasked with the burden of shouldering a primadonna diva action star played by Fox. Fox is about to star in a film about a cop and it is part of Fox's method to follow Woods so he can get down the mannerisms speech and personality of the real deal. Woods of course would rather focus on catching a killer on the street not carrying around a egotistical actor obviously Fox is too likable and endearing to be as annoying and grating as real egorich Hollywood stars hoping to hone his craft by following close to the hip of an authentic streetwise detective. So that's the film in a nutshell. Toss in a hot Annabella Sciorra as Woods' romantic interest she was in EVERYTHING at this time in the early 90s Delroy Lindo as Woods' boss and Fox supporter and plenty of shootouts explosions and car destruction Guess what? Yep you got it a fruit stand is barreled through and a cop car takes a couple flips! The Hard Way has plenty to offer those with an affinity for action buddy comedies that involve two totally different guys such polar opposites eventually coming together to stop a killer.Memorable moments include Fox awakening to find himself handcuffed to a bed with Woods leaving behind a sign to mock him Woods staging a faux accidental murder to frighten Fox away going so far as to use a cop portraying an innocent bystander shot by Fox in a staged collateral damage ruse! Fox exchanging gunfire with a hood running with two other punks in a subway station with Woods coming to the rescue and the climactic billboard sign overlooking the city scene where Lang is responsible for Sciorra hanging for dear life from a giant cigarette Woods having to grab hold to the bill of a hat granted it's a HUGE hat and Fox grabbing hold to his own eye granted this eye is slightly larger with a rope he swings across his face grantedokay you get the picture to rescue Sciorra before her cigarette snaps into. Fox gives us the expected laughs but Woods isn't too shabby as the straight part of the act his frustrations and aggravation at enduring such a tagalong leading to some fun moments too. Woods has always been a phenomenal heavy but this proves he can take on the part of one of the good guys...I really liked this one scene where Woods calls out Sciorra for the old argument of I don't want to attach myself to the man who may never come home by retorting We are always the one though depended upon with the bad goes down. Fox and Woods have some solid chemistry which certainly doesn't hurt. Lang plays the part of the colorful lunatic the one you would see mocked in Last Action Hero with no restraint.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hard Way is set in New York where detective John Moss James Woods is on the case of a ruthless killer nicknamed the Party Crasher Stephen Lang who taunts police as shoots people dead he phones the police  invites them to watch as he kills people. While chasing the Party Crasher detective Moss is injured  his boss Captain Brix Delroy Lindo takes him off the case in order to babysit rich Hollywood action film star Nick Lang Michael J. Fox who is researching a role as a cop poses as Moss' new partner Moss is horrified at having Lang follow him around as he won't let the Party Crasher case go  drags Lang into it...Directed by John Badham this action comedy thriller is the second Badham flick I have seen in the space of twenty four hours I didn't plan it that way but the other was Blue Thunder 1983  having watched both for the first time I am struck that while they are both decent enough action thrillers neither are particularly great  both feel rather routine. Here in The Hard Way we have the whole mismatched cop partners scenario with average results a popular but overcrowed genre at the time there are better examples that spring to mind such as Lethal Weapon 1987 Red Heat 1988  Tango  Cash 1989 to name but three. The difference fans of the film will point to is that Lang is an action film star but for all intents  purposes The Hard Way plays out like a straight cop thriller with little in the way of depth. The two main character's of Moss  Lang are great  equally great performances by Woods  Fox carry the lightweight script  it's them who make this as watchable as it is the interplay between the two is funny at times  the gradual warming of the character's towards each other works pretty well. However beyond a spirited couple of leads The Hard Way is routine  clichd there's the grumpy police captain the bad guy with a personal vendetta against the hero the veteran cop  his rookie partner a love interest  a final confrontation to the death. The Hard Way is also very predictable in the way it unfolds at over 110 minutes it's maybe a little long Moss or any other NYPD cop doesn't seem to do any real policework other than what he wants  the Party Crasher is given virtually no background or motivation other than the excuse he was killing criminals which gets explored with all of one line of dialogue.There are some funny moments here for sure but maybe not quite enough Moss screeching through New York shouting profanity as everyone around him or the one to one in a bar with Lang where he pretends to be Moss' girlfriend is also a highlight but beyond the energy  goodwill brought to the film by the two leads both character's  actor's there's just not that much here as any sort of plot takes a back seat. While not particularly violent The Hard Way is full of profanity so if you have sensitive ears in that regard be prepared. The action is pretty good but there's not enough of it there's a couple of car chases  stunts an explosion at a petrol pump  the final confrontation above Times Square in New York which looks impressive but lacks excitement. Apparently James Woods had his own hairdresser on set at a cost of 6000 a week.Flopping at the boxoffice I would suggest the buddy buddy cop film had lost it's appeal somewhat  The Hard Way is a fairly routine example anyway. This has that big budget Hollywood look about it  looks nice enough. The acting by the two leads is great with the always excellent James Woods taking first prize Fox is very good too while rapper LL Cool J has a small role as a cop.The Hard Way is a standard mismatched cop action thriller that is made watchable by great performances by it's leading actor's  some pretty funny moments  oneliners but storywise this is less than average  there's certainly not enough plot here to fill 110 minutes.".

Well this comedy takes that concept to the extreme and plays it purely for laughs.Michael J.Fox plays an Hollywoodpampered movie star of Indiana Jones type action movies who is sick of been labelled as a family oriented actor and wants to play meatier roles. He plans on playing a cop in a gritty new film and in order to do some research he is teamed up with New York's angriest most unsociable detective James Woods. But he's on the trail of a psychotic serial killer and doesn't intend to let Fox get in the way.The plot isn't important here. It's the hilarious banter and excellent chemistry between the two lead stars that makes the film so much fun while director John Badham milks the concept for all it's worth. He plays around with the cop movie conventions and bites the hand that feeds him with lots of swipes at Hollywood before the likes of Last Action Hero Showtime and Hollywood Homicide got in on the act.The production design is terrific throughout and is as good as you could hope for what is essentially just an action comedy. Badham clearly put a lot of thought into his locations. The New York city streets in the film are crowded dirty and gritty lookingto further contrast Fox's Beverley Hills lifestyle.The stunts are impressive and as the film goes on the action sequences become more and more over the top which suits the film because it puts Fox and Woods into situations similar to Fox's character's movies. The mayhem climaxes with a fun homage to North By Northwest. A great action comedyand Fox and Woods set this apart from the usual buddy cop movies from the 80's and 90's. Loved it.".

My mom knows we love MJF so while grocery shopping she picked up a fourmovie DVD she found on a clearance rack and one of the movies happened to be The Hard Way. I only watched it because my little sister asked me to and I even brought my phone in the room in case I got bored because that's what happened when she made me watch Midnight Madness another littleknown Fox film his first role actually. However I never picked up my phone once! The film started out strong with our first glimpse at the party crasher played with manic and slightly terrifying believability by Stephen Lang and a joke involving Shakespeare plays that immediately got me hooked. Stephen Lang wasn't the only good actor in this movie surprisingly the whole thing was earnestly acted and nobody really bordered on cheesy like they do in most bad comedies from that era. Michael J Fox was endearing as usual as the naive movie star shadowing a cop for a role and even when he had emotionally difficult scenes he never came off as cheesy like he occasionally did in Family Ties. And James Woods was especially great as the lovestricken NYPD cop. I'm usually very picky when it comes to movies especially comedies but I enjoyed this. If you're a Fox fan definitely don't miss it!".

This along with Casualties of War and Bright Lights Big City seemed to complete his trilogy of adult material movies. This was also in the midst of buddycop movies that it seems to be spoofing. I love Badham's direction in this film. Everything has a nice fast clip to it. The action pieces follow logic without being too showy. And...you really have to marvel at Badham's thrift when it came to action without the super budget.I got the feeling that Fox may've been spoofing a fellow actor in his Method way of going about learning to be a cop. That he was channeling the same overthinking actor processes that Downey does to the extreme in Tropic Thunder. In lesser hands I think Nick Lang could've been a terrible caricature. But he skates a really fine line and does it with such joy you love spending time with his spoiled brat complex.Also very under appreciated is Delroy Lindo's spin at the Captain role. You expect him to be a toughasnails screamer but in reality...he's just a starstruck fan like we would all probably be. And it really lends itself to great humor to the frustrated Woods seriousness.It's a really fun movie.".

This movie has much to offer. For example Michael J. Fox plays the startlingly true to life role of an actor in WAY over his head. If that doesn't convince you this will... At one point during the scene where M. J. Fox is pretending to be James Woods' girlfriend if you pause the DVD at precisely the right moment you can actually see the usually reliable James Woods hit rock bottom. Absolute zero baby. This isn't as bad as it seems for Mr. Woods considering Big Fox has these moments several times per minute on screen. Another interesting note is that the second unit director is none other than Rob Cohen. You may know him from his many cinematic achievements such as XXX The Fast and the Furious and The Skulls. Normally I'd doubt that a mere second unit director could possibly leave his wretched fingerprint on a piece of work but in this case I'm pretty sure something must have oozed over onto the first unit. It would explain a lot. Needless to say I love this movie! Except the length... Not quite long enough. Sure it's an hour and fifty one minutes that most closely resembles a twenty year stint on death row but when someone is doling out this kind of beating I say stick out your chin and enjoy the sweet agony.".

In the stories that Doctor Parnassus tells to his daughter Valentina the midget Percy and his assistant Anton he claims to have lived for more than one thousand years However when he fell in love with a mortal woman he made a deal with the devil Mr. Nick trading his immortality for youth. As part of the bargain he promised his son or daughter to Mr. Nick on their sixteenth birthday. Valentina is now almost to the doomed age and Doctor Parnassus makes a new bet with Mr. Nick whoever seduces five souls in the Imaginarium will have Valentina as a prize. Meanwhile the troupe rescues Tony a young man that was hanged on a bridge by the Russians. Tony was chased until he finds and joins the group.

	schema:reviewBody "Like so many of Terry Gilliam's films The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus is one that is going to need multiple viewings to truly form an opinion on. Like Brazil Adventures Of Baron Munchausen Fisher King Fear  Loathing In Las Vegas and Tideland even Time Bandits really there is so much going on here that expectations or reputations get in the way and make it hard to digest and appreciate on a single viewing. No bad thing necessarily.Of course Parnassus has the particularly insurmountable problem of being the late Heath Ledger's final performance and following on from his superb Oscarwinning turn in The Dark Knight. It is impossible to see the film through eyes that don't see it as the film he died making. Some parts of the film may perhaps work even better than they may of done had he lived  some of the best films are triumphs over adversity and adverse conditions don't come much greater than your star dying midshoot. But whatever works and doesn't in the film it is hard  impossible on a first viewing  to divorce yourself from the knowledge you bring into the theatre.On first feeling Parnassus seems patchy and curiously it feels like a film that may not have worked as well as it does had nothing happened to Ledger. Don't get me wrong I'd rather have a Gilliam failure and Ledger still alive to put it behind him and move on than a wonderful film that is largely the result of his tragic death. But we don't have that so I'm just looking at what's there.The fact is the film is at it's best when galloping around the fantastical worlds of the Imaginarium with Ledger's character Tony now played by Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell. Depp and Farrell are particularly good and imbue the film with an energy lacking in much of it.The casting generally is good. Christopher Plummer is steadfast excellence as always. Lily Cole is a surprisingly strong choice. I've never understood the viewpoint of Cole as sooooooo beautiful that the gossip sheets and magazines espouse but she has a quirky intrigue that works wonders in a Gilliam world and proves herself as an actress amongst a proved group of impressive performers. Hers is probably the best debut performance I can recall of a model or singer turning to acting. She puts a lot of professional actresses no Keiras named! to shame.Andrew Garfield is that intriguing mix of annoying and brilliant. Like DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? I started out thinking he was terrible and then grew to realise it was just that I hated him his character. He annoyed the hell out of me. In another words he had inhabited the character so fully so convincingly that my negative feelings toward him where directed at the fictional character. A superb performance.Tom Waits steals moments constantly. Waits hasn't been given such a juicy role that fit him better since Renfield in Coppola's Dracula and he revels as Dr Nick the devil here.Oddly the performance that again I specify on first viewing leaves you a bit underwhelmed is Ledgers. It is not a bad performance but the expectations as you go in knowing it was his last performance means you expect something special. Brokeback MountainDark Knight special. But of course not every role is as powerful as his in Brokeback or as scenestealing as the Joker. I mean he didn't know it was his last performance for crying out loud. Therefore it cannot possibly live up to expectations and is destined to underwhelm until multiple viewings and some distance allow it to be judged fairly. That there was such a fully formed character there that three other actors could step in to play alternate universe versions of it entirely convincingly is arguably a testament to how strong a performance Ledger did give. It is not a likable character or a flashy character it doesn't even really seem the main character until the alternate worlds with the alternate Tonys come in and so Ledger's understated subtleties are easy to miss.When you watch Fisher King the first time you remember Robin Williams not Jeff Bridges. In Twelve Monkeys it's Brad Pitt that comes away with you not Bruce Willis. And yet on further viewings Bridges' performance seems superb Willis' perhaps the best of his career. I suspect on repeated viewings I'm going to see the strength of Ledger's performance better. I hope so.And of course this is a problem much of the film has. Gilliam doesn't make simple overly explained films for the masses  thank Gilliam  you have to work with them. The problem here is that with your mind distracted with thoughts of Ledger and expectations built on that promise of Gilliam at his creative best three stepin performances and Ledger's final performance it's hard to get your mind around the story and enjoy it as a piece of work.Sometimes Gilliam films work sometimes they don't. Sometimes they get better and better on repeat viewings Brazil sometimes they work instantly Twelve Monkeys sometimes they seem to work but the more you see them or think about them they crumble and ultimately don't Brothers Grimm. Sometimes they just seem to be a mix of great ideas wonderful performances and ingenious set pieces but hampered by an overabundance of theatricality and almost too much going on for its own good Baron Munchausen. On a first viewing Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus feels like this latter. Bits work bits don't. It's enjoyable in places but perplexing ultimately.I will definitely revisit it though to see if changes on repeat viewings. I feel sure it will but whether that's a good or bad thing well I'll have to wait and see.".

Because of this tragedic death other actors came to fill up the role such as Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell.And still the important character the Faust that can't keep himself from betting with a mischievous devil that isn't even very unfriendly is Christopher Plummer's who played marvelously at his age of 81. I loved the way the devil was toying with him addicted to playing games that he didn't want to win in the end so that he keeps playing. The visuals were great the atmosphere both miraculous and brooding but rarely in the same time. And Lily Cole was cute and sexy as hell.Bottom line a weird film that you need to think about to get at his many hidden meanings with beautiful imaginative imagery and great actors.

	schema:headline " The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus";
	schema:reviewBody "The main talking point surrounding The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is the fact that it is the last appearance of the late Heath Ledger however there is a lot more to talk about with this film. Ledger's performance is good as one would expect but he has done better and more iconic roles. The problem faced by his death occurring before filming completed is overcome easily and one would not necessarily know that Ledger had died just from the evidence of the film. There is a fitting tribute to him in the film as Johnny Depp's version of Heath Ledger's character comments on how celebrities who died young will live on forever.However this film deserves to be discussed as a piece of work on its own. Like many of Terry Gilliam's films it is both complex and imaginative. The titular Doctor Parnassus Christopher Plummer operates a mostly unsuccessful travelling show where he hopes to send members of the public through a magic mirror into the Imaginarium where they will ultimately face a choice between giving their soul to Parnassus or the Devil Tom Waits. Those two are having a contest for the soul of Valentina Lily Cole the Doctor's daughter. Helping the Doctor's show are the lovelorn Anton the dwarf Percy and Tony a mysterious stranger who can draw punters. Initially all these plot points work well. Doctor Parnassus is a desperate man who has almost given up hope whilst the Devil is entertaining to watch yet evidently devious. The heart of the film lies with Valentina who wants a normal life but is it unaware that it is far more complicated than just the raising of money. Unfortunately the film runs into difficulty in the last third as the plot lines all come together and even more are added creating a overly complex ending where nothing gets resolved properly. The acting is good with Lily Cole surprisingly impressive and old hands Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits leading by example. Terry Gilliam direction combines the fantastical and the ordinary in a way that only he can. It is the first time he has participated in the writing process for two decades and this film has an autobiographical feel as Doctor Parnassus tries to entice with stories and the imagination only to be met by cynical crowds. This effort to wow the public may not move them away from CGI and is short of his best but it is still entertaining and favourable over films which lack charm imagination and storytelling.".

The story really a parable or allegory is built up in layers and seemed to me perfectly cast even allowing for Ledger's ringins after his untimely death. I particularly like the play between Parnassus Christopher Plummer and Mr Nick Tom Waits. I found it interesting to see the visual influences in this film as well. The fantasy segments all have the mark of the director's animation days with Monty Python. There's also a Harry Potter influence in that Parnassus's wagontheater looks like something from one of those films and Parnassus himself reminded me strongly of a drunk Dumbledore.But this is NOT a film for everyone. The ending is NOT a Hollywood style happy ending by any means but one that reflects on the nature of life.

	schema:reviewBody "Trying to come up with some kind of rating for The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is quite a challenge indeed. On one hand the plot goes absolutely nowhere the ending is nearly incoherent and the point seems lost in an overly symbolical climax. On the other hand the movie is absolutely beautiful some characters are beyond excellent and the ideas behind it are tremendously original. And I'm an absolute sucker for originality.Imaginarium makes no bones about being completely outofthisworld from the outset following a troupe of actors and mystics. The leader Dr. Parnassus is mostly silent on stage rumoured to be an immortal who has lived 1000 years. Also following are Parnassus' 15yearold daughter Valentina youthful romantic Anton who is of course headoverheels for Valentina and wisecracking yet wise midget Percy. They soon run across a mysterious amnesiac stranger who has new ideas for the show.Parnassus accepts because he's made a deal with the devil given the name Mr. Nick and needs to collect five souls before the devil does which he accomplishes by having people enter his Imaginarium a world inside histheir mind its difficult to tell just whose mind it is. And so the race is on and Valentina's life is at stake.The exact rules of this soulcollecting business is never explicitly stated. Some parts near the end involving this simply make little to no sense. In fact the entire ending is full of mumbo jumbo that probably demands a second viewing. Even with this oddity the ending is nonetheless exciting.The middle however does drag somewhat. Despite what one might think the Imaginarium scenes appear in the beginning then cut out for nearly an hour. The movie doesn't have much steam in the real world although Ledger's enthusiac salesman performance does give these bits some life to them as well as any interactions with Percy.It does of course have a very standard love triangle with Anton and the stranger vying over Valentina's affections. Thankfully neither suitor is displayed as particularly perfect but it does feel somewhat bythebook otherwise. Anton is the sweet ageappropriate suitor with a gleam in his eye and jealously in his heart. The stranger eventually revealed to be named Tony but I much prefer the early moniker George is much cooler and more assertive but there's mysteries in his past. How it all ends up is slightly surprising but its mostly the same as always for the romantic side of things.As for the actual imaginarium scenes if Avatar is a testament to the raw power of CGI this film is a testament to their artistic value. Likely entirely greenscreened these sequences are quite dazzling with rivers turning into snakes and sinister Russian mothers. Its like Alice in Wonderland went slightly more overtheedge and some while some bits are truly bizarre its all quite fascinating especially when it is first reintroduced after the middle.One of the big buzzes of Parnassus is Ledger's performance being his last before his untimely death. While he has extraordinary bits as the salesman of the show the meatier bits in the imaginarium unfortunately were not filmed before he passed. In an act of true genius Gilliam used three other actors to fill in Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrel with the explanation being that his appearance changes. Which would have made sense had the other characters had their appearance change as well although one other exception does occur giving it somewhat more validity. All three actors pull their weight wonderfully to help the film. Jude Law in my opinion was the best of the three although Farrel was also great with likely the most screen time and dramatic impact. Depp was certainly entertaining but seemed too much like Johnny Depp clashing a bit with Ledger's characteristics on the outside. Unfortunately Ledger's character is last seen as one of these forms leaving the characters sendoff disconnected.The supporting cast has some big standouts. Plummer is appropriately wise but does little more than expected. Lily Cole is a beautiful subject for the role and perfectly exudes youthful naivete although the character's age sometimes makes her actions squeamish. Verne Troyer yeah that Verne Troyer is exceptional as the comic relief Percy. The true standout is Tom Waits as Mr. Nick the trickster devil. A stlish mix of clever and evil Mr. Nick is one of the best villains of the year and an excellently entertaining performance.Imaginarium simply must be seen twice to get a proper opinion of the movie. If originality and style is more important than pure dramatic substance for you then I would recommend this movie as few like it exist. If you want more substance look elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus tells the story of the immortal Dr Parnassus Christopher Plummer and his magical Imaginarium a travelling show in which a volunteer from the audience gets to experience their greatest need in vivid forms and then has to choose between two paths. Choose correctly and you will be enlightened choose wrongly and things won't be so good for you. Dr Parnassus however has a very dark secret he once made a bet with Mr Nick the Devil Tom Waits in which he won immortality. Centuries later he decided to trade his immortality with youth when he met his one true love on the condition that his daughter Valentina Lily Cole belongs to Mr Nick when she reaches 16. The daughter is now reaching that consenting age and Mr Nick comes to collect but Dr Parnassus is not about to let go. However being the devil that he is Mr Nick renewed the wager Whoever entices the first 5 souls wins Valentina.Enter Tony the late Heath Ledger a mysterious man found hanging under a bridge by the Imaginarium crews and was revived by Anton Andrew Garfield to join the show and eventually make it successful. However there's something about Tony that makes Parnassus' loyal friend Percy Verne Troyer uneasy. Tony's shady backgrounds and friendship with Valetina also make the jealous Percy more anxious. Dr Parnassus on the other hand is happy with Tony and he promises his daughter's hand in marriage to whoever that helps him win the bet. A race against time and choices of morality ensues in the wonderland that is the Imaginarium.Terry Gilliam directed this painting of a movie wonderfully with timing and pace coherently controlled. He gives us not just a great story but a whole world so outstandingly created with visual effect and cinematography that might leave you wondering where you are at the end of the movie and where you were during it. The Imaginarium with its doorway made of simple foil sheets is filled with random worlds produced by people's mind which is so vivid and mysterious and weird. This whole film is weird. But in a good way.What most might notice is the fact that the script and dialogues flow and form so smoothly and realistically that it is like watching real people in real situation. Heath Ledger did improvise some of his line and that fact alone proves how great of an actor he is. Although you might find his acting a bit similar to last year's most famous villain The Joker in The Dark Knight 2008 which of course he himself played. His acting is believable since he is an Australian playing British. Then there are Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell each playing the different version of Tony when he enters the Imaginarium. The three actors played that one role so well that they disappeared into Heath Ledger's character so effectively that you are seeing a man whose face had changed and not a change in the person himself.But of course this is not a story about Tony but Dr Parnassus as in the title. Christopher Plummer did well playing a failing sometimes drunken sideshow immortal and he provided enough mystical quality for the character. There are also several flashback scenes of a younger Parnassus also played by him. Tom Waits played the Devil brilliantly with his growly voice and dark demeanour. Lily Cole proved that she can show real raw emotion in some scenes. Verne Troyer plays a lovable Percy equipped with fast witty comments and wise words. And Andrew Garfield plays the distress young man Anton.The score is great. Nothing groundbreaking but the music disappears and becomes a part of the scene. A great touch is when whenever Mr Nick appears the score changes to something jazzy or bluesy.The storyline itself is something to be loved and the twist and turns of the plot is something to be admired. It's one thing people might not expect from a CGIladen movie. But the story will grip you and make you captivated that you will sit through the 120 minutes just to see how it ends. The writers Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown deserve an applause for handling such complicated story so well.It is basically a story about a father protecting his daughter. But what makes it unique is the fact that is it layered with metaphors and references about religion the battle between good and evil choices people made impression people put up and morality behind each of our action.Not many people will like this movie simply because of its strange nature. The storyline itself is quiet confusing and its combination with the weird graphic of the Imaginarium world does not help at all. Some parts need a second viewing which I'm sure will be a rewarding watch. But if you understand it I expect you will love The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.".

But with the actor's tragic passing its unremarkable place on 2009's cinema calendar was upped by being Ledger's second posthumous and final movie unfairly burdening the film with the anticipation of it being something great.It's not great. But it is a good movie and probably Gilliam's best in over a decade. Also bittersweet though it may be Ledger's inability to complete his work is remedied in an incredibly inventive manner that arguably improves what would have been the multiple facets of Ledger's mysterious Tony in the Imaginarium is a great inflection and Gilliam deserves credit for this creative retooling and for the fact that the haste in which it was applied is not at all noticeable. Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell who all donated their wages to his daughter Matilda honorably step in to play the alternates paying poignant tribute to their friend. All are good though Farrell's Irish accent is far too thick to flatten Depp probably being the best but its all mimicry Ledger is the one who does all the work. His Tony performed with a flawless English accent is a great part for him possessing all the characteristics of vintage Ledger  charismatic droll physically erratic etc. It's not on par with his work in Brokeback Mountain or The Dark Knight but seeing how much fun he must have been having seeing that wily smile makes it a none the more fitting goodbye to the man.The multipersonas also despite sounding like classically contrived Gilliam actually turn out to be the most credible part of the movie they represent the most fascinating of the film's many mediations on reality Gilliam is always at best when toying with reality and this is no exception  different parallels of the human psyche or at least Tony's are all challenged and make for genuinely thoughtprovoking stuff. The rest of the film however is a bit of a patchwork provocative but hopelessly overwrought. As always with the Brazil director you can't fault his ambition but he's always been patently unable to neatly combine all of his ideas into a satisfying whole.His biggest mistake is going contemporary. Gilliam's sense of humor being that of a Python affiliate's has always been wellauthenticated by a theatrical and undeniably British zaniness. But here we get modern social satire in the form of Tony's revamped version of the group's travelling act and we get conversational verbosity particularly in the poor improvisation of a pointless Verne Troyer and it simply doesn't suit. Better are the moments where a group of violenceloving coppers dance about in skirts or in the inebriated ramblings of Doctor Parnassus.Why Gilliam didn't stick to his personal brand of appealing outlandishness is a shame and a mystery considering his fine cast of comicallyendowed Brits with glorious thespian Christopher Plummer at its head as the titular Doc. Of all the actors on hand here Plummer is the one who best excels with the material. Playing a man who has lived over onethousand years he manages to convincingly carry himself with the weight of that time his sallowskinned and ravaged face heavy sad eyes and worldweary frown scarily naturalistic. He's a heartbreaking character and Plummer makes him an uncompromising presence.Also impressive are newcomers Andrew Garfield and Lily Cole and Tom Waits as Mr Nick the Devil himself. The notorious singer has never really had any good roles to work with in his career and in all fairness his talents as an actor dictates just as much but he's simply perfect here his Machiavelli stealing all the scenes he wonderfully chews with his smarminess. It's not exactly a creation of noteworthy prowess and neither is the character  the cavalier smoothtalking gentlemanlike villain who relishes fomenting is very overdone but he's just such a hoot and effortlessly magnetic. He's pretty much the best thing here and worth the admission price.Along with the cast the visuals a branch you can expect brilliance in with Gilliam are a real saving grace. The special effects in the Imaginarium aren't extraordinary but that's the point it's an accentuated animated reality  one's greatest dreams and nightmares aren't supposed to be realistic. And few images this year are more stirring than of a harrowed Parnassus wandering through a vast snowplain giving up his struggle at a crossroad sign that reads High Road or Low Road.It's a very entertaining movie and thematically sound it manages to make existentialism and solipsism accessible and endearingly whimsical in tone and style. Unfortunately it frequently degenerates into a muddle the many ideas it juggles far too incoherently transcended. Thankfully however after the monotonous middle act the movie picks up steam and the great Imaginarium sequences arrive to compel. And in the end it's a sheer miracle that the movie got made the fact that Gilliam didn't give up that he persevered and singlehandedly defeated one of the worst production catastrophes and that he gave Ledger his swansong is something truly amazing. And it is for that reason that The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus will be remembered.".

	schema:headline " Imaginarium of Terry Gilliam";
	schema:reviewBody "I found this film interesting and visually stunning but flawed. At least one of the flaws cannot be attributed to faulty writingproduction but several others can be. For example there is nothing new or original in the story it is a straightforward retelling of Faust the man who makes a pact with the devil and discovers that the devil is smarter and has all the time in the universe to prove it. The ideas of a man who asks for immortality but neglects to ask for eternal youth and of a child born with a curse on her because of a prior wager her father has made with divine powers to further his own interests are taken straight out of Greek mythology. Still one could do worse than borrow from Goethe and Greek mythology. The movie weaves in and out of mundane reality the traveling freak show in modern England and schizophrenic hallucinogenic scenes inside the Imaginarium which is the carnival attraction into which Dr. P lures potential sacrificial victims in his attempt to outwit the devil. The scenes inside the Imaginarium show what happens when you give an exPython unlimited access to digital effects quite stunning but having little to do with the story. They show the fantasy of Gilliam running wild on a huge budget more than effectively advancing the story of Dr. P and his accursed daughter. I ask myself what a 1930s producerdirector Fritz Lang or Tod Browning for example might have done with this story and these characters but without the digital effects the story might have benefited from leaving the hallucinogenic details more to the imagination of the viewer than browbeating us with a pixel barrage of details. The real horror of what Dr. P is doing is masked by the almost Dr. Seussian silliness of the visual effects dancing policemen?? Dr. P is luring souls to eternal damnation in an attempt to free his daughter from a wager he made centuries ago. Dr. P is in essence trading in human souls. Dr. P himself is immortal but his daughter is not and time is running out for her the horror of her situation and the evil Dr. P is willing to perpetrate to undo the effects of his own damnable wager could certainly have been ratcheted up by more subtle means than Gilliam employs here.The reality scenes sometimes interweave with the fantastical ones in schizophrenic confusion indicating so I suppose Dr. P's own tenuous grasp on reality. The schizophrenic quality of the film is enhanced by the fact that several different actors play the part of one of the main characters Tony. I ask myself whether any producerdirector would have chosen this as his preferred mechanism to unfold this story and the answer I come up with is no. It is a trick which doesn't quite work for this story though it did work for I'm Not There no one could play Bob Dylan. The film just barely manages to make the trick plausible by implying that the differences in the character's appearance are due to the perspectives of the different people who perceive that character within the Imaginarium. OK it was made necessary by the death of the actor in the middle of production otherwise the film would not have gone public I can see that Gilliam made the best of terribly unfortunate circumstances. But it is still a dubious trick.The casting is excellent Plummer is entirely convincing as the world weary Faustian character Miss Cole acquits herself well as the girl clueless as to her own impending doom and Waits is superb as the devil. If I hadn't seen any other film with Heath Ledger in it I would not have thought him an especially gifted actor based solely on this performance maybe if he had completed the film it would have shown his true abilities.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Just before leaving to go and see The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus the latest offering from the perpetually 'unlucky' yet stubbornly visionary Terry Gilliam Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Time Bandits I asked a good friend also a movie buff if he wanted to come with.No way he proclaimed. I can't sit through a Terry Gilliam movie. Having sat through the 2 hour  film myself I'm convinced he made the right decision as I even had a tough time with it. It's definitely too long rarely makes sense and feels as though it might unravel at any minute. As usual Gilliam's imagination takes over the film running completely wild in every direction resulting in a rich visual feast that's a delight to look at. As usual though this comes at the expense of clarity and accessibility which is unfortunate especially so considering the multiple realworld challenges that severely disrupted the film's production and its theoretical comprehensibility anyway. Is Gilliam ever gonna catch a break? And if he does will he be relaxed enough to create something that more that a handful of folks might like? This film's script mostly unchanged despite production difficulties will definitely try one's patience characters make weird choices and important plot elements are left unexplained. As a decision seemingly made to serve the story most of Gilliam's film operates on a kind of dream logic which at the best of times put a huge grin on my face and made me feel all gooey inside and at the worst of times pulled me right out of the film faster than a spilled cold Coke in the lap. As an example of the latter one would think that Gilliam having famously made the creative decision to bolster the late Heath Ledger's incomplete performance with the work of Johnny Depp Colin Farrel and Jude Law might have installed some sort of interesting yet logical plot device allowing that singular character to appear physically different at times. Sadly the reasoning is for some reason halfbaked  the other characters in the film are just as puzzled as the audience is at the changes even going way too far with their No wait... who are you? line of questions. If one's own characters seem to think it's out of place then the audience will have no choice but to question it as well. Disbelief unsuspended and resolute in its anchorlike stolidity how's that for a sentence?.Now despite all that I absolutely positively and without question adored The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. Because Gilliam is really really good at what he does best. It's far and away one of my favourite films of the year and easily the most important film of Gilliam's career warts and all. With Parnassus he continues to stylistically explore potent ideas about the power of storytelling and imagination and what happens when the worlds of fables and makebelieve collide with our cynical sober reality  all concepts I personally go nuts over. When in this mode he always managed to subtextually raise questions about imagination and dreams as important signposts in our collective unconscious lighting the way to collective and individual hope joy and happiness. The difference with Parnassus is that Gilliam has finally made a film that is explicitly and without question about that exact thing positing at its core that stories and imagination and new ideas are the very things that hold the fabric of the universe together. A beautiful idea and as relevant as ever considering Hollywood's constant push for the bottom line over creative integrity and Gilliam's own personal feelings regarding his stifled creativity and the uncertainty of his place in modern cinema. And if you're anything like me Naive? Simple? this stuff when fused with Gilliam's impeccable eye for composition and always fantastic production design will help you forget that the film isn't perfect or logical or accessible.Despite all of the aforementioned flaws in the story which understandably most moviegoers may have a low tolerance for The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is actually quite brilliant and contains some of the single best movie moments and ideas seen all year and by dint of its stellar cast besides Heath Ledger and friends the film stars Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits both in memorable roles serves as a showcase for some of the best talent working in film at the time of production. But because of its flaws it probably won't generate the word of mouth necessary to bring the crowds and as such the box office receipts that Gilliam so desperately needs in order to continue to be able to make films of this scale. Which is too bad as directors like Gilliam who so zealously worship at the alter of imagination and visual splendour with a slavish dedication to filmmaking craft are not so high in abundance. Maybe if he was actually able to you know make a film without having outside elements messing up his plans he might actually live up to his ultimate potential as an original storyteller able to easily reach the masses. As it stands though his status as such as well as the very fabric of the universe it seems continue to be under threat.My score? 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "In London the sideshow troupe of Doctor Parnassus Christopher Plummer promises to the audiences a journey to the Imaginarium an imaginary world commanded by the mind of Doctor Parnassus where dreams come true. In the stories that Doctor Parnassus tells to his daughter Valentina Lily Cole to the midget Percy Verne Troyer and his assistant Anton Andrew Garfield he claims to have more than one thousand years however when he felt in love for a mortal he made a deal with the devil Mr. Nick Tom Waits trading his immortality per youth. As part of the bargain he promised his son or daughter to Mr. Nick on the sixteenth birthday. Valentina now is almost in the doomed age and Doctor Parnassus bets with Mr. Nick that whoever seduces five souls in the Imaginarium will have Valentina as a prize. Meanwhile the troupe rescues Tony Heath Ledger that was hanged on a bridge by the Russians that explains why he had been chased and he joins the group. Tony and Valentina fall in love for each other and the jealous Anton discovers that his competitor is a liar.The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is another original movie with the surrealistic and imaginary world of Terry Gilliam and last work of Heath Ledger that had to be replaced by Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell in the Imaginarium to complete the missing scenes. Further the trio of actors has donated their income with this film to Heath Ledger's daughter to guarantee her financial situation in the future in magnanimous attitudes. The duel between Doctor Parnassus and Mr. Nick together with the vision of the world of fantasy of Terry Gilliam is awesome. For those that liked this movie I would like to recommend the also surrealistic O Homem Que Desafiou o Diabo.

Undoubtedly it could be better but considering complicated circumstances under which were whole creation of the movie this is not just concocted story it's elaborately tailored picture with heart and deep sense.Looks a little bit patchy at first view I suppose it's related with the death of Heath Ledger who didn't end his performance nevertheless Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell imbue the movie with new shapes and different atmosphere. They not worse they just different somebody may deny such substitution but they need to think at first. What choice Gilliam had? These tree actors are probably the best that cinema industry has for this role. Without them this film won't even exist.This film is not for everyone there are lacks of hints to get accurate picture and you'll need to face a lot of puzzles within it. But obviously when you begin to peer into the deepest niceties you start to understand all charming aspects and the main idea. This entire story filled with dozens of perplexing moments due to the abstract reality mood yet it's all looks really stunning and amazing especially perfectly contrived mysterious clouds around Heath Ledger's character Tony. His enigmatic origin has specific magnetism it takes spectator's mind and don't give him any chance to digress from twists and turns of the plot and constantly keeps him on tenterhooks. No doubt this work deserves the highest mark Gilliam made a great job and I believe his efforts and efforts of all who were involved in the creation of this masterpiece won't escape from clever viewers. Pity that it is the last movie of Heath Ledger because in fact it's not a film about his character it is basically about Doctor Parnassus. But still I'm happy that last film of Ledger was so terrific and magnificent. Ledger left us beautifully like such outstanding actors should. Rest in peace Heath we all know that you were the best. And you still the best cos like Johny Depp sad in the movie ''Nothing is permanent not even death''.".

The films of Terry Gilliam defy explanation or description he approaches each film with his untouched creative vision and inventiveness. Every world he creates is wholly unique he is the master of the original and the fantasy. The great Dr. Parnassus made a wager a bet with the devil himself and he won. Granted immortality but at a great cost the life of his first born his daughter on turning age 16 is forfeit to the fiend. Living on the street as a traveling stage show Parnassus grants onlookers a chance to enter into his Imaginarium a world of their own mind. The doctor is cursed cursed to live forever to watch and wait for the day of his daughters 16th birthday a day that is looming. The devil loves a game and makes another gamble with the Doctor Lead 5 souls into the Imaginarium grant them the choice between the sides of darkness and enlightenment. Win 5 souls before the day of his daughter's birth and win her freedom. The match is set but the devil does not play fair he loves the game above all else. There is an interesting conflict between Dr. Parnassus's two worlds the grim dank reality of his life as a meek street performer and the whimsical animated realm of his Imaginarium. Containing some of the most grounded characters of a Gilliam film and yet some of the most fantastic dreamscapes. The traveling stage troop rescues a hanged man a young man left for dead fortune places him in there company an amnesiac played by the late Heath Ledger in his last performance one that he was unable to complete Ledger proves once again the great talent that was lost. He is expressive shrewd and a joy to watch. It is an unavoidable distraction to think of the man behind the character to see the great talent just beginning to come to light we lost an actor of immense talent and charisma. Terry Gilliam for all his creativity and skill may be cursed. His filmography is fraught with difficulty and even disaster. He fought tooth and nail over his edit of Brazil his lead actor in Don Quixote had a herniated disc and a flash flood destroyed a set nearly every one of his films has struggled for financing and his creative control. And now the young burgeoning talent he cast in his latest dies during filmmaking the man is truly cursed. The solution to the passing of his actor and friend was quite ingenious. As Ledgers character enters the Imaginarium his appearance is changed altered to reflect the imagination of the current participant in the realm. Jonny Deep Jude Law and Collin Farrell each admirably take there turns as incarnations of Ledger's character. It works surprisingly well as they all bring a slightly different persona to the character as he is transformed by imagination. Farrell is able to capture the essence of Ledgers performance with the greatest quality but all three are to be commended for finishing the last work of a great man. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is a wild film the animated formless ever changing realm of imagination is vivid and very enjoyable to observe. It is a very interesting fantasy and Terry Gilliam's insane touch is present thought out. It does not reach the level of Gilliam's greatest works it lags a bit struggling to truly catch my attention but I enjoyed the movie it was a fun if confusing ride I can't say I understood it all but I think that maybe the point. It is a journey of wild creativity and unmistakable original. A very entertaining abstract vision with a surprisingly likable ending it's a fun diversion from reality a glimpse into the mad mind of Terry Gilliam.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read quite a few reviews of 'The Imaginarium Of Dr Parnassus' before I finally got around to seeing this amazing film. Most reviewers comment on the basic plot  story line the Terry Gilliam style of visual effects the actors' individual performances etc but what surprised me the most is the sheer spiritual depth of this movie which no one seems to talk about or recognize. I cannot think of any other film that is as multilayered in this regard. It appears the state of mind  soul of the viewer determines the viewing experience. People who are primarily focused on the physical and little on the spiritual world will miss a lot of what this film is about and therefore will not be able to adequately appreciate it. I would actually find it to be quite a challenge to verbally explain certain meaningsmessages as in a way they're perceived on a spiritual level first and kind of need to be 'translated' into words  that's a really rare thing in movies these days and something I highly value. There is a lot of symbolism in this film. For example look up the meaning of 'The Hanged Man' tarot card which appears in the film several times... httpwww.tarotteachings.comhangedmantarotcardmeanings.html . I now understand why it was impossible for Terry Gilliam to remove that hanging scene  it is an integral part of the movie...Even if you can't understand the deeper meanings of this film it's still very entertaining due to the wonderful visual effects and strong acting performances. Heath Ledger managed to demonstrate a completely new acting style his variety of characters in a few brief years is simply astounding Lily Cole was perfectly chosen for her role and as she has said so herself her acting benefited greatly from the mentoring she received from Heath during the filming. She did a wonderful job and I think she's got amazing potential. I can't wait to see how she'll develop as an actress in years to come. I also really enjoyed Christopher Plummer. He managed to play a very difficult role that could have easily destroyed the whole film if his acting skills weren't so impeccable.Incidentally when you watch the film experiment viewing Dr Parnassus as a reflection of one's eternal soul and the other actors as various aspects of life rather than specific characters and the film takes on a whole new meaning... I thought the casting in general is superb and one can't help but walk away from this film feeling enriched. I watched it with my 13year old son who was completely mesmerized from start to finish...I'm so glad and grateful Terry Gilliam completed this profound film because I personally consider it a much more suitable last performance of Heath Ledger than what the Joker would have been. I feel Heath has left us with a deeply meaningful message  a precious gift to be cherished. Make sure you go and see this movie. Try to not intellectualize it but instead keep your mind open and 'let everything come to you.'".

	schema:headline " A messy disappointment from Terry Gilliam";
	schema:reviewBody "After having walked out half way through Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to sit and watch the film from start to finish with lowered or at least more realistic expectations.This is the story of Dr Parnassus who is constantly in game of give and take with the devil. Its a battle for souls that kind of mirrors the battle for God and the Devil. Parnassus travels around putting on shows overing enlightenment to anyone who'll take it but it rarely amounts to very much. As the film opens time is running short Parnassus' daughter is to turn 16 which means that she'll be handed over to the devil however into the mix comes the amnesiac Tony who they find hanging from a rope under a bridge in London. As Tony tries to find his past and the Doctor drinks himself into oblivion the Devil has yet another wager up his sleeve.A brilliant cast including the stand ins for Heath Ledger try to do what they can with a script that kind of rambles all over the place constantly reinventing itself like the never ending wagers that Tom Wait's devil keeps coming up with. I'm certain that this made some sort of sense on the page or at the very least in Gilliam's mind but what has come out on screen is kind of like an uncontrolled brain explosion. Its like Terry Gilliam was thinking about all of these things and when suddenly they just sort of popped out before they could adequately be put together. I'm told that the film is very close to Gilliam and reflects things important to him if that is the case and I suspect it is I think Gilliam should be told not to share next time. I really had no idea what he was getting at.Don't get me wrong it has some great bits. The imagery is as with all Gilliam films stunning. Some of what we see in the Imaginarium is amazing. Most of the bits as bits are wonderful but as a whole they don't work. There are simply too many plot holes and too often Gilliam stacks the deck in what ever way he wants things to play out or adds things that make little sense even in a nonsensical way say the signing police number. If you want an example of Gilliam forcing issues think about the scene at the fair early on. Think about how the family and everyone else ignores them. I mean everyone ignores them to such a large degree that its intentional. Its much too fake.They are behaving like a monstrous movie family not like a real family. Worst of all is the fact Gilliam can't even keep his characters consistent one need only loom at the Parnassus character to see that. He is so all over the place as to never seem to fully formed. He drunk he's not. he fights he gives up. Give him 30 seconds and he'll change.I stopped caring about half way into the film.When I originally discussed this film with friends I said that I felt nothing and that I was bored something I had never felt in a Gilliam film. In someway I think that was true and in some way I think I was wrong. I think the boredom and lack of feeling was a reaction to what I feel is the scattershot nature of the script. How can I feel anything when there is no way to know what is really going on since the film doesn't seem to have a clear idea either. I know when it was done I was of the opinion that you probably could even argue that the whole story was a story.Its a mess.No I did not like it. Honestly between this film and Peter Jackson's Lovely Bones I've had to come up with a new movie list namely major disappointments.".

	schema:reviewBody "An experience. That is the best description I can think of every time I see a movie by Terry Gilliam. He truly is a visionary who's work is like non other. It's as if there are no rules in his line of work. Beautiful imaginative sick...It actually is quite hard to describe his work logically because everything about his work is not based on logic. It is as if his imagination bursts out of his mind beyond the comprehension every time he does a movie yet everyone of them in my opinion is genius. And The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus is a perfect example of what Gilliam is capable of.The story is quite original and imaginative. Of course it definitely is not for everyone since this movie REALLY stands out. But as for me I loved everything about it. Everyone who loves stories about bargains with the devil will surely at least like it because not only does it use this old fashioned element but here it dressed up really well. It ads a sort of a humor to it as the all the characters especially the devil are presented here with a nicely exaggerated charisma. And the story's drama put together with this interesting sense of humor creates an absolutely fantastic and aberrant overall atmosphere which will make you enjoy practically every minute of the picture with tranquil satisfaction. The cast is just amazing beyond praise. So many A list actors Heath Ledger Christopher Plummer Johnny Depp Colin Farrell Jude Law etc.put together in one place make this film even more enjoyable. And the fact that the character Tony was Heath Ledger's final performance really makes you pay a lot of attention to his role which is absolutely FLAWLESS! And the rest of the cast give the most decent performance especially Christopher Plummer whose acting here is impossible to complain about for any movie admirer. The visual effects are incredible. Probably even imaginative enough to match the imagination of Mr. Gilliam. At moments of watching some of the more visually superior scenes I actually thought to myself How high and 'on' what Gilliam was to be capable of creating such pictures? But of course this director isn't 'on' anything but a true master in the craft of filmmaking.Definitely recommended. This movie is a must see for any Terry Gilliam fan any Heath Ledger fan and anyone who likes imaginative and bizarre stories.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gilliam's strength as always is in having the ability to project the craziest depths of his imagination on to the big screen and this film provides the ideal platform for him to showcase his stunning visual conceptions. The 'Imaginarium' itself is a spectacle of fabulous colours wonderfully bizarre landscapes and alluring visions each personal to whoever enters through the magical mirror of Dr. Parnassus' mysterious travelling sideshow.On the face of it this vague idea along with an unparalleled cast sounds like it could be a winning concept for another masterpiece from acclaimed filmmaker Terry Gilliam Twelve Monkeys The Fisher King Brazil Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but I think it lacks the substance to make it a winner. Having said this credit should be duly given to Gilliam as the sudden death of Heath Ledger before filming had finished meant that some of the script had to be rewritten and other actors drafted in to complete Ledger's part Depp Law and Farrell.The plot is hazy and with so much going on throughout it is very difficult to summarise. Dr. Parnassus Plummer is accompanied on his travels by his 15 year old daughter Valentina played very well actually by modelturnedactress Lily Cole. They are joined on the road by two more assistants the somewhat irritating yet harmless character of Anton Andrew Garfield and Parnassus' number two Percy Troyer. Parnassus possesses the extraordinary power to invite people into their own imaginations through the main attraction that is the Imaginarium which appears to be a completely ordinary twosided mirror from the outside. Once inside however people are enticed one way and another and eventually required to choose their fate. Heath Ledger effortlessly plays Tony an ambiguous enigmatic character who brings charisma and charm to the failing sideshow. It is very much a supporting role and he turns up towards the second half of the film. Johnny Depp Colin Farrell and Jude Law each bring an interesting dynamic to the character even though they feature only for short spaces of time within the Imaginarium.I would like to watch this film several times more before making my mind up completely as to whether I like it or not but the main reason that I wouldn't put this amongst Gilliam's best is that it is quite slowmoving in places where Gilliam seems to have gotten so carried away with his imaginationland that some of the other scenes are lacking focus. It is also difficult to feel any empathy or emotion for the characters because even with some excellent performances  particularly Plummer as Parnassus himself  there are no distinct personalities to love or hate. In this sense it is quite possible that this will appeal to cult fans of his niche filmmaking style. In any case it is absolutely essential when watching this film that you abandon the desire for a plot in any conventional sense of the word and accept that in order to appreciate it your imagination must take over".

	schema:reviewBody "Terry Gilliam films are never known for telling a straight story and his productions are no different. Often both are fraught with setbacks doomed failure and last minute redemption. His 1999 production of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote was a spectacular disaster. On the second day of shooting a flood ravaged the set causing 15 million in damages and was compounded days later when his lead actor Jean Rochefort sustained a slipped disc which forced the film to shut down. However a second film crew was documenting the entire proceedings and produced the rather interesting documentary Lost In La Mancha.His latest opus The Imaganarium of Doctor Parnassus was no different. Starring the late Heath Ledger whose sudden death caused production to grind to a halt having only filmed a third of his parts it seemed that once again Gilliam's film would be destined for the cutting room floor.With developments in technology Gilliam initially planned to use computer generated effects to change Ledger's appearance akin to those used in The Curious Case of Banjamin Button and finish the film. However the actors JOhnny Depp Colin Farrell and Jude Law were eventually cast to portray alternative versions of Ledger and production resumed several months later.The film itself concerns the travelling theatre troupe led by Doctor Parnassus who offers unsuspecting members of the public a chance to enter a magical mirror to unbeknown worlds of an almost hallucinatory nature. These worlds are classic Gilliam animations of a similar theme of those first espoused on Monty Python albeit using modern CGI to create an ethereal reality reflecting the subjects mindset. Those who enter the Imaginarium are manipulated by Dr Parnassus to offer them an experience of a lifetime.The twist in Parnassus's ability however is that his powers were granted by the Devil for a ransom and now he is back to collect on the bargain his daughter Valentia. The role of the devil is adeptly played by Tom Waits who plays his character as a reluctant antihero seemingly willing Parnussus on whilst simultaneously mocking his ability to beat him at his own game. Indeed the Devil can also change the landscape of the vision by those who enter the mirror giving him a somewhat unfair advantage.It's true of Gilliam films that the plot is often muddled by the visuals employed to truncate or assist the narrative and certainly there are moments in The Imaginarium where it detracts from the storyline by an overambitious and needless set piece. Nevertheless the visual effects are stunning at times and add to the grandeur of the moment.It is also interesting to see how Gilliam has used the mirrors own powers to change Ledgers character as he enters successive times and how this allows other actors to take his place. It would certainly have been interesting to observe the original idea as subverting the plot to allow Farrell Law and Depp would have seriously altered the concept of intent as initially conceived.Ledger's own performance is satisfactory and it's a shame we do not get to see the change in his own character throughout the entirety of the film but which is adequately filled by the performance of his fellow stars.Despite these setbacks and reworkings the film succeeds in pulling the viewer into the story despite how ridiculous it becomes at times. As the race reaches its climax for Parnassus to save what is dearest to him the fragmented storyline pulls more or less neatly together and it is easily Gilliams best film in a decade although not without it's aforementioned detractions.This will certainly please fans of his previous work and must have given the studios enough confidence to start production on the illfated Don Quixote project which is his next film. Let's hope this is a resurgence in Gilliams ability to match creativity with an ability to deliver a fully formed concept.".

Pleasantly Opapatika fulfills both those requirements although not as thoroughly I would have liked. It feels like the story is never really explained well and you definitely have to be on the ball when watching to follow it. One also has to be willing to forgive what I can only guess are translation errors in the subbing although they weren't bad enough to really mar the movie experience for me.Opapatika does however is provide a unique story experience. I can honestly say that there aren't many movies that I have seen that take such an innovative approach to the use of extraordinarysupernatural powers. The fight scenes are quite enjoyable with each opapatika showing off his special ability. There are plenty of ouch moments along with one or two jaw dropping ones. I would caution that this movie is very violent with lots gore and death but more in a Kill Bill sort of way not something realistically graphic like a Saving Private Ryan.I don't normally think or say this but it would be nice to see this remade or redone in the States like what was done with the movie The Ring or Ringu in Japanese. The plot is truly original and deserves to be completely fleshed out.Overall Opapatika is an enjoyable movie with plenty of twists to keep it from being predictable and the main theme tells us that nothing comes without a price and that sometimes when you get what you've been hoping for it isn't always what you wanted just like this movie.".

	schema:headline " A supernatural blast of action and fighting...";
	schema:reviewBody "Demon Warrior or Opapatika was an interesting movie in different ways. Especially because of the supernatural aspect to it combined with the level of action and martial arts there were in it.Storywise then Demon Warrior sort of halters. And by that I don't mean that it is a bad storyline far from it but that the movie is not driven by the story but driven by the action and fighting primarily. Plus I found the whole 'suicide is a mortal sin' lecture a bit pretentious and lecturing bordering on being religious propaganda.But moving on. The story is about Taesit who commits suicide and is thus turned into an opapatika. He is recruited by another opapatika to track down other opapatikas but this is not an easy task. Opapatikas hold superhuman abilities and senses living out their cursed existences amongst mortals on our world.I will say that the opapatika abilities were interesting and the movie did entertain although it had a fairly weak storyline. The action and fighting in Demon Warrior was off the charts  as it usually is with Thai action movies. And it was from the producers of Ong Bak so thumbs up for the action here. One thing did annoy me in the movie was the constant sound of a growling big cat lion tiger or whatever there was around some of the opapatikas. It was more of a nuisances than it was a flavor that helped the movie along in any way.The effects in Demon Warrior were quite good as well. And what the movie lacks in a solid story line it more than makes up for in brutal action blood and violence.Demon Warrior combines elements from the action genre and dark fantasy genre quite well. Sort of think the Supernatural series just added with a heap of action and more interesting supernatural beings. If you enjoy Thai movies then Demon Warrior is definitely worth watching.".

Especially because of the supernatural aspect to it combined with the level of action and martial arts there were in it.Storywise then Demon Warrior sort of halters. And by that I don't mean that it is a bad storyline far from it but that the movie is not driven by the story but driven by the action and fighting primarily. Plus I found the whole 'suicide is a mortal sin' lecture a bit pretentious and lecturing bordering on being religious propaganda.But moving on. The story is about Taesit who commits suicide and is thus turned into an opapatika. He is recruited by another opapatika to track down other opapatikas but this is not an easy task. Opapatikas hold superhuman abilities and senses living out their cursed existences amongst mortals on our world.I will say that the opapatika abilities were interesting and the movie did entertain although it had a fairly weak storyline. The action and fighting in Demon Warrior was off the charts  as it usually is with Thai action movies. And it was from the producers of Ong Bak so thumbs up for the action here. One thing did annoy me in the movie was the constant sound of a growling big cat lion tiger or whatever there was around some of the opapatikas. It was more of a nuisances than it was a flavor that helped the movie along in any way.The effects in Demon Warrior were quite good as well. And what the movie lacks in a solid story line it more than makes up for in brutal action blood and violence.Demon Warrior combines elements from the action genre and dark fantasy genre quite well. Sort of think the Supernatural series just added with a heap of action and more interesting supernatural beings. If you enjoy Thai movies then Demon Warrior is definitely worth watching.";

Then finally at the end it starts to make sense but you are still left unsatisfied. The only thing to keep you interested would be all the fight scenes. But there was more gun shooting than anything. I wanted to see more fighting with fists and kicks but there was not much. The story behind it all is that you kill yourself and it is a sin. So you are in a world between reality and Heaven or Hell. In this world you are granted a special power but in return for your sin you have a pain also. For example one guy has the ability to see all kill points and kill them really fast. In return he gets a scar on his body where he killed the guy. If you notice most are by his heart. I admit that each character was kind of cool to see. There powers were interesting but there was really not that much back story at all to the characters leaving it hard to enjoy them to the fullest. Basically what this movie was missing was full out a storyline. It had the ability to create one but like I said it leaves you confused on how they try to do it. This really could of been one great action film if done right.".

The plot if you can describe it thus seems to be about a young man who's advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor only to return as an asskicking 'demon warrior' with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the 'demon warriors' that are out there.There's some Thai religious mumbojumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot but you'll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various warriors and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he's killed  a neat idea that sadly isn't explore to the fullest extent as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways this is like a grownup version of XMEN with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.There's action aplenty and lots of CGI blood but the choreography is pretty poor it has to be said. Even worse is the script which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals so that the demon warriors themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least and director Thanakorn Pongsuwan needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time instead of this silly noisy nonsense.".

Some movies are made to sit through wincing  leaving you sore emotionally and some are light silly goofball creations that wont change the world but sure are nice to just zone out with. This movie will never turn Roger Ebert's crank...its silly and goofy and irrelevant....Its also over time revealing itself to have been at the time...subversive. This movie has a lot of little things about it that are becoming more relevant as the years wear on... When this first came out I thought An alright movie with catchy songs This was before I myself got involved in the Music industry. After living through three bands and two contracts over ten years I would like to say this movie isn't as unrealistic as you may think. It is still a spoof but close enough to reality to warrant another look. Originally waved away as being pure fluff I now find this movie creepily prophetic. Since this movie was made we have witnessed the fall out of bands like Back street boys the breakdown of popstars like Brittany Spears and a slew of young actors  actresses separated from family  friends whose entire personalities have been written and designed by stylists and are seen battling like some weird Fashionista roman gladiators under the tutelage of sycophants and managers.Mediapop culture with its out of control emphasis on looks and weight over talent and personality have resulted in actual government legislation regarding model weights and rampant anorexia amongst young starlets. Musically there has been a huge increase in management interference listen to Pink's first album regarding the pressures placed on a young singer to conform to a label's Vision dictating how the artists shall look and act. If it hadn't been for the internet download revolution of Lime wire and such I think the Music industry would have happily continued to control what consumers were ALLOWED to buy and ALLOWED to see...This movie was also made prior to the outing of gay boy band members Stephen Gately Lance Bassit Jordan Knight but the top selling song for the Boy Band Du Jour in this movie is the most homosuggestive song I've ever heard. Is it really called In Through Your Back Door?After all this fallout the world of Josie  the Pussycats seems much less stupid to me.Again...Not deep but possibly prophetic...and fun to watch Just don't expect to feel moved. Its popcorn at its best  light and salty not really a meal...its a snack and as that type of movie...shouldn't't be judged solely for its nutritional value... I'd rate it a 7".

Humorous at certain points and worth watching if your a teenage girl or especially if you like all the conspiracy theory stuff Is meaningful in that it puts emphasis on importance of certain things in our lives leaves you wanting to download the track and has a light hearted attempt at portraying messages to young people without the boring political side.Josie and the Pussycats is lively and funny at points. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movie's like Mean girls Legally Blonde etc as it is humorous and meaningful without being overly politically correct.".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable satire although it is rather undone by the silly mood that pervades it";
	schema:reviewBody "When Du Jour a top boy band go missing after an unfortunate plane accident manager Wyatt Frame decides that the time is ripe for him to go and find the next big thing to sell to the teen market. He discovers a failing girl rock group in a small town and offers them a deal without hearing them. Within hours they have been styled and dressed by the label and are ready to cut their first record. Within a week they are number one have screaming fans following them everywhere and have a strange desire to buy products that they had no previous interest in. However Josie starts to notice something strange about all of this and is soon asking more questions than the label would like her to.I hope my description above gives you an idea of the silly sense of humour that runs throughout this film because although it could have been a sharp satire it isn't quite as insightful as it could have been. Mostly this is down to the material  the targets are so easy hell pop music is practically a parody of itself in some regards it is never sharp although it is pretty ontarget for the most part. It doesn't help that the tone of the whole thing is that of a silly teen comedy rather than a satire and perhaps it was the strange mix of things that confused me a little bit and put me off it. Despite this though I still quite enjoyed it it was amiable enough was quite selfaware and was pretty funny at points. I can understand why many were put off it and it doesn't break any new ground but it is still pretty enjoyable and it was nice to see a teen movie actually try to do more than just pander to its audience well not much anyway.The actors involved give some clue that the material is up to something despite the weaknesses  Parker Posey doesn't just turn out for every teen comedy that is around you know! The three leads are all pretty good  delivering the silly mood but also being in on the joke and into it. Cook is probably the least fun of the three but she does well to carry the narrative. Reid is fun in a simple ditsy role that made me smile and Dawson is as gorgeous as ever while still delivering an enjoyable character. Cumming is a bit annoying and he adds to the silly mood with his overly daft performance. Posey is fun and somehow manages to be daft but still effective in the role. The support are mostly in on the joke and the star cameos send themselves up well  Carson Daley and Levy particularly. Biggest surprise was that I liked Missy Pyle  normally she is terrible but here she works.Overall this is a strange mix of pop satire and teen movie. This produces a rather silly tone which may put some off not helped by the fact that the easy targets do rather take the edge off the material somewhat but for my money it was refreshing to see this try to do what it did. I enjoyed the humour and the fact that the cast were all into it and although it is not a great movie I would certainly watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I got a chance to see a sneak preview of Josie  the Pussycats this past week. I really didn't have many expectations for this film...all I was looking for was a fun movie that wouldn't make me cringe too much. Well without hesitation I can say this movie totally blew me away. It was by far one of the funniest movies I've seen in a LONG time. Sure it was campy but it garnered genuine and consistent laughs from the audience. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie with such energy and wellbalanced pacing.All three actresses were fantastic as the Pussycats staying very true to their comic booktv characters. Rachel Leigh Cook was an excellent choice for Josie...she adds a poignancy to the role that was completely unexpected. As you can imagine there is the usual romantic subplot but Cook gives it an honesty and sweetness that saved it from becoming a cliche. Rosario Dawson also did a wonderful job of humanizing Val portraying her as a strong yet insecure woman. Tara Reid had the hardest part of all. How do you portray a ditzy character so that it doesn't degenerate into a onenote gag? Answer Make the character endearing. Reid did a wonderful job at making Melody's sappy optimism and absentmindedness absolutely adorable. In less capable hands some of the gags would have fallen flat...but they got me smiling and even laughing.The soundtrack utterly rocks...the last teen movie I can think of with a soundtrack that was so well matched to the visuals was Clueless. Songs that could have been just filler really added to the overall energy and appeal of the film. The music style was more hard rock than the original TV series but they managed to get the theme song in there somewhere so I was happy.  At the screening I went to people actually danced in the aisles during the end credits...not something I see every day. The script is phenomenal filled with many injokes and great timely references. What's most amazing is that Josie  the Pussycats is a movie with something to say yet it got its message across in a witty and entertaining way while avoiding being too preachy.I can honestly say Josie  The Pussycats is one of the best TVtoFilm adaptations I've ever seenvery enjoyable for fans of the old series but remaining accessible for those who weren't.".

Josie and the Pussycats is a product of Archie Comics.The back story is the need for record producer Parker Posey to find a new group any group simply as a carrier for their marketing messages. The group doesn't need to be very good and this one isn't. Rachael leigh Cook is excellent as Josie the lead singer and Tara Reid is funny as the ditzy drummer of the group. As an aside they all were taught to play their instruments during performances so they look natural even though professional playing and singing were over dubbed.Well eventually the smart Josie figures out the scheme and foils it. They give a real unencumbered concert performance she gets the boy she wanted all the time. The whole film spoofs product placement and the recording industry that takes unknowns and through hype molds them into hit groups for the profit of the handlers.

Jack Black and Kyle Gass are the genius behind Tenacious D a rocking acoustic duo blessed by none other than Satan to spread their awsomeness about the globe. On the first disc you'll find every episode of their unfortunately short lived HBO series as well as a complete concert recorded live at Brixton Academy in London England. Highlights from their TV show include the episodes Search for Inspirado in which the band has 5 days to write a new song because the club where they play is tired of the same song every week and The Fan in which the D find themselves turning the table on a wouldbe stalker.Disc two contains gems labeled For Psycho Fans Only. On this disc you'll find three music videos and two movies about the making of two of those videos. Also it contains an on the road documentary D appearances on TV shows and three extra short films that were made for HBO.The Works has everything you could ever hope for chronicling this groups greatest creative efforts. The content some will find offensive and there are many rock induced Satanic elements which humorously add to the depth of these characters if indeed JB and KG aren't just being themselves. Their songs are addictive easy to pick up and sing along with even if their subject matter isn't something you'd want the kids to be exposed to. If you enjoy irreverent satirical humor along the lines of Monty Python or The Simpsons then I suggest whole heartedly Tenacious D The Complete Masterworks.".

But what denotes serious? If financial success is the measure of sobriety then Tenacious D is every bit as serious as those real rockstars. Which makes Tenacious D as unlikely as it may be real rockstars.

But Tenacious D's angle of attack has widened their scope. Unlike serious musicians who boast powerful talent yet are stultified by the demographic that they are marketed to The D can shamelessly perform feats which would cause serious rock stars unwarranted PR problems or lose them their followings criticize other musicians without press repercussion display their outofshape bodies without loss of libido wear idiotic stage attire whilst fearing no fashion police claim to devilworship without evangelical dissent egotistically aggrandize their own product without humility all due to the initial establishment that this project is unequivocally tongueincheek!But how far can tongueincheek stretch?

That being said HBO must be kicking themselves that they didn't contract Tenacious D for more than 3 halfhour episodes  Who knew that those benign television morsels all of which are included in the Master Works DVD would attain such cult legend?And now Tenacious D having brushed so close to actually being considered The Greatest Band On Earth through acclaim by a multitude of fans have necessarily modified their focus. This is not a bad thing as every artist must sway to their public's demand but their clat has shifted from vainly trying to make people notice them to raving in the spotlight. The overwrought Spike Jonesdirected Wonderboy music video is a prime example of their largesse threatening to outrun their selfpossession. Though they parody Ronnie James Dio in an eponymous ode this video is more Dio than Dio ever was  the production value could never be matched by Dio's budgets in his heyday  which begs the question on whether the satirists have become the satire yet.IS it still tongueincheek? Yes. For holding at bay the curse of selfconsciousness and selfawareness is a schoolkid honesty and sophomoric sensibility illustrated best in the three additional mentallytwisted shorts on the DVD  showing us that talented though they may be The D are still two sick puppies with abject disregard for social protocol a nearmiracle in this frightened and quivering politicallygutless modern age. It might be guilty laughter watching Rock Star Sperm For Sale but it is unbidden guilty laughter. We wish we could ALL be this honest and juvenile and callous.The DVD also sports the fulllength concert at the Brixton Academy in London a daring stark presentation featuring only the duo themselves harking back to their roots when there was no band intrusion into their chemistry. It is testament to The D's charisma and talent Black's freneticism perfectly complemented by the understated Gass that they can hold an internetbred audience with such rigorWe bear witness to one of the truly great comedy teams of our time.

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie to be really alienating. You can sympathize with the main character on some elements here and there being bored in a relationship jealousy etc but she goes about fulfilling her desires in such a selfish manner you really can't forgive her. Ani blames her misfortune entirely on her husband who seems to try the best to do what he can in his situation. Unfortunately for him she doesn't know how to appreciate the little things in life and only yearns after luxury and youth. That's all fine and all  there have been plenty of movies with unsavory leads but Zuo Tou goes about it in such a mindnumbingly slow manner. Every. Single. Bloody. Detail. Attention to detail is appreciated but there in fact can be too much of it. So much in fact it sometimes seemed that Rosamund Kwan and Wallace Huo were severely overacting.

The message of the movie is convoluted to me get out of an unhappy marriage to pursue your own happiness even if it means abandoning a child and not bothering to try to make it work? you don't need men to be happy? young men should sell themselves to older women for money? doing your hair really isn't that important? What indeed. 410.".

	onyx:emotionText "I found this movie to be really alienating. You can sympathize with the main character on some elements here and there being bored in a relationship jealousy etc but she goes about fulfilling her desires in such a selfish manner you really can't forgive her. Ani blames her misfortune entirely on her husband who seems to try the best to do what he can in his situation. Unfortunately for him she doesn't know how to appreciate the little things in life and only yearns after luxury and youth. That's all fine and all  there have been plenty of movies with unsavory leads but Zuo Tou goes about it in such a mindnumbingly slow manner. Every. Single. Bloody. Detail. Attention to detail is appreciated but there in fact can be too much of it. So much in fact it sometimes seemed that Rosamund Kwan and Wallace Huo were severely overacting.

So of course she flirts with her hairstylist and when she's sure that she wants to run away with him she dumps her husband and her daughter.

Really you can feel no sympathy for the lead character. She is cruel and morally reprehensible. And just when you think there is a moral to the story she lives happily ever after.

The artistic design and cinematography is good but the story was OK but not impressive enough to make it great. However I think Wallace got a lot of potential and I look forward to his future works!!

It's a lovely funny poignant film about the relationship between fatherAiello and youngest offspring LaPaglia. As a seasoned film actor Aiello puts in a solid performance. More interestingly LaPaglia who must have been approx 34 and hadn't yet made those many films up to this point is staggeringly good at portraying Frank Pesce from age 16 to mid twenties. This is definitely one of his classier performances. I particularly liked the running joke about the father's pizzas. Also of interest is that the real life Frank Pesce plays his own older brother!!

I happened to stop on the end of a showing of A CHRISTMAS CAROL and by chance I decided to see the next movie that was showing29th STREET.  This is a great movie 10 out of 10.  I have to say that first of all.  I'm assuming this isn't the most well known of movies because it's not something I've ever heard of.  I recommend it though.  Despite some rough language which was edited out of the tv viewing I got to see it is a great family film.  Did you like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING?  This film manages to capture that same ethnic family feeling though in this film it is Italian not Greek.  The family with Danny Aiello as the father is charming in all it's quirkiness.  I laughed a lot at the subtle humor that came out of the daily lives of the Pesce family.The acting in the film is terrific.  The characters are well developed in the writing and the actors used this to the fullest in bringing them to life.  I was amazed to see that Frank Pesce actually plays in the movie in a fairly large role as the brother Vito.  He does a good job.  Anthony LaPaglia is excellent too.  You'd think he'd really grown up in NYC with that accent of his.If you happen to catch this on tv or see it at a movie rental place don't pass it up.  The story is simplethe world's luckiest man as he grows up. The ending runs high with emotion as you come to see the results of the decisions that this lucky man and his family makes.  In the end though it's a great holiday film showing the true love that families have.  It's great to see men fathers with lots of love and emotion for their families!Check this out D".

I have to say that first of all.  I'm assuming this isn't the most well known of movies because it's not something I've ever heard of.  I recommend it though.  Despite some rough language which was edited out of the tv viewing I got to see it is a great family film.  Did you like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING?  This film manages to capture that same ethnic family feeling though in this film it is Italian not Greek.  The family with Danny Aiello as the father is charming in all it's quirkiness.  I laughed a lot at the subtle humor that came out of the daily lives of the Pesce family.The acting in the film is terrific.  The characters are well developed in the writing and the actors used this to the fullest in bringing them to life.  I was amazed to see that Frank Pesce actually plays in the movie in a fairly large role as the brother Vito.  He does a good job.  Anthony LaPaglia is excellent too.  You'd think he'd really grown up in NYC with that accent of his.If you happen to catch this on tv or see it at a movie rental place don't pass it up.  The story is simplethe world's luckiest man as he grows up. The ending runs high with emotion as you come to see the results of the decisions that this lucky man and his family makes.  In the end though it's a great holiday film showing the true love that families have.  It's great to see men fathers with lots of love and emotion for their families!Check this out D";

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Pesce did not win 6.2 million in the 1976 Empire Stakes lottery in New York. He didn't win a penny because there wasn't such a lottery or drawing on that date. New York launched its Empire Stakes game in January 1977. But scenes in 29th Street clearly show a drawing for such a lottery on Christmas Eve of 1976. So much for this film being based on a true story as the IMDb storyline reads and as the movie implies and so many reviewers seem to believe. People in general and movie buffs especially should be wary of a claim that a film is based on a true story. That can mean anything. Based on might mean no more than keeping the title of a novel. Or it might mean a thorough and accurate rendering of a book. Most often it means something in between. Perhaps a story that has been altered in time with events with fictitious characters or accounts andor absent some events and people. In 29th Street. the only resemblance to reality may be some of the interplay in the Pesce family. But even that must be suspect. Newspaper articles in 1991 L.A. Times and N.Y. Times discussed this film and its origin with skepticism. After all Pesce who is a character actor has given no personal details about himself or his family. The IMDb Web site doesn't even have his place and date of birth. So the accuracy of the film buildup aside how does this movie stand on its own? While the plot and premise of this story are strange and hard to believe the script is good and the acting is very good. This is a story about a family that is dysfunctional yet strongly bound in love. That is its endearing aspect. No matter what the situations and no matter what the mistakes of one or more members in the end they are bound by love. This is shown most often in the relationship between Frank Pesce senior and Frank junior played by Danny Aiello and Anthony LaPaglia respectively. Their frequent arguments are laced with humor at times. Lainie Kazan is excellent as Mrs. Pesce and Frank Pesce the real Frank Pesce? plays the older brother Vito Pesce. The movie has considerable profanity and dodges all around questionable legal activities. It has something of a fairytale atmosphere about it. The idea for the story and film was concocted by Frank Pesce and his friend actor James Franciscus. It was supposed to resemble Pesce's family when he grew up in a tough New York neighborhood of Italian and other ethnic families. Newspaper articles of the time liken parts of it to other films and sitcoms of the past. For a comparison of films based on real incidents watch It Could Happen to You of 1994. That movie is about a New York cop who splits his winnings from a lottery ticket with a waitress. When he didn't have enough money to leave a tip he gave her a choice of half his lottery ticket if he should win or double the tip when he comes back the next day. The film promotion says it was inspired by a real event or true story. And it had a good basis. The reallife incident was in 1984 when New York policeman Robert Cunningham asked a waitress friend Phyllis Penzo to split a lottery ticket with him in lieu of his leaving her a tip. Each picked three numbers and when Cunningham learned that his ticket had won 6 million he honored his deal and split the money evenly with Penzo. Many reviewers enjoyed 29th Street for its family depictions and nostalgic connections to growing up in similar neighborhoods. I can appreciate that. Some wondered why this movie hasn't had more play or isn't better known. Could it be because it was almost all fiction but seemed to imply and continues to be tagged as though it is based on real events?".

That movie is about a New York cop who splits his winnings from a lottery ticket with a waitress. When he didn't have enough money to leave a tip he gave her a choice of half his lottery ticket if he should win or double the tip when he comes back the next day. The film promotion says it was inspired by a real event or true story. And it had a good basis. The reallife incident was in 1984 when New York policeman Robert Cunningham asked a waitress friend Phyllis Penzo to split a lottery ticket with him in lieu of his leaving her a tip. Each picked three numbers and when Cunningham learned that his ticket had won 6 million he honored his deal and split the money evenly with Penzo. Many reviewers enjoyed 29th Street for its family depictions and nostalgic connections to growing up in similar neighborhoods. I can appreciate that. Some wondered why this movie hasn't had more play or isn't better known. Could it be because it was almost all fiction but seemed to imply and continues to be tagged as though it is based on real events?";

The real winner Frank Pesce actually played a part in the movie as one of his brothers was an associate producer cowrote the story and it was based on his book. So he had a lot to do with this story being brought to the big screen. In a way this kind of underminds the whole thing. The story is basically about how the lottery winner has a led a lucky life from day one but he thinks that his luck has been turned around by a decision he made two hours before he won the money. It's told from his point of view as he is explaining to the cops that picked him up for vandelizing a church after the announcement was made that he won. His story has moments of comedy heartwarming family moments and of heartbreak as we journey thru some of his life up to this point. What doesn't work is the last hour where we're taken thru how the story becomes a positive one for him when he thinks it's negative. I realize this is a true story but it was difficult for me to buy into the conclusion. I consider this a negative on the filmmaker's part. I'm not doubting the story I just don't think it was presented very well. If I get into any more details it would ruin it for those who want to watch the movie so I won't. Anyway what could have been a heartwarming human story just missed for me. OK entertainment but that's all in my eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm glad this turned out to have a dramatic turn of events right in the middle cause if it wasn't for that it would be a pathetic and shallow little movie about almost nothing.29th Street tells the story of a lucky guy in New York who doesn't seem to realize all the luck he has confusing it to some extent as a misfortune. He could be called as the luckiest man alive yet quite unlucky. The movie begins with him being the first person to ever win the New York State lottery. And what does he do? Scream to God in anger. Later his life story is retold showing his instants of pure and amazing lucky strikes such as being discharged from serving in the Vietnam war or surviving an fatal attack where he could almost get killed. And he doesn't win the lottery once but twice.Who is this guy? He's Frank Pesce played by Anthony LaPaglia quite an character who now is an actor he plays his older brother in this film. We follow not only him but also his big and lovable family having as parents two great folks played by Lainie Kazan and Danny Aiello who always try to make ends meet despite everything including Frank's lunacies and lack of involvement on things.So first half of the movie is so incredibly dumb and unfunny that one can easily depart from watching it. It's full of comic situations that doesn't cause much impact on the viewer. It gets better when the stolen car problem is introduced to us. And if lifts up for good when Frank has to solve his father's financial problems surrounded with debts after asking money from the mob. Frank will have to decide if he'll get the millions of dollar of the ticket or deliver it to the mobsters who want to buy it for a good price smaller than the prize though since they know about Frank's luck. That's when the movies shows what's it all about creating some tension and building an satisfying story involvement for us that saves this project of being a little silly.LaPaglia's performance comes of as strong and vigorous sometimes truly funny when almost everyone around plays pathetic types and he can be quite moving as well the fight scene with the father is his high point. But it's Danny Aiello and his class act that are the true reason 29th Street doesn't suck. He's an convincing father very real a good person who does his best to unite his family sacrificing everything for whom he cares. The final message is the one that really grabs us despite a little sentimental. It's a film about understanding what luck or fortunate moments means. But not the most perceivable of lucks or getting millions of dollars but discovering that you have not only the most difficult of lucks but the one that truly matters. Find it what it is in this picture. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "As everyone remembers in the classic Errol Flynn version of Captain Blood he whipped his fellow pirate Basil Rathbone in a dual on the dunes he took Lionel Atwill's place as royal governor of Jamaica after the House of Orange threw out the House of Stuart in The Glorious Revolution and married Atwill's niece Olivia DeHavilland to live happily ever after. I think it was understood there'd be no more pirating under William and Mary.Yet here we have Captain Blood this time played by Louis Hayward back at his old trade again. I guess politics must have bored him but what happened to Olivia because Hayward's got a couple of girls panting after him in this story.The women are the Spanish viceroy's niece Patricia Medina and an innkeeper's niece Dona Drake. It seems as though several of Blood's crew were betrayed on a shopping trip for supplies and sold into slavery. Doing the selling was George MacReady who's been charged by the King of Spain to bring in Captain Blood dead or alive. He's also got a lustful gleam in his eye for Patrica Medina and who could blame the old reprobate.Hayward's mission is to free his captive crew members and he has to involve himself with a whole lot of intrigue political and romantic. In a way he really acts like a heel towards Drake and it does kind of lessen audience sympathy for him.Harry Cohn at Columbia did not want to spend as much money as Jack Warner did on his version and it shows. Hayward is capable enough as Peter Blood but I kind of like MacReady in this film he really does dominate it whenever he's on screen. Alfonso Bedoya is also good as the slave overseer.When all's said and done Fortunes of Captain Blood just doesn't measure up to what made Errol Flynn a star.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Columbia Pictures' release The Fortunes of Captain Blood 1950 neither boasts the epic scale nor the lavish quality that Warner Brothers' poured into its classic 1935 Errol Flynn original with Erich Wolfgang Korngold's exhilarating orchestral score. Essentially this thoroughly routine black and white swashbuckler confines itself largely to intrigue on land rather than adventure on the high seas. The budgetary constraints no doubt forced veteran director Gordon Douglas to stage only two less than spectacular sea battles that take place at the outset and during the finale. These lackluster clashes occur with the opposing ships miles apart rather than hull to hull. You won't see any pirates with cutlasses clenched in their scrofulous teeth as they swing from the rigging of their ship to board the enemy vessel.The pompous Hispanic monarch King Charles II Kurt Bois of The Desert Songwarns the Marquis de Riconete George Macready of Knock On Any Doorthat unless he captures lawless Irish buccaneer Captain Blood Louis Hayward of Captain Pirate the king will strip him of all his wealth and position. Charles II also places a bounty of 50thousand pieces of eight on Blood's head. Blood has has been devastating Spanish galleons in the West Indies. Blood and his ship the Avenger lie off the island of La Hacha the most important Spanish possession in the West Indies. They are awaiting a signal from the mainland to pick up supplies and ammunition from a trusted merchant. Unfortunately it's a trap and the Marquis bags a boatload of Blood's men. Although we never see them once they wind up behind bars we learn from the expository dialogue in the loquacious screenplay by Frank Burt of Barbary Pirate Michael Hogan of Tall in the Saddle and Robert Libott of Captain Pirate that these poor souls are forced to dive for pearls in sharkinfested waters with slim chances of survival. Captain Blood refuses to tolerate this unhappy situation. He remembers his own days as a prisoner and he ventures ashore against the advice of his secondincommand to free his men. Masquerading as a harmless fruit peddler Senor Morales so that he can have open access to the town he sets out to rescue his enslaved sailors. Along the way he encounters a hotblooded little tomato Pepita Maria Rosados Dona Drake of Road to Moroccowho takes a shine to him. Pepita's boyfriend is the Prison Overseer Carmilio Alfonso Bedoya of Treasure of the Sierra Madre who uttered the famous line of dialogue from the Humphrey Bogart classic We don't need no stinkin' badges!.The Fortunes of Captain Blood contains few surprises or revelations during its trim 90 running time. A cleanshaven Louis Hayward makes an adequate Captain Blood but he sorely lacks the charisma of an Errol Flynn. Consequently Hayward seems somewhat wooden in the role. In his defense Hayward doesn't perform any feats of valor like Flynn did because the scenarists give him nothing in the way of grandstanding heroics. On the other hand George Macready doesn't make your blood boil as the villainous Marquis. As the Marquis' relative Isabelita Sotomayor beautiful Patricia Medina of Mr. Arkadin spends more time offscreen than onscreen. Eventually Captain Blood gets around to wooing Isabelita but he devotes more time to spunky Pepita so he can befriend Carmilio and orchestrate the release of his men. However since there is no suspense Blood has few close calls with his adversaries and rarely appears in jeopardy. The miniature ships look fine but the back projection aboard the ships when the heroes and villains weight anchor is obvious. The sword fighting choreography is strictly secondrate with the combatants never moving far from where the fight started. The last scene before the final ship battle when Blood and his men switch ships and capture a Spanish warship anticipates the future cinematic antics of Captain Jack Sparrow against the British.".

Alfonso Bedoya who played Carmilio the Prison Overseer. To my surprise Bedoya was accomplished indeed. In The Treasure of the Sierra Madre 1948 Bedoya delivered the famous line about not needing any stinking badges. He made a number of popular films in the U.S. but a drinking problem destroyed his health. He died at the age of 53. I don't need to go on about the film as no one will probably ever read this. Apparently this film is not popular at all. However! I now have a new respect for the actor i wanted to dislike. Thanks IMDb.".

Part of the problem may be attributed to the fact that this film was in black and white.Patricia Medina's role as a selfish niece who changes course real fast after falling for Peter Blood comes on too quickly. In many of the scenes Miss Medina an excellent actress looks like she is in pain or in deep depression. I would probably join her if I had been in this production as well.As always George MacReady plays a sinister character quite well.The slaves in this film don't exactly look like they have suffered under slavery for too long.".

All in all a reasonably good standardissue pirate movie sorry I can't be more definite than that.

For better or worse the fact that both are now available in virtually pristine if nonanamorphic editions is due to the massive boxoffice takings of the recent overblown Pirates Of The Caribbean saga!Anyway I had already watched Hayward's previous buccaneer venture  namely Edgar G. Ulmer's THE PIRATES OF CAPRI 1949  and frankly was wary of his making a convincing Peter Blood truth be told even Flynn's starmaking turn had been somewhat overrated! given that he usually tends to play fops harbouring a revenge agenda the narrative contrives to put the actor in his element by having the former doctor don a South American disguise for a sizeable part of the duration! Plotwise it is  admittedly  no great shakes a handful of Blood's gang are ambushed when they go ashore and put in chains so he determines to free them. In the course of the 90minute duration he is helped and hindered often both by a number of other characters a bartender a saloongirl a prison warden enamoured of the latter Alfonso Bedoya a shifty nobleman his girlfriend leading lady Patricia Medina  clumsily named Isabelita! and the obligatory chief villain played by the ubiquitous George Macready. Blood's brawny crew then typically encompasses all sorts  from Scots to Swedesand perhaps mercifully I only counted two negligible instances of comic relief on their part throughout!While it may appear halfhearted in blackandwhite especially in comparison with the glowing Technicolor afforded the sequel director Douglas was practiced enough at this sort of thing for the record he had already guided both Hayward and Macready through the monochromatic paces of the R.L. Stevenson adaptation THE BLACK ARROW 1948 and involving Macready yet again would follow this with the colourful ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST 1950 to render the essence of the material via the modest means at his disposal. With this in mind amid the sheer amount of fun to be had it was possible to include such striking images as a hanging body casting a sinister shadow over a wall a guard being set ablaze during the mass prison escape and in the exciting seafaring climax a bloodied Macready at the helm of the hero's own vessel Avenger! interestingly enough Hayward will be forced to blow up his ship again in the sequel! By the way I had been led to believe this involved the English King Charles II but the royal by that name here appearing in the guise of Curt Bois at the start of the film actually presides over the French court!".

He keeps a gang of slaves busy diving for pearls which the island is famous for. Coming upon this island Blood sends a party ashore to get provisions. But they are surprised by a gang lead by the slave trader George FairfaxLowell Gilmore and sold to the Marquis. But the Marquis also wants to capture Blood to win the 50000 pieces of eight offered by King Charles II of SpainCurt Bois.......Blood devises a plan of disguise as a fruit peddler in the main town across the island to hopefully find his way into the dungeon where his men are kept. He makes the acquaintance of the Marquis's ethereal niece IsabolitaPatricia Medina who is plotting with George Fairfax to leave the island for Spain as she fins the island too boring. Blood also meets the cute very flirtaceous tavern wench PepitaDiana Drake. Fortunately he encounters her various times during the film. For me she is the best thing about this film! She also is the girlfriend of Carmilla overseer of the slaves. In this capacity she is useful to Blood toward freeing his men which happens in an unlikely swordfight with the dungeon guards......Blood eventually returns to his ship with his freed crew. But his ship is soon fired upon by the Marquis's bigger warship and rendered helpless.

Blood then finishes off his ship with some cannot fire the Marquis escaping injury. The Marquis is allowed to come aboard his ship with a few men. He agrees to release the other slaves in exchange for his life. Later the wench Pepita and the lady Isabelita come aboard separately to kiss Blood goodbye as he is about to sail for other parts of the Caribbean with his new superior ship.......Note that  historically La Hacha wasn't an island but rather a port city on the Columbian coast.

Under the able direction of Gordon Douglas this movie was far better than you'd expect  actually much better than the cocaineinspired junk they make in 2008. Now in DVD.In 1950 good adventure movies were commonplace so this movie was given some extra hype by Columbia Pictures pairing it double feature with Beauty on Parade a semisexy saga about beauty contests and how the girls get abused. Odd that I'd remember this second feature after 58 years not on DVD cable or anywhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite receiving top billing I wouldn't call this a Dudikoff movie. It's Mark Hamill's movie all the way as the former Luke Skywalker chews the scenery and steals the entire film. In a role that again demonstrates Hamill's versatile talent he plays a mental patient who has escaped from his hospital to visit his doctor Robert Mitchum in a small supporting role towards the end of the film. After an argument Dudikoff's wife leaves him and goes to see her sister picking up hitchhiking Hamill along the way. Dudikoff borrows his friend's car and sets out to find her unaware of the danger she will soon be in. As much as I like to see Hamill play good guys he always makes a delightful bad guy and his role here is one of his best psychotic characters. Even when he's playing nice there's an underlining sense of uncertainly. The wife finds out Hamill is a psycho when he kills a hotel clerk and fashions a necklace out of her fake eye dangling it from his finger and asking if she likes it. Dudikoff soon catches up but learning he's a cop Hamill forces the wife to hightail it setting off a dangerous game of pursuit. Dudikoff thinks his wife is trying to get away with another man and the entire time always ends up one step behind. At one point he loses his car forcing him to steal another from a car carrier truck as it speeds down the highway. A great scene by the way.There's plenty of action car chases explosions car chases explosions and one tense scene in which Hamill straps Dudikoff to the hood of a taxi cab and proceeds to slam repeatedly into the rear of a gas tanker the driver of which must be completely unable to feel the hits his vehicle is taking. The climax at a hospital is pretty good as well with a tense final encounter between Dudikoff and Hamill on the roof of the building. The gritty cinematography helps give the film a horror movielike tone. I just wish we had known a bit more about Dudikoff and his wife. All we know is that he and a friend helped get her out of Russia though how we are never told. But that little unknown plot point aside MIDNIGHT RIDE is effective as a creepy little road movie and fans of those should enjoy it. It would make a terrific Saturday triplebill with DUEL and THE NATURE OF THE BEAST.".

The boyishly sweet looking Hamill is obviously trying to break away from that typecast his been associated with and this cheap bgrade Cannon action flick gave him an opportunity to do that. Well he lets it all out in an unconvincingly hammy and spacedout portrayal with such nonapologetic aplomb. It's quite a sight. A frightening one too but not in that threatening way. But there's something random about it that just compels. Starring opposite of him is a surprisingly sound and rugged Michael Dudikoff and coming between the two is a feisty Savina Gersak. Making a brief and alltoo tired turn is Robert Mitchum. Who looks like he'd rather be somewhere else and its understandable. I can't deny that I didn't enjoy it as for an active nocturnal road chase movie with cat and mouse elements it was thrillingly executed. Never did it lose any of that gritty energy and hysterical nastiness from Bob Bralver's assertive direction. Sure it can be laughable and contrived with its weak psychological front. But it's all about leaving a constant pile of destruction and a workable death toll. Still there's a real creepiness in certain sequences and atmospheric lighting but it's mostly broken up by some ridiculously overthetop setpieces. That also goes for the outofnowhere shock ending. The material has actually dreamt up something that's original and could've been tightly menacing as it has a wife fleeing her committed police husband while unknowingly offering a ride to a unstable psycho but how they go about it loses the possibility of gelling the two threats and dissolves into something quite standard with the opening half of the story's motive coming off dispensable.

Mark Hamill is as creepy as you can get in this film as the escaped mental patient Justin who takes Lara Savina Gersak hostage and ends up killing sixteen people by my count before the night is over. After having a domestic fight with her cop husband Lawson Michael Dudikoff Lara leaves for a friends house and picks up a harmless looking hitchhiker Justin and then ends up having the ride of her life. Killing everyone that he comes in contact with Justin ends up murdering ten policemen and six civilians as he takes Lara to the hospital where he escaped from earlier in the evening. Justin wants to see and have a talk with his doctor Dr. Hardy Robert Mitchum . Lawson who Justin tried to murder by driving a taxi with him strapped to the hood gets to the hospital just before Justin puts Lara under electric shock treatment which Dr. Hardy refused to do. They then both have it out with Justin falling down a balcony and getting electrocuted on a grid. Were told later by Dr. Hardy that Justin is insane to no ones surprise watching the movie. Only to have Justin reappear later in the hospital elevator disguised as a hospital patient with both Lara and Lawson only to get a bullet between his eyes by a fast thinking and fast shooting Lawson.The movie Midnight Ride works on all levels as a suspense horror thriller as well as a chase action movie and it's a wonder that the film is not as well known as it should be. Mark Hamill steals the acting honors in the film as a psycho killer who makes movie psycho's like Michael Myers from Halloween and Jason from Friday the Thirteenth look like school yard bullies in comparison.No matter how unbelievable the actions that Hamill does in the film are you still believe that he could do them. Thats just how convincing he is as a uncontrollable escaped psycho. Robert Mitchum is effective in his small part as Justin's doctor and both Michael Dudikoff and Savina Gersak were very good as Lara and her husband Lawson. But it's Mark Hamill's one man show as the murderous and insane Justin that really makes the movie Midnight Ride as good as it is. This is one movie to watch that you would need to strap on your seatbelt and hold on tight for an unbelievable adrenaline rush.".

Mark is a very good actor and I have always liked his acting in the original Star Wars trilogy especially The Empire Strikes Back! The music by Carlo Maria Cordio is good and in My opinion most of it nearly sounded like Alan Silverstri's Predator and Back to the Future scores!

Mark Hamil plays a part a million light years away from Luke Skywalker here playing a psychopath which I rather enjoyed although it was a bit hammy and unconvincing at times. Michael Dudikoff plays the cop husband pretty well I found him very charming and capable as the leading man. But I didn't find Savina Gersak very convincing at all she's supposed to be the terrified victim but I found her very weak and disappointing and I think that this movie would have been better if they had a better actress in that part.The film has some really great action moments. In particular there's a terrific Mardi Gras Massacre sequence that's one for the books. Some of the action toward the end is hit and miss Dudikoff's encounters with the Pentangle in the swamp is kinda anticlimatic but the finale is thoroughly awesome. It also manages to have its share of solid action beats the bus chase was pretty good. Plus it moves along at a steady clip which helps make you forget about the lapses in logic. But overall I found this movie fun and entertaining the scenes with Mark Hamil are the real highlight even if they were hysterically funny like when he tries to attack a female victim But I did enjoy the final scenes between him and Dudikoff in the steam factory and the hospital scene.So all in all okay Midnight Ride is a copy of the far superior Hitcher but it's not a bad one and this should get a DVD release because I enjoyed it.".

But overall I found this movie fun and entertaining the scenes with Mark Hamil are the real highlight even if they were hysterically funny like when he tries to attack a female victim But I did enjoy the final scenes between him and Dudikoff in the steam factory and the hospital scene.So all in all okay Midnight Ride is a copy of the far superior Hitcher but it's not a bad one and this should get a DVD release because I enjoyed it.";

She picks up hitchhiker Justin McKay Hamill who turns out to be a raving annoying psychopath. McKay forces her to drive to the town of Hendersonville so he can meet up with his only friend Dr. Hardy Unfortunately Robert Mitchum.In what is basically a road movie Lawson is chasing after Justin and Laura for most of the running time.Nothing is ever established so don't know who these characters are and thus there is no suspense. The movie has a weird offkilter feel and seems like it was filmed in another country but apparently it wasn't. It also feels ten years older then it is. The happygolucky jazz music during the chase scenes is inappropriate. It is overlong and rife some many absurd plot holes it is not possible to list them all here.Hamill plays a very similar role to the one he played in the TV movie The City 1977 a leering lunatic who bugs out his eyes and cackles incessantly. He wears a graystriped jacket that makes him look like a ten year old and takes Polaroid pictures of everything. If he is trying to forget Star Wars 1977 this is not the best way. Hamill spits outs craziness like When Dr. Hardy fixes your brain you can marry me! Dudikoff doesn't do any of his trademark martial arts. The movie desperately needed his patented karate chops. His cool hair is still present and accounted for however. The movie focuses way too much on Hamill and not enough on Dudikoff. Of course their final fight is in a steam factory and Hamill has one last silly weapon up his sleeve a random ATV. Doesn't every hospital basement have one? The Videohound book lists Mitchum's appearance as a cameo. In the same way that retired people get jobs because they are too freakin' bored around the house Mitchum's decision to appear in Midnight Ride seems based on that same thought process.It's no surprise Cannon Films ceased to exist a few years later.

Midnight Ride has all the elements there to be a decent movie but in the hands of Bob Bravler this is all ridiculous with no stab in credibility what so ever. For instance Dudikoff is crippled in the beginning of the film My guess is that he broke his leg doing one of the stunts for the movie and yet despite this he still manages to outdo his American Ninja styled heroic actions with plenty of gusto to spare. Ever sprain an ankle? Well you can barely walk now try imagine trying to beat someone up at the same time? Oh and consider that breaking your leg is much much worse than that. More implausibilities play out. The climax in particular is so ridiculous that it becomes obvious that there is no attempt at credibility to any of the action sequences. What is even more amusing is just how misogynist this flick is. The woman in this film is put through an ordeal because she had the audacity to leave her husband Hamill's mother was a psychopath Hamill's sister had an affair with him another female victim talks back to her boyfriend and the first female victim is shrewish hence these women are either killed or put through an ordeal. The film also never notes the sharp irony that Dudikoff really is not a good guy in that he's just as insane as the villain of the movie. Dudikoff refuses to let his wife go as he takes off after her. He offers stock apologies that seem manipulative he steals cars and furthermore seems to rescue his wife out of jealousy rather than actual love. Of course reading too much into a flick is somewhat pretentious even for me but there is no doubt that that this thing is somewhat sexist. This of course didn't bother me so much as the credibility of the action sequences and story. Plus the acting is not very good. Dudikoff comes off the best which says something considering who he is. Mitchum seems embarrassed Hamill is hammy and Gersak is a rather weak heroine. However the most annoying thing about this movie is just how many times Hamill keeps picking up Gersak. It happens at least 3 times and each time the explanation is absurd. Movies like Midnight Ride live and die by their director's execution and in Bob Bravler we have a guy who has no real sense of distinguishable style so the action sequences are only okay making it easier to point out flaws in the credibility of how such action sequences are conducted. Therefore the audience sees through the plot and realizes that this far fetched thriller is hardly thrilling.12 out of 4Poor".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay you can't deny that The Hitcher inspired this movie and you think sarcastically Oh I can just imagine. Well I'd hate to say it but you're wrong. I've seen this film many a time. This quite tense movie has great plotting and believe it Hamill pulls off his hitch hiking psycho convincingly. I was impressed by the structure of the story situation after situation. Sevina Gershak really good as are our four leads plays a Russian immigrant married to cop Dudikoff. Obviously she's had enough. This seemingly arranged marriage isn't working and I must admit I did find Dudikoff irritating. Hopefully that hairy scene with him tied down the front bonet of a car as it hurtles down a mountainside woke him up a bit and made he reevaluate his priorities but I don't think it did too. Also to begin with he's on crutches so he's limping throughout. The guy doesn't learn. This film with it's violent moments leads up to a little twist towards it's conclusion never letting up on the tenseness of the film where we're greeted with acting presence Mitchum who was Hamill's psychiatrist. I wish we had more screen time with Mitchum. Being a Hitcher fan I had to see this out of curiosity and while it's not as good as that cult classic here's a tense B grader you shouldn't overlook save for a stupid after ending scene with Hamill. The performances are good though sometimes Hamill does ham it up but it's fun seeing him in this role and he does like taking photos too.".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay you can't deny that The Hitcher inspired this movie and you think sarcastically Oh I can just imagine. Well I'd hate to say it but you're wrong. I've seen this film many a time. This quite tense movie has great plotting and believe it Hamill pulls off his hitch hiking psycho convincingly. I was impressed by the structure of the story situation after situation. Sevina Gershak really good as are our four leads plays a Russian immigrant married to cop Dudikoff. Obviously she's had enough. This seemingly arranged marriage isn't working and I must admit I did find Dudikoff irritating. Hopefully that hairy scene with him tied down the front bonet of a car as it hurtles down a mountainside woke him up a bit and made he reevaluate his priorities but I don't think it did too. Also to begin with he's on crutches so he's limping throughout. The guy doesn't learn. This film with it's violent moments leads up to a little twist towards it's conclusion never letting up on the tenseness of the film where we're greeted with acting presence Mitchum who was Hamill's psychiatrist. I wish we had more screen time with Mitchum.

There is even a monologue at the end of the movie which explains that things have changed now that we have entered the Atomic age.James Whitmore James Arness Joan Weldon and Edmund Gwenn give good performances as the heroes who are out to save mankind along with the U.S. military police. The pacing was rather good as well slowing down when things need to be explained and then picking up when the giant ants are on screen.Though the special effects seem cheesy by todays standards I thought they were rather effective in this movie and memorable for 1954. This movie definitely looks best in black and white because it adds a haunting feeling to the desolation of the desert where the creatures are first found and it also makes other scenes in the movie seem darker and sinister.

Although the atomicradiationcausingterriblemutations was a standard device in 50s sci fi THE DEADLY MANTIS IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA and others it was a workable one and given that the ants were from the same area of desert where the first atomic blast occurred it had just enough plausibility. I also like the little touches of humor and banter between characters. There was even a little bit of cheesecake when the young Dr. Medford Joan Weldon gets her skirt caught when descended from the plane revealing a pair of shapely legs. This is one I keep going back to on rainy Saturday afternoons! A gem of its kind.".

The 1950s was a golden age of science fiction movies and THEM! was one of the very best. Good casting dialog and storyline and commendable special effects for the time. Although the atomicradiationcausingterriblemutations was a standard device in 50s sci fi THE DEADLY MANTIS IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA and others it was a workable one and given that the ants were from the same area of desert where the first atomic blast occurred it had just enough plausibility. I also like the little touches of humor and banter between characters. There was even a little bit of cheesecake when the young Dr. Medford Joan Weldon gets her skirt caught when descended from the plane revealing a pair of shapely legs. This is one I keep going back to on rainy Saturday afternoons! A gem of its kind.";

We were scared to death and hid behind the trees and bushes just watching for them.Where have I lived for most part since 1984? Good old Alamogordo NM home of the giant ants! How destiny does intrude on life. I love the desert and mountains out here retired from USAF in 1999 and I am very happy to say that there have been no reports of giant ants since I have been here. People always call this the home of Atomic bomb though they are off by some distanceand I always look them straight in the face and say What? You mean you never heard of our giant ant problem?";

The special effects WERE good! Well for the fifties! They weren't like other pathetic paper mache model films like The Giant Claw or The attack of the Crab Monsters. These monsters actually looked like an effort had been made on them. I have to say I was taken aback by this suspenseful fifties success and was pleased in every way. Enjoy!".

For its time they were state of the art and personally I can't imagine any better ants on the screen. They look and act real. and they're pretty creepy enough to keep you looking over your shouldar But what I really love about this movie is the script which is unusually good for a sci fi of this period and the fact that it all sounds so scientifically possible. I have since learned that it's impossible for insects to grow to a large size even with radiation because they lack lungs to support their bodies but who knew back then? We didn't know what atomic energy could do and this movie expresses our fears in such a homey way.And it may just be the only sci fi where the woman does more than scream and get rescued. She is a scientist and she's no one's fool and she manages to put James Arness in his place when he tells her the ant hill is no place for a woman. I love it! And every time I watch it I just feel so bad when James Whitmore dies saving those two kids. He's been with us since the beginning of the movie and he gives his life to rescue them finally able to right the scales a little over the death of his partner. I just hate that he dies. It's horrifying.A great flick.".

The actors are all great even those in supporting roles. Edmund Gwenn is the standout. Possibly the most impressive thing about the movie is that the characters are written and acted so well they don't descend into archetypes as often happens in scifi and horror films then and now. Speaking of impressive how about those special effects? Extraordinary for the time and hold up well today.In my opinion it's one of the top ten movies of the 1950's.

	schema:headline " Easily among the best horrors from the 50s!";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever one thinks about the many horror movies of the 50s it's nearly impossible to not think about the multitude of creature features that had in common a basis on sciencefiction that reflected the newly discovered fears of uncontrolled science and the cold war paranoia and when one thinks about this 50s creature features the ideas of cheesy story lines and laughably awful special effects quickly come to mind as those were two elements typical in many lowbudget productions. However it would be a big mistake to think that every 50s horror movie was a bad display of special effects as the classic Warner Brothers film titled Them! one of the first of those nuclear monster films proves clearly. Made a year after the success of The Beast from 20000 Fathoms this movie followed similar themes but gave them a more horror oriented spin and singlehanded became the source of countless imitators.Sgt. Ben Peterson James Whitmore investigates a strange series of disappearances and murders happening in New Mexico's desert and since one of the missing persons was an FBI agent agent Robert Graham James Arness is sent to collaborate with Peterson in the investigation however the only clue they have is the strange prints found at the crime scenes. As the death toll increases they send the print to be analyzed in the FBI headquarters but in return the FBI sends Dr. Harold Medford Edmund Gwenn from the Department of Agriculture and his daughter Dr. Patricia Medford Joan Weldon in order to aid them in their work. While the two law enforcers are confused at first by this decision soon they discover that the Medfords were sent because the responsible of the killings is not human.Based on a story by George Worthing Yates actually his first foray into science fiction Them! presents a story that still feels fresh in this its original form despite having been copied countless times. Playing on the Cold War fears of Nuclear technology Them! starts as a murder mystery that grows bigger and suddenly becomes a matter of global security. What truly makes Them! to stand out among the rest of the movies of its time it's the way it takes its plot as silly as it may sound to today's audiences with a respect that few works of science fiction not only films do. Another of the elements that makes Them! a very special movie is the way the characters are fleshed out in a very realistic and human form. While basically stereotypes scientist cop government agent etc... every one is given enough depth to stand out and become really multi dimensional characters.Experienced bmovie director Gordon Douglas brings the story to life in a sober yet very effective style that at times echoes his work in Westerns and Film Noirs. Just like the script does Douglas takes the plot of his movie seriously and with a strong basis on reality creating an atmosphere of dread and a slight dose of pessimism that adds a lot of feeling to the movie. Unlike his imitators Douglas favors suspense over visual shock and by hiding the monster during most of the time and giving a really brilliant use to the score and sound effects he transforms it into a terrifying and very real threat despite his lowbudget effects. Combined with the serious take on the plot this really makes the whole movie be more believable and adds an powerful feeling of impending doom that makes it haunting and truly terrifying.The four actors that give life to the key roles in the film really make the most of the characters they play starting with James Whitmore as the county cop whose simple and quiet life gets changed after his discovery in the desert. James Arness is excellent as agent Graham and shows off the natural talent and charm that would make him a star in Gunsmoke. Joan Weldon is also very good in an atypical for the 50s role very ahead of its time. She plays Dr. Pat Medford with a confidence that shows that women can be both beautiful and intelligent. However the true highlight of the film is the performance done by Edmund Gwenn as Dr. Harold Medford. It is he who gives the film the heart and becomes the basis for the old scientist role of future creature features.Like many movies of its time Them! has earned a reputation as outdated silly or worse badly done movies of a bygone era however Them! is a film that offers not only a glimpse of the 50s attitudes but also an example of a movie that twisted the conventions of its time.

	onyx:emotionText "Whenever one thinks about the many horror movies of the 50s it's nearly impossible to not think about the multitude of creature features that had in common a basis on sciencefiction that reflected the newly discovered fears of uncontrolled science and the cold war paranoia and when one thinks about this 50s creature features the ideas of cheesy story lines and laughably awful special effects quickly come to mind as those were two elements typical in many lowbudget productions. However it would be a big mistake to think that every 50s horror movie was a bad display of special effects as the classic Warner Brothers film titled Them! one of the first of those nuclear monster films proves clearly. Made a year after the success of The Beast from 20000 Fathoms this movie followed similar themes but gave them a more horror oriented spin and singlehanded became the source of countless imitators.Sgt. Ben Peterson James Whitmore investigates a strange series of disappearances and murders happening in New Mexico's desert and since one of the missing persons was an FBI agent agent Robert Graham James Arness is sent to collaborate with Peterson in the investigation however the only clue they have is the strange prints found at the crime scenes. As the death toll increases they send the print to be analyzed in the FBI headquarters but in return the FBI sends Dr. Harold Medford Edmund Gwenn from the Department of Agriculture and his daughter Dr. Patricia Medford Joan Weldon in order to aid them in their work. While the two law enforcers are confused at first by this decision soon they discover that the Medfords were sent because the responsible of the killings is not human.Based on a story by George Worthing Yates actually his first foray into science fiction Them! presents a story that still feels fresh in this its original form despite having been copied countless times. Playing on the Cold War fears of Nuclear technology Them! starts as a murder mystery that grows bigger and suddenly becomes a matter of global security. What truly makes Them! to stand out among the rest of the movies of its time it's the way it takes its plot as silly as it may sound to today's audiences with a respect that few works of science fiction not only films do. Another of the elements that makes Them! a very special movie is the way the characters are fleshed out in a very realistic and human form. While basically stereotypes scientist cop government agent etc... every one is given enough depth to stand out and become really multi dimensional characters.Experienced bmovie director Gordon Douglas brings the story to life in a sober yet very effective style that at times echoes his work in Westerns and Film Noirs. Just like the script does Douglas takes the plot of his movie seriously and with a strong basis on reality creating an atmosphere of dread and a slight dose of pessimism that adds a lot of feeling to the movie. Unlike his imitators Douglas favors suspense over visual shock and by hiding the monster during most of the time and giving a really brilliant use to the score and sound effects he transforms it into a terrifying and very real threat despite his lowbudget effects. Combined with the serious take on the plot this really makes the whole movie be more believable and adds an powerful feeling of impending doom that makes it haunting and truly terrifying.The four actors that give life to the key roles in the film really make the most of the characters they play starting with James Whitmore as the county cop whose simple and quiet life gets changed after his discovery in the desert. James Arness is excellent as agent Graham and shows off the natural talent and charm that would make him a star in Gunsmoke. Joan Weldon is also very good in an atypical for the 50s role very ahead of its time. She plays Dr. Pat Medford with a confidence that shows that women can be both beautiful and intelligent. However the true highlight of the film is the performance done by Edmund Gwenn as Dr. Harold Medford. It is he who gives the film the heart and becomes the basis for the old scientist role of future creature features.Like many movies of its time Them! has earned a reputation as outdated silly or worse badly done movies of a bygone era however Them! is a film that offers not only a glimpse of the 50s attitudes but also an example of a movie that twisted the conventions of its time. While James Arness and Whitmore play the typical archetypes of the hero in this kind of films they are shown as confused at first and later afraid of the nature of the beasts they must fight. They are not knowitall macho men ready to save the world but everyday people who must learn to overcome their own fears.

The script and character portrayal make a strong social comment on the folly of nuclear weapons. Camera angles and ant robotics intended to enhance a 3D effect also serve the director skillfully in spite of visual restraints. This film is unforgettable and stands up today as a chilling morality play about the fruits of man's darker side.

Over all the film is good. It was well directed with some remarkable actors. And remember LASER BEAMS! If you don't like the film you will definatly like LASER BEAMS! Hehe.

It did make me smile though and that is already a good thing. There were some humorous parts in it but in my opinion that's still not enough to call it a comedy. If it isn't a comedy what is it than? It's a well produced action thriller which was able to keep my attention from the beginning to the end thanks to the many twists and the good acting. You could say of course that Sean Connery is still used to playing this kind of roles. He wasn't James Bond for nothing. He still knows how to play a smart gentleman who likes to play with a lot of gadgets and pretty ladies... And what an opponent he has! Catherine ZetaJones is really nice to look at in every way...Connery is an art thief who is able to pass the best security systems stealing the painting and making fun of the security people by changing the original painting with a picture of Elvis. Catherine ZetaJones investigates the crime scenes for an insurance company and tries to catch Connery. To do so she will try to convince him that she's a thief as well that she has planned a huge robbery but that she needs his help to complete it.Thanks to the many twists this movie will keep you guessing till the end who is what who did what to who and why... And the ending is in comparison to other movies of this kind a pure surprise very subtle and truly original. That is why I reward this movie with a 7510. Truly a good job!".

That's what ENTRAPMENT is.Gin Baker Catherine ZetaJones seems to be working for an insurance company. She has a certain fascination with Mac MacDougal Sean Connery who is an incredibly good thief who has stolen numerous works of art.

But Gin who is a very talented thief herself has her own plans. With the help of Mac and his partner that she doesn't know about named Aaron Thibadeaux Ving Rhames she wants to do a robbery with a payoff of billions of dollars.The acting in this movie is of course excellent. Sean Connery naturally does his usual outstanding job but Catherine ZetaJones steals the show. Her closeups are beautiful as expected and she manages to give off a professional and sexy performance. Ving Rhames also does a good job as the notsurehecanbetrusted partner of Connery. Will Patton also does a good job even though his part isn't especially large.The plot is very interesting but the ending is a little confusing. It happens and ends rather quickly which may make you think What just happened? You'll understand it a few minutes later but some will be left with a some what dissatisfied feeling about the end.This movie is really pretty good. The actors are good the plot is interesting the machinery is nice and the closeups of Catherine ZetaJones' butt are great. Worth a rent for sure.".

Connery is weary and reserved as befitting his age and that made the MayNovember romance all the more poignant. Ving Rhames again was the street wise tough a role he has done many times before.

The film glides effortlessly between some sketchily drawn romantic inclinations to wellexecuted scenes of training to actually exciting action moments of the heists.  It's a nice package.The film is really about the art or maybe even the beauty of stealing. A refreshing idea that hasn't been considered in some time.  There is a giddy glee in just watching the thieves use high tech mechanisms to outsmart the systems that house the loot. It's a carefully paced film so the usual actionpayoffdramaactionpayoffdrama form for these types of movies isn't used here. It's entertaining as hell and the climax holds many thrills.Like I said before the two leads are some of the finest looking in the film biz.  Sean Connery makes a wonderful choice by playing off his old age.  As the character he seems overwhelmed by Catherine ZetaJones. It makes for a few moments of sly comedy.  As for Ms. ZetaJones it has been said of her that she takes the best closeup in current motion pictures. Entrapment proves that statement time and again.  While she does struggle trying to keep down her natural Welsh accent ZetaJones makes for a lively sidekick to Connery and despite the ballyhooed age difference they work together just fine.Despite a lackluster and forced final Entrapment works better than you may think.  It's easy to get hung up on the age difference or Connery's hairpiece but the movie is too much fun to be bothered with such minute details.  This is good presummer entertainment.  I give the filmmakers kudos for keeping the tone light and the suspense on 11. 8".

	schema:reviewBody "The heist caper genre so popular in the '70s rears its head with this uninspired but fairly enjoyable 1999 flick. Sean Connery and Catherine ZetaJones generate genuine sexual chemistry despite their age gap Connery was just shy of 70 when the film was made and there are a couple of suspenseful heist sequences along the way. Between the high spots the film is rather bland and forgettable with little of the humour that made the heist movies of yesteryear such fun try to imagine The Hot Rock or The Italian Job stripped of their sense of humour and you'll have a fair impression of what this film has to offer.Virginia Baker Catherine ZetaJones works for a top insurance company. Also secretly she is a master cat burglar who greatly admires the audacity and criminal success of another thief Robert MacDougal Sean Connery. Virginia double bluffs her boss Hector Cruz Will Patton into allowing her to track down MacDougal. Her official brief is to become his partnerincrime for a daring heist after which she is supposed to turn him over to the police. But in reality Virginia actually DOES want to be his partnerincrime.... and has no intention of turning him in whatsoever! Aided by MacDougal's buddy Thibideaux Ving Rhames the thieving twosome complete their robbery successfully. Later MacDougal reveals his plans for an even bigger job. With Virginia as his accomplice he aspires to pull off the nearimpossible theft of 8 billion dollars from the world's tallest building in Kuala Lumpur on Millennium Eve. By this point Cruz has begun to suspect that Virginia may not be working on the side of the law any more. In a taut finale MacDougal and Virginia attempt to complete their ingenious crime before the security forces catch them redhanded.Entrapment is slick and effortlessly watchable stuff with little discernible style of its own. Connery and ZetaJones as already noted overcome their remarkable age difference to make for a rather attractive pair. A good measure of any heist flick is whether your sympathies lie with the crooks or the law. In this one the burglars win handsdown.... they are infinitely more charismatic than the good guys. The globetrotting narrative provides some exotic locations in which the stars can indulge in their posturing. Kuala Lumpur especially comes across as an exciting and interesting locale somewhat underused to date in the movies. Entrapment has its share of silly moments including a gratuitous sequence in which ZetaJones trains for her first robbery by writhing in a skintight cat suit through a maze of wool strung out in such a way as to replicate the pattern of an infrared alarm system! Too many scenes also have Connery vanishing into midair to avoid capture a trick that becomes increasingly hard to swallow and hampers the film's credibility. All in all though Entrapment is a harmless timekiller that keeps you moderately entertained especially if you catch it in the right frame of mind.".

Too many scenes also have Connery vanishing into midair to avoid capture a trick that becomes increasingly hard to swallow and hampers the film's credibility. All in all though Entrapment is a harmless timekiller that keeps you moderately entertained especially if you catch it in the right frame of mind.";

	schema:reviewBody "Entrapment is essentially a lightweight caper movie about a scheme to catch one of the world's greatest art thieves. It features an enjoyable series of action sequences daring heists and enough doubledealing twists and intrigue to keep its audience engaged and entertained throughout. This is pure escapism and a fun film that's a great vehicle for its two lead actors who make the most of the considerable amount of screen time that they're given.After a priceless Rembrandt painting is stolen from a New York skyscraper insurance investigator Virginia Gin Baker Catherine ZetaJones suspects that the culprit is international art thief Robert Mac MacDougal Sean Connery and persuades her boss to allow her to go undercover to pursue him. She meets up with Mac in London where she poses as an art thief and suggests that they join forces to steal an extremely valuable Chinese mask from Bedford Palace. Despite their success in stealing the mask Mac remains very suspicious of her real motives but then she interests him in a plan to carry out an even more daring heist which could net them 8 billion.Gin's plan involves carrying out a sophisticated computer based robbery at the headquarters of the International Clearance Bank located in the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur. The type of theft that she envisages exploits the fact that the bank's computer system has to be shut down briefly just before the new millennium and so the heist is eventually carried out in the countdown to the year 2000.The tension builds as they attempt to carry out their plan at precisely the right time with Gin's boss and a very large number of security officers monitoring what's happening in the building. Mac and Gin complete their mission successfully but in the process inadvertently set off the alarm system and have to make an incredibly dangerous escape by clambering precariously along some cables that link the building's two towers. The remainder of their plan doesn't run smoothly and they have to escape the building separately before meeting up again the next morning at Pudu train station where a further series of unexpected developments follow.The relationship that develops between Mac an Gin is amusing to watch as there's a certain amount of attraction between them but also a significant absence of trust. Mac clearly appreciates Gin's physical beauty especially in the sequences where he breaks into her hotel room unexpectedly and also when she's practicing the contortions required to negotiate a network of laser beams. On the other hand however he is very suspicious of her motives and on one occasion asks has there ever been anyone you couldn't manipulate beguile or seduce? and she replies No.Commendably the quality of their performances and the amount of charm they exude enable Sean Connery and Catherine ZetaJones to compensate greatly for the lack of witty repartee that would normally be a feature of a story involving their kind of relationship.A series of exotic locations excellent cinematography and wellexecuted stunts are also used well to further enhance the enjoyment of this glossy Y2K thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not go into Entrapment expecting too much and well there wasn't much. I have come to the conclusion that there are only two reasons why people may like this movie and both have to do with the two leading stars. Sean Connery is universally seen as the best looking older man and his Scottish charm is of course also one of his attractions. Then there is Catherine Zeta Jones a redhot newcomer whose luscious figure would make any man want to watch. Entrapment is a perfect example of a Hollywood star film which has the sole purpose of raking in as much cash as possible. Any attraction to the film is based entirely on its stars. I saw the movie with a number of people who liked it and when I was discussing it with them all of their praise was based on the two leads.The director Jon Amiel is generally an unknown filmmaker to most people. He has done Copycat and Sommersby both of which are average films and whose success can be attributed to the stars. Entrapment does not contain any breakthroughs in terms of editing or cinematography and it certainly does not have an original plot. We have seen the formula that makes this movie many times perhaps in varying inflections but essentially the same. So what's left entertainment value. Many people reading this review may think that I do not look at films in terms of entertainment value. Not the case. There are many films that I have given excellent reviews to based entirely on the merit of entertainment. Two recent examples that I can think of are Cruel Intentions and Go. But Entrapment lacks anything close to what might have been an entertaining or interesting plot. The idea of basing a heist that will only work if it is conducted on New Years of the Millennium is a great idea. I would love to see a film about the meticulous planning and the execution of such an endeavor. Entrapment tries to accomplish too much and ends up leaving such huge plot holes that the film feels rushed and absurd.Gin Catherine Zeta Jones takes on the role of an insurance agentundercover thief who hooks up with Robert Sean Connery a rich career criminal to execute a couple of huge international heists. They train together in Robert's castle. There are a few scenes here that I enjoyed. I especially liked the scenes of Gin practicing avoiding lasers simulated by strands of yarnOf course Robert and Gin have a romantic tension that is complicated by the rules of being a thief. You can not trust each other if you're romantically involved right? At first they do not seem to get along. Hollywood loves to put together two misfits who have to put aside their differences to accomplish some task. This formula has marked the copbuddy film for years. Take for instance the first Lethal Weapon. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover at first hate each other. And in Die Hard With a Vengeance Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson did not at first get along but in the end their differences are put aside and they emerge as friends.Entrapment also exists as a catalyst to Hollywood's ongoing trend to have romantic encounters between young extremely attractive women and much older men. There is a forty year age difference between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Zones. Other recent examples of this trend include Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow in A Perfect Murder and Harrison Ford and Anne Heche in Six Days Seven Nights. This trend is not necessarily a negative thing but in Entrapment it's just too blatantly obvious and cliched.Entrapment is a movie that had potential but got lost in a number of cliches and its hurriedness. Connery and Jones do have chemistry and look good together but forget the romantic tension leave it for romantic films. Forget the first heist it feels like filler to keep us occupied until the final scenes and climax. A strong film could have been made with the planning of the year 2000 heist. Because it would be the heist of the century so many ideas could have been developed which would have made for a much more entertaining film. out of ".

Gets by well enough on style and star chemistry and the basic allure of watching a tightlyplanned caper unfold. A certain sunny sloppiness almost redeems Jon Amiel's throwback caper flick.Connery and ZetaJones not only look great together they work well together too.Connery and ZetaJones are such fun to watch together it almost doesn't matter how little sense the movie makes  and their relationship is far more gleefully perverse weirdly chivalrous and surprisingly interesting than the trailer makes it look.Cleverly updates the formula with a sprinkling of fun finDEmillennium touches.Entrapment luxuriates in the best Hollywood big bucks can buy superb sets and cinematography spectacular locations expensive stars. During the opening credits the camera glides through a romanticised Manhattan skyline. The steel and chrome gleam the lights of the skyscrapers are digital jewels and the frame of the screen is dynamically pierced at odd angles by a laserlike red beam. This sequence holds out a tantalising promise for the movie particularly when the camera rests on a sinuous catburglar entering a high tightly shut window with elegant ease. We expect an exciting sleek and slick caper movie something like To Catch a Thief 1954 or at least let's not be too greedy Arabesque 1966. It's not the stars' fault that Entrapment is disappointing. Sean Connery gets the Cary Grant treatment here made the object of his costar's desire. Catherine ZetaJones chases him just as surely and shrewdly as Audrey Hepburn chased Grant in Charade 1963. Given the 40year age gap between them her instigation is presumably meant to make their romance less risible but it's an unnecessary precaution. Closeups reveal Connery's skin is losing the battle with time but his appeal was never really based on youth.Connery's stardom rests on his ability to represent a man completely at ease with his masculinity and his sexuality better than any other star of his generation. There was always something a bit suspect about prettier men like Paul Newman cf. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof 1958 while tougher guys such as Clint Eastwood seemed too stiff to be turned on by anything but seaminess Tightrope 1984. Connery however deploys his physical size gruff and commanding voice a glance both sure and sly and a stillness that can pounce into graceful movement at any moment to project a sexuality so confident it can afford to be nonchalant and playful. We are easily convinced that what ZetaJones wants from him give or take a couple of billion dollars is delivery on the promise of a rough good time.ZetaJones more than holds her own here. Connery may be the object of her desire but ZetaJones is meant to be the object of ours. The sight of her leotardclad figure practising gymnastics in order to avoid the burglar alarm's lasers is more spectacular and pleasurable than the action set pieces. She emerges from Entrapment a fullblown star flirting with such intelligent sultriness not even a man of Connery's strength can resist. Good alone but even better together the two have an undoubted chemistry.Entrapment aspires to be nothing more than a bit of glamorous nonsense but although it has done all right by the glamour it has perhaps done too well by the nonsense. Very badly structured the story begins to feel ripped off half way through its maze of doublecrossings never delivering a narrative payoff. At the unbelievable and tackedon ending even a cynic might feel a twinge of discomfort at the lack of even a halfhearted gesture towards a moral rationale for the action. We're meant to root for these thieves just because they look gorgeous seem meant for each other and are good at their work.The fact that the combination of sex and capital as spectacle is thought to need no other rationale says a lot about millennial culture and would make a good subject for another movie. But this is bynumbers genre work which has forgotten a few sums. Entrapment fails as a caper film because it neglects that fundamental ingredient  a credible plot evidently something even the biggest chequebooks in Hollywood can no longer guarantee.".

This is the next film that we watched after The Matrix.  As for the storyline the chase scenes didn't live up to how the story was brought up which was very good and exciting and intriguing.Sean and Catherine make a good pair in this film. Catherine didn't look like she was 'intimidated' by working with a veteran actor like Sean. She endured the film and it looks like that she actually quite overwhelmed Sean on this one. It is an honor for Hollywood actors and actresses to work with an icon like Sean and not only Catherine was fortunate but she did fit as Sean's sidekick. The 'romance' that was built up between them has a good chemistry and they really are suited as a match despite the age gap.To my surprise the latter part of the film was shot in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia where i worked for almost 6 months. It is very refreshing to see our side of the world in big films with big names like this. I am not sure about this but it's quite weird that there are no peoplecommuters at the train station at 630 in the morning. I felt funny seeing them alone on the station that really didn't look like realistic at all. I know for sure that KL is a busy capital and it justs doesn't look correct.On the chase scene inside the current tallest building in the world the tear gas event is also a disappointment. I've experienced the agony of what tear gas do to your eyes skin and noselungs  and this without even being near the teargas can! I just can't imagine how the characters would have 'survived' going thru the smoke and then continue running away from the authorities.Sean and Catherine were great together and the story was thrilling and exciting. If not for the sloppy chase scenes I have given it 8 stars. In this case it's a 7.".

However within a very short amount of time I became hooked  this is just a really entertaining story well told well shot and totally enjoyable from start to finish. Implausible plot? Yeah sure but what escapist movie isn't and the important thing is that the characters really believed in it and so we did too. The heists in this movie were all meticulously thought out and grippingly presented  and the extended middle sequence where Connery is training ZetaJones is just really interesting. It reminded me in a weird and distant way of those YodaLuke Skywalker sequences in Empire Strikes Back and emphasizes how seldom Hollywood movies particularly action ones ever show anyone in the process of learning something characters either know what they're doing ahead of time or pick up skills with alarming speed usually in the heat of conflict. Now about that relationship between Connery and ZetaJones. Entrapment is no mere Grandpa romances the babysitter movie like Bulworth or Six Days Seven Nights or just about any Woody Allen film simply because the focus of their relationship is always the catandmouse game of accomplices in crime who don't trust one another not the mating dance of  horny singles. Both stars are certainly attractive of course and the filmmakers know it and emphasize it but the fundamental relationship takes its cue from Mac's Connery's character advice early in the film to the effect that there can be no romance between thieves. This advice is scrupulously followed in the film itself keeping it free of an embarrassing romantic subplot and thereby maintaining a sharp focus upon the story and action. If only the other heist film this past summer the inferior but far more lavishly praised The Thomas Crown Affair had stayed true to this maxim we might have had more great sequences like the beginning and the ending and been spared the long looooong middle section where nothing happens save for Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan getting it on improbably and boringly in as many situations as possible.To sum up tight plot exciting action sequences great looking stars and some nifty twists and turns along the way  all without the curse of a boring and improbable romance slowing everything down. What are you waiting for? As long as you're in a purely escapist mood Entrapment is GREAT entertainment.".

Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007 and Catherine ZetaJones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of Zorro.But is chemistry between a man and a woman just physical sensual and sexual ?I find the movie entertaining as it shows 2 people enjoying doing what they like best.   The chemistry is between ZetaJones youth outgoing passion for life and Connery's less evident more inward quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime experience.   As they go about doing and accomplishing things together the old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth.   Slowly he starts to like her and despite his age or perhaps because of his age he feels that to a certain extent he cares for her.   While at the same time she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually liking him on her side.Admittedly it is an uneasy chemistry between Connery the Scott gentleman and Catherine the Welsh with long brown hair and eyes but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.Watch Entrapment !   Enjoy it as I did for what it is not for what it is not! rating 7.510".

Nothing like this would ever happen remotely in real life.  I place the entire blame for this movie on screenwriter Ron Bass who to his credit wrote the great script for Rainman.  But this piece of junk... it's not worth any further comment.";

I don't even know where to begin ... Gainax threw out everything they had completely redrawing all the animation and backgrounds in painstakingly high detail. It is the most apparent revision to the series at first glance ... all the visuals are topnotch even the computergenerated graphics which I would typically find unforgivable in a film  but everything is drawn and animated so smooth and the rare use of CG is so wellintegrated into the film that it feels like you haven't been taken out of the organic animation at all.The storyline is quite similar to the original though first on the side I want to say they've taken much thought deciding how to develop the characters better and the result is that the cast is much more believable and their chemistry is quite fantastic. The characters just feel deeper their emotions are more genuine it's hard to describe in a review but if you're a fan of the original series you'll find their personalities and interactions much more developed and satisfying.The plot as I've said has not changed too much at this point.. there are exceptions here and there with the introductions of pivotal locations and characters earlier on no doubt to lay down continuity for the later installments. The original Evangelion had a slight problem with eclectic character and plot point introductions. They have taken care to set the stage more carefully for the first scene this time around and as shown with the early introduction of an important character Gainax intends to make full use of some fantastic characters that didn't get enough time in the spotlight to really add anything especially deep.I recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of serious animation and I would say that it's an absolute mustsee for fans of the original series.It's comforting to know that in a world of poor remakes and extensions of popular titles that Gainax has their wits about them and shows true dedication in their efforts to make Evangelion into everything that it could possibly be.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I knew a little about the Japanese anime Neon Genesis Evangelion through the reading of various fan sites dedicated to it I've never actually sat down and watched an episode of the series. So when opportunity came by to experience the Rebuild of Evangelion why not start the slate clean? Rebuild of Evangelion is actually a tetralogy based on the original anime series by the same creative team but it's not exactly a shotbyshot rehash in that it does include some extra scenes and I guess the objective is to allow the tetralogy to encapsulate what worked in the original while at the same time to perhaps make it the more definitive telling of the story. Kind of like how comic books like to do the various reboots and tweaking of origins to suit the times.We're introduced to Shinji Ikari the teenage kid whose father Gendo is commander of an organization called NERV which developed the Evangelion mechas to fight against alien Angels who invade Earth. To a layman like me it's something like Ultraman battling monsters except that are certain constraints here that make Evangelions interesting. Firstly they are dependent on launch pads and are wired to NERV control and what more piloting these sophisticated mechas involves some biofusion between children and the bots. Imagine having the fate of the world resting on the shoulders of a child and what more a rookie one in Shinji who has to learn the ropes on the job. To complicate matters he's the reluctant hero who whines a lot is indecisive and seems like he could lose it all anytime.But that's exactly what makes Evangelion a joy to watch. The flawed heroes compounded by the fact that with every increasingly powerful Angel to battle the Evangelions seem to be more patched and repaired after each encounter you'd wonder how long it could hold up before actually crumbling. The battle sequences here are nothing less than spectacular to watch as we discover along with the heroes just how best to defeat the vastly different Angels. Animation wise there's nothing to specially shout out about as it's quite standard 2D fair with the usual attention to details.Being the introductory movie this film begins quite unconventionally in the thick of the action to grip your attention and never let up. As it moves along it does drop hints of previous incidents while introducing us to new characters along the way expanding its mythos and universe. And in all intents it does leave many doors opened for questioning and it's almost definite that these would hopefully be answered in the subsequent films. Oh and for action junkies I give the thumbs up for the final battle in this movie  the creative team really do know how to make everything look really bleak!For those who are new to the series I quite sure this will serve as an excellent starting platform into the Evangelion universe. For those who have already been in the loop and probably hated the series ending this could be interesting for you to see what changes were made and whether you will prefer the tetralogy instead.".

Of course this is Evangelion and comparing it to the fictional 'Asses of Fire' will probably upset many people on this board. Let me cut to the chase. I've always been a die hard Eva fan. By always I mean since about 1999 when Australia first got it's run of the show. Now I live in Tokyo and speak a hefty amount of Japanese so I was fortunate enough to see and understand this movie since I believe a subtitled version wasn't released in Japan. It never actually dawned on me how suitable Eva is for film rather than as a series. Think of Star Wars Lord of the Rings or any epic saga that will remain in classic film history forever as opposed to the slightly annoying 26 chopped up bits of story and don't get me wrong I love the series and hate LOTR but this movie and the ones to come are just so perfect. Leaving the theater I immediately wanted to rush out and buy the entire subbed box set but I guess I'll have to wait a few years for that purchase to exist. Now moving on to the actual film. The main concern I had and probably a lot of you have is if the story would be butchered if you calculate the entire series into three movies you can imagine a lot of the story would be gone but rest assured it was brilliantly paced timed characterized and everything. The first half hour brings you into the story at the exact same pace the first episode did leaving out nothing which I thought was necessary. As the story continues to tell the attacks of the next two angel a lot of character and plot progression is made and it's only the unnecessary gags or repeated dialogue that's gone from the original series. Overall very well done. Maybe it's just the Japanese version but Shinji and Rei were slightly different to the American dub. Shinji was stronger more rebellious more lost more Kakkoii and Rei's voice acting was almost cute. Also the animation was excellent. The scene depicting Tokyo 3 merging underground was breathtaking. Music classical mixed with JPop was also excellent. All in all nothing is lost and a true classic is born. Ladies and gentlemen I hope you all have the chance of owning the entire film's box set in a few years time. Also slight spoiler Kaoru makes in appearance in literally the last minute of the film just to give the audience a slight tease. Oh! And after the credits which were scored with Utada Hikaru's Beautiful World a trailer of the SECOND Evangelion film is shown in which THE NEW CHARACTER a girl with glasses as well as Kaoru Asuka and Kaji are all shown. If anyone has any questions about the film or how it may be different to the series please ask. I rarely give a film 10 out of 10 Requiem for a dream Donnie Darko Paprika and Fight Club being the only others on that list but this film deserves it.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I learn that there was a remake of the classic series i asked myself what kind of mess are they getting themselves into? After the opening few moments of the movie i only said to myself how wrong was i to underestimate the decision ... because easily this could be one of the best animes ever made in history.First off years ago i was decently hooked on the TV series version. When i finished it i was honestly quiet upset that the plot was going to heck at many points not providing a decent link to things. I always liked the earlier episodes where Shinji and gang battle all the angels that attacked but i didn't quite enjoy how things were towards the end ...Death  Rebirth was a good attempt to try to provide a better ending to the series. But frankly i always felt it wasn't enough ... years later thank god we may have the best version of the Evangelion saga in the making ... starting with You Are Not Alone.Not just additional artwork and more CG enhancements are added into the movie the story summarizes the opening few episodes of the original series and this is my own opinion tweaked the script alittle. It's a lot easier to understand the plot and intention of the characters and with all the plot making more sense than the original series all you need next is the action.The fights between the angels and the Eva 01 and 00' are much more interesting to watch as the fights seem much longer and more details are added into how the battles are fought. Remember the first time Shinji pilots the EVA01 into battle and it went berserk? I'm much more excited this time when i watched the fight scene! As for the cinematic experience i don't think watching it on DVD does this movie any justice. If you can do attempt to catch this in a CINEMA because the experience is very much rewarding! I'm thankful i didn't miss this movie version it's worth every cent i paid! I don't need to go into the plot of the movie you can easily pick it up from internet sites just know that this isn't the end yet and business is going to pick up once the next one comes along. Shinji is still how everyone remembers him to be ... the hedgehog dilemma comes into mind when you talk about him and he's still like that in this movie! I hope this comment will send more people rushing into the cinema to catch this movie after i was done i felt sorry that so many seats in the cinema are empty ... everyone has missed out on this masterpiece edition of the Evangelion series!".

When the Angels attack Shinji sees the sides of people around him he never saw before.

Shinji asks her why she pilots an Evangelion and her answer is as simple and contemplative as the movie.The film is the first in a planned production of four films that reimagine the 90s series Neon Genesis Evangelion.

	schema:reviewBody "Evangelion has been a neverending cash cow for Gainax and all associated parties since it was released so it's not surprising that they've decided to go back to the well with a fourmovie revision of the original series. The new movies offer a chance to see Evangelion animated with the budget that such a famous title deserves. The fight scenes are slick and everything is well puttogether. It's not absolute top of the line animation and it hews very closely to the default anime art style but it's certainly better than the infamously lowbudget original animation.My memory of the original series is a little hazy but what's shocking about this movie is how close it sticks to the TV show. Several scenes are lineforline shotforshot reprises of scenes from the original and as far as I could tell there weren't any major changes in the plot although I think the order of the Angels might have been shuffled around a bit. The main change is tightening everything up and making it an efficient fastmoving giant robot action movie.And that's fine if your main problem with Evangelion was the lack of action but it also removes a lot of the show's style and completely eliminates its almost meditative pace. With an actual animation budget the show doesn't need animation shortcuts like the long almoststill scenes that crop up periodically but losing those makes Evangelion lose some of its definitive flavour. A lot of the moments in the movie just don't have the emotional impact that their equivalents in the TV series do  it's just one plot point after another.Evangelion 1.0 is an effective movie and retains some of the original's charm. But all the same I feel I can't really recommend it to anyone. If you've seen the TV show this will all be a retread for you. If you haven't then I would still recommend the original over this remake. The original series was far from perfect and there was a bunch of room for a new interpretation of the general story but Evangelion 1.0 chooses to play it safe and winds up being kind of forgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Shin Seiki Evangelion Neon Genesis Evangelion debuted in October 1995 no one could have predicted how much of an impact it would have on the future of Japanese animation. With its stunning animation style inventive use of graphic typography unique mecha designs and complex mythology combining JudeoChristianCatholicism and archaic mysticism Evangelion was a breath of fresh air at a time when Japanese anime had stagnated into endless remakes mediocre animation endless clich recycled story lines and dumb slapstick humor. Even its writerdirector Anno Hideaki who had remarked how he had hoped to reinvent the Japanese robot anime genre never imagined how successful this series would become and how influential it would be on all animation series to come hereafter. Produced by acclaimed animation studio Gainax in cooperation with legendary Tatsunoko Pro the studio responsible for beloved animation series such as Kagaku Ninja Gatchaman and Mach Go GoSpeed Racer the TV series revolved around the life of Ikari Shinji an angstridden manicdepressive 14 year old who is forced by a clandestine government organization led by his estranged and distant father to pilot a giant biomechanical humanoid organism against an advancing horde of powerful extraterrestrial angels to prevent the mass extermination of humankind. While the premise itself was not revolutionary and seemed to be recycled from countless other anime series of the past Anno and Gainax infused this anime with a vibrant and unique creative style that was all their own and it proved to be an instant hit with viewers. Part MTV video part psychedelic mindtrip and part anime melodrama Evangelion was like nothing viewers have seen before. The mecha designs by Yamashita Ikuto were amazingly complex and detailed and it's cast of characters designed by Sadamoto Yoshiyuki were not atypical heroic types but rather tragically flawed selfdestructive and psychologically damaged antiheroes. It had a particularly strong cast of female characters which was unique at the time and its intriguing and complex storyline seemed more akin to David Lynch's Twin Peaks or Chris Carter's XFiles than anime.The 26 episode series concluded in a rather bizarre fashion with an alternate reality segment and a confusing series of cryptic and perplexing scenes which did little to make for a satisfying conclusion or resolution to the series. The ambiguous ending left many fans unsatisfied and unhappy so much so that Anno and Gainax decided to completely redo the ending and released a trilogy of films in 1997 to appease the fans. Death of Evangelion which was a compilation of the TV seriesRebirth of Evangelion which was all new footage that occurred after Episode 24 of the series and The End of Evangelion which was a completely new retelling of the final episode were well received and garnered much fan accolades particularly with the new footage however the ending was again criticized as being too dark and nihilistic.Evangelion Shin Gekijoban Jo Evangelion The New Movie Preface AKA Evangelion 1.0 You Are Not Alone or simply Evangelion Rebuild is the second attempt by Anno and Gainax to reinvent and repackage the TV series for theatrical release. When first announced I was very doubtful and thought what was the point of retelling the same story yet again. How many different ways could Anno and company tell the same story. It recalled Tomino Yoshiyuki's influential Gundam series which spawned countless retelling of the same basic story. Thankfully these reservations went away as Evangelion 1.0 is a much more simpler evenly paced film that is a good introduction to Shinji and the chaotic world that he inhabits.Evangelion 1.0 is largely a compilation of episodes 16 of the TV series remastered and reedited much the same way as what was done in the recent Zeta Gundam A New Translation. Most of the changes occur with the inclusion of new footage and animation replacing some scenes with newer scenes done in updated CGI and tweaks to some of the story plots. Fans of the show may be quicker to pick up on the changes than those coming into the story for the first time but all can definitely appreciate the streamlined story.Perhaps the most impressive parts of the film involve the additional footage made specifically for this film. The scenes in which Tokyo3 rises from its safe harbor underground is very impressive as is a lot of the military hardware scenes and battles sequences. Unit 01's battle with Angels Four through Six are very thrilling and are an improvement from the TV series. I never did like main character Ikari Shinji Ogata Megumi whose whiny depressive and effeminate character was grating and annoying. He is very similar to Gundam's Amuro Ray but unlike Amuro his reasons for piloting Unit 01 aren't always particularly noble. The women of Evangelion are definitely the strong ones as each of the other three principals are vastly more interesting and entertaining. Katsuragi Misato Mitsuishi Kotono is both strong and commanding yet supportive and sisterly when need be. Rei Ayanami Hayashibara Megumi is certainly the fan favorite as her character is not only visually alluring but whose quiet and mysterious personality is very attractive. Fans of hotblooded firebrand Asuka Langley Soryu Miyamura Yuko will unfortunately have to wait until the next movie to see her debut. The movie unfortunately ends far too quickly and at a point just when things start to become interesting. Like the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films Evangelion will perhaps be best appreciated as a complete whole rather than individually. However as the first of four it is a grand start to what hopefully will be a great series of entertaining and exciting movies. Whether Anno and Gainax can succeed and finally deliver a satisfying resolution and ending to the series third time is a charm? is anyone's guess. Here's hoping that substance wins over style this time around.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Shin Seiki Evangelion Neon Genesis Evangelion debuted in October 1995 no one could have predicted how much of an impact it would have on the future of Japanese animation. With its stunning animation style inventive use of graphic typography unique mecha designs and complex mythology combining JudeoChristianCatholicism and archaic mysticism Evangelion was a breath of fresh air at a time when Japanese anime had stagnated into endless remakes mediocre animation endless clich recycled story lines and dumb slapstick humor. Even its writerdirector Anno Hideaki who had remarked how he had hoped to reinvent the Japanese robot anime genre never imagined how successful this series would become and how influential it would be on all animation series to come hereafter. Produced by acclaimed animation studio Gainax in cooperation with legendary Tatsunoko Pro the studio responsible for beloved animation series such as Kagaku Ninja Gatchaman and Mach Go GoSpeed Racer the TV series revolved around the life of Ikari Shinji an angstridden manicdepressive 14 year old who is forced by a clandestine government organization led by his estranged and distant father to pilot a giant biomechanical humanoid organism against an advancing horde of powerful extraterrestrial angels to prevent the mass extermination of humankind. While the premise itself was not revolutionary and seemed to be recycled from countless other anime series of the past Anno and Gainax infused this anime with a vibrant and unique creative style that was all their own and it proved to be an instant hit with viewers. Part MTV video part psychedelic mindtrip and part anime melodrama Evangelion was like nothing viewers have seen before. The mecha designs by Yamashita Ikuto were amazingly complex and detailed and it's cast of characters designed by Sadamoto Yoshiyuki were not atypical heroic types but rather tragically flawed selfdestructive and psychologically damaged antiheroes. It had a particularly strong cast of female characters which was unique at the time and its intriguing and complex storyline seemed more akin to David Lynch's Twin Peaks or Chris Carter's XFiles than anime.The 26 episode series concluded in a rather bizarre fashion with an alternate reality segment and a confusing series of cryptic and perplexing scenes which did little to make for a satisfying conclusion or resolution to the series. The ambiguous ending left many fans unsatisfied and unhappy so much so that Anno and Gainax decided to completely redo the ending and released a trilogy of films in 1997 to appease the fans. Death of Evangelion which was a compilation of the TV seriesRebirth of Evangelion which was all new footage that occurred after Episode 24 of the series and The End of Evangelion which was a completely new retelling of the final episode were well received and garnered much fan accolades particularly with the new footage however the ending was again criticized as being too dark and nihilistic.Evangelion Shin Gekijoban Jo Evangelion The New Movie Preface AKA Evangelion 1.0 You Are Not Alone or simply Evangelion Rebuild is the second attempt by Anno and Gainax to reinvent and repackage the TV series for theatrical release. When first announced I was very doubtful and thought what was the point of retelling the same story yet again. How many different ways could Anno and company tell the same story. It recalled Tomino Yoshiyuki's influential Gundam series which spawned countless retelling of the same basic story. Thankfully these reservations went away as Evangelion 1.0 is a much more simpler evenly paced film that is a good introduction to Shinji and the chaotic world that he inhabits.Evangelion 1.0 is largely a compilation of episodes 16 of the TV series remastered and reedited much the same way as what was done in the recent Zeta Gundam A New Translation. Most of the changes occur with the inclusion of new footage and animation replacing some scenes with newer scenes done in updated CGI and tweaks to some of the story plots. Fans of the show may be quicker to pick up on the changes than those coming into the story for the first time but all can definitely appreciate the streamlined story.Perhaps the most impressive parts of the film involve the additional footage made specifically for this film. The scenes in which Tokyo3 rises from its safe harbor underground is very impressive as is a lot of the military hardware scenes and battles sequences. Unit 01's battle with Angels Four through Six are very thrilling and are an improvement from the TV series. I never did like main character Ikari Shinji Ogata Megumi whose whiny depressive and effeminate character was grating and annoying.

It's great how realistic this movie and franchise is particularly with how reluctant Shinji is to pilot the Eva.I'm glad to understand the series better. What works here is the gorgeous animation. We even get all the original voice actors including Spike Spencer contribute to the film. There's no attempt to make the series modernized or anything. It's simply a faithful version of something very beloved. My favorite part is probably the final battle with the sixth angel. I don't know their names okay? I also love the scenes in Misato and Shinji's apartment as it's great to see the characters dealing with such mundane problems. 12".

The only reason I can see that someone would actually recommend this movie is if they watched the original series which I haven't seen because I can't find it anywhere in the US and just wanted to see more? Other reviews on here are saying that this movie is as good as and better than the original series and if that is true then I really don't want to try to find the original series. Animation  I've noticed a lot that people who don't watch anime are more likely to watch anime movies vs anime tv shows. I think this is because movies are sometimes more accessible for people to find and watch. A consequence of this is that people will end up watching one or two anime movies with very poor animation and then think that that is the standard for anime and call it beautiful. This anime is not beautiful a word in nearly every positive review on this site. There are a few nice shots but nothing above average and honestly a lot of it just looks generic and borderline bad. The actual animation isn't very good either. I've seen better animation in cheaply made tv shows. I've even seen better animation in much older feature length animes in case someone wants to bring up that argument where the reason why the animation wasn't that good is because its old. This anime was made in 2007. Anime movies have been around for much longer.PlotCharacters  This movie is really boring. Probably because there is no plot no character development and no world building. This movie is just a collection of scenes with barely anything connecting them. Almost nothing about how this world works is ever established and nothing about the characters is developed. Overall this movie is just a confusing collection of fight scenes and visual noise. Honestly I would've preferred exposition dumps over this disjointed mess.Sound  Yes I watched with the Japanese dub. Yes it was bad. I can't recall much music I literally just watched it before writing this review but there is a lot of stock sound effects. Also the voice acting was bad. Not that I blame the actors I wouldn't have known how to act if I was presented a horrible script like that.".

Also note i've never seen the 1995 TV series or the movies that came out shortly after that i started this show from the newly remade movies and could understand everything perfectly and follow the story flawlessly. Now its not just the story line that makes this show so amazing its a flawless combination of the absolutely stunning animation and the amazing music and sound effects. I can honestly say i think its the most amazing animated show i've ever seen. This movie also has so much emotion and attachment to all of the characters in such a short amount of time. Its really so amazing this movie gives you goose bumps and runs shivers down your spine at times. I've seen 1.11  2.22 at the time of writing this 3.33 is only subbed so i haven't seen it and 4.0 is said to air sometime this year 2015 but no air date has been set. If your a fan of post apocalypse or mecha genres then this is the god of your genre if you absolutely hate mecha i'm almost positive you'll love this just like i did everything is just so amazing. This is a much watch for any anime fan of any age! You wont regret it.55 Perfection! I don't give many things a perfect score but this blew me away in every aspect the animation the music the story line everything is just so great. And when i call this one of my favorite movies i mean the entire remake movies as a series not specifically just the first one i loved the second one just as much as the first and i have a very strong feeling i'm going to love the last two just as much as the first two.

If not spoilers abound.So yes this is basically a retelling of the original Evangelion in movie mode and it's the first of 4 movies. This first movie covers the first six episodes of the original series therefore not exactly innovative or anything shockingly interesting about the story.The art is simply fabulous. The original series already had excellent artwork for its generation and they've managed to improve it. Introduction of CG was definitely a great move and it made scenes even better especially the fighting parts. They completely redid the scene with the Angel Ramiel replacing traditional handdrawn Ramiel with CG designs. Needless to say that scene turned into absolute eyecandy. Other uses and integration of CG were more subtle such as introducing it into the graphs computer charts and background. The human character designs were sharpened a bit from the original but otherwise remained unchanged. But it was integration of CG into this remake which really stole the light.The sound remained mostly the same but they did add new sound effects most notably to the EVAs and Angels and an excellent new ending song.Characters remained virtually the same except they cut out a lot of Shinji's bitchingwhining so definitely a good move. Made the movie a lot more enjoyable as we only seen about 5 minutes of whining opposed to the half episodes of manbitching in the original series.Seeing this movie was definitely fun to watch because they basically took the original series and remade with better graphics with a few minor changes so that it's enjoyable to watch without feeling it's the same as the original series yet not different enough that it strays away from its original roots. This definitely will bring back nostalgic feelings from older fans whilst giving something new for them to watch and admire.This movie is actually a good enough retelling that a newcomer to EVA can watch this instead of the original series and will be able to know nearly everything that happened. Of course it's not really recommended seeing how it's the original that was so profound and revolutionary. After seeing this I have high hopes for the following three movies although I am a bit doubtful about the last one.".

	schema:headline " What was the purpose of this film?";
	schema:reviewBody "I knew it was supposed to be a summarized version of first quarter of the original Evangelion TV series but I expected more new scenes or at least major difference in every scene like the Doraemon remake Nobita no kyry 2006 Nobita's Dinosaur 2006. The animation retains the original 1995 style and definitely more detailed compared to anything made in the '90s but nothing remarkable compared to most other 2007 anime films. Practically all scenes are produced using the original storyboard and layouts devoid of any new camera angles or cuts. In fact it's better to prepare yourself for a digitally remastered recap release than anything new. TVanimeOVA and theatrical features work on completely different level of budgets and deadlines. Animation quality in this film is soso at best in movie standards. The new 3D Angels especially Ramiel were protrusive against the 2D cel animation in the background.I have only watched the TV series twice when it was aired in 1995 missed 3 or 4 episodes and once more in 2003. For me it was a carbon copy of the TV series except a few new scenes of mechanical aspects of New Tokyo 3 and the teaser in last 30 seconds of the film. Other than slight improvement in graphics which I can barely notice because my eyes are used to much better animation in recent years I have detected no difference in 98 of the screen time. What I'm trying to say is that I wasted 100 minutes of my life watching a long rerun.To be honest I didn't like the TV series at all. I enjoyed the first few episodes as I did for many Japanese mecha series but they focused too much on Ikari Shinji's hesitation and despair in piloting Eva after that point. I watched this film in hope that maybe I was too young to fully appreciate this series back then and enjoy more this time but even after 26 episodes and a rerun movie Ikari Shinji only seems nothing more than a really dumb and weak kid who likes to exaggerate his emotions all the time. It was frustrating to watch and in the end the only thing I gained from watching this 'movie' was a 30 second teaser for the upcoming sequel.Maybe anime otakus who watched the TV series over and over can spot subtle differences and get a kick out of it but for a casual anime viewer like me it was a 100 minute long rerun. It wasn't even a movie. I don't understand why the producers felt the need to make this socalled cinematic release other than reviving a dead franchise for the sole purpose of making more money.Frankly I am very shocked and disappointed to see this socalled movie's comments on IMDb were all rave reviews. I hope I Am Not Alone in this sentiment.".

	onyx:emotionText "I knew it was supposed to be a summarized version of first quarter of the original Evangelion TV series but I expected more new scenes or at least major difference in every scene like the Doraemon remake Nobita no kyry 2006 Nobita's Dinosaur 2006. The animation retains the original 1995 style and definitely more detailed compared to anything made in the '90s but nothing remarkable compared to most other 2007 anime films. Practically all scenes are produced using the original storyboard and layouts devoid of any new camera angles or cuts. In fact it's better to prepare yourself for a digitally remastered recap release than anything new. TVanimeOVA and theatrical features work on completely different level of budgets and deadlines. Animation quality in this film is soso at best in movie standards. The new 3D Angels especially Ramiel were protrusive against the 2D cel animation in the background.I have only watched the TV series twice when it was aired in 1995 missed 3 or 4 episodes and once more in 2003. For me it was a carbon copy of the TV series except a few new scenes of mechanical aspects of New Tokyo 3 and the teaser in last 30 seconds of the film. Other than slight improvement in graphics which I can barely notice because my eyes are used to much better animation in recent years I have detected no difference in 98 of the screen time.

There was one CG moment with an Eva in an elevator I didn't like I can't tell you how glad I am they didn't use CG sequences for the Evas and angels! but the crayfishlike limb fluttering of Shamshel and Ramiel's shapeshifting were great. I can't wait to see Sahaquiel and Leliel! Storywise it is nearly identical to the show albeit in a compressed form. Most of what's lost is comedic sequences and Shinji's interactions with his classmates. A few elements are ignored how exactly do Shinji's classmates know he is an Eva pilot? and the scene where Shinji sees Unit 01's eye is sadly missing. Though it is still shown the symbolism of Shinji going back and forth between tracks 25 and 26 of his music are lost given that there is no longer episodes 25 and 26 or the controversy surrounding them in this version.However hints that possibly big changes are to come occur when about 34 through Misato takes Shinji to see...something...even the audience hadn't seen until far into the series and at the end when Kaworu shows up though this does not mean he will enter immediately in the next part we'll have to wait and see. Overall simply great I loved it. However you probably shouldn't warm up by watching the show right beforehand because it is SO similar you might get bored.".

	schema:headline " Argentine realities";
	schema:reviewBody "Rulo the middle aged man at the center of this story has to deal with all the present realities his country is going through. His friend Torres is instrumental in finding him a job in a building project as a crane operator. He must pass a medical examination that reveals he is suffering from a strange disorder that keeps him awake after awakening for any reason at night and he is overweight.This man has a son Claudio that like most of the Argentine youths don't seem to have a clear future. He has a rock band but he sponges from his father whatever the older man can afford to give him. Rulo who is somewhat proud of what Caludio is trying to achieve because he himself had his own musical group in the 60s and was a minor celebrity. That is quite a contrast from the present circumstances.Adriana the owner of a small kiosk where Rulo goes to get his lunch feels an attraction for him. She remembers the band and how she used to follow him in her youth. Nothing comes out of this possible relationship because Rulo after a month of working in the building loses the job because of the medical report. Torres his friend tells him to go South to Comodoro Rivadavia where his friend Santori will give him a chance. That of course seems to be the end for Adriana and Rulo as she lets him know when he is ready to depart.Rulo's luck runs out even in that remote spot when labor troubles at the place where he is working. He is once more defeated and calls his mother. He doesn't want to tell her the truth but as he asks for Claudio who by now is living with the grandmother Rulo reveals the truth and that he has to come back to Buenos Aires again defeated.Pablo Trapero's Crane World has a look that reminds us of Italian Neorealism. The film is shot in black and white. Mr. Trapero uses improvisation with excellent results. The actors used with a few exceptions are people from his neighborhood in Buenos Aires. The places that were used are authentic and that's why the film has such an impact because it feels real. One marvels at this director who was able to put together an important film with so little yet the picture is true of the Argentina after the excess of the Menen regime where practically all the industry had been sold to multinationals and the middle class of the country a majority suddenly saw themselves move a few notches down in the economic ladder.Best of the film is the great contribution Luis Margani brought to the film. We believe he is Rulo from the moment he first open his mouth. For being a non professional actor Mr. Margani carries the film on the strength of his magnificent performance. Equally appealing is Adriana Aizemberg an actress that is another natural. Her Adriana is devoid of mannerisms matching the style of Mr. Margani. They make a wonderful bittersweet couple that must deal with reality to keep on living yet they are not embittered by what life has given them. Daniel Valenzuela Rolly Serrano Graciela Chironi and Federico Esquerro make valuable contributions under Pablo Trapero's direction.Crane World is a slice of life as seen from Pablo Trapero a director who shows great integrity and presents us with his reality.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rulo the middle aged man at the center of this story has to deal with all the present realities his country is going through. His friend Torres is instrumental in finding him a job in a building project as a crane operator. He must pass a medical examination that reveals he is suffering from a strange disorder that keeps him awake after awakening for any reason at night and he is overweight.This man has a son Claudio that like most of the Argentine youths don't seem to have a clear future. He has a rock band but he sponges from his father whatever the older man can afford to give him. Rulo who is somewhat proud of what Caludio is trying to achieve because he himself had his own musical group in the 60s and was a minor celebrity. That is quite a contrast from the present circumstances.Adriana the owner of a small kiosk where Rulo goes to get his lunch feels an attraction for him. She remembers the band and how she used to follow him in her youth. Nothing comes out of this possible relationship because Rulo after a month of working in the building loses the job because of the medical report. Torres his friend tells him to go South to Comodoro Rivadavia where his friend Santori will give him a chance. That of course seems to be the end for Adriana and Rulo as she lets him know when he is ready to depart.Rulo's luck runs out even in that remote spot when labor troubles at the place where he is working. He is once more defeated and calls his mother. He doesn't want to tell her the truth but as he asks for Claudio who by now is living with the grandmother Rulo reveals the truth and that he has to come back to Buenos Aires again defeated.Pablo Trapero's Crane World has a look that reminds us of Italian Neorealism. The film is shot in black and white. Mr. Trapero uses improvisation with excellent results. The actors used with a few exceptions are people from his neighborhood in Buenos Aires. The places that were used are authentic and that's why the film has such an impact because it feels real. One marvels at this director who was able to put together an important film with so little yet the picture is true of the Argentina after the excess of the Menen regime where practically all the industry had been sold to multinationals and the middle class of the country a majority suddenly saw themselves move a few notches down in the economic ladder.Best of the film is the great contribution Luis Margani brought to the film. We believe he is Rulo from the moment he first open his mouth. For being a non professional actor Mr. Margani carries the film on the strength of his magnificent performance. Equally appealing is Adriana Aizemberg an actress that is another natural. Her Adriana is devoid of mannerisms matching the style of Mr. Margani. They make a wonderful bittersweet couple that must deal with reality to keep on living yet they are not embittered by what life has given them. Daniel Valenzuela Rolly Serrano Graciela Chironi and Federico Esquerro make valuable contributions under Pablo Trapero's direction.Crane World is a slice of life as seen from Pablo Trapero a director who shows great integrity and presents us with his reality.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director Pablo Trapero's film 'Mundo Gra' inquires whether one is really on top of the world merely by sitting in a crane which is used to construct sky scrapers ? The answer is in negative as one is on top of the world only if heshe has a respectable job which enables people to lead decent lives. For this film Argentine actor Luis Margani is excellent as his acting performance makes us wonder how fast the lines between fiction and reality have blurred. Cobi Migliora's black and white photography does wonders to depict an honest account of the life in Buenos Aires. It is said that family is the unit which ties humanity. This is also the case with the protagonist whose immediate family is always around him in the form of a wayward son and an anxious old mother. Mundo Gra is one of the most original films to have come out of New Argentine Cinema. It depicts how severely ordinary people are affected by employment crisis. Their plight is further worsened when there is no guarantee that they would be provided with decent meals on different construction sites located all over Argentina. The viewers get to see how choices have to be made by ordinary people in order to be alive. Despite its serious theme this film does not lose focus even while depicting scenes of humor.".

The characters buildings and vehicles could belong in the 70s or early 80s. Only later did it dawn on me that the story takes place during the tough Argentine economic crisis of the late 90s and early 00s. The film shares a visual look with some early Scorcese work although its social theme is perhaps more reminiscent of the Italian neorealist films of the 40s and 50s.Crane World also reminds me a bit of Five Easy Pieces with Jack Nicholson which also deals with a sensitive musician who puts his music aside in order to work in construction even if the circumstances surrounding their main characters are very different. Unlike Robert Dupea Nicholson's role in Five Easy Pieces Crane World's Rulo has a beautiful sense of humor and doesn't take himself terribly seriously. He's a dreamer confronted by reality but also an every day man navigating life as fluidly as he can. As the going gets tough he makes an effort to keep his chin up and find serenity within his struggle.The film doesn't provide big explosions or fireworks. It's a quiet and very elegant piece of work. What consistently amazes about it from start to finish is how natural and spontaneous it feels. One might as well be watching a documentary or be dreaming.Unfortunately for nonSpanish speakers some of the magic will be lost in translation. Much of the melody comes from the Argentine dialogue that the actors produce so effortlessly. Still there's no good reason to miss this touchingly eloquent jewel. I can only wonder why it's not better known.".

New opera is incredibly expensive to produce  costs might run close to a million yet tickets cost more than a trip to the cinema  and many people prefer to see wellknown operas rather than new works. So can cinema be an outlet for emerging operatic talent? And does it work as cinema? Johanna is a reworking of the story of Joan of Arc. In this modern 'version' she is a patient in a Budapest hospital and also turns out to be a drug addict. Having saved her from a terrible road accident the staff realise she has nowhere to go but a young doctor is attracted to her and persuades the hospital to keep her on as a nurse if he trains her up. Soon she is performing miraculous cures  achieved largely it seems by having sex with the male patients. They recognise her saintly healing gifts but also brand her a whore. She says she does what she does sacrificing her body to save others out of pure love. The doctor suitor says he loves her and she should love only him but she retorts that he does not know what love is.From a cinematic point of view an immediate advantage of opera is that we do not complain about plot holes or lack of realism  that is not unusual in opera  if it makes conceptual or symbolic sense that is usually enough. A downside is that even in the best of auditoriums the purity of the sound quality does not quite equal that of an opera house. So how do we justify the transition to the screen? Is the spirit of the opera better conveyed? Polanski's transition from Shakespeare's theatre for instance evokes a realism the sense of mud and filth in a rainsodden Scottish countryside that would be impossible on stage. The opening scenes of Johanna look promising the dark and eerie setting of the oldfashioned hospital the ghostly pallor of the patients in the dismal setting. But soon it becomes clear that the lack of visual lustre is more about budget than choice. Most filmmakers for instance would have given visual emphasis to her first hit of morphine as she embraces the drug but we are left to imagine her inner exhilaration as we would have to if it were a stage opera. Subtitles are also low quality and not always easy to read. Where the film really comes into its own however is when the revelation of Johanna's divine mission becomes clear amidst contrasting scenes of light and dark. We recall the large amounts of exposed breasts earlier in the film that lead to the doctor's infatuation  an obsession romanticised into 'love' and full of jealousy and moral selfrighteousness. The tragedy of divine goodness hiding within the lowliest form gains momentum and  as in all good operas  proceeds to its inevitable climax.By the end of the film the forces of good and evil have become strongly polarised the 'good' doctors sing of how they will 'praise' her once she is out of their way. The rebuffed doctor arms himself with two needles like the arms of a cross  is he going to drugrape her? kill her? frighten her?  he becomes symbolic of the Christian Church that controls the eros within its faithful by worship of abstinence and conjugal rights just as she becomes symbolic of true love to all mankind philia to which her sexuality becomes subservient.The remarkable thing about Johanna a new experimental opera written directly for the screen Zsofia Taller is that it works at all. As an opera it works brilliantly. As a film it just about proves its point.".

If not then perhaps you might find that you can appreciate it as a one off. Whether that is a good or a bad thing I suppose is up to the viewer.The lead actress Orsi Toth is absolutely stunning in this film. Her performance was uncomfortable emotive and surprising.

But in my humble opinion it's not worth throwing the baby out with the bathwater.If you can get past the fact that 1 it's an opera 2 it's sung very beautifully in Hungarian and 3there's naked old men singing about liver failure..you might actually enjoy this film. If not then perhaps you might find that you can appreciate it as a one off. Whether that is a good or a bad thing I suppose is up to the viewer.The lead actress Orsi Toth is absolutely stunning in this film. Her performance was uncomfortable emotive and surprising. I look forward to seeing her in future films.";

	schema:headline " Probably the greatest hospital based Hungarian language operatic Christ allegoryridden musical that's ever been made.";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems the football match some of the elderly patients watch on television whilst based at the Hungarian hospital within which 2005 feature Johanna is set was in fact real. They observe Romanian striker Marius Niculae's goal in the fifth minute FIFA.com have it credited after four the match was against the watching Hungarians and ended two to nothing in favour of the Romanians in their capital city of Bucharest thus dating that particular scene on the second day of 2001's June. It's a wacky way to begin a written response to a film but just where DO you start with Kornl Mundrucz's adventurous dizzying somewhat nauseating but eye opening musical Johanna? Littered with style substance I think offthewall content and sheer madness there will be few who'll have seen this Cannes nominated 2005 piece and even fewer who'll have forgotten it after having seen it. Quite how the pitch for the film went I'll never know but it is a mostly unforgettable avantgard fuelled trip into a barren and bleak world of all things medical and allegorical.The titular Johanna is played by young Hungarian actress Orsolya Tth her involvement in a road accident giving her a severe bout of amnesia whilst being treated at a local hospital her newfound existence following this accident a severely disjointed and disconnected period of living as she occupies a place seemingly cut off from the rest of the real world. Is she alive? Is she dead? Is anyone? Did she transfer to Hell after death? Is it Heaven? Purgatory? Perhaps she died and was reincarnated as the Second Coming what with all her newfound powers. Is it all a dream? Director Mundrucz has fun toying with us disorientating the audience with as many low budgeted tricks as he can and providing us with a plethora of scenes and sequences designed to instill confusion and on occasion just a sickly sensation.Mundrucz shoots the locale of the hospital as if it were underground with most of the scenes seemingly having been shot in pitch black following the taping of a battery powered torch to the top of the camera's lens and switched on for filming. The result is an odd sense of being in a place no one knows of a place no one sees unless summoned to and with a real air of bleakness and hopelessness dominating the air. My guess is most of the film's budget is used in the opening sequence a slow track following a bus crash and explosion in a public Hungarian street as emergency services arrive setting exactly the sort of tone for what the film isn't in any shape or form about. The eerie pained sense or atmosphere of agony Mundrucz has his film instilled with makes itself known fairly early on the credits coming up over a static shot of a medical kit as we hear all those bleeps and noises associated with electronic medical machinery. Off screen dozens off people lie injured but our admittance as to being able to see their aid is denied despite a certain desperate sense of longing to see some kind of help in operation.The survivors are taken to a nearby hospital a doctor by way of a long take breezes down a dimly lit corridor in which the lighting frequently cuts out perhaps disguising the film's edits. Each victim he encounters is gradually more injured until he arrives at the final patient whom is obviously the worst for wear out the bunch the sequence effectively establishing a sense of by way of a doctor's moving physicality progression onto things that are more disfigured and nasty as we progress thus echoing how the film itself branches out. The moment the rug is pulled out from under us as we attempt to identify who's who and where the film might lead us having started out with a road crash aftermath before venturing to a place of aid for recovery is the moment everyone in the hospital gets up out of their ward beds having finished the drill and breaking into song. The rug is pulled we are flat on our backs and we don't really get back up again until after the film has finished. Johanna seemingly stays injured though the tests they administer to her and the time she spends there resulting in nothing bar a new existence as a nurse to go along with a sensational gift of being able to cure elderly men of their illnesses by having sexual intercourse with them.It's here most people will point out the film's predominant ingredients are sex and death. Welsh born filmmaker Peter Greenaway is quoted on the IMDb to have said There are basically only two subject matters in all Western culture sex and death. We do have some ability to manipulate sex nowadays. We have no ability and never will have to manipulate death. Johanna whilst a Hungarian film which you'd be within your right to classify as of an Eastern ilk toys with the prospect of using sex as a means of doing exactly that and manipulating death so as to essentially avoid it. For how long the film is unspecific if people are in fine health an hour after the opening bus crash then it might be for eternity. A love plot enters proceedings towards the end Johanna remaining firm and sleeping with as many ill patients as possible so as to cure them but refusing to bow to a resident doctor's approaches. Mundrucz sees the humour in the whole thing the line Let's all rush to the Urology department sung therein garnering raised eyebrows but smirks. The omnipresent juxtaposition of the characters' orchestral singing with the morguelike locale of the hospital is probably a little too effective at times with the overall result a just about watchable musical about enough to make the 86 minute runtime seem longer than it is and I mean that in the nicest possible way.".

The woman starts to treat the terminally ill men in an unusual manner which is not received well by the doctors ending the whole situation in the sacrifice of Johanna with a chorus reciting the moral of the story.The set is a real hospital called the Hospital in the Rock and was built under the Buda castle in the thirties  it is terrifying and marvelous in the same time and can work very well as an opera set also note that Terey and Mundruczo already used it for theatrical plays before. Johanna as a character is a profane saint what she does is obscene but does work  curing with sexuality like in Breaking the Waves Trier. The camera work and the degradation of the film material is also similar to Trier's think of Medeia for example and has similar conclusions both saints are discarded while their powers defeat rationality.In an age of technology the deeply maternal and spiritual rituals are banished from our life the fall of Johanna is inevitable from the very moment she decides to stay among the terminally ill. The paternalistic hospital with all the male patients who will not save the girl in the end and the male doctors aided by their superiority and academic knowledge destroy the unknown female power they kill her discard her and burn her banishing her from this world.

I tend to put art films towards the right part of the spectrum meaning the good part so to speak. This one however I must place at the left extreme of the spectrum along with trash such as what you might expect from a film titled something like Jesse James Meets Terry and the Pirates just made that up. The lines are all sung kind of like in lulls in between arias of an opera only there are no arias. Just the same sound over and over and over. There is a certain arty ugliness to this hospital so ugly that I thought the film would redeem itself if I sit there long enough and not give up. What is the story like? Since my review is directed at those who have not seen it yet I will just be metaphoric. Think of being swallowed by a huge pig. You get bitten up in the mouth gulped down the esophagus churned around in the stomach reduced to mash in the intestines and whatever is left gets dumped out his rear end. Halfway into this you are convinced that there is some good to all this ugliness though we know the world for some of us many of us? is a bad place and we wind up in the burn pile. That's the story and I don't think my metaphor has spoiled anything. If after reading the other reviews you must see it then I suggest you spend as little as possible of your hardearned money and watch for say 10 minutes or so. If you like it by then enjoy the rest but if not  it won't get better. The one thing I got out of it all particularly after reading its history and the other reviews is the realization more than ever before that there are those who laud something as art for having been placed into the art category. I don't know if my review will do anyone any good. Very few who read the review titled awful considered that review helpful so I wrote a longer review. I like to write helpful reviews. If you do see it and find it awful you might give us naysayers a thumbs up to give us credibility which may prompt others to watch something else instead. Having read the reviews for this film I had expectation of a worthwhile art film but found in my honest opinion a monstrosity all 82 minutes of it. Oh and I almost forgot. Sex is suggested more than actual. What little nudity there is is rather ugly. It is a hospital after all.".

Halfway into this you are convinced that there is some good to all this ugliness though we know the world for some of us many of us? is a bad place and we wind up in the burn pile. That's the story and I don't think my metaphor has spoiled anything. If after reading the other reviews you must see it then I suggest you spend as little as possible of your hardearned money and watch for say 10 minutes or so. If you like it by then enjoy the rest but if not  it won't get better. The one thing I got out of it all particularly after reading its history and the other reviews is the realization more than ever before that there are those who laud something as art for having been placed into the art category. I don't know if my review will do anyone any good. Very few who read the review titled awful considered that review helpful so I wrote a longer review. I like to write helpful reviews. If you do see it and find it awful you might give us naysayers a thumbs up to give us credibility which may prompt others to watch something else instead. Having read the reviews for this film I had expectation of a worthwhile art film but found in my honest opinion a monstrosity all 82 minutes of it. Oh and I almost forgot. Sex is suggested more than actual. What little nudity there is is rather ugly. It is a hospital after all.";

In fact I refused to be taken for granted by clever Hollywood people who usually produce very sweet and educative movies. Well a couple of years later while I was refurbishing my own movie collection I stumbled on a special LaserDisc sale and bought this one as well just to see what all the fuzz about it was really about. First of all I was amazed to know that it is based on a true story just like Lean on me and what caught my attention was that the teacher in question didn't belong to that profession she was a discharged and unemployed USMC officer. I expected a war between her and the pupils she would drill. What I received in return was an education on how one can be prejudiced in more than just one way... Having served in the Swiss Army and having been a teacher myself I could really empathize with the Character played by Michelle Pfeiffer. My first teaching approach unlike hers was disastrous to say the least... The entire movie deals with LITTLE REAL EVERYDAY problems and not with the big issues of life and this is probably why this movie was summarily discarded as being second rate. But when we consider how children consider and perceive our world nowadays it's exactly what they expect us the adults to do as well. That's to say take our time to explain to them the everyday happenings in their little worlds. Why mom and dad went their separate ways why do they have to cope with homework they cannot understand and so on and so forth. This movie is a teaching lesson for teachers not a moralizing or preachy one. It shows us how it should be done nothing more. In Drama one says less is more why shouldn't it apply to life? We always want to set standards and a higher example to the students we are supposed to tutor but what about our commitment to give them what they really want lend them an ear when they talk a heart when they feel sorrow and sometimes when required a firm authority to look up to? Many colleagues I have met have forgotten what teaching is all about. It's not a simple profession to earn your life it's much more than this it's a mission a passion a drive a call just like the one an actor or a director have. In this instance in my own opinion Dangerous Minds has amply achieved its goals. For the detractors of this tiny movie I would suggest to take a better and closer look they might still learn something... But please take your time and concentrate on it. This is really not a Popcorn and Beer movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dangerous Minds has often been accused by critics as being too preachy whilst failing to highlight sensitive and often difficult personal issues and situations the pupils at school were facing themselves. Yet this is a film which is anything but that. This wasn't just about a teacher trying to achieve and maintain trust from her so called 'troublesome' students but it attempted to delve into the efforts LouAnne Johnston makes to achieve what's best for the teenagers and to get the best out of them as possible. Dangerous Minds is not a film of which tells teachers how they ought to do their jobs but rather it emphasises the types of issues the students and LouAnne embark on in their lives.When LouAnne first enters the classroom she is met by a chorus of boos chaos and anarchy by the students they don't like her and they all think that she isn't any different from the other teachers in the school. They are often rude inyerface and disobedient. Eventually though she wins them over by being compassionate fair and caring but at the same time instilling tough discipline and tough love and warranting respect without having to patronise or judge those students of which they return the favour. She also shares with them the personal hurdles obstacles and difficulties she had to overcome and face thus she shows herself up to be somebody the kids could relate to because she has been through exactly the same types of struggles they have gone through and are going through themselves.Personally Michelle Phieffer gives a good performance in her role as LouAnne and whilst it isn't up there with her very best she is very convincing throughout. Considering how much this film was trashed by so many people the truth nevertheless is that there are certain efforts which strike a chord with viewers and touching them in ways that inspire thought understanding and empathy on their part and Dangerous Minds is one of them. It also helped considering this is based on a true story and so a lot of what takes place within and outside of the academic environment rings a lot of truth. The socalled teacher as heroineconcept of the movie is approached in an almost realistic dark and serious matter but not in a way that puts viewers off.All in all this is a very good movie that is not afraid of portraying the gritty and tough suburban outlooks of inner city school life as seen through the eyes of the pupils themselves and Louanne Johnston herself. Dangerous Minds is at times challenging and throughprovoking and whereas it can often be a tad preachy it still packs a mean punch.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some movies are for laughter some are for thrills while Dangerous Minds is for life lessons. This movie takes the viewers into the ghetto neighborhood of AfricanAmerican Latino and the lower class. It takes place at a high school where an exmarine Louanne Johnson Michelle Pfeiffer becomes a teacher from an invitation by a friendteacher that teaches at that school. After a terrible reception from the students she tries unconventional methods of teaching using Bob Dylan lyrics friendship and attention and gets the trust of her students. After handing out an assignment she rewarded the top three students with the most effort and best mark to a dinner with her to an up scaled restaurant. Louanne started realizing how education was too much for some students to handle because their in a life struggle. It forced some students dropped out of school with so much frustration in their lives because of trying to study education and keep up with life. But others saw it as an inspiration and determination to keep on studying and educating themselves because of Louanne's teaching. I am a huge fan of Michelle Pfeiffer's acting and think she put a terrific performance like the usual. But this time it was the theme message of the movie that really interested me. I got to experiment the life of how teenagers are struggling in life and trying to take education seriously. However the movie shows that determination inspiration and dignity motivate us to achieve goals in school and also in life. The movie's soundtrack called Gangster's Paradise by Coolie copied from the original song by Stevie Wonder Past Time Paradise fits in very well with the movie. The lyrics are meaningful explaining that education is an option rather then a priority in a struggle life. In my opinion this movie deserves 8 out of 10. The movie reveals that life is about love hate fear and strength and that determination and dignity passes us all in life.".

The impact that a good teacher can create in their students and the alert to the need for more talented teachers and committed to building citizens and righteous humans. The school principal and Carla are probably allegorical characters of narcissistic society we live in.

The impact that a good teacher can create in their students and the alert to the need for more talented teachers and committed to building citizens and righteous humans. The school principal and Carla are probably allegorical characters of narcissistic society we live in.

Anyway the book further misrepresents the school.  Yes it is a  fairly middle to upper middle class area where less economically disadvantaged kids get bused in from EPA east Palo Alto yes unfortunately as in most of our society it tends to be split on racial lines.  However a. our school looks like concrete bunkers I heard they filmed Burlingame High.  b. We've never had metal detectors for guns  such.  Our school is not some innercity LA school like it was portrayed in the film. Granted I experienced the high school from a relatively privelleged side of it I don't know what that special program that the film concentrates on was like.  And for a lot of those kids their life in EPA was comparable to the stories you hear of innercityEast LA kinda life. It's like any movie where you know the real story. Those who don't know the schoolarea would probably like it since they don't see the errors.

	schema:reviewBody "The famous and invaluable diamond known as the Pink Panther is stolen once again from the museum in Lugash and the authorities decide immediately that to effect the return of this National Treasure they must seek the help of the one man they know will bring the needed expertise to the case Clouseau.  And so it is that The Return Of The Pink Panther' is entrusted to none other than the inimitable Inspector Peter Sellers from France much to the chagrin of Chief Inspector Dreyfus Herbert Lom who knowing what unbridled mayhem Clouseau is really capable of would like nothing more than to be rid of him once and for all.  But such a request from the sovereign authorities of a friendly nation cannot be denied and Clouseau is therefore dispatched with all haste to Lugash with orders to bring the criminals to justice and insure that the case is indeed to quote Clouseau solved.' Some ten years had passed since director Blake Edwards and Sellers had teamed up for the brilliant film A Shot In The Dark' before coming together once again for this third installment chronicling the misadventures of the beloved' Inspector Clouseau.  But the wait was certainly worth it. Cleverly written and delivered it affords Sellers ample opportunities to do what he does best  Make you laugh.  Whether affecting an alias in disguise or forthrightly confronting the usual suspects Clouseau deftly uncovers every ploy' attempted by the unscrupulous thieves he seeks.  There are moments so hilarious that even costar Catherine Schell Claudine has trouble keeping a straight face at times but rather than being a distraction as you'd think it would be it somehow makes it even funnier. And it's a great example of why this movie is so good and why it works so well.  Simply put it's fun.  Edwards has a formula for success that begins with having a good story at the core an excellent supporting cast to flesh it all out then mixing it all together with the main ingredient which is of course Sellers.  It's one that works and of which directors of some of the more recent fare being proffered as comedy' could benefit. Christopher Plummer is well cast as debonair master thief Sir Charles Litton bringing an air of sophistication to the film that contrasts so well with the antics of Sellers.  Characters returning after debuting in A Shot In The Dark' include the terrific Lom whose Chief Inspector Dreyfus is the perfect foil for Clouseau Andre Maranne Francois and of course Burt Kwouk as Clouseau's everattacking manservant Cato.  The scenes between Sellers and Kwouk in which they spar at Clouseau's house are a riot as is the way Sellers and Lom play off of one another throughout the film or the series for that matter Lom's reactions' alone to what Sellers is doing are classic bits of comedy. Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Arne Colonel Sharky Peter Jeffrey General Wadafi Gregoire Aslan Chief of Lugash Police Victor Spinetti Hotel Concierge and John Bluthal Blind Beggar.  A number of elements go into making a comedy work and The Return Of The Pink Panther' has them all but most especially Peter Sellers who without a doubt is one of the funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen.  His comedy works because he always plays it straight and allows the humor to flow naturally from the situation at hand there's never a laugh that is forced or false. Consider one of the opening scenes in which Clouseau walking a beat questions a blind beggar with a monkey about having the proper permits to beg all while the bank in front of which they are standing is being robbed. There's a purity about it that makes it a joy to watch the kind of film you can see over and over again and never get tired of.  One of the great things about video and DVD is that it affords us the opportunity of cuing up this film as well as the other Panther' movies at will.  For a lot of laughs take advantage of the technology at hand and check out Peter Sellers and discover what classic' comedy is all about.  It never gets old and somehow just keeps getting better with age.  I rate this one 910.".

It is in true slapstick style that we see Clouseau bumble through one laugh out loud situation to another in trying to solve the case. Standout scenes include Clouseau going to Charle's Lytton's home posing as a telephone repair man a runaway vacuum cleaner a fantastic escape by Charles Lytton from some thugs.

To follow was The Pink Panther Strikes Again and Revenge Of The Pink Panther. I say trilogy because of course 'Revenge' saw Sellers' last outing before his premature death.This film is a refreshing return to the roots of the original with Closeau on the trail of the PP diamond after it is once again stolen by the infamous Phantom.  The Phantom's alterego Sir Charles Webb Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven is naturally assusmed to be the culprit but he is in fact innocent and so joins in the search.Steve from the first page is spot on with his review of the film.  It is slow and quite dismal when Sellers is not on screen and the subplot involving Sir Charles is weak and uninteresting which was not the case with Niven in the original but nevertheless Plummer is an inspired choice for the role.  Actually the whole story isn't really clear or upfront just Sellers at his best.  And when he is on the screen its gleaming with hilarity with a genius at play.The result is a comedy which has its obvious flaws but also one which has many many memorable and riproaring laughs.  Return Of The Pink Panther is an irrestible treat and a mustsee.  I'm just having trouble figuring out which is better  this or Strikes Again.  They're both great!".

	schema:reviewBody "Return of the Pink Panther 1975Complete with the great Mancini sax theme the nutty smart Blake Edwards directing the sassy cartoon panther himself and of course Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau taking on many absurd disguises. This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini Sellers or Edwards and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yesit did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012?Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that like Chaplin rise above their time. But of course Sellers as terrific as he was was no Charles Chaplin. At his best the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters including the leading woman who is totally a late 60s type not a 1975 type and she feels oddly unnecessary don't command their parts or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery sort of of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. The Pink Panther is the original and at times also a bit sluggish but it's the first. And A Shot in the Dark is the best of the three I think. But if you like them you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any you might go in order since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward but decent third.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although it's already Peter Sellers' third outing in the series The Return of the Pink Panther sets the tone for all of the Pink Panther movies still to come. Fast furious wacky and hilarious.In fact this movie is in many respects the movie the first should have been. The plot once again revolves around the Pink Panther diamond. The chief suspect is once again Sir Charles The Phantom Lytton. And of course Peter Sellers is once again on the case as the oneofakind Jacques Clouseau.Class act David Niven has been replaced by the equally classy Christopher Plummer Murder by Decree The Sound of Music Dragnet. His portrayal of Sir Charles is more dashing and youthful than Niven's. In this film his character is also more likable simply because he's working alongside Clouseau rather than against him.And Inspector Clouseau the underdog is now finally the hero. He's been demoted to bumbling Parisian street cop by his slightly crooked boss Chief Inspector Dreyfus played hilariously for the second time by Herbert Lom. Then the president of Lugash specifically requests Clouseau be restated in order to find the Pink Panther diamond which has been stolen from a museum. The return of the Pink Panther diamond is Clouseau's responsibility.The film is divided between Clouseau's quest to find Sir Charles whom he blames for the Panther's disappearance and Sir Charles' quest to find the Panther and by doing so clear his name. Clouseau's adventure is filled with more slapstick than in either of the previous two films and good slapstick at that. Peter Sellers plays Clouseau in the way that only he could with results that are guaranteed to make any comedy fan laugh. Meanwhile Sir Charles' side of the story is filled with action and international intrigue in a plot that's absurd and confusing but to be expected from a Pink Panther film. Graham Stark who played Clouseau's partner in A Shot in the Dark now appears as Sir Charles' putupon underworld informant.All is finally right with the Pink Panther universe. Sir Charles is finally likable. It's okay to empathize towards Clouseau. And there's humor in the romantic catandmouse game between Sir Charles' new bride and Clouseau. Lady Lytton is played by Catherine Schell On Her Majesty's Secret Service and is interestingly enough not the exMrs. Clouseau one of the earliest cracks in the series' fragile continuity. However it's amusing to see Lady Lytton take advantage of Clouseau and those around her whereas in the first movie it just seemed unfair when Clouseau's wife treated him the same way.".

In this film his character is also more likable simply because he's working alongside Clouseau rather than against him.And Inspector Clouseau the underdog is now finally the hero. He's been demoted to bumbling Parisian street cop by his slightly crooked boss Chief Inspector Dreyfus played hilariously for the second time by Herbert Lom. Then the president of Lugash specifically requests Clouseau be restated in order to find the Pink Panther diamond which has been stolen from a museum. The return of the Pink Panther diamond is Clouseau's responsibility.The film is divided between Clouseau's quest to find Sir Charles whom he blames for the Panther's disappearance and Sir Charles' quest to find the Panther and by doing so clear his name. Clouseau's adventure is filled with more slapstick than in either of the previous two films and good slapstick at that. Peter Sellers plays Clouseau in the way that only he could with results that are guaranteed to make any comedy fan laugh. Meanwhile Sir Charles' side of the story is filled with action and international intrigue in a plot that's absurd and confusing but to be expected from a Pink Panther film. Graham Stark who played Clouseau's partner in A Shot in the Dark now appears as Sir Charles' putupon underworld informant.All is finally right with the Pink Panther universe. Sir Charles is finally likable. It's okay to empathize towards Clouseau. And there's humor in the romantic catandmouse game between Sir Charles' new bride and Clouseau. Lady Lytton is played by Catherine Schell On Her Majesty's Secret Service and is interestingly enough not the exMrs. Clouseau one of the earliest cracks in the series' fragile continuity. However it's amusing to see Lady Lytton take advantage of Clouseau and those around her whereas in the first movie it just seemed unfair when Clouseau's wife treated him the same way.";

Clouseau goes back on the case as does Sir Charles Lytton Christopher Plummer taking over for David Niven the former Phantom himself.  Anyway this movie shows the progress of the Panther franchise when the crazy characters and Clouseau's wacky mannerisms start to really show.

	schema:reviewBody "This film compares favorably to SO much that hits the screen nowadays that it's well worth seeing also it's a key part of the rest of the Pink Panther 'series' although not included in the box sets so far. We get the classic minkey sequence and meet Cato for the first time in one of the series' great slapstick routines. However the film has a sort of split personality and the current DVD transfer is too grainy for a largescreen TV IMHO. So rent it but I'd wait for something better if you're looking to collect.I wouldn't exactly say this movie sets the tone for the rest of the series. The original starred David Niven with an allstar supporting cast including Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. Then Clouseau became the star of A Shot in the Dark which didn't involve either the Pink Panther gem nor jewel thief Sir Charles Lytton. This film has them all so tries to 'balance' the action between Clouseau and Sir Charles. It doesn't work and probably as a result there were no more such attempts the series becomes all about Clouseau and that's for the best. I like Christopher Plummer but the movie is too 'heavy' when he's on screen  probably the writer's fault. As for Catherine Schell I'd look at her in anything or nothing at all and IMHO her acting compares favorably to at least Dyan Cannon's and Elke Sommers'. Herbert Lom Burt Kwouk and Andre Maranne are of course a terrific comedic supporting cast but Peter Arne has to straddle the comedic and serious aspects of the film which doesn't really work out.The story shifts back and forth between the perspectives of Sir Charles and Clouseau. The Pink Panther gem nationalized by the government of Lugash after the events of the original film has been displayed in the national museum until stolen in a great caper sequence. Against the wishes of his frustrated boss how can an idiot be a police officer Clouseau who sortof recovered the gem previously is recalled from beat duty There was some question whether it was the man or his minkey who was breaking ze law and put on the case at the request of Lugash police chief Colonel Sharky. Clouseau naturally suspects Sir Charles particularly since his trademark a glove embroidered with the letter P was left at the scene. Sir Charles however is surprised he has been living in retirement and knows nothing about the matter until it is brought to his attention by his mischievous wife Claudine. Knowing he will be suspected Litton sets off for Lugash to find the real criminal while Clouseau sets off for Nice to investigate Sir Charles' home  and wife. Clues lead both Clouseau I am NOT Guy Gadbois and Sir Charles to a Swiss hotel and the parrot sequence. All is revealed in the final confrontation where more than one policeman proves to have been playing a double game.Someone here said it hasn't aged well but I'd say almost the opposite  the first time you see it you'll probably think it hilarious  but it may pall the second time around.".

The dialogue is very inspired especially Clousseau's wooing of Catherine Schell's Claudine with his chat up lines that are oddly reminiscent of the style of Humphrey Bogart. The slapstick is bumbling and always delivered with the best scenes being Lytton's escape from the thugs Clousseau's distraction during the bank robbery Clousseau posing as a telephone repair man and especially the scene with the runaway vacuum cleaner. The characters are wonderfully crazy and the acting is very good as good as Catherine Schell Herbert Lomwith his mental breakdown another highlight and Christopher Plummer are it is Peter Sellars who steals the show his Clousseau as always is a riot.Overall a great comedy and film. If there was anything that wasn't as good with the film it was perhaps the length the film could've done with being 510 minutes shorter.

The last 'Clouseau' movie had been the illfated Alan Arkin version from 1968. It was not any old Clouseau audiences wanted but Sellers. Both men agreed to put aside their creative differences and restore the original.'Return' begins in Lugash where the fabulous 'Pink Panther' diamond is stolen once more.

It would appear that Sir Charles Lytton  Christopher Plummer  is up to his old tricks again. Now retired from crime and living in the South of France with his wife Claudine  Catherine Schell  he is concerned that someone is imitating him and decides to track down the real culprit...Forget the plot. It is nothing more than an excuse on which to peg the gags and many are first rate. There are more laughs to be found here than in the original 'Pink Panther'  which had too much of David Niven for my liking  and the Arkin 'Clouseau'. I think I'm right in saying this film was the beginning of Clouseau's habit of mangling the French language. Not only do English people not understand him but other French people do not either. When he asks Victor Spinetti's hotel clerk for a room the man thinks he is asking for a 'rheum'.In addition to Sellers returning we also get back Herbert Lom as the harassed 'Dreyfus' whose hatred of the detective is so great he keeps trying to kill him and Burt Kwouk as 'Cato' the Chinese manservant who is under orders to attack his boss every chance he gets. 'Return' has one of the best Clouseau vs.Cato scenes ending with the former trying to do a flying kungfu leap and crashing through a door into his kitchen. Christopher Plummer replaces Niven as 'Sir Charles Lytton'. When we last saw him he was with Clouseau's wife  Capucine . Catherine Schell's character is not the same woman. It would not be until 1981's 'Trail Of The Pink Panther' that the former 'Mrs.Clouseau' would be seen again. Graham Stark is back also but as seedy crook 'Pepe' who keeps getting his fingers crushed.'Return' was a big success paving the way for further sequels. It is not included on the box set though due to it having been made by a different company. It has since been released separately.Funniest moment? For me its the bit where Clouseau enters the hotel and a man requests politely he hand over his hat coat and gloves. Thinking him to be a member of staff the Inspector does this and then watches dumbfounded as the man casually walks out of the foyer gets into a car waves and drives off!".

	schema:headline " Fascinating story with a few flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a slow moving but interesting story about a 50 something bohemian photographer named Connie Fitzpatrick Stephen Rea who is a serial seducer of impressionable young women.  His seduction is not really about sex although that is part of it.  Instead it is more of an emotional seduction that involves his creating a symbiotic mentorprotg relationship that puts him in control while feeding his ego.  His latest conquest is Harper Sloane Sarah Polley a recent college grad from a wealthy family who is all set to go to Harvard Law School.  Clearly lonely and vulnerable and not used to the attention of men she falls prey to the charms of this free spirited older man and eschews law school to run off with him and live the artsy life.Directorwriter Audrey Wells whose best previous writing credits were for The Truth About Cats and Dogs does an excellent job bringing this story to the screen in her directing debut.  Her shooting of the scenes was sensitively done and brought forth a lot of the emotional elements of the story and the characters.  It is clear that this was a labor of love for Wells but as is often the case directing one's own work takes away the objectivity about the script leaving most of the plot problems intact.It is believable that an insecure girl could be lured into a relationship by a charming older man who overtly appreciates her and believes in her abilities.  MaySeptember romances or more aptly in this case AprilAugust are common and usually happen for all the reasons depicted here.  The biggest problem with the story was the introduction of Billie Gina Gershon one of  Connie's earlier alumni so early in the story.  Billie warns Harper of the specific manipulative lines that Connie uses repeatedly with each of his love interests almost by rote.  She gives great detail right down to the way he touched her and the fact that he calls them all Guinevere.At that point Harper does exactly what one might expect she leaves him. Shortly thereafter the story loses all credibility as she eagerly goes running back to him knowing full well that she is being totally and impersonally manipulated.  The entire relationship after that waits for an emotional explosion that never comes.  The whole thing just sort of withers away with the eventual breakup being no more than a fait accompli.  The breakup scene was weak and cowardly which detracted greatly from the dramatic potential.  If Wells had put Billie's scene closer to the end of the story to create the last straw it would have been more effective.Wells also misses a great opportunity to add fireworks by not emphasizing Harper's relationship with her mother Jean Smart.  There was a natural emotional tension between the two and she was the one character who had complete clarity about the relationship.  Finally without giving too much away the gathering of the five Connie alumni at the end was a bit goofy and highly implausible given the gravity of the situation.  However Wells does eventually redeem herself with a good ending and some of the best imagery of the film.Sarah Polley was well cast in this film and exuded the pure naivety of a young woman inexperienced in the ways of love.  She was wonderfully awkward and vulnerable and it was very believable that she could fall prey to the ministrations of an older man.  Polley has a Winona Ryder quality about her and has excellent potential as an actress.  It remains to be seen if she can break out of the role of quirky teen.Stephen Rea was hopelessly miscast in this role.  He didn't have the emotional horsepower to play this character.  His acting is somewhat stoic and wooden and this character needed to be charming passionate and obsessive.  The part required an actor more like Michael Caine.The best performance of the film goes to Jean Smart as Harper's outspoken and gregarious mother.

	onyx:emotionText "This was a slow moving but interesting story about a 50 something bohemian photographer named Connie Fitzpatrick Stephen Rea who is a serial seducer of impressionable young women.  His seduction is not really about sex although that is part of it.  Instead it is more of an emotional seduction that involves his creating a symbiotic mentorprotg relationship that puts him in control while feeding his ego.  His latest conquest is Harper Sloane Sarah Polley a recent college grad from a wealthy family who is all set to go to Harvard Law School.  Clearly lonely and vulnerable and not used to the attention of men she falls prey to the charms of this free spirited older man and eschews law school to run off with him and live the artsy life.Directorwriter Audrey Wells whose best previous writing credits were for The Truth About Cats and Dogs does an excellent job bringing this story to the screen in her directing debut.  Her shooting of the scenes was sensitively done and brought forth a lot of the emotional elements of the story and the characters.  It is clear that this was a labor of love for Wells but as is often the case directing one's own work takes away the objectivity about the script leaving most of the plot problems intact.It is believable that an insecure girl could be lured into a relationship by a charming older man who overtly appreciates her and believes in her abilities.  MaySeptember romances or more aptly in this case AprilAugust are common and usually happen for all the reasons depicted here.  The biggest problem with the story was the introduction of Billie Gina Gershon one of  Connie's earlier alumni so early in the story.  Billie warns Harper of the specific manipulative lines that Connie uses repeatedly with each of his love interests almost by rote.  She gives great detail right down to the way he touched her and the fact that he calls them all Guinevere.At that point Harper does exactly what one might expect she leaves him. Shortly thereafter the story loses all credibility as she eagerly goes running back to him knowing full well that she is being totally and impersonally manipulated.  The entire relationship after that waits for an emotional explosion that never comes.  The whole thing just sort of withers away with the eventual breakup being no more than a fait accompli.  The breakup scene was weak and cowardly which detracted greatly from the dramatic potential.  If Wells had put Billie's scene closer to the end of the story to create the last straw it would have been more effective.Wells also misses a great opportunity to add fireworks by not emphasizing Harper's relationship with her mother Jean Smart.  There was a natural emotional tension between the two and she was the one character who had complete clarity about the relationship.  Finally without giving too much away the gathering of the five Connie alumni at the end was a bit goofy and highly implausible given the gravity of the situation.  However Wells does eventually redeem herself with a good ending and some of the best imagery of the film.Sarah Polley was well cast in this film and exuded the pure naivety of a young woman inexperienced in the ways of love.  She was wonderfully awkward and vulnerable and it was very believable that she could fall prey to the ministrations of an older man.  Polley has a Winona Ryder quality about her and has excellent potential as an actress.  It remains to be seen if she can break out of the role of quirky teen.Stephen Rea was hopelessly miscast in this role.  He didn't have the emotional horsepower to play this character.  His acting is somewhat stoic and wooden and this character needed to be charming passionate and obsessive.  The part required an actor more like Michael Caine.The best performance of the film goes to Jean Smart as Harper's outspoken and gregarious mother.  She completely steals the movie with her confrontational scene with Connie explaining to him why he can't make it with women his own age.  She is terrific in every scene she is in and the fortune cookie scene is fantastic.Overall I rated this film a 710.  This film will probably be most appealing to men over 50 and women under 25.  None of the flaws were fatal but the pace was slow and the plot implausible in parts.  That detracted from an otherwise engaging story and some very good technical filmmaking.";

But in leading roles she seems both brittle and amoeboid. As Harper the insecure and overlooked daughter of a family of cutthroat lawyers she has one amazing scenebeing seduced her reactions fry out her speakers sending from giggly hysteria to overdrive lust. Harper is seduced by an aging bohemian wedding photographer Stephen Reaa lush who talks a big game pontificates in bars with his lowrent cronies and makes a sport and a pastime of mentoring and groping avid young women. But we don't see any hunger any passion or obsession in Harper. When the photographer Connie tells her she has talent it's an obvious pickup linenot because she hasn't done any work but because she shows no interest in anything but being noticed.The writerdirector Audrey Wells doesn't show much interest in anything else either. The author of the scripts for GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE and INSPECTOR GADGET her first indie feature has more than a whiff of the dilettante. Like AMERICAN BEAUTY GUINEVERE likes to flirt with the idea of having an edge then shies away from it. Both of these movies are just too damned clear. The pleasure of that seduction scene is that Harper responds in ways that are messy funny unprogrammed every other scene in the picture makes its point in letters so bold the thickest member of the audience couldn't miss it.You can take the girl out of the studio but ain't no way you're taking the studio out of the girl. The lechy photographer's big sinthe thing that makes him evanesce in Harper's eyesis that at fifty he's still stumping and hustling for cash. Can Audrey Wells really intend that it's okay for Connie to be a serial phony an egoinflating comeon artist but his real Achilles' heel is that he never made real money? Wells' point seems to be Connie gets Harper's tender young fleshhe could at least pay the bills. Every scene is so blandly overdetermined it reeks of falsityespecially the muchapplauded one where Harper's bitchy mom Jean Smart comes into Connie's loft and undoes their relationship with a single cutting observation. Would these lovers react with such shock to such an obvious accusation?For someone making a movie about the romance of the artist's life Wells seems to have no clue how artists talk to each other or even behaveshe seems to think that's egghead stuff the audience won't care about. But it's that not sex that's supposed to be the fundament of Connie and Harper's relationship. Despite Rea's and Polley's efforts the movie drowns in bigmovie timidity. And the endinga Felliniesque princess fantasy where all of Connie's sweet young things gather for an All That Jazz adieumaybe intended to be tender. It comes across as a final passiveaggressive flipping of the bird to a halfforgotten dirtyminded teacher.".

You've obviously mistaken me for someone with potential she barely manages to squeak to the wedding photographer in one of the multitudinous lines of onthenose dialogue in this selfconscious overwrought clunker.Somehow this bright beautiful 20yearold has managed to get through her entire life including four years of college without once meeting a person who has affirmed her intelligence and her creativity even though she's smart enough to have been accepted into Harvard Law. Similar ironies occur in real lifethe beauty who thinks she's ugly the overachiever who thinks she's not doing enoughbut at some point you lose interest in a character who's either got some serious personality disorder or whose creator the writer imagines that weird gestures and speeches can take the place of psychology.The beautiful bright girl proves utterly vulnerable to the seducements of the wedding photographer an older lesspromising often insolent and lecherous man who says things to her like You can do it and You must learn to detest the bourgeoisie. Oh I don't remember if he actually said those things but his utterances are so much hogwash that only an impression of nonsense remains. Harper is introduced to . . . coffee houses! She listens to . . . jazz! Someone actually asks her about her ideas for the first ever time in her whole entire life! To go back to the biographical thing how did this girl ever get the liberal arts education required to enter Harvard Law without someone at least once eliciting her opinion on something? And probably admiring it? Without ever having a lively conversation with intellectual and creative types? Without ever laughing? Without going through that whole fascinatingolderman thing about ten times? Without getting a glimpse outside the world she came from? Unlikely weird scenes get slapped on one after the other without any progress in character or conflict. She throws herself on him hungrily. She moves in. He insults her she runs away she insults him and then comes back they insult each other and reunite. When he's at his lowest she goes into a frenzy of taking his picture presumably off a roll of film with about 200 exposures on it. Then she gets him into focus and relents with a whimper.Ultimately the photog turns out to be every bit as bad as he promises and perhaps a little better since he's principled enough to send her away when it's at the point where the relationship can do nothing but drag her down. Fastforward to so many years later and she's giving him the last and only thing she can her best wishes for a good death. The scene drags on and on and ends with his dissolution into heavenly white light. Why? Whose story was this? He was the worst man I ever met. Or the best man I ever met. This hamfisted summary I suppose is supposed to be a specimen of brilliant tortured complex ambiguity. To me it's a failure to make a stand an excuse for the writer to dump a truckload of contradictions into a character then sneak away without explaining any of it. And why end with him? Again I ask whose story was this?Audrey Wells you're a fraud.".

To its credit Guinevere  like Leaving Las Vegas is also a very good film. Sarah Pollack is outstanding as the withdrawn Harper in stark contrast to her brazen streetwise savvy Ronna in Go!. Although she's actually twenty she looks fifteen which helps to convey a believable vulnerability and transformation.Rea is truly manipulative as Connor more pathetic than sinister who preys on young women  you're never quite sure if you should loathe or pity him. Finally Jean Smart does an excellent job as the hardasnails matriarch miles away from her smarmy character on Designing Women.Well worth the price of admission.".

To its credit Guinevere  like Leaving Las Vegas is also a very good film. Sarah Pollack is outstanding as the withdrawn Harper in stark contrast to her brazen streetwise savvy Ronna in Go!. Although she's actually twenty she looks fifteen which helps to convey a believable vulnerability and transformation.Rea is truly manipulative as Connor more pathetic than sinister who preys on young women  you're never quite sure if you should loathe or pity him. Finally Jean Smart does an excellent job as the hardasnails matriarch miles away from her smarmy character on Designing Women.Well worth the price of admission.";

	schema:reviewBody "A young woman living in San Francisco who has just been accepted to Harvard decides upon another path after meeting and falling under the influence of an older man an artist in Guinevere' written and directed by Audrey Wells.  Sarah Polley stars as Harper Sloane who lives with her career oriented rather selfabsorbed family her parents Alan Francis Guinan and Deborah Jean Smart and her older sister Susan Emily Procter.  Rather selfconscious and unsure of herself Harper has allowed her parents to plan her future a career in law though it is decidedly against her own wishes.  Then at Susan's wedding she meets the photographer Connie Fitzpatrick Stephen Rea an artist who quickly gains her confidence and lures her into his own bohemian lifestyle.  She moves in with him unbeknownst to her parents who think she's staying with a friend for awhile and he becomes her mentor she is his Guinevere' and the only demands he makes of her is that she create' something every day.  The choice of her artistic endeavors is entirely up to her photography painting writing dancing.  but she must create.Inevitably of course their relationship develops beyond the mentorprotege stage and she learns some things about him that ultimately lead to complications.  And she discovers that her reign as Queen Guinevere may not be all that she had expected it to be.Wells convincingly presents the allurement of a lifestyle free of constraints and overwhelming demands which makes it quite understandable that the indecisive Harper would choose to go with Connie rather than adhere to the wishes of her parents who are rather cold and impersonal and altogether controlling especially her mother.  The fact that Alan dotes on Susan and could seemingly care less about Harper as well as Deborah's apparent lack of actual concern for Harper qualifies the facility with which Harper is able to effect her plans so readily.  And even when Deborah finds out what Harper is up to which of course was inevitable she seems to take it as a personal affront more than anything and is content with merely denigrating the relationship into which her daughter has entered rather than even trying to change it which ostensibly at least would  be the appropriate reaction of a concerned parent.Polley is well cast as Harper as physically and emotionally she is able to fit Harper's profile perfectly and she gives a credible performance though given her unassuming manner and fairly nondescript appearance it says more about Connie than it does about her.  And what you have already been able to deduce about Connie from his pursuit of Harper is further underscored during a scene in which Deborah confronts him with her views on the situation which is arguably the most powerful scene in the film. Rea is perfectly cast as well affecting a patient reserved manner touched with an almost forlorn weariness evocative of a certain wisdomoftheworld attitude that makes Harper's attraction to him believable.  And as the story unfolds he very subtly allows you to see more of what lies beneath the surface until in the end you have a concise picture of who Connie really is.  It's a fine understated performance and a good bit of work by Rea.In a supporting role that demands mention Jean Smart gives a smoldering performance as Deborah a woman of seemingly insatiable needs and an overwhelming desire to dominate.  And Smart plays it perfectly from the look in her eye to the telling way she carries herself making the most of her limited screen time and making Deborah the most memorable character of the film.The supporting cast includes Gina Gershon Billie Paul Dooley Walter Carrie Preston Patty Tracy Letts Zack Sharon McNight Leslie Sandra Oh Cindy Grace Una April and Jasmine Guy Linda.  Though not a film with which you can get too emotionally involved Guinevere' has it's moments and does manage to maintain interest.  The characters are real enough but they evoke a sense of ambivalence these are not people you are necessarily going to like or dislike.  In the final analysis it's a good film and worth seeing but with the possible exception of Smart's character there is nothing especially memorable or compelling about it.  I rate this one 610.".

Wells' forte seems to be characters in search of romance who find it in unexpected places. It was the 'ugly' girl in Truth About Cats  Dogs Italy in Tuscan Sun and the older man in this film. That older man is played with wild abandon by Stephen Rea often inappropriately stealing the show. Ignoring Jean Smart's histrionic heavy scene later in the film and the control Rea's Connie has over Polley's Harper this is Sarah Polley's film. What make this film work is its sensitivity and subtly especially toward Harper's youth naivete and uncertainty in love and life. It's a sweet film about selfdiscovery at any age and although it gets a bit moody toward the end it works well as a date movie.".

In her sister's wedding she meets the photographer Connie Fitzpatrick Stephen Rea an old weird not handsome and very poor man who tells her that she has a great potential in arts and calls her Guinevere. Harper falls in love with him. She gives up of Harvard leaves her family and moves to his apartment. Pretty soon she finds that he has used the same seduction by flattery technique including the nickname Guinevere with other girls. But she stays with him until she is replaced' by another girl. After four years Harper becomes a mature woman totally different from the one in the beginning of the story. This movie is a very weird romance. If the viewer can buy that a beautiful and wealthy girl like Harper could really love a guy like Connie and stay with him probably he will like this film. That is not my case. Harper is a mature woman in the end of the story but in the beginning she would have to move to Harvard where she certainly would develop herself as a human being. Of course the experience she has with Connie is great for her formation but the guy is too much strange and does not really seems to love her. She is just another tasteful laboratory for him. The cynical dialog of Harper's mother with Connie is for me the greatest part of this film when she says that a looser like him prefers young and naive women to be admired in his completely failure as a man.  My vote is four.Title Brazil A Lente do Desejo' The Lens of the Desire'".

We are told to believe  that Sarah Polley at age 20 needs something or someone to appreciate her for what she can become.  Sarah's character Harper is a beautiful wealthy collegeeducated resident of the San Francisco Bay Area.  There is no way in the world she would still be this uninformed inexperienced and helpless.  She has done well enough at college to be accepted into Harvard Law School.  If we are to believe the film she is incapable of any intelligent or creative thought or action.  From what college did she graduate?  Was she asleep for four years? Was she asleep for 20 years? The only scene with any hint of reality or intelligence was the one in which Harper's mother played well by Jean Smart confronts the older man.  Sarah Polley is beautiful and talented she is wasted in this turkey.  For a film in which the director utilizes the talents of a young actor avoid Guinevere and see Natalie Portman in Anywhere but Here.".

	schema:headline " A Must See If Crushing On Sarah Polley";
	schema:reviewBody "Sarah Polley fans especially ones going all the way back to Ramona are generally bigtime Guinevere 1999 fans simply because it is the film in which she peaked physically. And Director Audrey Wells picked up on this during casting seeing in Polley at that time of her life someone physically perfect to play her heroine Harper Sloane. Wells needed a young woman who simply glowed in front of the camera whose face looked better without makeup and who projected both innocence and restlessness. With Polley she also got a bonus one of the most talented actresses of her generation. In this sense Wells resembles Alfred Hitchcock a director with an uncanny ability to identify actresses at the one moment of their lives when they are physically perfect for a particular role. Sylvia Sidney in Sabotage Nova Pilbeam in Young and Innocent and Joan Fontaine in Rebecca come to mind.Wells who also wrote ''The Truth About Cats and Dogs'' captures that moment in some young women's lives yes the film could be considered a feminist statement when they are able to break free of expectations and programming. The Harper Sloane character seems so authentic and the portrayal so lacking in glib cynicism that it most likely has a lot of autobiographical elements. Harper is tracking along toward Harvard Law School when she meets Cornelius Fitzpatrick Stephen Rea a middleaged Irish artist who has been hired to photograph her sister's wedding. His wellpracticed seduction technique and irreverent worldview causes a major attitude adjustment and she abandons her career track to become his protg and lover.The story is told from Harper's point of view and the viewer soon learns along with her that this is not the traditional Pygmalion scenario. While not exactly a rogue and a rou Connie is a compulsive Henry Higgins who has repeatedly played this game with repressed young women. He goes into these relationships with a fiveyear time limit. Consistent with the POV factor Harper's story is told with intelligence and compassion with a lot of emphasis on the fragility of a first love and the pain of a trust betrayed. The film's feminist slant is revealed not so much by what is explicitly shown but by its failure to bring any dimensionality to Connie's character. No clues are provided to explain his aversion to a longterm commitment Harper discovers that his promises are empty ones but she never learns the roots of his insecurities. Although Polley's best scenes are those with Carrie Preston who plays her best friend and confidante the most entertaining scenes are those with her mother Jean Smart an unstated version of Susan's mother on Seinfeld. The dysfunctional nature of Harper's family and her mother's unfulfilled life are slowly and somewhat comically revealed but the bottom line is that her mother is sincerely trying to shield her daughter from mistakes. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Honeymooners Joan Crawford and Fred MacMurray are asked by British intelligence to do some spying while on their European jaunt. The agreeable pair go along with a plan that has them on the trail of an agent and in and out of dangerous situations as they are pursued by Basil Rathbone chilling as usual as a Nazi.  Good entertainment with some amusing dialogue and lighthearted performances by Joan and Fred that indicate they should have been teamed more than once. As it is this is Joan Crawford's last film at Metro after seventeen years with the studio and comes just two years before Mildred Pierce at Warners. Good cast and fine production values make it an absorbing treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Above Suspicion 1943An odd movie even for its time being clearly antiNazi and a bit of an American adventure on behalf of the British but set in the months before the war began earlier 1939. Yet it was made and was released in the thick of the war four years later well after even the Americans were involved. It must have seemed a bit lightweight at the time and it certainly is a bit breezy now too.Joan Crawford is at her best when life is going wrong when the screws are applied or when she has to be a tough and independent women. Here she plays a cheerful and rather carefree newlywed. What Crawford character is truly carefree? Well in this case her husband is perfectly cast because Fred MacMurray knows what carefree is better than anything. When the Nazi threat becomes violent things turn out rather okay at least at first. The only other actor of note is the Nazi figure played by the guy who plays Sherlock in all those BMovie Sherlock Holmes films Basil Rathbone and you can't quite make him out as the evil menace he needs to be.Of course our leading odd couple has been chosen for this mission by some knowing British officials who see the American innocence as a perfect cover for what is actually pretty dangerous stuff. And the movie despite all these essential weaknesses is really fun and a bit dramatic and very well made. Yes it's a good movie if far from a great one in either importance or effect.The director Richard Thorpe is one of the stepinwhenneeded guys with a bunch of Bmovies under his belt and an assortment of mediocre oddballs a Tarzan movie the last Thin Man a Presley movieJailhouse Rocksome Westerns and so on.

	schema:reviewBody "Above Suspicion 1943  12 out of 4Bythenumbers WWII drama from MGM has Joan Crawford and Fred MacMurray playing newlyweds who are asked by the government to do some spying as they make their way into Nazi controlled territory. ABOVE SUSPICION was one of the hundreds of films turned out by Hollywood to motivate or at least pursued the country to support the war and to show how evil the Nazi party was. With so many films in this subgenre it's always hard to find a great film and this here certainly isn't one of them. While the film remains slightly entertaining from start to finish there's really no way to deny the fact that there's just nothing overly special here and it's also incredibly uneven. I say uneven because the tone of the film seems to change from one scene to the next. Sometimes you feel as if you're watching some sort of light comedy and then the next minute everything is being handled so heavily. At times there seems to be a winkwink going on between the two leads and then the next second everything is back to being dead serious. I thought the entire tone of the film was just wrong and it was incredibly hard for me to believe the story or take it too serious. Both Crawford and MacMurray are good in their roles although I'm not so sure they play were together. I really didn't buy them as a married couple and I also didn't buy them working together on these missions. Conrad Veidt is good in his role as a good German and Basil Rathbone steals the film as the evil German. Reginald Owen has a good supporting part as well. Again at just 90minutes the film moves well enough but there's just not enough going on here to make it worth watching except for fans of the cast.".

This weapon is a magnetic water bomb that is pulled to a ship and explodes. At first it's fun then it becomes dangerous.This is an entertaining film in part thanks to a good cast of Crawford MacMurray Basil Rathbone and Conrad Veidt. There are some suspenseful sequences. There is also some real stuff of spy books and films  special hats song codes codes on maps and in books.Above Suspicion doesn't seem very big budget and despite some Bavarian costumes and quaint German towns it's all Hollywood set. Given the huge films Crawford took part in at MGM this black and white movie must have seemed like a comedown. It was. Louis B didn't want over the hill actresses  i.e. those over 30. There's nothing special about her part which could have been done by any MGM stock player. And at 38 for those days she was a little old to be a bride. Better things were on the horizon for Crawford though she couldn't have known it at the time.Worth seeing.".

Ms. Crawford had a lighter role as Frances Myles she shows good sense of timing for this type of genre. Conrad Veidt is hilarious as the German that shows up in most of the places the Myles seem to go.

	schema:reviewBody "Reviewers seem to have wide range of opinions about Above Suspicion and I can understand why.Released in 1943 the film actually portrays action that takes place in 1939. The British anticipating a Nazi invasion of Poland are preparing for the inevitable. They ask newlyweds Richard and Frances Myles Fred McMurray and Joan Crawford to try to track down the formula for a new German secret weapon while on their honeymoon. Because they are newly married surely they would be above suspicion. Richard is a student at Oxford. He wants to keep his bride in the dark about the danger of their mission but she sees through his subterfuge and is delighted by the fact they will now be Spies!The mission is convoluted and unnecessarily complicated as if written by Rube Goldberg. As they travel from Dover to Paris to Salzburg they fumble their way from clue to ambiguous clue managing to keep their sense of humor. Basil Rathbone and Conrad Veidt plays significant roles in this drama that was called tongue in cheek by TCM. It's a fair assessment for a story that feels like it could have been written by a teenager. Nevertheless it's a fun ride punctuated by assassinations and Tyrolian chases.".

	onyx:emotionText "Reviewers seem to have wide range of opinions about Above Suspicion and I can understand why.Released in 1943 the film actually portrays action that takes place in 1939. The British anticipating a Nazi invasion of Poland are preparing for the inevitable. They ask newlyweds Richard and Frances Myles Fred McMurray and Joan Crawford to try to track down the formula for a new German secret weapon while on their honeymoon. Because they are newly married surely they would be above suspicion. Richard is a student at Oxford. He wants to keep his bride in the dark about the danger of their mission but she sees through his subterfuge and is delighted by the fact they will now be Spies!The mission is convoluted and unnecessarily complicated as if written by Rube Goldberg. As they travel from Dover to Paris to Salzburg they fumble their way from clue to ambiguous clue managing to keep their sense of humor. Basil Rathbone and Conrad Veidt plays significant roles in this drama that was called tongue in cheek by TCM. It's a fair assessment for a story that feels like it could have been written by a teenager. Nevertheless it's a fun ride punctuated by assassinations and Tyrolian chases.";

It is always fun to see a welldressed justmarried couple take an European honeymoon not knowing where they are going to spy for the British.  This was before WWII.  Joan Crawford and Fred MacMurray made a great team.  MacMurray had the skill to team well with every leading lady he worked with.  It was great to see Crawford work with Conrad Veidt again.  They worked well in A Woman's Face.  Too bad Crawford and Veidt never worked again.  Mr. Veidt died in 1943.  This was his last movie.".

It's amazing that Richard Myles Fred MacMurray can remember all the details. The viewer may also be amazed that Fred MacMurray speaks such good German. MacMurray is one of those great Hollywood actors who never received his due even though he almost matched the performances of Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck in the film noir classic Double Indemnity. He certainly keeps up with Joan Crawford in Above Suspicion although the two simply don't jell as a team. Barbara Stanwyck would have made a much better partner for MacMurray in this film.All that aside this is still a topnotch suspense movie from World War II. The flick is fastpaced and has worn well with the passage of time since all the goings on are now just history to most viewers. Since director Richard Thorpe was an old hand at directing action pictures he lets the show get on the road and move along rapidly. He throws humor in from time to time to ease the tension the way Hitchcock would do in a more masterful way. Viewers used to seeing Basil Rathbone play Sherlock Holmes will enjoy seeing him play a dastardly Nazi stooge who receives his just desserts. In the opposite direction viewers may also enjoy seeing Conrad Veidt playing a good guy who assists the newlyweds Frances and Richard Myles Joan Crawford and Fred MacMurrayin their dangerous mission inside Nazi Germany. Those who enjoy World War II espionage films should find this one a winner.".

Basil Rathbone always makes a great charming villain and the much underrated Fred MacMurray comes across quite well as the hero. Casting of all supporting parts is excellent and the MGM production values are faultless. The first half of the film is considerably better than the second as things become a bit chaotic and muddled towards the end but its great to see a Hollywood film where the Germans actually speak German. There are also one or two quite extraordinary tracking shots especially one in the concert hall and in fact this whole sequence has an intensity that one wishes the entire film had.

	schema:headline " Light espionage WWII thriller and Conrad Veidt's last film";
	schema:reviewBody "Suspense a little intrigue adventure and espionage make for an enjoyable World War II movie. Above Suspicion has all of that and a little more. It has romance in a newly wed couple. And its stellar cast give good performances all around. This movie is based on a novel of the same name by Scottish writer Helen MacInnes. The story takes place in 1939 before the start of World War II. Although filmed entirely in California the outdoor scenes around Mt. Wilson and Bishop could resemble scenes in Austria and southern Germany. The MGM studio set was so authentically recreated that I saw a couple scenes with small religious wayside shrines in them. These are common in many places in Europe. I wonder what audiences thought when they heard reference in this movie to Dachau. The concentration camp had been opened there in 1933 for political prisoners. While the Allies knew about the POW camps and concentration camps by the middle of the war the public had heard very little about them yet in the press. So this film has two references to Dachau  but they don't use the word concentration in the same breath. At one point toward the end Fred MacMurray's character Richard Myles says At least it's not a concentration camp referring to the detention place where the Nazis have taken his wife.Joan Crawford plays Frances Myles the new bride of Oxford professor Myles. Conrad Veidt Basil Rathbone Reginald Owen and Bruce Lester round out the list of the major supporting cast. All do very well. The film has a couple of humorous lines as well. When Richard and Frances are in Salzburg Austria they are almost trampled by German troops marching in the street. A Gestapo officer goes into a bookstore where they are browsing and trying to make a contact. He has words with Richard who then answers him with a closing term dope. The Gestapo officer turns to a woman in the shop and asks her in German what dope means.This was the last film that Conrad Veidt made. He died of a heart attack on April 3 1943 the month before the film was released. Veidt is most famous for having played the Gestapo Major Strasser in the 1942 film Casablanca. But he had been an accomplished actor and film star in Germany. When Hitler came to power in 1933 Veidt and his Jewish wife Lily fled the country. He became a British citizen in 1939 moved to the U.S. and made many films here. In war films he was most often cast as a German officer or Nazi chief. He was equally adept at comedy mystery romance and drama. Veidt was only 50 years old when he died. It's too bad he didn't live to see the end of the Nazi regime which he so despised. This film is a light espionage thriller that most should enjoy. It's a nice showcase of several stars of the time with a last kind look at Conrad Veidt.".

	onyx:emotionText "Suspense a little intrigue adventure and espionage make for an enjoyable World War II movie. Above Suspicion has all of that and a little more. It has romance in a newly wed couple. And its stellar cast give good performances all around. This movie is based on a novel of the same name by Scottish writer Helen MacInnes. The story takes place in 1939 before the start of World War II. Although filmed entirely in California the outdoor scenes around Mt. Wilson and Bishop could resemble scenes in Austria and southern Germany. The MGM studio set was so authentically recreated that I saw a couple scenes with small religious wayside shrines in them. These are common in many places in Europe. I wonder what audiences thought when they heard reference in this movie to Dachau. The concentration camp had been opened there in 1933 for political prisoners. While the Allies knew about the POW camps and concentration camps by the middle of the war the public had heard very little about them yet in the press. So this film has two references to Dachau  but they don't use the word concentration in the same breath. At one point toward the end Fred MacMurray's character Richard Myles says At least it's not a concentration camp referring to the detention place where the Nazis have taken his wife.Joan Crawford plays Frances Myles the new bride of Oxford professor Myles.

MacMurray and Crawford both do fine though it doesn't seem like the part quite fits Joan. This was her last movie for MGM before departing for Warner Bros. Nice support from Rathbone and Conrad Veidt. It's the kind of movie that you feel could have been so much better in the hands of a different director and perhaps different leads. Joan reportedly wanted Alfred Hitchcock to direct. It does seem somewhat up his alley but he certainly would have had the script rewritten significantly. I'm sure it would have been a much better film with Hitch at the helm. As it is though it's an agreeable timepasser. I love Fred MacMurray's closing line.".

But here sadly in his last film he is cast against type that face and voice still imperious but with a much lighter heart and on the side of an American couple Fred MacMurray and Joan Crawford who are on the European mainland on their honeymoon. MacMurray is an Oxford professor who was asked on his way out of England to perform a service for the Allies and new wife Crawford is game for helping him. On the way they encounter MacMurray's old college chum Basil Rathbone who hides his suspicions in order to find out what MacMurray and Crawford are up to. Veidt keeps popping up for a few amusing bits and you aren't quite sure why he's there. There's murder at the symphony a chase down a mountain road and ultimately a confrontation between Allies and the Axis that goes the way of the Reichstag.A fine cast of supporting players include Cecil Cunningham as Rathbone's imperious mama Eily Malyon as a hotel attendant Make sure you pull down the shade she tells MacMurray and Crawford suspiciously adding There's a practice blackout tonight for comic innuendo and MGM perennial Reginald Owen. While this was Crawford's last MGM film under her long contract and she had been considered boxoffice poison it was a nice way to leave the studio she had considered home for 18 years. It has all the fun of some of the lightly comic antiNazi films that Warner Brothers had done particularly All Through the Night with MacMurray wryly delivering some lines insulting the Nazis. Vat is dope? one of the S.S. workers asks rather confused. Relatively short at only 90 minutes the film flies by its mix of romance comedy and action always entertaining and entirely suspenseful.".

Veidt is as good as ever and his presence certainly lifts the film.It is a tale of intrigue and the fight against Nazism but is hardly involving.  I've seen much better movies on similar lines made before and after this one and it isn't one I'd be that bothered about seeing again.";

	schema:reviewBody "LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I'll see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benot Mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Benot Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car a Lada! for him. To do this the son has to break the record opening doors. What the father actually wants his for his son to be someone because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called L'Espoir Hope. Of course nothing works out as planned. This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismki's DRIFTING CLOUDS although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker. Just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat without being unrealistically happy. The humour is absurd without making the plot unbelievable and Mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting by Poelvoorde. This actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cultclassic C'EST ARRIV PRS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands because as he said in an interview he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the Ben character. With his return to a leading role in LCA there should be no doubt anymore about his acting. He's simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery but smart enough to realize what he's done and be torn by remorse about it. A must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "The journey that began on the small screen in 1967 comes to its end on the big screen in 1991 after three TV seasons six films and the creation of a cultural phenomenon unrivaled in the history of television. The crew of the original series had met with mixed results on the big screen producing the excellent The Wrath of Khan but also the inexcusably bad The Final Frontier the other four ranged from passable to good. After the financial failure of Star Trek V Paramount brought back Star Trek II director Nicholas Meyer and commissioned from him the final voyage of the original cast. As Star Trek so often does the events depicted mirror the glasnost of the late 1980s as the collapse of the Soviet Union eased global tensions and heralded the beginning of a new era. In the Trek universe the possibility of rapproachment between the Federation and the Klingon Empire raises the hackles of hardliners on both sides and Kirk and co. must prevent the weak peace from being destroyed. The original cast is in fine form all of them giving their all to make the potentially final appearances of their characters memorable. Despite William Shatner's reputation as a ham actor he delivers a great performance here his final log entry is one of Trek's finest moments. As the villain of the piece we get General Chang Christopher Plummer a Klingon out to insure no peace in our time. Plummer is superb chewing scenery and spewing Shakespeare with a wonderfully loathsome presence. I would rank Chang below Khan and the Borg Queen but far above all the other Trek villains. There are some tacky anachronisms typical of Meyer's style and the usual amount of discontinuities and canon issues but that's inevitable and I can accept it if it leads to a good story. Trek VI is a good story. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "The final Star Trek film to feature the original cast is an enormous improvement after the awful fifth film and might just be the best in the series. Much of it is probably thanks to the return of director Nicholas Meyer who is responsible also for the classic Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan while film III through V were directed by cast members. Meyer's very professional directing shows in every scene on STVI and the old cast  William Shatner Kirk Leonard Nimoy Spock DeForest Kelly McCoy James Doohan Scotty and the rest  give here what is without doubt their finest performance. Mind  Shatner and Nimoy are by now 60 years old while Kelly and Doohan are well into their 70s. But there isn't a trace of the pathetic silliness that characterized the fifth movie Meyer knows what to do with these aging actors that wouldn't make them look like idiots. What we see in Star Trek VI is a much more mature approach and the crew members have to face more than an outside enemy their own aging and their fear of change. That fear is a key element here and it's an issue that is well handled and is always relevant.While the old cast members are doing splendidly here the movie introduces some fantastic new characters. First and foremost the experienced Shakespearean actor Christopher Plummer makes a fascinating villain in the conservative and suspicious Klingon General Chang endlessly throwing out Shakespeare quotes on every turn. 'You haven't truly enjoyed Shakespeare until you've read it in the original Klingon' Also Kim Cattrall who achieved much success lately in the acclaimed 'Sex And The City' plays the Vulcan Lt. Valeris and gives a great performance. Finally David Warner gives a brief but memorable performance as the visionary Chancellor Gorkon. The real stars here though are Shatner and Kelly whose attempt to save the Chancellor's life as well as their trial for assassination before a Klingon court CAMEO Michael Dorn who plays Worf in the Next Generation plays Kirk and McCoy's attorney here  Colonel Worf. An ancestor probably make for some of the best scenes ever seen on Star Trek. The directing and camera work are splendid and the script has just the right amount of self humor which was dreadfully lacking from the fifth movie e.g. Spock 'If I were human I believe my response would be go to hell. ...If I were human.' All in all a remarkable sign off for the original crew of the Enterprise and one of the best scifi movies of all time.".

The timeliness of the film's release with realworld events. Funny how Col. West had a contingency plan for terrorism along the Federation's border. Made me wish we had one prior to 911 The issue of how people can be frightened of drastic change what a very Clintonesque message mirroring Kirk and crew's emotional baggage helps propel the plot forward and makes it believable.A great tense score and tight editing sorry no overlong speeches and theorizing combined with terrific performances from Christopher Plummer and the best yet from the original ensemble kept me glued to my seat the whole time. Additional characters are actually relevant unlike Saavik the Marcuses et al. and although I should have seen it coming I was surprised how farreaching the conspiracy to kill Gorkon actually was even including a Vulcan! Fun cameos from Michael Dorn Christian Slater and Iman lighten the mood. Her presence finally makes McCoy quip to Kirk What is it with you anyway? which is something that should have been said years ago. Must be the girdle. The Klingon attack scene at the end is great unrelenting action and was better than Khan's attack on the Enterprise in Part II see my comments on that film to get an idea.The Undiscovered Country is essentially a mystery in space with political overtones and it's great fun watching Spock and Valeris unravel the mystery piece by piece. Valeris Kim Cattrallis given more to do than Saavik ever was.  The only nitpicking comments I have is just why couldn't the assassins just throw the boots out the window? If an explosion in space wasn't monitored until the shockwave hit the Excelsior how would the Enterprise find the boots? Would the NCC1701 just shift gears into reverse?A lot has been made about the clock errors. To me it's not terribly important since it's just background and your attention should not be there anyway. It was a bad idea to include such a prop though.The only wasted role belongs to Scotty but he had his moment of greatness in The Voyage Home during the transparent aluminum scenes. He also delivers the corniest line of the film during dinner with the Klingons Maybe we are looking at something of that future here! Well duh!Everything that made Star Trek great is in this film action great oneliners from McCoy and Chekhov the peace message the Klingons Spock's logic skills literary quotes and celebrity cameos makes The Undiscovered Country a worthy sendoff to perhaps the most celebrated ensemble cast in entertainment history.

This is also the best of the series because we see the Enterprise crew past their prime save the universe one more time.As the film opens we are witness to an ecological disaster. As the starship Excelsior now under the command of Capt. Sulu George Takeiis on a survey they witness the aftermath of the explosion of the Klingon moon called Praxis. Even though Sulu is ready to offer assistance The Klingons want no help from them.Later the Enterprise crew is called into a top secret meeting and is apprised of the situationwhich is dire Think Chernoble. Because of the devastation Which will destroy their ozone within 50 years the Klingons offer to extend an olive branch with the Federation. In other words The Klingons and The Federation want a peace treaty.Considering that the Klingon Empire and the Federation have been at each others throats for ages this doesn't sit well with the parties involved especially Captain Kirk William Shatner who wants nothing to do with the process considering that it was the Klingons who had killed his son See Star Trek III The Search For Spock. In fact when Mr. Spock Leonard Nimoy who has been working with the Klingons for the treaty tells them that they are dying Kirk viciously says Let them die! Ouch. However he has to follow orders.Soon the crew of the Enterprise meets with Chancellor Gorkon David Warner his officer General Chang Christopher Plummer and his daughter Azetbur Rosanna DeSoto. During a dinner in which pretty much everyone is intoxicated with Romulan Ale there is some negativity among both sides clearly indicating that the road to peace is going to be a bumpy one.And it is.Later the Klingon ship is fired upon seemingly by The Enterprise and the Chancellor is assassinated despite the attempts of Kirk and McCoy DeForest Kelley to save him. Both Kirk and McCoy are arrested and put on trial. Found guilty both are sentenced to the ice planet known as Rura Penthe. How bad is it? Judging from Uhura's Nichelle Nichols and Scotty'sJames Doohanreaction it would have been better for Kirk and McCoy to have been executed on the spot.Spock knows that a conspiracy is present. And so while he is trying to find out the facts Kirk and McCoy try to stay alive on the penal planet.With time running out before the peace conference starts the crew of the Enterprise must not also save Kirk and McCoy but to race to the site of the conference to stop another assassination from taking place which will destroy any chance of peace. This proves even more difficult when they discover that there is a Klingon Bird of Prey that can fire when cloaked. And that those involved in the conspiracy work on both sides of the coin.What is interesting about the film is that it mirrors the general feelings between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union. Once considered enemies each side works together for peace even if both sides are skeptical. We also see the flaws of the crew of the Enterprise everyone is prejudiced. Chekov Walter Koenig during dinner mentions unalienable human rights and is chastised by Azetbur for his racist comments. Even Mr. Spock is prejudiced he's so blinded by the accomplishments of his Vulcan protg Valeris Kim Catrall that he doesn't see how much of a threat she is He admits this to Kirk later on until it is almost too late.It is nice to see the crew back in action one last time and you can't help but get a bit misty eyed Gene Roddenberry the creator of Star Trek died before it's release and this film is dedicated to him. A nice way to end the series but it's hard to say goodbye.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSThus it came to pass twenty five years after the original series began and twelve years after the first movie the original crew of the USS Enterprise decided to retire. Before going however they created history and they battled the all too human fear of change all in a film which is not only brilliant to watch but is a superb send off to this wonderful crew.Since Star Trek The Motion Picture 1979 the klingons the most famous enemy of all were always shown to be rather a pathetic lot. With their only appearance in the first film being five minutes they didn't get off to the best of starts. In the third encounter The Search for Spock 1984 they were given slightly more menace but were still relatively inept. Finally in Star Trek V The Final Frontier 1989 the main Klingons were an old alcoholic mess who needed to be shouted at by Spock to do anything and a pathetic ship Captain who seemed almost childlike and eventually had to apologise to Kirk. Therefore for a long time the Klingon Empire always seemed to be hard done by and put upon. In the first ten minutes of Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country this process appears to be repeating itself again. With the Klingon moon of Cronos being half destroyed Captain Sulu's USS Excelsior encounters the shockwave when they discover this awful accident. Skipping forward and on Earth the Federation's leaders are informed that the Klingon Empire is now facing doom. As a result Captain Kirk's Enterprise is sent to meet with Chancellor Gorkon David Warner in yet another different role and to begin discussions of Peace. It isn't long however before things go wrong and Captain Kirk is forced to battle the wonderfully evil General Chang Christopher Plummer.The beauty of this sixth film is that it puts considerable thought into all the real aspects required to make a decent Star Trek movie. With the crew beginning to feel their age they perform brilliantly in their final adventure. At the same time the supporting cast including Plummer Warner Kim Cattrell and Brock Peters is well thought out and constructed. Out of this supporting cast comes the absolutely superb General Chang played by Christopher Plummer. When considering all of this series of films arguably the three finest attempts are The Wrath Of Khan The Undiscovered Country and First Contact. With the three charismatic appealing bad guys in the form of Khan Chang and the Borg Queen these films appeal because they have an evenly matched battle. Whether it's Captain Kirk or Captain Picard both Shatner and Stewart perform better in their roles when they are given an enemy to sink their teeth into. None is more true of General Chang in this film. Chang represents an almost Klingon alternative of Kirk. Both are Warriors with strong knowledge of Earth's past Chang quoting Shakespeare perhaps once too often and for the majority of the time they both are terrified of change. The key to Kirk's success in this film is not the eventual destruction of Chang but that Kirk is willing to set aside his prejudices and accept the Klingon offer of peace. The bartering between the two is superb and the film is considerably better for it.Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country is probably more what people would classify as a typical adventure. Whilst the forth film was funny it never felt like it belonged in the series and it was then followed by the awful fifth film which was just in general bad. Therefore it feels like this final voyage of the original crew has saved face really. This film feels like it has learnt to respect the genre. Constructing a brilliant plot Nimoy Konner and Rosenthal have given the characters wide enough space for them to develop whilst simultaneously sticking to what makes Star Trek so great. There are battles there's drama there's emotion and there is mystery. With these however the crew are able to banter between themselves with Dr McCoy the late great DeForest Kelley getting some of the best lines once again.Ultimately there is only one flaw with Star Trek VI and that is that it reminds us that this is the end. Whilst Patrick Stewart and the crew of the Enterprise NCC 1701D would pick up the reigns from this moment on the series would never be as good as it was with Captain Kirk in command. Star Trek VI tells us that never again will we see this crew together on board the Enterprise. This film is a brilliant film and a suitable way of saying farewell to this group of people but this is in itself rather upsetting.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERSThus it came to pass twenty five years after the original series began and twelve years after the first movie the original crew of the USS Enterprise decided to retire. Before going however they created history and they battled the all too human fear of change all in a film which is not only brilliant to watch but is a superb send off to this wonderful crew.Since Star Trek The Motion Picture 1979 the klingons the most famous enemy of all were always shown to be rather a pathetic lot. With their only appearance in the first film being five minutes they didn't get off to the best of starts. In the third encounter The Search for Spock 1984 they were given slightly more menace but were still relatively inept. Finally in Star Trek V The Final Frontier 1989 the main Klingons were an old alcoholic mess who needed to be shouted at by Spock to do anything and a pathetic ship Captain who seemed almost childlike and eventually had to apologise to Kirk. Therefore for a long time the Klingon Empire always seemed to be hard done by and put upon. In the first ten minutes of Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country this process appears to be repeating itself again. With the Klingon moon of Cronos being half destroyed Captain Sulu's USS Excelsior encounters the shockwave when they discover this awful accident. Skipping forward and on Earth the Federation's leaders are informed that the Klingon Empire is now facing doom. As a result Captain Kirk's Enterprise is sent to meet with Chancellor Gorkon David Warner in yet another different role and to begin discussions of Peace. It isn't long however before things go wrong and Captain Kirk is forced to battle the wonderfully evil General Chang Christopher Plummer.The beauty of this sixth film is that it puts considerable thought into all the real aspects required to make a decent Star Trek movie. With the crew beginning to feel their age they perform brilliantly in their final adventure. At the same time the supporting cast including Plummer Warner Kim Cattrell and Brock Peters is well thought out and constructed. Out of this supporting cast comes the absolutely superb General Chang played by Christopher Plummer.

The personal struggles of Kirk and the Chancellor's daughter and even the violently opposed logical conclusions of two Vulcans in the same circumstances but with differing priorities are all clearly missed by most viewers.  Of course as with James Bond movies Jim Kirk and his crew must save the day and also nicely throw in some minor Star Trek future history trivia with the Khitomer massacre etc.  An excellent story line excellent themes carefully produced and directed this is a science fiction classic on par with Alien Blade Runner and yes much better than any of the Star Wars movies.".

The special effects though not remarkable as in The Wrath of Khan's inyourface effects the effects in this movie generally are good the battle sequences in this movie are just as good as The Wrath of Khan one.Again a nice motif is the scripts placement of Shakespeare quotes into the villain just like Khan in Star Trek II.

	schema:reviewBody "The final Trek for the original crew of the Enterprise restores the talent behind the camera including Star Trek II's Nicholas Meyer as director and thus intelligence and high production values are back on screen after the stagnant Star Trek V. The Undiscovered Country is a generous cut of the franchise's sweet meat though it doesn't hold the same place in my affections as Trek's II III and IV. The story is the series at it's best  a deft allegory of the fall of Soviet Communism with the old cast having to question their old assumptions about those 'Klingon bastards' who are now suing for peace with their Federation foes. The ensuing political double crosses assassinations and space battles are far meatier and more interesting than anything in the previous film and this is all counterbalanced by something approaching poignancy given that the movie represents a final fling for our quasigeriatric heroes. The direction and visual effects are top notch with Meyer getting the best out of the classic cast including a surprisingly descent turn from Shatner who rediscovers a bit of the old magic as a Kirk trying to reconcile his hatred of the enemy and his personal resentment against the practicalities of the peace initiative. Its really his movie though Spock and McCoy have some good moments and Christopher Plummer's General Chang provides prime cut villainy with just a glint in his eye literally just the one eye and a stroke of his Klingon moustache. His propensity to quote Shakespeare is a bit of a hoary old clich for your wouldbe enemy but it works nicely as a hallmark of a man who has invested in the culture of his adversaries in an attempt to best them intellectually. As a military man with an less than honourable agenda he's a far more convincing villain than any megalomaniac hell bent on world domination partially because writers Meyer Nimoy and Flinn understand that the real world grounding of the story invests it with a edge and a credibility that might otherwise be wanting. There are a few false notes  The Enterprise rescue of Kirk and McCoy has always felt a bit too clean and easy for my liking and the purple Klingon blood is just inaccurate for continuity purposes but I'll put my hands up to pedantry on that one. The major faux pas though is the final 'sign off' from the crew in which their signatures are 'written' across the screen. Its not the idea that's wrong its the fact we're looking at the actor's signatures and not those of the characters. It feels like a bit of misstep because it betrays a misunderstanding of the fact that it's the characters that made the series fly not an interest in William Shatner Deforrest Kelly and so on. From the moment I first saw it it never felt right to me but still there you go. Gene Rodenberry just got to see this before he died and a good job too because I think he'd have been satisfied that his original crew had gone out on a something of a high note. He'd also never see the 4 movies that followed with the Next Generation cast and for that alone he may have got out at just the right time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Cold War unleashed a spate of Hollywood films in which Russians defected to the United States The Hunt For Red October Russians and Americans teamed up to fight crime Red Heat shaky peacetalks began between Soviet and US politicians The Undiscovered Country dissident Americans sold defence secrets to the Soviets Falcon and the Snowman and likable America warriors kicked steroid injected Russian ass Rocky 4.Directed by Nicholas Meyer Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country is one of the more interesting of such films. Meyer a director and novelist who imbues his films with a quiet intelligence is of course the man responsible for Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan a film which virtually reinvented Star Trek. Meyer took Melville's Moby Dick several allusions to Hornblower Naval classics and submarine flicks and turned Star Trek into a full blown maritime adventure movie in space. The pretentious technobabble and the soulless FX of Robert Wise's Star Trek The Motion picture it's actually pretty good and the utopian flailings of Trek creator Gene Roddenberry gave way to crowd pleasing action humour screwball banter likable heroes and retro design changes. Elsewhere uniforms were given a more maritime feel battles were staged like nautical encounters crewmen blew whistles torpedoes were loaded like cannons captains talked about rudders and villains wore pirate eyepatches.These changes of course annoyed both Roddenberry and the die hard fanboys. How dare Trek  a series about ideas and social issues  degenerate into a mainstream action movie!? How dare you turn a futuristic fleet of star ships into a jazzed up version of The British Navy each vessel literally piloted by a crew of Red Coats!? It's a valid point until you realise that Meyer was the first artist associated with Trek to have recognised not only that Star Trek was always Hornblower in space but that it was always a fascist and xenophobic franchise. Meyer didn't turn The Federation of Planets into The British Empire with warp drive he merely amplified and questioned what was always there.And so The Undiscovered Country begins by introducing Captain James Kirk William Shatner as an unashamed racist. Having lost his son to a dirty Klingon warrior Kirk hates the Klingons believing them to be vile vulgar violent and always untrustworthy. Of course his crew shares his sentiments. Why wouldn't they? Throughout the TV series the Klingons were cast as token Russian Black and Japanese villains. They were savage barbarians wearing Asian clothes and mostly played by black actors.But when Kirk's ship is chosen to host the peace talks between the Federation US and Klingon Soviet Empires Meyer undermines our preconceptions by portraying the Klingons as a well spoken and sophisticated group adept at quoting Shakespeare and well versed in Earth literature. Far from a band of vile pirates they come across as classy noblemen. Kirk and his merry men meanwhile look like a horde of drunken sailors.Later Meyer deftly toys with his audience's preconceptions teasing us with the possibility that the Klingon's are responsible for a cunning attack on their own ambassador. But what actually unfolds is an elaborate plot started by human Vulcan Romulan and Klingon militarist factions in other words we're all guilty to destabilise any hope of peace between the empires. Old animosities and fears of change are essentially exploited in order to maintain the intergalactic status quo. The status quo being the constant cultural scientific and military superiority of the United Federation of Planets.Beyond its simple parable Country resumes Meyer's fondness for turning his films into altars to classic literature. Dickens Melville Doyle Shakespeare...these are his influences. Watch how he has Spock turn into Sherlock Holmes frantically racing to solve the case of the missing gravity boots. Watch how he pulls the film's title out of Hamlet has bad guys quoting Shakespeare and has characters standing proudly before bookshelves adorned with A Tale of Two Cities. References to Peter Pan the Merchant of Venice The Tempest and the racially themed Guess Who's Coming To Diner give the film a classiness which the franchise typically lacks.Other impressive things abound despite severe budget limitations Meyer's space battles are deliciously spatial his action has a cerebral kick his dialogue is exceptionally well written often screwball always memorable packed with oneliners he makes sure all his cast members are given shining moments and cleverly counters Shatner's theatricality with appropriately theatrical villains. Elsewhere the film features an explosive shockwave which set in stone the look of all future space shockwaves the Star Wars shockwave was only added in 1997.Still the film has two flaws. Firstly the film's lead characters are all ultimately heroes each with their obligatory save the day sequences. You sense that Meyer wants them to be tarnished to be deeply wounded in some way but that these characters have simply become too iconic too mythic to be meddled with. And so all the film's evils are given to token characters Kirk's evils transplanted to a Federation admiral Spock's evils to a Vulcan officer the Klingon's evils to a rouge captain and so forth. Secondly like most science fiction films the film fails in its depiction of alien planets a boring ice planet and alien creatures shape shifters and costumed dogs. But this is mainstream scifi. When you're dealing with swashbuckling space opera dog puppets and ice planets will suffice.8.510  Worth multiple viewings.".

Meyer a director and novelist who imbues his films with a quiet intelligence is of course the man responsible for Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan a film which virtually reinvented Star Trek. Meyer took Melville's Moby Dick several allusions to Hornblower Naval classics and submarine flicks and turned Star Trek into a full blown maritime adventure movie in space. The pretentious technobabble and the soulless FX of Robert Wise's Star Trek The Motion picture it's actually pretty good and the utopian flailings of Trek creator Gene Roddenberry gave way to crowd pleasing action humour screwball banter likable heroes and retro design changes. Elsewhere uniforms were given a more maritime feel battles were staged like nautical encounters crewmen blew whistles torpedoes were loaded like cannons captains talked about rudders and villains wore pirate eyepatches.These changes of course annoyed both Roddenberry and the die hard fanboys. How dare Trek  a series about ideas and social issues  degenerate into a mainstream action movie!? How dare you turn a futuristic fleet of star ships into a jazzed up version of The British Navy each vessel literally piloted by a crew of Red Coats!?

	schema:reviewBody "Ironically Nicholas Meyer also directed the best of the Trek movies and the only one which I think works as a real movie as opposed to a device for vacuuming dollars out of Trekkies' wallets The Wrath of Khan. I guess he just got lucky with that one. Nevertheless bringing him back to rescue the series from the clutches of the Shatnermonster was clearly a good decision. Everyone seems to have been so relieved that they are willing to ignore this movie's many and massive flaws.The core problem here is that the smug selfrighteousness which was always the most obnoxious thing about Star Trek serves as the very basis of the film and is handled in an even more hamhanded manner than it usually is. Funny how no one ever behaves like a racist jerk until a Point needs to be made and then suddenly Starfleet's full of 'em! But that is exacerbated by a constant stream of little idiocies and absurdities Chekov asks if he should raise shields when the Enterprise meets the ship they were expecting to meet. So complete idiots can become officers on the Federation flagship then? The idea of Klingons and humans dining together is treated as a shocking and unprecedented thing even though the end of the previous movie they were shown partying together though it is understandable why everyone wanted to forget that the execrable ST5 existed.Spock just happens to have a stickybacked homing device which he can place on Kirk's shirt when he needs one even though there is no reason at the time for him to be carrying one around.This marvel of 23rdcentury miniaturization is an inch long and half an inch wide and remains clearly visible on the shoulder of Kirk's uniform throughout the entire process of his arrest and trial but the Klingons never notice it.Neither the Enterprise's crew nor even the computer can easily tell from the trajectory of a torpedo whether it came from Enterprise's launchers or a point under her keel? And the neutron surge which could only have come from another ship didn't alert anyone to the presence of another ship until after Kirk and McCoy had been sentenced? I think I see how Chekov kept getting promoted.Apparently gravity boots are not standard equipment on Starfleet vessels with artificial gravity since only the killers will have them. Gee you'd think having a few pairs around would be kind of useful just in case.Valeris demonstrates the Enterprise's alarm system by actually firing a phaser at a pot of food in the galley instead of just explaining it.The guy she's explaining it to is Chekov. That's right the brandnew helm officer is explaining ship operations to an officer who has served on this ship and its predecessor for a quartercentury. Worse she says As you know before explaining it. So what was that idiotic demonstration in aid of exactly? Why not just say The alarms would have gone off? The pot disappears while the food inside it remains even though no Star Trek phaser has ever worked that way before or since. Apparently Meyer thought this would be cool.Uhura comes to investigate the alarm at the head of the security team. That's right the communications officer! And no she doesn't bother calling on the comm system to find out what happened she actually runs down to check it out in person because...uh because they needed an excuse to get Nichelle Nichols into the scene I guess. Then Scotty runs in for the same reason. Apparently only the main guys care about stuff like that and don't have jobs to do.Even though the comm officer is standing right there Spock orders the helm officer to send a false message to Starfleet. Why? Because the helm officer is a Vulcan and it allows them to remind us that Vulcans don't lie unless it's absolutely necessary to the plot.It took that long for someone to notice the bright purple blood on the transporter pad? Can the transporters be accessed by just anyone? And aren't there records? Haven't any number of episode plots turned on transporter records? So Kirk knew about the homing device and didn't even bother moving it to a less conspicuous location? Lucky Klingons are as dumb as humans.I'm not even going to go into the manifest imbecility of the Klingon dictionary scene except to say Books? Printed books?! Why would Spock ask McCoy to help him reprogram a torpedo? Dammit he's a doctor not an engineer! Why can a bunch of people just beam into a secret summit conference with phasers drawn a short time after the Klingon Chancellor was assassinated? You'd think Starfleet and Klingon security would be pretty keen on stopping things like that.Apparently phasers have a rarelyused defenestration setting.I won't mention Colonel ! West since Meyer apparently retained enough sense to cut him from the original release. Stupid movie.".

His script for this one written with partner Denny Martin Flinn and based on an idea by Leonard Nimoy is more than a little obvious and simplistic. In a way it seems almost a throwback to the original relatively unsophisticated TV series all the more surprising in contrast to the literacy and mature sensibilities of KHAN's scenario originally written by Jack B. Sowards and supposedly vastly polished and improved by Meyer's doctoring.What worked especially well in KHAN  the larger than life villainy of Ricardo Montalban's title character eloquently expressed in quotations from Melville among others  is here rather hammily echoed by Christopher Plummer as the Klingon General Chang. Unfortunately his character's ferocity seems designed simply to fulfill the story's requirement of a baddie who can engage in a 'duel of wits' with Kirk as in STII. But there's no backstory and no dramatic connection between the two warriors and to be honest Plummer's overwrought Shakespearean readings become old pretty fast.The parallel between the collapse of the Soviet Union in our time and that of the Klingon Empire in the 23rd century could have been quite effective if dramatized with more subtlety and believability. But again and again the proceedings here are undermined by obviousness and bythenumbers plotting. We get Kirk as an unrepentant Klingonhater who must eventually see the error of his ways. We get the insufferably smug Enterprise officers ? showing disgust at their Klingon guests' table manners. We get a clichd prison camp of horrors. And we get the unintentional comedy of actors who memorize their script and never listen to their fellow actors or the director to come to a consensus on how to pronounce Gorkon.There are a few fine scenes particularly a harrowing demonstration of the power of the Vulcan mindmeld as performed by Nimoy and Kim Cattrall and a funny exchange between DeForest Kelley and Shatner which alludes to Kirk's conspicuous womanizing. But there are also some of the dumbest things you'll ever see in a Star Trek story. How about a starship crewman who doesn't wear shoes? Why? Because he has big clawed feet and can't find a single cobbler in the entire galaxy who can make a pair of boots for him! How about a shapeshifting creature who can not only transform herits body into an exact replica of another person's but manages to perfectly duplicate the clothes as well?! How about the spectacle of the Enterprise officers having foiled an assassination attempt in the nick of time being treated to a round of applause by a bunch of Federation diplomats? Yep these are all just as stupid as they sound.So which is it? Is Meyer a wizard or a hack? And is it Gork'n or Gorkhan?".

Good thing the Enterprise ran into the stupidest Klingon in the galaxy or they might have gotten caught. A pattern is developing. They had to look up Klingon words in books. It's been stated everywhere that books are a very rare thing by the 24th century. Spock gave Kirk a book for his birthday and Kirk was astonished that he found one.

The other Klingons just let them pass without a blink. Kirk should have been filleted on the spot. Here's the killer of her father walking past her to kill someone else.I could go on but I don't want vomit on my keyboard. Trek V may be flawed but it has a good solid story. The direction is also good. The camera is in the right place and everyone is on their spots. What more do you want? The ending was supposed to have gargoyles chasing Kirk after the demon was killed but Paramount got cheap and cut the budget. The scenes with Sybok sharing Spock and McCoy's pain are very powerful. I'm sorry but this is one of the better Trek films. It's certainly better than Insurrection Nemesis and Generations.".

Here's the killer of her father walking past her to kill someone else.I could go on but I don't want vomit on my keyboard. Trek V may be flawed but it has a good solid story. The direction is also good. The camera is in the right place and everyone is on their spots. What more do you want? The ending was supposed to have gargoyles chasing Kirk after the demon was killed but Paramount got cheap and cut the budget. The scenes with Sybok sharing Spock and McCoy's pain are very powerful. I'm sorry but this is one of the better Trek films. It's certainly better than Insurrection Nemesis and Generations.";

In fact if you are a Trek fan I'd skip reading this because you aren't going to like what I have to say.The main problem I had with this film apart from the totally ludicrous ScoobyDoo type unmasking of the would be assassin and Spock's plodding Jessica Fletcher impression is the filmmaker's assumption that the audience is totally stupid.For example towards the end of the film faced with having to find an invisible spaceship a cloaked Warbird no less the crew of the Enterprise come up with the wizard wheeze of attaching some of that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies to a torpedo that will seek out the Klingon ship's exhaust. They hurriedly attach the gear to a torpedo and blow the baddies space ship to bits. Hurrah! This is great  except this is the first mention of the Enterprise carrying all that atmospheric equipment. There was scene at the start of the movie on board a totally different ship commanded by Sulu which had just finished surveying Fiftyfour planets  and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies in which we are told the sensing and analytic equipment worked well but there's no mention of the Enterprise lugging this kind stuff around until the script demands it. This is just lazy. It assumes the audience cannot remember what happened 80 minutes ago. It's insulting. Why didn't they look for the suspicious Neutron emissions that Spock noticed just before the attack? If the Warship was venting Plasma which is very hot why didn't they bung a night sight on their 'sensors' and look in the infrared spectrum? Other moments of stupidity includeThe galley having a gun rack just so a crew member can vapourise a chicken and prove a point about the alarm system. Why the hell would the ship's kitchen need a gun rack? Maybe there is a setting lower than 'stun' for melting the sugar on a Creme Brulet. Who Knows?The assassin's magnetic boots being left in a locker so they could be found later. Why didn't the bad guys just bung them out of an airlock or even better 'transport' them off the ship into the convenient undetectable  invisible space ship hanging about outside. But no this is a Star Trek movie. Only the heroes are allowed to be smart and that is only by comparison so everyone else has to be REALLY stupid. Having found the boots the locker's owner is brought forward and challenged to put them on to see if they fit. The camera pans down the suspect's legs to reveal he has huge webbed feet. Bare huge webbed feet. No socks no shoes just ugly rubber feet. I guess this was supposed to be funny but it just made me think 'Starfleet only provides uniforms for Humans? Oh come on! Grow up people!'And what's all this guff about the Klingons only having 50 years? If Earth's moon exploded with the force that the Klingon homeworld's moon did it  it was a big enough bang to rock a Federation ship light years away  it would have done more than cause deadly pollution of their ozone it would have wiped life of the face of the Earth Mars and any other colonised planets in the Solar System. For years we are told an uneasy peace has been kept along the border between Klingon and Federation space. A Federation ship is warned by the Klingon High Command to Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone! Later when the Enterprise zooms to Kirk's rescue it scoots into Klingon space at top speed with big coloured zoom lines trailing behind it and a loud stereophonic Swoooooosh! on the soundtrack. The Klingon's response? A bored and sleepy guard hails them and asks them who they are. He hails them in voice only mind you  the first time ever in the history of the Trekyverse that I can remember that people haven't communicated via wall to wall TV  because if they had communicated via the usual wall to wall TV the bored and sleepy Klingon guard would have seen he was talking to humans and pushed the panic button  how convenient for our heroes was that! On board the Enterprise Uhura and company frantically page through old Klingon glossaries manuals and dictionaries they just happen to have lying around and bluff their way past the Evil Empire's borders by mumbling We art delivering food... things and...supplies to Rura Penthe... over.... Okay says the guard on you go. And that's it! No passwords no words of the day no sign of any basic military security measures at all. Nothing. So much for the mighty warlike and evil Klingon empire. It's pathetic.At least once during every movie I watch I seem to end up thinking Why did they just do that? only to have to remind myself It's only a movie. Watching this turkey I asked myself the question far more often than I usually do. Too often. There come a point when It's only a movie mutates into Because it's crap. This is crap. Another dumb Star Trek movie only partially redeemed by an excellent score.".

Second the reason that the similarities do not stray into silliness is the acting of William Shatner as Captain Kirk.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite disappointing box office returns for Star Trek V Paramount was originally looking to develop a Star Trek Prequel concept for veteran producer Harve Bennett to direct. However pressure to give the original series cast an opportunity for a moderately budgeted sign off led to Bennett departing the franchise to return to TV producing and gave Leonard Nimoy as executive producer the opportunity to steer this film to completion.He made a reasonably sensible decision to hire Nicholas Meyer who had wrote and directed Star Trek II and helped rewrite the script for Star Trek IV. The addition of producers Steven Charles Jaffe long term Meyer collaborator from both Time After Time The Day After and Volunteers and previous Trek movie's effects producer Ralph Winter meant that a very focused team was formed. This was crucial when trying to get the maximum production value out of an outer space set movie on very limited 30 million budget. The team wisely brought back visual effects houses ILM and VCE the same two companies who had worked on Star Trek II and supplemented by further good work from companies run by exILM workers Matte World and PDI. Like Trek II some effective recycling took place  the reuse of the venerable Klingon Bird of Prey miniature from Treks III IV and V a dusted off and modified USS Excelsiorfrom Treks III and IV the the veteran K'Tinga class cruiser and the USS Enterprise miniatures which had been originally constructed back for the first movie back in 1978!However this recycling would count for nothing if it wasn't for an interesting solid but not without its flaws storyline. The story idea was at is heart very good and typical Trek but while it helps sustain an exciting journey like some previous it glosses over some key plot holes. There are some excellent set pieces  the assassination sequence and the Rura Pente break out sequence are well done aided significantly by Hiro Narita's solid photography and 2nd unit photographer Christopher Fante's work. Narita really brings some great atmosphere to the USS Enterprise bridge  which has not looked as good since Star Trek The Motion Picture. However the limited budget does show and some of the sets do look despite the strenuous efforts of Narita cheap and cheerful and get dangerously close to pulling you out of the picture. This failing together with some dubious plotting regarding the solving of the assassination crime some decidedly uneven direction by Meyer the action finale onset scenes being very poorly choreographed and uneven editing by Ron Roose does mean the film feels a little cheap and dated compared with more slickly made original series cast films such as Star Trek IV and Star Trek The Motion Picture.However these flaws are more than compensated for by some great acting performances. Shatner's grounded slyly amusing introspective and world weary performance as Kirk sets a great tone for the movie and both Nimoy and Deforest Kelley know exactly how to riff off him and are themselves both great. The guest cast interacts with these three very well Michael Dorn in a charismatic if too brief role Kim Cattrall as Vulcan Enterprise science officer Valeris the returning David Warner as Klingon Chancellor Gorkon a very interesting return performance by Star Trek IV's Brock Peters replaying Admiral Carthwright and a terrifically amusing and moustache twirling performance by Chris Plummer as Klingon Military leader Chang. It is the interplay between the core three Trek crew characters and the guests that is the highlight of the film and gets you to overlook the plot flaws and some decidedly broad and OTT performances by the supporting Trek cast and simply allows you to get drawn in and follow these characters through to the end of the film. This journey is hugely assisted by newcomer Cliff Eidelman's thunderous score. Like Horner's work on Trek II this score is a real surprise and elevates the visceral impact of the film far above its relatively small budget. It is an entirely appropriate musical journey complements the story brilliantly and leads you through the climax and end credits leaving you with an overriding sense of nostalgia and a feeling of gratitude for Paramount allowing the original series actors to go out on a high. The music also invokes sense of completeness to the journey and a very subtle hint as to what the future at the time cinematic adventures of the USS Enterprise might hold. In summary a solid and satisfying way to sign off this series with the original cast.".

They have only 1 choice  to join the Federation which will mean an end to 70 years of wars. Admiral James T. Kirk and crew are called upon to help in the negotiations because of their experience of the Klingon race. Peace talks don't quite go to plan and eventually Kirk and McCoy are tried and convicted of assassination and sent to Rura Penthe a snowy hardlabour prison camp. Will they manage to escape ? And will there ever be peace with the Klingons ?I enjoyed bits and pieces of this it really revved up the in intensity level from the woeful part 5 but it's still not to what I had liked. Too many dull moments and talky scenes for my liking to fully succeed. Many questionable moments as well especially regarding the ending. What it does do well is establish the characters well and helps set up the series for even bigger things.Performances. William Shatner is good as our fearless leader once again. The rest of the crew do good as well while familiar faces such as Christian Slater Kim Cattrall Etc.Bottom line. Above average Star Trek film that should appeal to the diehards. I enjoy StarTrek but am not a diehard. Could have done without the inconsistent pacing but hey it beats part 5. Worth a look.6  10".

They have only 1 choice  to join the Federation which will mean an end to 70 years of wars. Admiral James T. Kirk and crew are called upon to help in the negotiations because of their experience of the Klingon race. Peace talks don't quite go to plan and eventually Kirk and McCoy are tried and convicted of assassination and sent to Rura Penthe a snowy hardlabour prison camp. Will they manage to escape ? And will there ever be peace with the Klingons ?I enjoyed bits and pieces of this it really revved up the in intensity level from the woeful part 5 but it's still not to what I had liked. Too many dull moments and talky scenes for my liking to fully succeed. Many questionable moments as well especially regarding the ending.

It goes back to ST IV an entertaining movie that became a borderline screwball comedy almost because it knew it couldn't avoid self parody. The movies seemed to run out of compelling reasons to exist other than to just bring back the old crew.

None of the cast nor crew of the production new that the movie was going to be a giant success. In fact the production lasted less than a week as the entire cast went their separate ways to star in other adult movies that began production the following week. A rip off from the 1972 unknown RatedR movie PROBOWL CHEERLEADERS the movie was originally titled as THE GAMES PEOPLE PLAY. I believe it was named this in order to pull the covers over the idea to many investors and location managers that this movie was an adult  exotic picture. The football field locker room showers and library in the movie were all filmed on campus at Stony Brook University SUNYin New York with the assumption that the Buckley Brothers were filming a movie.....not an adult film! After word on the true nature of the film got out a few members of the schools administration were let go from the University for the embarrassment that the film brought to the school. Bambi Woods who played Debbie went on to do only 3 more adult films before dying of a drug overdose in the mid 80's. It was her innocence as Debbie and the publicity of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders that made Debbie Does Dallas the huge success it is today.".

None of the cast nor crew of the production new that the movie was going to be a giant success. In fact the production lasted less than a week as the entire cast went their separate ways to star in other adult movies that began production the following week. A rip off from the 1972 unknown RatedR movie PROBOWL CHEERLEADERS the movie was originally titled as THE GAMES PEOPLE PLAY. I believe it was named this in order to pull the covers over the idea to many investors and location managers that this movie was an adult  exotic picture. The football field locker room showers and library in the movie were all filmed on campus at Stony Brook University SUNYin New York with the assumption that the Buckley Brothers were filming a movie.....not an adult film! After word on the true nature of the film got out a few members of the schools administration were let go from the University for the embarrassment that the film brought to the school. Bambi Woods who played Debbie went on to do only 3 more adult films before dying of a drug overdose in the mid 80's. It was her innocence as Debbie and the publicity of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders that made Debbie Does Dallas the huge success it is today.";

And I imagine all of them are out of the molds of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I might guess that most of them would give their right arm to spend one night with any of the actresses in the film. One has to remember this movie did not come out of the 2000's. This movie is 30 years old. Much of the technology of today's filmmakers was not available then. As one post commented correctly this film gave some of the Oscar nominated films of the year a run for their money. And it was not even shown in the mainline theaters for the most part. It was one of the many examples of the destructive forces appearing in a film such as this can have on a person. Many actorsactresses have attempted to start by appearing in a nonparticipatory sexual role of an X rated film and some cases a very limited participation such as this one. Bambi experienced a downfall that apparently led to her very untimely death. Kristen DeBell who was in Alice in Wonderland found that even though she was attempting to get into the mainstream films her involvement proved to be her death knoll in the industry. However Julianne Moore who appeared in Boogie Nights didn't suffer the same results. So when we talk about these films we need to realize we are talking about a very volatile unpredictable group of films and participants involved in their making.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film for the first time just now but my memory of it dates back to when I was at school. Some kid was passing around a dodgy video CD of it much to the excitement of my classmates. I never bothered watching it myself...not sure why I guess it just didn't interest me at the time. So now I've seen the schoolboy's porno as an adult and actually it's quite an enjoyable film! For some reason I was expecting this film to be a bit soft and so I was surprised that Debbie Does Dallas doesn't hold back and is easily as dirty as some of the 'hardcore' porn that I've seen. The plot focuses on Debbie Benton a schoolgirl and a cheerleader. She wins a place on the Dallas cheerleading team but unfortunately she doesn't have enough money to get there. This soon becomes an excuse for Debbie and her friend to take their clothes off who'd have thought it? and before long they've realised that they can all pull together and make Debbie the money she needs by forming a business in which they turn tricks for the local men.The thing that sets Debbie Does Dallas apart from other porn films is the fact that the central girls are schoolgirls and this is something that director Jim Clark is keen to impose as much as possible. Of course the fact that this is a porno means that the ideology isn't nearly as important as the sex scenes and that is obvious as the vast majority of the movie is made up of them. One reason why I'm not a massive fan of porn movies is that the pornographic scenes can sometimes bore me but most of the sex here is quite good. I'm guessing the reason why this isn't seen as a hardcore porn film is because most of the sex itself isn't as outrageous as the stuff seen in other films. One thing that annoyed me about the film is that it's called Debbie Does Dallas and I always thought it would be about a woman 'doing' everyone in Dallas...when in fact Debbie never even gets there! Ah I suppose it's not important. All I really wanted from this was a porn film and that's exactly what I got! Overall Debbie Does Dallas is fun to watch and as long as you don't go in expecting a masterpiece you'll be OK.".

	schema:reviewBody "Debbie Does Dallas was a pornographic film that along with its predecessor Deep Throat helped jumpstart the pornographic industry and introduced us to the concept of pornographic chic and the Golden Age of Pornography. Had it no been for this particular film along with others who knows what the porn industry would've stooped to. To paraphrase Ron Jeremy in his documentary Porn Star The Legend of Ron Jeremy the quality of pornographic films during the Golden Age matched the quality of the Bmovies Hollywood was churning out at the time.People constantly ask me when I detour from traditional cinema into the erotic wonders of pornographic cinema how exactly do I review a film of the genre? First off it's incredibly difficult to tackle a contemporary pornographic film from a critic state of mind. Nowadays the films play like the actors and actresses can't wait to take off their clothes. Contemporary pornography forgets the essential element of the project that is the tease. The film must have some dialog to captivate us excite us and arouse us. Not just five minutes of flaunting the body of the female before a fellatio begins. Reviewing a pornographic film from the Golden Age period isn't difficult at all I consider the writing the comedy of the story the kinkiness of the scene and finally whether or not the sex is exciting or simply phonedin on the actors' behalf.The titular character of the film is played by the gorgeous Bambi Woods a blonde innocent young woman who has dreams of trying out for a cheerleader position of the Texas football team actually the Dallas Cowboys although they're never referred to by name because of rights issues. Debbie and her girlfriends are changing in the lockerroom one day with Clark's camera bluntly focusing on the obligatory parts of the female body when they realize their cheersquad has been accepted to tryout for the Texas cheerleaders. The girls must then try and raise the money to commute to Texas on short notice by doing oddjobs for people around town. Debbie in particular gets a job working at a sports store for Mr. Greenfield Richard Balla who is instantly captivated by the beautiful young Debbie. One can only imagine what he wants to do such a young blonde woman.You're likely aware of cheap parodies of pornographic films from decades past that utilize lines such as how could I ever repay you? or what are you gonna do to me? Debbie Does Dallas was likely the direct inspiration for those parodies. The film includes all of the corniness the lameness and the transgressive squareness of pornography in terms of dialog and tone. This isn't a bad thing however and adds to the comedic effect of the film something as stated I feel is greatly missing in the modern porn industry.On that note Debbie Does Dallas is entertaining. Its level of eroticism is pretty basic with the shower orgy and Debbie's sex scene being the notable highlights. I will say however that Clark knows how to appropriately choreograph a sex scene. The scenes are very intimate and run longer than many scenes from the era that I've seen. Scored in a germane fashion  corny and strangely relaxing  by the likes of Gerald Sampler and assisted by the wonderfully charming likes of Woods it's easy to understand why Debbie Does Dallas is the iconic film it is. It defined an age and kickstarted the quirks of pornography that we've grown accustomed to. On that note alone it's worth watching.Starring Bambi Woods Christie Ford Robert Kerman Robin Byrd Herschel Savage Eric Edwards and Arcadia Lake. Directed by Jim Clark.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie begins with our characters the girls cheerleading squad discussing life in the communal locker area. They move this philosophical chatter into the showers and begin washing themselves in every nook and cranny. This promotes excellent personal hygiene and teaches us all to shower on a daily basis. Good message! The girls immediately try to acquire jobs in which to fund their friends trip to Dallaspossible drug habit. We see Debbie our main protagonist entering a sports store think JJB and we are hit with immediate product placement for Adidas the company what makes trainers and shoes. It is in this scene in which we begin to worry for the health of Bambi Woods Debbie. She gives off a very intense stare and has what I call coke eyes. Once again we return to the showers to discuss jobs and life as a whole. It is this showerlocker room that becomes the hub of all activity for the movie and plays a vital role in linking both the story and the scenes. Exposition galore. I was surprised although not shocked to see a series of communal showering scenes with naked men and ladies. I believe that the wardrobe department must have had the day off as there were no clothes to be found between any of them. Despite the nipple slips and buttock showing I personally enjoyed the upbeat musical score that played an integral part in this scene accompanying the communal shower perfectly. However it must be said that the actors playing these high school jocks members of the football team and also tennis were quite obviously played by men in their mid to late 30s. Mustaches galore. Mullets everywhere. Unshaven pubic hair but little to no chest hair. The theme of washing and water continued throughout the flick as we moved on to a home car wash scene which has been replicated in pornspornoskids flicks ever since. This scene involved not only the washing of a lovely Merc but also wasted a lot of materials. Soap and water was thrown over people mostly girls which could lead to water contamination. Again no bras. Wardrobe malfunction again. BLOOPER! The narrative was that these young supple and innocent cheerleaders were offering these nubile unshaven teen bodies to leery unshaven hard men for money. The whole community seemed very willing to partake in this game of prostitution and finances were discussed left right and centre before during and after sexual intercourse shower scenes.A point that I feel needs to be brought up is that these girls were playing almost freely with the law which in our great country I find objectionable. Despite these actors being over the age of 16 and thus legally able to S D's and F D's all with their V's repeatedly it was mentioned several times that they were 16 which is illegal and wrong and immoral and un Christian.Technological slip ups galore in this film which I feel came from setting it in the 70s. It was quite obvious to me that these actors writers and directors were very used to the interactive global communicative world we live in and thus made some very basic errors. Number 1 there was a telephone on a tennis court. How does that even I don't even what? Number 2 a lady who had previously stated she was babysitting that evening told a supple young gentleman to call her despite not giving out any details whatsoever. Basic but easy to spot. Debbie despite being the main protagonist of this film does little to no sexual activity until the very end of the movie. Instead she hangs about places looking almost unable to stand up and very very very coked up. She did in fact almost fall over several times in the film. So in conclusion Debbie Does Dallas contains an unrealistic amount of nudity an unrealistic amount of sex considering the age of these girls a ham fisted and often confusing plot and not enough Doing Dallas four our liking. Considering how this film is often branded as being the greatest kids film of all time we and I felt that this was an absolutely huge anticlimax although at the end of the film Mr Greenfeld does climax all over Debbie. We would score this movie a total of 9.010.0 When asked if you would watch it again we would say YES! Would watch again. I would say this is better than One Week 1920 but probably not as good as next weeks film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is one of the most known adult films of the 70's along with such fare as The Devil in Miss Jones and Deep Throat. The adult film industry kind of took off during this time as the films became more mainstream and less a dirty little secret however while the girls do have a more a more natural look and it is kind of nice that the film's of this era had a plot which built up anticipation overall a lot of films of this time period suffered from lousy camera angles and an incessant need to film the girls doing oral on the guys. Granted they do it a lot these days too but you can fast forward through it and see the same girl receive hers and then the two proceed to have sex. Too many times in the older adult films the scenes only consisted of the guy getting oral and that would be it. You sometimes did not even get to see the girl's boobies. I do not understand why so many adult films do oral scenes I do not really care to see a guy get a blow job. I like seeing the female enjoy herself not the guy. Perhaps women like it and it is for them but then most adult films are geared to the males so why do so many want to see a penis? Honestly if I were a woman I would be a hardcore lesbian I just do not like seeing the male anatomy close up and sucked on.The story is sadly the best part as Debbie really wants to go to Dallas for some sort of cheerleader thing. Well the girls on her cheer squad want to make it happen so they all get some odd jobs so they can pull their money to send Debbie to Dallas. Well Debbie soon learns that one of the most effective ways to earn some money is to do some sexual favors for the perverted guys in their lives! Soon they are making money left and right but Debbie will quickly find out that for the opportunity to sleep with her her boss is willing to pay for the whole trip himself! For an adult film it has some good points. The girls are not as attractive as those found in another adult film of the time Little Girls Blue they are much more attractive than those found in Devil in Miss Jones. Of course that one always featured some of the most unappealing women I have ever seen in an adult film never saw the appeal in that one except it is more artsy than most porn films. The sex scenes in this one are not great. There is not a really nice long sex sequence in this one. There is a shower one where too much is going on then one that starts off good with a girl with a candle but ends flatly and then one last decent one where two girls have sex with a guy and after that there are like three scenes in a row that consist of nothing more than a guy getting oral that I fast forwarded through. That lead to the final scene which was way too rushed considering Debbie is the main attraction of the piece.So there are things about the old time adult films that are good as a lot of the girls do have a more natural look and I do like the story element as it does make you feel anticipation when things begin to heat up but there are so many more problems. A lot of scenes only consist of one activity while in adult films today if there is a girl in a scene you see her do everything so you are not left wishing you had seen a cutie more. The film has a better plot and plays like a sex comedy and at times you forget it is a porno which is not good because despite having a better plot and so on what you came for is the sex and too often it was too rushed and featured too little actual sex!".

This is a hard core porn film so there is plenty of explicit sex.The girls featured in the film are all natural thank goodness and Bambi Woods is especially attractive although we only get to see a good amount of her near the end. There are several scenes for the other girls including the car wash scene which turns into a girlgirlguy scene and another girlgirlguy scene at a candle shop. The shower scene which was two girls and several guys featured a lot of oral sex and in my opinion went on for too long and the guys involved looked more into their thirties and forties than teenage high school jocks.On the whole though the film delivered plenty of sex a plot and although the acting left a lot to be desired this just complemented the humorous tone of the film. One disappointment was that Kasey Rodgers probably the cutest of all the girls seemed to disappear after the shower scene but otherwise the film is a pleasant way of passing 80 minutes.".

Debbie goes to work in a sporting goods store another girl works at a candle shop and so on.Needless to say there are all sorts of contrived situations which lead to the expected in this type of film. The acting is enthusiastic if not terribly skilled and most of the high school students particularly the guys look way too old for their parts but it's actually a reasonably decent movie. The production values are better than those of films with the whole shaky camera found footage variety though that isn't setting the bar that high I'll grant you.This film is available on DVD is is worth watching.

Unlike the others this one was filmed in New York State not California. While The Cheerleaders had plenty of sex to qualify for an X rating this one is definitely triple X territory with all the servicing! Debbie as played by innocently gorgeous blonde Bambi Woods is certainly a stunner and her scenes with a Mr. Greenfield Richard Balla have a perversely playful side to them that I found funny and sexy. I also liked the scenes involving Donna Merril Townsend her boyfriend Tim Bill Barry according to Wikipidia or Paul Hughs according to this site but most likely Herschel Savage and her librarian boss Mr. Biddle Jake Teague. The rest I either wasn't crazy about or weren't as excited about but I mostly liked what I saw. I rarely watch porno films since the kind of scenes in them do get repetitious but it was alright here most of the time. In summary Debbie Does Dallas was fun when it was on Debbie and Donna was not as much on anyone else.".

Downandout former professional PingPong phenom Randy Daytona is sucked into this maelstrom when FBI Agent Rodriguez recruits him for a secret mission. Randy is determined to bounce back and recapture his former glory and to smoke out his father's killer  one of the FBI's Most Wanted archfiend Feng. But after two decades out of the game Randy can't turn his life around and avenge his father's murder without a team of his own. He calls upon the spiritual guidance of blind PingPong sage and restaurateur Wong and the training expertise of Master Wong's wildly sexy niece Maggie both of whom also have a dark history with Feng. All roads lead to Feng's mysterious jungle compound and the most unique PingPong tournaments ever staged. There Randy faces such formidable players as his longago Olympics opponent the stillvicious Karl Wolfschtagg. Can Randy...";

This movie is funny and if you didn't find yourself laughing at it you are probably already dead or on the fast track to ulcers and a stress induced stroke by age 30. This is not the first movie that approached a ridiculous subject in such silly manner. Odds are if you hate movies that have done that in the past ie Dude Where's My Car Blades of Glory Hot Rod etc. you are gonna hate this one as well. As it stands right now this movie has a 4.6 and that probably a little low due to people 1 staring it because they wanted the Saving Private Ryan of ping pong movies. This movie should probably get a rating in the 6.16.3 category. If you have a little time to kill have already seen Super Bad and want a good laugh go check it out. Otherwise wait till it comes out on DVD or just ignore it. As for those who have blasted it. Go blast a movie that actually supposed to be good and isn't as opposed to picking on the 90 lb. asthmatic kid of movies. This movie can't defend itself for being stupid because is supposed to be. If you couldn't tell that from the trailer then odds are you haven't made it this far into my comment.".

I thought it was something like Prince of tennis the liveaction movie and the pingpong ball fights scenes are something like that. That the pingpong ball fights is the thing that attracted me to watch it. But Prince of tennis is better than this. Balls of fury got the comedy and the simple action which becomes a harmless fun movie. I like movies as long as they are fun or entertaining. Balls of fury though fun is considered quite dumb for some mature adults or teenagers the director used stupid jokes like always get hit in the groin and banging into the wall. It has to be stupid to be funny. Sometimes I admit that it is quite dumb in some of the scenes but it is fun it got slowmotion ball fights it got Maggie Q who is hot and it got dumba jokes so what more you want for a dumb comedy.Overall it makes a harmless movie that you can watch in your free time. It can be funny sometime and it too can be dumb sometime. You may laugh or smile at some scenes. I don't know but I smiled when watching it even at the stupidest jokes.

He doesn't deserve a second chance but gets one anyway  encouraged by his coach with words of wisdom like believe in yourself when nobody else does... like now! Maggie Q as his training partner is hot and Chris Walken as Feng adds the eccentric element which fits the colorful scenery. I liked it.";

	schema:headline " Christopher Walken has balls to appear in trash like Balls of Fury";
	schema:reviewBody "If hittothegroin jokes are your cup of tea then look no further than Balls of Fury the newest comedy from the minds behind Reno 911. Not only are there punches to the groin kicks to the groin and paddles to the groin there are even chopsticks and metal spheres to the groin! If on the other hand you're looking for something with a little more comedic value then men being hit in their nether regions avoid Balls of Fury like the plague.The plot which serves no purpose but to string together a multitude of lame jokes follows Randy Daytona a 12 year old ping pong prodigy who is sweeping the ping pong world by storm. Unfortunately he ends up losing an important match becomes a laughing stock and his father who was involved in illegal gambling is murdered.19 years later Daytona played by third rate Jack Black wannabe Dan Fogler is washed up and performing ping pong tricks at a run down theatre. FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez George Lopez who has been assigned to take down Feng Christopher Walken a criminal mastermind who runs an underground ping pong tournament decides to enlist Daytona to help take Feng down. Daytona besides making a comeback in the ping pong circuit wants to get his revenge on Feng who incidentally was responsible for his father's death. So Daytona and Rodriguez go undercover infiltrating Feng's annual ping pong tournament where they...get hit in the balls.There are two very confounding things about Balls of Fury. The first being how a script so utterly bad was green lit and produced. The movies plot doesn't make a lick of sense and ambles on from one random scene to the next. In one moment Daytona and a female ping pong master are shown as hating each other...and out of nowhere a minute later they are suddenly love interests. It would've been nice for the writers to put a little bit of effort in and at least include something leading up to that. Another scene has Daytona refusing to join Rodriguez in taking down Feng only to learn that a water park has been built next to his father's tombstone. How does that provide any motivation for Daytona to strive to take Feng down? The answer is it doesn't as the writers were to busy writing in jokes to develop a good story.This wouldn't be such a big deal if any of the jokes were actually funny. Sadly half of the jokes either involve testicles or an old blind man walking into things or in some instances a combination of the two. It's not funny unless you're 12 years old I wouldn't be surprised if the writer actually was. Not only are the jokes unfunny they've been done hundreds of times before and done much better. When Balls of Fury does manage to include some original jokes it involves stuff like the aforementioned water park being built next to a tombstone which sadly enough is less funny then the blind man falling down a staircase.The second mind boggling thing about this movie is how they managed to stick Christopher Walken in this film as the villain Feng. There are a few other relatively known actors in here but Terry Crews has already been making appearances in terrible movies for a while now Norbit anybody? and Maggie Q still hasn't become a household name. But Christopher Walken? Walken is an amazing actor and it's a crime to see him act in crud like this. He's been in a few duds in the past Envy springs to mind but he's never sunken to this level before. Walken isn't fading out or losing appeal in fact he just had a role in the critical and box office hit Hairspray. How could he read a script that terrible and agree to take on a big role as the villain? The only reasonable answer seems to be that director Ben Garrant blackmailed him into taking it as I've got to much respect for Walken to believe he'd actually willingly agree to.Walken manages to get a few laughs which is an impressive feat in a movie like this and steals every scene he's in. Despite working with crummy material he still puts in a decent comedic performance as Feng far outshining the other actors. Dan Fogler is the least funny leading man since Jimmy Fallon and mugs for the camera every opportunity he gets imitating Jack Black as best as he can. George Lopez and Maggie Q play their roles completely straight which doesn't work in a movie so absurd. By the end of the movie you'll be wishing they axed the main characters and just made a movie about Feng instead.The tagline for Balls of Fury reads A Huge Comedy with Tiny Balls. On the contrary it took a lot of balls to make this movie. It took balls for director Ben Garrant to release the film without Alan Smithee in replace of his name in the credits. It took balls for Christopher Walken to act in this trash and risk losing his credibility as an actor. It took balls for Rogue to screen the film for critics as if they expected any good reviews. Yep it took a lot of balls to make this movie. What it didn't take to make the film was any talent. Balls of Fury is a horrid excuse for a film and if you're looking for a funny movie to see in the theatre go see Superbad or Hot Rod. Hell you can even go see Halloween as a film about a serial killer is bound to be more funny then this trash.".

You have to master equipment speed and spin pressure points and even the occasional cheater. But everyone who tries the sport or comes back to it in later years finds it addictive. It is like catnip for humans. I think many serious players fear that this movie might set our sport back or make it the butt of jokes but I hope many will see this movie and give table tennis a try. Table tennis has been described as a mix of noncontact martial arts and chess and portions of this movie portrayed it as such.

There isn't much outright slapstick which I would have liked. The funny parts are quiet although not particularly subtle. The humour is more from the mild delight of seeing some oldtime character actors like James Hong and Christopher Walken play out some long and slow bits over the course of the movie. Some of the humour also comes from a bit of satire although not of the outright spoof category. Mostly it's just a series of improbable and goofy scenarios silly whimsical and with enough colour and dash to be enjoyable.

I did and I realize it is a dumb movie....but it's fun and it's entertaining. In many respects this is a typical farcical comedy of today with the same ingredients you see in many of them  the same type of outrageous characters everyone in here the typical spy story and Nazi villain will Hollywood move on in that regard? tons of sexual innuendos and scantilyclad babes an uglyand fatmale lead and total absurd humor. It's the latter that I like and I can't recall how many times I laughed out loud at some ridiculous sight or sentence that I saw in here.Walken even though he doesn't play the lead guy is fascinating as always in his typical off thewall role. To me though James Hong an actor in his late '70s just about stole this film as Master Wong the blind instructor. He was flatout hilarious and had a lot of great lines. Of course so did Walken and the film's star Dan Fogler Randy Daytona. and the villain Thomas Lennon as Karl Wolfschtagg. Kudos to Lennon for also cowriting the script.Other reviewers here who wrote silly but entertaining hit it right on the nose. That's what it is and that's what you should expect. Humorwise it is another Dodgeball except now it's pingpong and it's funnier.In addition you get profound words to live by such as To die like a tiger is better than living like a pussy. Hmmmm.".

But it's not exactly aiming high in the first place. Some jokes do get dragged out too long and there are awkward moments. Still as it clocks in at just over an hour and a half it doesn't go on any longer than it should. At its best it does generate some modest chuckles here and there.The cast is really more engaging than their material. Dan Fogler stars as Randy Daytona a star pingpong player at age 12 who gives up the game for 19 years before being persuaded to pick it up again by Federal agent Ernie Rodriguez George Lopez. The Fed needs Randy to infiltrate a tournament presided over by archcriminal Feng Christopher Walken at his most Christopher Walkenesque. It turns out that the bad guy is an avid pingpong fanatic.Working as a spoof of both action movies and sports movies Balls of Fury is agreeably silly at times. Its characters are reasonably endearing and entertaining and it's hard to knock a story written by costar Thomas Lennon who plays the swaggering Kraut Karl Wolfschtagg and director Robert Ben Garant with an affection for the music of Def Leppard.Lots of familiar faces here Maggie Q as the luscious and badass love interest Terry Crews Robert Patrick don't be fooled by his prominent billing he's barely in the thing Diedrich Bader Aisha Tyler CaryHiroyuki Tagawa Jason Scott Lee David Koechner Patton Oswalt David Proval Masi Oka. But it's the legendary character actor James Hong who steals the show in a gem of a comedic performance as the blind Mr. Miyagilike mentor. Walken unsurprisingly is a hoot as the villain.Of course Balls of Fury is no modern classic but sometimes a good nobrainer comedy is just what some people look for to pass the time. It's certainly not as terrible as it's been made out to be.Six out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A good not great comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll start off by saying that I'm in my early 30s ChineseAmerican and played quite a bit of ping pong in my youth. Now on to the movie.I remember the first time I watched competitive ping pong in the Olympics and was amazed by the skills displayed especially at the speed and accuracy of the players. This movie captures that and then takes it to the best levels of spoofing and parody. Any scenes featuring ping pong balls are very amusing in the effects and performance. Sprinkle in some amusing dialog and some physical comedy and you'd probably have a very good movie.However that isn't the whole movie. While not spoiling it too much for people the plot draws heavily from Enter The Dragon and any scenes resembling dialog from Star Wars should probably have hit the cutting room floor.The cast was a good collection of characters including Christopher Walken who plays the bizarre characters to the hilt. James Hong plays his stereotypical role well as always and Dan Fogler was quite good reminding me of the late Chris Farley in many ways. Maggie Q and Aisha Tyler are hot on screen and look for cameos by Heroes' Masi Oka and comedian Patton Oswalt. George Lopez was okay and I'm still trying to figure out how low Jason Scott Lee's career has gotten for his role in this movie.Not a side splitting comedy by any means but provided enough laughs despite higher expectations. It's not as good as Dodgeball or Shaolin Soccer as a comedy so I'd recommend waiting for rental or cable unless you identify with ping pong in some way. So I give it a 610.".

Craig Ice Cube and his cousin DayDay Mike Epps are back for another installment in the Friday series. This time the boys are in South Central and getting ready to celebrate Christmas...until a burgular dressed like Santa Claus Rickey Smiley robs the boys and getting away with their rent money and presents. Craig and DayDay then apply for jobs as security guards when their evil landlady Miss Pearly Bebe Drake demands the rent money in advance or she'll let loose her burly son Damon Terry Crews who has spent 12 years in prison and now likes men. As they adjust to their new job Craig becomes interested in the sexy Donna K.D. Aubert who works at her pimpedout boyfriend's department store. Also featured in the movie are Craig parents John Witherspoon and Anna Maria Horsford Uncle Elroy Don D.C. Curry Pinky Clifton Powell and even Chico the dog who wreaked havoc on Craig and DayDay in Next Friday.This movie was so hilarious and topped the second installment but could never surpass the original Friday simply because of Chris Tucker who played Craig's best friend Smokey. I will definitely go and see this movie again and again until its available to own on DVD. Maybe if there's a fourth Friday Chris Tucker can join Ice Cube and the hilarious Mike Epps. I would love to see those three together.".

Again I thought that Friday After Next turned out to be a great film that had a lot of really funny humor that nearly had me rolling on the floors laughing. Ice Cube did a great job with these stories and made it a Lord of the Rings of the hood type of trilogy. I loved Friday After Next the story rocked and the actors were back and it looked like they had a great time performing together again. I know that this movie is so stereotypical but it was all in good fun you know? Craig and Day Day have jobs as security men in a strip mall and they find themselves being tormented by their land lady for the rent money. When Day Day abuses his power of security and has men go after him for throwing their grandmothers off the corner he and Craig are fired. They decide to throw a party to pay the rent money by charging party fees and Craig does fall for another woman but she's a bit harder to get than the others.I loved the pimp and Damon's characters they were just so funny especially coming out of the party with Damon's partners in a clamp! You'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean. I highly recommend Friday After Next to anyone it's a great movie that I honestly had a good time laughing with and I am not ashamed to admit that I don't get the low rating because this was a fun movie. Please don't judge so harshly you'll find yourself loving every joke better and better.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Having been a fan of the first Friday my expectations for the second one weren't exactly high no pun intended given the fact that Chris Tucker wasn't in it. But it turned out to be an okay movie. I also noticed the direction it took the franchise to  low brow humor. The first had a little bit of it but the second one seemed like it just wanted to gross you out with its sick humor and poop jokes. You won't find much difference in this Friday. Turning the series on its ear and giving it a fresh new spin with the Christmas theme seemed like an intriguing idea. Did it work? Hells yeah. With the uncontrollable Mike Epps once again playing the crazy sidekick to Cube's Craig Chris Tucker seems like a distant memory. Out goes the semiseriousness of the first one about the reality of the hood and in comes the all out craziness that solidified the second. The only memorable characters in this one are Money Mike and Damon. If you're a fan of the series by all means rent it.By the end of the movie you'll ponder if this was the best way to close out the trilogy. Was it as funny as they could make it? Memorable? With a stronger script and more reignedin performances it could have been. Average at best. But let's hope Cube ends it here.".

	schema:reviewBody "The third movie in Ice Cube's Friday series this was the funniest of the three so far. The film takes place on Christmas Eve on a Friday of course. Craig Jones and his cousin DayDay have been robbed by someone going around dressed like Santa Claus and have all their gifts and rent money stolen and their recreational drugs confiscated by the cops. It puts a damper on the day where they have new jobs as mall security officers. So we see them through their day wondering if they'll get their revenge on the burglar and seeing the hilariously overdone sterotypes in the film.Most of the characters from the first two film and their idiosyncrancies are back like Craig's father and his bladder problems. There's also Maz Jobrani's Moly playing a stereotypical Asian character whose broken English was a gas! Probably even more hilarious is the sheer sight of Katt Williams' Money Mike who plays someone that is a cross between Snoop Dogg and Spike Lee. Also I just loved the wardrobe I'd love to get a pimptastic suit. Ice Cube is good here as he plays the only normal character in a world full of crazy people I could feel for him. The acting was overdone but it was done like this on purpose and so I could accept it besides the dialogue was funny. Ice Cube has a superb sense of humour. It's only about 82 minutes so it doesn't overstay its welcome either.And once again Craig proves you don't have to be overly handsome to get the ladies. Very good comedy!".

Friday 337 AM Christmas Eve a lowdown robber dressed as Santa Claus broke into Craig and Day Day's apartment and began stealing their Christmas presents their stereo and just as he was making himself a sandwich Craig discovered him and jumped him. They get into a scuffle. But the Santa had the advantage. He beat Craig with the Christmas tree and got away. At dawn bumbling police officers B. Dix and A. Hole arrive and when they heard these boys were robbed by Santa Claus they were skeptical. As soon as the cops left Craig and Day Day's nasty landlady Miss Pearly arrived and demanded the rent. Unfortunately the rent money was in the stereo that got ripped off. They weren't afraid of her but they were absolutely terrified of her son Damon. He made Deebo look like a pussycat. Damon had just spent 12 years in the pen and now he was out he developed a craving for companionship. Prisonstyle companionship. He also told Craig and Day Day that if they didn't have the rent money by nightfall he was going to really have his way with them.After that Craig and Day Day head for work. That's right the impossible has happened. They finally have jobs. They work as security guards at the outlet mall where their fathers have gone into business. Willie Jones is no longer a dogcatcher and together with his brother Elroy have opened a place called Brothers Barbecue Taste So Good Make You Wanna Slap Your Mama The boys were employed by a man named Moly who ran the entire outlet mall and was the proprietor of flyinfested Holy Moly Donuts Craig and Day Day spent most of the morning arguing in their security booth. Then Day Day accosted and cursed at some old ladies for singing Christmas carols and did the same thing to some kids in front of the toy store. But then outside of the Pimps  Hos clothing store Craig saw a very pretty girl named Donna. He attempted to hit on her but unfortunately Day Day had the same idea so it didn't go too smoothly Day Day and Craig go out back on their break and have a joint. Elroy joins them just then they're held at gun point by the Santa Claus robber! He steals Elroy's Rolex and makes a clean get away. Worse yet a street gang heard what Craig and Day Day did to the carolers and they did not look friendly. Craig and Day Day run like the wind as the gangsters give chase. Fortunately our heroes hide on the roof of Pimps  Hos while the gangsters met up with Moly. They give him a message for Craig and Day Day they beat him up. After that Day Day and Craig decide to quit and soon after Moly fires them Meanwhile Miss Pearly decided to snoop around the Jones' apartment. Luckily Day Day's pit bull Cheeco caught her in the end. Literally.Craig and Day Day's Christmas party would still be held that night but how would they raise their rent money? Craig decided to charge his guests and take up a collection. Willie and Elroy were there Donna came too along with Money Mike local pimp and owner of Pimps  Hos. Day Day's old boss Pinky came and brought some very sexy girls. Damon was there too and he began to take a liking to Money Mike. He followed him into the john. Luckily Mike managed to find Damon's weakness by applying a pair of pliers to his testicles. He takes Damon outside. Craig and Day Day follow. But unfortunately when Mike attempted to get Damon into his car Donna drove off without him and those pliers wouldn't hold for long so a furious Damon chased Money Mike all over the neighborhood. Suddenly Craig spotted the Santa Claus robber and he and Day Day tail him into his hideout where they jump him. Craig beats him with a Christmas tree but then Santa escapes and they chase him all over the neighborhood in and out of yards even houses including that of a mean shotguntoting old man and the unfriendly gangsters from earlier. Santa made it out to the street thinking he got away with it when suddenly he was mowed down by Pinky's chauffeur. Craig and Day Day catch the Kris Kringle criminal and reclaim all their possessions. They leave him tied up on the roof in a sleigh Epilogue Santa remained on the roof for a while Damon chased Mike all over creation and Day Day and Craig gave themselves early Christmas presents and got it on with some FINE girls. Oh yeah.Friday After Next. This movie was hilarious. Just as good as the first two. This is it with the Friday series for now but I hope they make another movie soon. Ice Cube is back as Craig and he's as funny as ever. Mike Epps is back as Day Day and he's a riot. He's also that shotgun toting old man towards the end. Also here John Witherspoon as Willie Don 'D.C.' Curry as Elroy Clifton Powell back as Pinky Katt Williams as Money Mike and K.D. Aubert as Donna. All very good in this movie. As you may have noticed Chris Tucker hasn't returned as Smokey again. Maybe in a future Friday movie or Smokey may have his own movie? Anyway if you've seen Friday and Next Friday then please see Friday After Next. It's hilarious. It's loaded with foul language and fine girls. You won't be disappointed. Friday After Next is topflight entertainment for any day of the week. I recommend it.".

Also here John Witherspoon as Willie Don 'D.C.' Curry as Elroy Clifton Powell back as Pinky Katt Williams as Money Mike and K.D. Aubert as Donna. All very good in this movie. As you may have noticed Chris Tucker hasn't returned as Smokey again. Maybe in a future Friday movie or Smokey may have his own movie? Anyway if you've seen Friday and Next Friday then please see Friday After Next. It's hilarious. It's loaded with foul language and fine girls. You won't be disappointed. Friday After Next is topflight entertainment for any day of the week. I recommend it.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is must see cinema If you can quote all the crazy phrases and dialog from the Original Friday then this one is for you. The saga of cousins Craig and DayDay continues but to really get to the true grit of the film rent or buy the DVD and watch the Infinifilm with all of the deleted scenes. My personal favorite is the deleted scene of how they lose there old job at a nursing home ...that old man that ran the student diner on A Different World is just too damn funny .... The plot is basic ghetto.. . The Christmas bandit that does break ins in a Santa suit is a good subplot. The movie is a true salute to black entrepreneurship. Craig and DayDay parents open up a BBQ restaurant a pimp goes legit and opens a clothing and pimp accessory store Pinky the record store owner from NEXT Friday is still in business and Craig and DayDay show a penchant for party promotion when they throw a rent party at their apartment. But I digress the quotables are some of the funniest one liners in Blaxpo ever. I mean truly I never thought about getting my dick sucked from behind until DayDay mentioned it or ever questioned the motives of church ladies standing in front of a Liquor store singing hymns or carols until DayDay asked them if they were trying to sell pussy in the lords name ...Damn thats Ghetto! Without Chris Tuckers character the Friday franchise moves on. Craig has moved on in life without the neighbor that damn near got him and his family killed. Who wouldn't? But seriously analyze it on its own merits and forget Cris Tucker. One more note that I nearly forgot don't ever see Mike Epps in concert that mofo is not funny doing standup. I paid 58 bucks to find out the hard way. There is a rule in comedy never follow a comedian that has better material than you ... well his ass had No material. The funny guy at work place is funnier and has better material.".

However its probably too long at an hour with its ponderous preaching taking away from any value the film might have had.";

On one hand it contains 100 actual footage from the trial as well as footage from the crime scenes which makes it somewhat special. This footage is never easy to watch and there are some graphic images here of dead bodies including some people that were turned into soap. All of this is used to explain or preach why these men must be either killed or thrown into prison.The second way to judge this is by the fact that it tries to hard to get its message across. I say this because the crimes themselves are enough to make people understand yet this documentary offers up some very overthetop narration which beats the viewer in the head with its message. What's worse is the fact that there's a very very annoying music score that is constantly being overplayed to try and add even more drama.

	schema:headline " Take it from a caver the details are very accurate";
	schema:reviewBody "Sanctum is an action thriller involving exploration of an extensive worldclass cave system in Papua New Guinea. The movie is inspired by an actual flood event in an extensive cave in the Nullarbor Plain of Australia in 1988. It is not a documentary but designed to be a realistic albeit embellished account that includes nonstop action as the team is faced with its deadly situations and decisions. Although released in 2D 3D and IMAX formats Sanctum is not a science fiction or horror movie. There are no monsters weird creatures on humanoid inhabitants such as are found in the recent films The Cave The Cavern and Descent Parts 1 and 2. And it is not a fantasy underground adventure like the recent remakes of Journey to the Center of the Earth and Alice in Wonderland. Sanctum is about caving an adventure sport that is practiced by knowledgeable and safetyminded people throughout the world.Most movie goers may not recognize the authenticity of the techniques and equipment used in the film. As one who has spent over 45 years exploring and studying caves in over 35 states and several countries I am familiar with modern caving in some of the great cave systems on the planet and I personally know many of the cavers who are making new discoveries every year. Therefore I can attest to the great care that the director Alister Grierson and writerproducer Andrew Wight have taken to provide realism to the cave setting. In fact Wight was a survivor of the Nullarbor event and is an experienced caver and diver. That having been said Sanctum takes some liberties to create an exciting story. Nearly every activity in caving is included in this epic such as climbing rappelling and other rope work squeezing and negotiating tight passageways and of course cave diving. This story shows what can go wrong with each of these if care is not taken or if safety is ignored. Sanctum is an adventure thriller that consists of a long string of incidents dilemmas and solutions. Each situation is believable on its own merit and has happened at one time or another in caving. But in Sanctum all of these have been combined one after another and continually pose challenges and demand solutions. It reminds me of the classic and entertaining cliff hanger movies of old. This makes for an exhausting tale in which the audience feels the tense and claustrophobic situations. It is unlikely that such a string of events would ever be encountered by a single caving expedition. However individually accidents do happen although they are relatively rare because cavers strictly abide by established safety rules.What disturbs me is that many of the reviewers of the movie to date miss the point of the film and show an ignorance of what caves and caving are like. Here are some typically unfair remarks and why these are so.There is little character development. Caving is very focused. When you are underground you only think about your surroundings and mission. You do not think about the outside world and your life there much less about your interpersonal relationships with your fellow cavers. It is true that when caving you learn a lot about your compatriots and their personalities just like in the movie but you do belabor interpersonal relationships. Team members are selected based on their proved track record underground. If there are challenges and threatening conditions you focus on those as a team as in the film. Many reviewers apparently wanted more psychodrama among the protagonists.The dialog is terse unrealistic and too loud. I disagree. Under the emergency conditions such as shown in the film the dialog of the characters would be similar. There would be a leader and a plan would develop just as we witnessed in 2010 in the case of the trapped Chilean miners. As for loudness and screaming this is the only way to make yourself heard in the presence of running water in the echoing confines of cave passages. I know this from experience. One's senses in a cave are very much focused on sight and sound and the immediate surroundings. It is a tedious tale. Yes trying to escape through a cave system that is flooding could easily be tedious and given the extent of the cave in Sanctum finding routes and traversing them would take considerable time. Cave exploration is not a fast process. I have been on hundreds of caving trips including some grueling ones in long and complex cave systems. For me the representation of the features in the cave and the techniques of exploration are portrayed quite well in Sanctum. Again this movie is an adventure story that accurately shows what caves are like even though it combines many of the dangers into a thrilling series of unfortunate events. It is a fictional tale but realistically portrayed.Reviewers who expected Sanctum to be a highculture movie or one that explores interpersonal interactions among the characters have missed the point completely. Unless they have gone on trips into extensive and wild caves they have little idea of what caves and caving are really like and what this movie is all about. They can not possibly understand the dynamic among cavers under adverse conditions. I find more faults with the reviewers' logic and understanding than they can legitimately find in the film. The movie stays true to what extensive caves are like and the techniques used to explore them. Given that it is also one heck of an adventure thriller.".

I was tense the whole time and came out feeling like I'd been holding my breath for hours.Seriously most critics seem more interested in showing how cynical and cool they are than actually enjoying a great adventure film. I've read lots of reviews so I'll address a few of the complaints made.Bad dialogue It's not Shakespeare but it sets up the relationships between characters quickly and serves the action well. It also manages to explain the basics of caving and scuba diving which most of the audience would be unfamiliar with without seeming too preachy.Bad acting I thought everyone was pretty great with what they had to do. Again it's not bloody Shakespeare.Predictable not to me. Yes they're stuck in a cave so there's only so many things that can happen. But what does happen is really bloody exciting. I guess if you spend your whole life watching movies as critics do then any action movie would be predictable after a while.Unlikeable characters Um since when did every character have to be likable? And even if you don't particularly like a character surely you don't want them to die a horrible death down a cave. The truth is some of the characters you really like some grow on you and some you almost want to drown with your own bare hands. So a good mix.Weak roles for women I disagree. The women are put in freaky situations and react in human ways. Though I didn't quite understand what happened to Victoria  that's one thing the film could have done slightly better.I've also heard critics complain about too much swearing seriously if you've ever spent time around reallife explorers they're generally not too concerned with social niceties especially in lifeordeath situations. And some reviewers complained that there were no monsters in the cave  seriously! That was what was so great about the story  it was extreme but it all could have happened. Man vs nature and vs each other  much more interesting than another monster flick.Anyway Sanctum is excellent. Go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie although not James Cameron's best is visually exciting and suspenseful. A gripping expedition becomes a race against time and human nature when a group of explorers navigating an immense cave in Papua New Guinea during a cyclone find themselves trapped in what threatens to become a watery tomb. The sometimes melodramatic acting and clichd dialogue tries too hard to construct the nature of each character before the action scenes start to set in the uncompromising and experienced leader the rash and cocky business man the young kid with father issues. There were plenty of chances to let these traits become apparent naturally throughout the script.The acting gets more bearable as the number of characters starts to dwindle a little. What saves this movie is the sense of scale in the scenery the beauty of the natural caves and the realism with which situations become volatile and unmanageable. Overall if you want to see a decent action driven film about of one of the world's last remaining unexplored landforms then Sanctum will probably not disappoint. It could have done without the 3D which seemed unnecessary overkill. Not as good as The Abyss but a similarly excellent visual experience to Avatar unfortunately it comes with a similar level of acting and with momentary exceptions emotional depth.".

To me not in any sense ha ha yes the movie is 3D lousy pun intended.But seriously for two hours you are taken on a brutal subterranean adventure. I liked the fact that it IS believable. It isn't just action  it is a true human drama and shows the good and bad that can come from people in a life or death situation. And I didn't think it was predictable for the most part anyway. I am guessing that the reviewers just didn't like the characters but that is no fault of the actors the characters were quite realistic which I considered a huge plus while others might have preferred something else. I do need to give a disclaimer that I did not research the true story and watched purely from the perspective that it is 100 fiction so I'm not saying this is an accurate depiction of real events. But it sure seemed like something that could happen.It isn't The Black Swan. It isn't True Grit. It won't be sweeping the Academy Awards. But was it entertaining and worth the price admission? Without question  I actually found it more enjoyable and gripping than anything I have seen in some time. Highly recommended  give it a fair chance!".

I was! It was exciting  The cave scenes gave a claustrophobic feel to it and a couple of times I felt quite panicky myself! The photography was stunning enough to take my breath away. The plot was good enough to hold me enthralled right to the end. Of course it was not a particularly original plot but then again very few are and considering the numbers of films being churned out every day we can't be surprised if most of them use and reuse plots.

	schema:reviewBody "The script hovers around Bmovie level the characters are fairly one dimensional. That said the leads do the best they can with the material. Roxburgh is the shining light in this dark cavernous movie. Relative newcomer Wakefield deserves kudos for getting through some physically grueling scenes while giving the stereotypical son with absent father some dimension. Gruffudds character rapidly deteriorates from charming daredevil to crazed selfish psychopath which is boring and predictable. He deserved better. The old standby kills are easily telegraphed. Sanctum is particularly harsh to women. Females best beware taking on the ohsomanly task of cave diving you WILL fail is the message. The only moment of extreme gore is at the half way point. It was the only time there was much response in our packed theater. Do not expect to be moved or feel much connection with the characters or story.On the upside many of the underwater scenes are remarkable. The 3D is not necessary but does add to the claustrophobia and disorientation the characters must battle. The cinematography and editing are fantastic and easily the best part of the film. Would have loved more panoramic establishing shots of the underground environment so that the audience could get a real feel for why these daredevils risked so much. Many of the cave shots and renderings are breathtaking but ultimately there is no heart and soul to either the characters dialogue or plot. There is a reliance on bombastic music to force emotions leaving Sanctum as cold and airless as the caves being explored. In the few scenes where the music was cut and all one could hear was water and breath a larger sense of drama was invoked.Sanctum is inspired by a true story. It would have benefited greatly from a more documentary perspective instead of spiraling into melodrama. The poor script and characterization are ultimately anchors that weigh the film down. Sanctum boasts Cameron but this is no Avatar it's more like the sinking of the Titanic. Final Verdict Skip this and see Cameron's superior The Abyss instead".

	schema:headline " Definitely Better than I was Expecting";
	schema:reviewBody "I was expecting this film to be a lot worse but it was supported by my JC  James Cameron as executive producer and it does have some of the best 3D visuals out there. I praise Alister Grierson for using proper 3D cameras and not only that the ones JC prefers and created. It was a joy to actually watch a proper 3D film and not the hideous post production 3D I have bitched about on numerous occasions. I think the utilizing of JC written everywhere will definitely help this film immensely and to some extent it truly deserves it.Some of the scenes in this film are poetic artwork and sheer beauty and provide some mouth agape splendor. And the 3D really does immerse you in the environment there were moments of vertigo and a constant claustrophobia suffered by myself. The only thing I have struggled to do that I have tried is scuba diving  I chewed through the mouthpiece and kept wanting to rip my mask off  not a cool way to dive . If you can see this one in IMAX 3D then do it  would be totally worth it. The film also has a really worked out plot the story is great although it has been done to death before in different settings it's an escape film like Towering Inferno. In fact think of The Poseidon Adventure minus the boat . If you don't work out who will survive in the first ten minutes then good for you . It is extremely clichd with some obvious flaws  for example the one lady who doesn't wear a wetsuit but wears this huge red outdoor storm gear thing nearly dies of hypothermia and shivers the whole time and yet all the guys are wearing wetsuits although all sleeveless so we can see some flesh and they are always nice and cosily warm. What this film really lacked though was a decent script  some of the lines in this film had me laughing and cringing in equal parts. It really needed someone like Roberto Orci andor Alex Kurtzman from Star Trek fame to flesh it out and make it justifiably awesome. But the script brings a lot of the film to B grade level.Then the other thing that let this film down was one actor Ioan Gruffudd  I could not believe how bad he was in this film. This guys is a lead in Fantastic 4 was in Titanic King Arthur and numerous other films but in this he plays this over the top heavily and badly accented American and it was so badly played he brought the film down a few notches  there were scenes I was hoping he would die so he would be gone from the film. It was shocking. I will say thank god for the two main leads Richard Roxburgh and Rhys Wakefield playing his son. When I first saw the trailer I wasn't too impressed with Roxburgh  he always puts on a silly accent in films and in things like MIssion Impossible 2 he was this hideous bleach headed idiot. But in this film he really pulls it off and I preferred him as a leading man than as a supporting cast member. I found his role very believable and a strength in the film. Then there was Rhys Wakefield I found him great in the film and see a strong future for him following that Australian to US market. He is incredibly attractive and has smoother skin that Just Bieber after a buffing. Josh Wakefield has a superb relationship with his father in the film Frank Roxburgh. It is a love hate make them tough relationship and it developed nicely and made Josh a man by the end of the film. His good looks were quite distractive in some scenes  as Josh is holding someone dying both Paul my viewing partner and myself were going oooh  nice arms. LOL. I am sure this is not what they were after in this scene . He holds the camera well and I look forward to his next role  those Hemsworth boys need to watch out  this guy is coming for all your parts.I think this film will do OK. It is a guilty pleasure action film that requires limited thinking. It will be a teenager's dream film . I think with the combo of JC some great direction in a difficult environment by Alister Grierson and the acting of Roxburgh and Wakefield really made this film a pleasure for me. If Gruffudd was never in this film and the script got a work over this could have been a much much better film. It is out this Thursday Feb 3rd in Australia and I recommend a big screen in 3D. Worth 610. Suss all my reviews at SaltyPopcorn.com ".

The opening scenes gave you a sense of what it is really like to be a cave diver. There were some things that bothered me in the movie such as full face masks and the use of re breathers without a back up air source. Also the fact that the divers didn't have back up lights or line arrows with them. There isn't a true cave diver that would even think of entering a cave without proper equipment however to the general public you wouldn't ever know the difference. All in all a great movie that I will go see again! Ignore the other reviews great movie!".

Maybe the characters are not so deep that you could hope for? They could have build a bit more on their relations between each other. But you always need to have in mind that it's based on reality. I think that makes the movie a much greater experience like when he has to kill his father in the end! Just try to imagine the situation what would you have done to survive? Would you really be able to help a person die if they are in pain by drown them?And that the movie was in awesome 3D didn't make anything worse.Great movie! Great moralities!".

This movie features Australian acting which is funny because I am Australian and the I couldn't even cope with it.Another thing is the scenery.

It had the misleading James Cameron Presents label on the posters but despite the marketing boost this may have produced it also served as an expectationsheightener something this megaflop could've done without. In fact at first glance it's hard to see why Mr Avatar would want to attach his name to a shambles such as this. On a closer look my guess is it might've been a combination of two things his intense love for the extreme depths of the deep blue as witnessed in his multiple underwater docos and the chance to help a relative newcomer in the director's seat Grierson's only other feature film being Kokoda in 2006.Unfortunately the Aussie filmmaker doesn't show anything that would suggest he's one to keep an eye on. The action is unconvincing and the pacing uneven Grierson struggles to effectively frame his shots with flair or excitement. One of the major opening shots featuring a handful of thrillseekers abseiling and parachuting down the 2km deep cave should've sent the adrenaline pumping instead it completely fizzles the first warning sign that Grierson doesn't have a handle on the action. The movie only gets worse from there and even the admittedly decent 3D can't salvage it.Andrew Wight and John Garvin's script is downright atrocious. Both their narrative and dialogue is strictly amateurish. The plot developments and character arcs are laughable predictable and onedimensional. You'll know exactly how the story plays outs well in advance but worse you won't care. The actors aren't given much to work with in way of conversation either Wight and Garvin heavily overdo the True Blue Ocker Aussie jargon and they frustratingly utilise the dialogue as a means of spelling out exactly what each character thinks.They may not get any assistance from the dire screenplay or the unsteady direction however the cast are in embarrassing form and excuse the pun sink to new lows. Home and Awayer Wakefield proves his thespian skills are more appropriately aligned with extraordinarily crappy soapies his melodramatic acting unsuited to the big screen. The former Mr Fantastic Gruffudd is stilted and wooden as the smarmy American playboy despite having the advantage of not being required to talk like a bogan from Western Sydney. And the usually reliable Roxburgh  with the most humiliating performance of the lot  lazily growls his way through the absurd role of the tough and bitter oldhand leading the way.The first bona fide dud of 2011 has arrived.1 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Fine 3  Good 4  Great 5  Brilliant".

As it turns the 3D stood for a Trifecta of terrible as in terrible screenplay terrible dialog and terrible acting. No amount of 3D eye candy and visual treats could make up for this clunker of a story and the high school thespian quality acting. The movie painfully drags on for 109 slow motion minutes and while the premise of the movie was for the hapless cast to escape from a flooded cave I was hoping in vain they would suddenly drown all at once and be done with the movie. Sadly that didn't happen and the actual result was easily predicted from the beginning of the movie. While the amateur quality acting caused severe eyerolling every single character was a loathsome cardboard caricature and when I wasn't snoozing I wanted to reach out and slap them silly as they recited obnoxious clichs and emoted on cue. On the positive side the cinematography was sufficiently good to keep me from walking out of the middle of the movie.".

You're gradually waiting for something to happen. When it does however there is actual focus on each individual character that has a dark fate. It wasn't that original but it did have some new things that I hadn't seen before. I expected another Vertical Limit or Cliffhanger. It played with some of those ideas but did veered into another direction with them. One in particular I guarantee you'll be cringing more than you ever have in a rock climbing film. If you're looking for an instant classic than stay home but if you're looking for something that is going to be better than your recent remakes take a chance. I also enjoyed the 3D although I still don't think we need have to have it in films today. It just gave me a bigger headache than the one I went in with. Still it had better 3D than most of the films that is just layered in 3D and not shot with actual cameras. This isn't a PG13th film so expect so dark moments.".

The acting is not amazing and the dialogue was a little subpar but this was made up for with the technical realism of the SCUBA diving and the breathtaking pun intended scenery. As a SCUBA diver I am a little biased towards liking this film. There are very few movies produces by Hollywood that even come close to displaying the level of realism of the SCUBA in this movie. There are some absurd moments for sure but in general the movie gets it down well. The cave system for me was the best feature of the movie it is absolutely gorgeous. This movie may be a pass for many but if you can spare the time  money and love exploration it is worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Poltergeist was released in 1982 there were a lot of assumptions from certain quarters that the credited director Tobe Hooper was not actually the real director and that ownership of the picture actually belonged to the Executive Producer Steven Spielberg. One look at Poltergeist and it's easy to see why some would think that. If you actually subscribe to the idea of the 'auteur' theory then it's obvious Spielberg's stamp is on every frame. What's that got to do with Sanctum? A lot actually In 1989 James Cameron made the brilliant and criminally underrated movie 'The Abyss'. It was met by mixed reviews despite being that rare animal in Hollywood an original story. It was also a slow burner of a film taking its time to rev up before cutting loose and racking up the tension  kind of like a lot of Cameron's films actually. We have a similar scenario here an underwater epic that's very Cameronesque in every sense of the word except it's directed by someone else a director by the name of Alister Grierson. So how much of the movie can be attributed to James and how much of it is Alister's? It's anyone's guess. But like the aforementioned Poltergeist it's got the Cameron branding iron on every frame.Sanctum tells the gripping story apparently 'based' on real events  somewhat loosely one would imagine of a group of cave explorers led by veteran adventurer Frank Richard Roxburgh who becomes stranded in a deep network of caves after a tsunami strikes the surface. Unfortunately for them their surroundings become engulfed by the deluge of water from the jungle above forcing them to flee from the rapidly rising waters and try to make their way to where the caves exit to the ocean. Decisions that were made earlier with perhaps a lot less foresight than there should have been comes back to haunt them... Ten fold Worse for Frank his estranged son Josh Rhys Wakefield is also along for the expedition putting additional stress and even more guilt on him but it makes him even more determined to guide everyone to safety. As you can imagine their efforts don't go entirely to plan and everything goes pear shaped after that.It's fair to say Sanctum take its time setting up the story and the characters. For a moment you wonder where it's all going then something happens that's along the lines of a certain famous scene in 'The Abyss' and you're immediately sucked into the story from that point onwards. The movie reels you in drags you down and very rarely lets you up for air. The slow build is necessary when you see what comes after it it's virtually one crisis after another after another with Director Grierson doing a great job ratcheting up the tension to stunning levels. Just when you think it can't get any worse for the protagonists some other dastardly thing happens to them. It's great filmmaking and it's sustained for the entire running time. You're on the edge of your seat right to the very end.The entire cast is very good but Richard Roxburgh really stands out. At first he's not really too likable and maybe even a bit too gritty and steely but once that veneer is cracked you get to really like the guy. In fact it's the entire fatherson thing that gives this movie such gravitas. Without it it would be just another 'lost in caves' flick. Ioan Gruffudd last seen working for Cameron in Titanic plays a totally different beast here and does a sort of a comic book turn but adds something else for the cast to go up against besides the deadly caverns.The films says a lot about the human spirit and what happens to it when we find ourselves cornered like animals in life or death scenarios. It ably gets across how savage we are capable of becoming once the instinct for survival overtakes us. Some very effective scenes demonstrate this where decisions are made that can be deemed wrong or right  depending on your viewpoint. Nothing is black and white. There is no clearly set out rules when it comes to trying to get yourself out of a predicament alive.The use of 3D here is subtle and effective. While there's no debris being hurled in your face every few minutes the 3D seems to bring the water engulfed caverns closer to your eyes. You almost think that if you reached out with your hand you would actually touch water. The tunnels open up effectively in some shots while being disquieting tight and cramped in others.As mentioned previously this still looks like a James Cameron movie. So much so in fact you can't help but wonder why he didn't actually direct it. It has the whole underwater theme like 'The Abyss'  even the scuba helmets and dialog underwater reminds you of that fact. Like a lot of his movies  from 'The Terminator' right up to 'Avatar' it starts off slow slow before abruptly shifting into gear. Even the poster is pure Cameron. Heck even the title lettering has the same little glimmer of light that was on 'The Abyss' poster  you'd almost be forgiven for thinking this is some sort of sequel.But that doesn't detract from the movie in any way. Sanctum is a terrific and very exciting film. While deeply claustrophobic and at times unsettling it remains entertaining on every level. It's a movie that if you let it hook you it won't let you go. As with 'The Abyss' it will probably divide a lot people's opinions but also as with 'The Abyss' its popularity will inevitably grow over time. But that's no excuse for missing it on the big screen now. See it. In 3D. Just don't have an Abyss style injustice happen for the second time. It doesn't deserve it. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the beginning of Michael Douglas's thereaftergigantic career he plays Carl Dixon a freespirit during the Vietnam era who returns from New York college life to a rural farm family that's harbored proud fighting men since the Civil War.The first act of HAIL HERO! has Carl entering into his small Southern hometown with the kind of jovial personality that embodies aimless sarcastic abandon first playing bull and matador with a truckload of Mexican workers and eventually being misunderstood by his uptight father who gives him a nice clean haircut right away.The best scenes involve blond starlet Deborah Winters who that same year played a teenage rebel badtripping on acid in THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR. Here's she's a promiscuous country girl with a crush on Carl and a past relationship with his older brother Frank...In the thankless straight man role Peter Strauss might as well be Nick Nolte's uptight brother in RICH MAN POOR MAN. Strauss's Frank was crippled because of Carl and holds a grudge that enters into the final act taking place at a big party where generations collide. But it's one prolonged segment with Douglas and Winters splashing around in a swimming hole wearing close to nothing that provides something for either sex to enjoy.Unlike many counterculture flicks HERO is never too preachy or annoyingly idealistic. The soundtrack is large and brassy and the acting including veterans Arthur Kennedy and Teresa Wright is topnotch. Meanwhile the sporadic use of muted flashbacks of important memories  like Carl's father having an affair with the Spanish maid and the accident that changed Frank's life  make this rare curio more interesting that it sometimes deserves to be.Dated and ultimately stagey with a really bizarre and pointless midsection where Frank smokes pot with a hermit woman in a cave what's really important is the introduction of Micheal Douglas proving as the son of legendary Kirk Douglas that he could hold his own.".

OK Pete doesn't have a big role in this and he spends half of it in his customary handsonhips pose but he does it so well!!As for the nonStraussian parts of the film Watching it for the first time here in 2011 on an old VHS I could really feel the atmosphere of 1969. It was confusing for a lot of the contemporary youth and the culture was something of a mishmash mess. I'd have hated it as I wouldn't have a clue where I stood and I guess that's why Michael Douglas's character first comes off as a naive clueless ass. I didn't think I'd like this film. It's not a plot I could personally identify with but I was certainly engaged by it. I could almost feel Carl growing up or at least shucking off his youthful naievete and finally understanding at least some of the crazy adult world he seeks approval from. I have friends who served in the US forces during Vietnam and what they told me of society's mentality back then seems really well reflected in the characters' mindsets. A very interesting journey and a film I will be watching again sometime!".

	schema:reviewBody "Right offI'll mention that I cannot believe this movie15 years after the public debut of DVD'sis still not available in the format. I won a VHS copy of it from Ebay nobody bid against mebig shock. I thankfully had the great experience of seeing on late night TV in 2000 somewhat edited for content of course. The reason for tuning in thenlike most here was that it is Michael Douglases debut feature.Michael does an excellent job here of playing and balancing a youngidealisticantiwar protester who at the same time is still trying to win the approval of his old fashioned fatherby doing...of all things...volunteering to go off to Vietnam! He's also trying to find a way to mend fences with his brother and maybe open the eyes of his motherwho seems to want to avoid such things like real life issues or her son's thoughts or feelings. Douglas's arrival back to the family homeis a great way to show how directly between man  boy his character is. He almost playfully romps around the place and is beyond joy when reunited with his dog. Some might think this is too sunshiney but I loved it...we should all be so happy to come back home. Unfortuantly after thathe findsof coursethat nothing has changed.His brother feeling Douglas's character caused his accident a couple of years ago is none to thrilled to see him. His father immediately gives him a haircut in the kitchen because he disapproves of his son being a long haired hippie  looking like a girl. His mother still handles things the same old wayby not handling them or acknowledging her son's point of view. She's also fooling around with a man behind her husband's back which Douglas later discovers.  Douglas saysdoes and tries many ways to make certain things understood to his family  former neighbors but also to take him seriously about his having signed up to go to war. I totally loved his tense standoff with one of his father's friends in the family living room. The home exterior set looks a bit dated looking like right out of a 50s moviefilmed on a sound stage. The real outdoor shots are much bettergiving a better sense of a real place and situation. These two things combined thoughkind of show where Amercia was then. In a struggle between old  new values and also the opposing stands on Vietnam and other realities the country was dealing with. The only reason I'm rating this a 9 instead of a 10is that while I get the ending of the filmit just seems a bit hurried. Without giving the ending awayDouglas's youth makes one more grand poignant demonstration and right after thisit goes to freezeframethe closing theme playsand the brief credits roll. I guess I felt there could have been at least another 15 to 20 minutes more that could have been done here. Just to have a more defined ending but maybe Im wrong  that's what the filmmaker was gong for. Point madeend film.I also love that Gordon Lightfoot does the title song HailHero at the start and ends with a then newer version of his 60s classic Wherefore And WhySonine stars out of ten. A great debut for Michael Douglaswith even better things to come after. The rest of the cast did a great job as well. Once again thoughto concludethis really needs to be put outon a real DVD. Real meaning digitally restored picture and sound and subtitles andor closed captioning  or both. This is Douglases debutafter all. It deserves a better status than VHS on Ebay! END .".

Barely anyone I know has even heard of this movie and it's quite saddening. Although it has won numerous awards and lots of prestige in Canada where it was made I've often seen it lying on the shelf untouched at Blockbuster or gay film shops.The movie begins with a prisoner named Simone who requests that a specific priest come to hear his confession. The priest perplexed as to why he has been summoned arrives at the prison not knowing what to expect. It is soon divulged that the priest has some confessing of his own to be done when the prisoners trap him in his confessional box and begin to perform a play. This play is about Simone's childhood when Simone was attending a Catholic allboys boarding school and was in a gay relationship with his schoolmate Valier. They keep their love clandestine until another schoolmate Bilodeau the priest as an adolescent unearths something of what the two lovers have been doing. He confronts them about it calling them a disease when it is revealed later that he is more insidious than they are.Things take another dramatic turn when Simone's father discovers his son has kissed a boy and mutilates his body with a whip. Out of searing rage Simone succombs to arson. A Parisian woman who is portrayed by a male actor because the play is being performed by male prisoners visits the schoool and falls in love with Simone. Despite the distinctely male features on her which expose the actor's gender the he does an excellent job of emulating a pristine romantic woman desperately seeking love.Simone repudiates Valier saying it's time he started thinking about girls and that he plans to marry the Parisian woman. Valier is devastated and runs to his mother who is scorned by the rest of society because she believes herself to be a countess. She is shockingly compassionate and supportive when she learns of Valier's homosexuality. At the engagement banquet for Simone and his fiancee Valier sabotages the celebration by dressing like a Greek God and reciting a monologue from the romantic Greek play he and his beloved were rehearsing together in the beginning of the film. And I can't tell you the rest. It'll ruin it. All I know is everyone should see this movieespecially gay Catholics.

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone does things they would rather forget. Lilies is about one man's horrible sin returning to haunt him 40 years after the fact. As a rash child young Jean Bilodeau did all he could to seperate gay lovers Simon and Vallier not for any highminded moralistic reason but out of his own jealousy and desire for Simon. 40 years later Bilodeau and Simon meet again and witness their history performed by prisoners in a Quebecois jail. What results is heartwrenching and beautiful. The cinematography of Lilies is flawless moving effortlessly between 1952 and 1912 with lush vivid colours. The performances are also excellent with Brent Carver a notable standout as Vallier's deluded mother as the movie is a play set in a jail we see the male prisoners perform all of the roles including the female ones. Jason Cadieux and Danny Gilmore are beautiful as the young lovers going through the awkward pangs of adolesense coming out and first love. A truly beautiful movie for anyone who loves a good cinematic experience I cannot recommend Lilies enough.".

When watching the movie from the beginning it doesn't take a moron to realize that the play is being put on by inmates at a prison.Staying true to the setting of the play the movie uses males to play all roles including the roles of women.  It is unique as the characters in the play react and respond to the female roles as if they were women and not men playing women's roles.There is an incredible depth to the movie that chronicles the life and love lost by Simone through the deception and lies of the church.  There is much more meaning here than just the plight of one man.  The movie tell the story of many men and women around the world who are persecuted imprisoned and often sacrifice their lives for being true to their love of the same sex.  It is good to see a movie that does not portray a same sex relationship as one of casual sex or onenight stands.  The relationship is one of committment of trust of pain and caring of going through the good and the bad together.  Heterosexuals do not have the corner on good relationships.  This movie tries to portray the love between two people and the struggles they faced largely due to the intolerance and rigidity of the church.".

	schema:reviewBody ".... I'll catch the conscience of the Bishop to paraphrase Hamlet. 'Lilies' is a morality play about love murder and retribution  three themes that have dominated classical drama for millennia.  But although it borrows heavily from Shakespeare and classical Greek drama 'Lilies' is in many ways new and experimental also.  The manner in which the scenes of the hauntingly beautiful imaginary landscape of northern Quebec are interleaved with the somber gray of the real prison set in which the play within a play unfolds is nothing short of brilliant. I've never seen anything quite like it in a movie before.The events that form the core of the play took place in Roberval Quebec in the summer of 1912  Two boys Simon and Vallier find themselves madly in love with each other while rehearsing a school production of The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian.  Their passion does not go unnoticed however  Simon's father flogs him mercilessly and their schoolmate Bilodeau watches them with increasing envy.  In a final fit of rage when Simon rebuffs him Bilodeau exacts a horrible revenge on the two lovers.  Justice eventually catches up with Bilodeau however when he is held hostage in the local prison and forced to watch a play written by Simon and performed by the inmates that depicts the events of that fateful summer forty years earlier.I really can't find much to fault about this movie  other than it's length  at only 90 minutes it seemed too short.  For the most part the acting was superb with special notice going to Brent Carver as the piteous Countess de Telly.  In many ways his portrayal of her reminded me of an aging Ophelia and one soon forgets that he is a man playing a woman's role. On a scale of 1 to 10 I rate 'Lilies' at 9.5. It is definitely a movie that should be viewed more than once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never trust a confession that a childhood friend wants to make to you because more than likely it comes with an entire onslaught of a carefully planned stage adaptation of the reason he hates you so much. That's the blueprint for Michel Marc Bouchard's play of the same name. It at first looked to me to be a little stylized like some of Marguerite Duras' short novels  The Ravishment of Lol Stein for example  but once the movie takes off a thing that happens quite immediately it draws you in.A seamless transition from past events and the present staged events in the prison facility where the older Bilodeau now a Bishop has gone to hear this confession makes the entirety of the movie. LILIES evolves with the surety of a mystery even when we know something pretty bad has happened between the Bishop and the prisoner Simon who hates his guts but it's like a marvelous puzzle worth solving  you can't turn away.It seems in 1912 two boys loved each other very much. Simon and Vallier were carefree mindless of what anyone else would think. Played by the young Canadian actors Jason Cadieux and Danny Gilmore they look perfectly matched and complement each other Cadieux being the more masculine and therefore dominant Gilmore being the feminine more malleable and romantic man desperately and unabashedly in love.But as it goes with people in love regardless the gender I will always state that there is always a monkey wrench. That is Bilodeau a man with his own designs on Simon who the very thought of him kissing another man drives him crazy with rage and who bellows left and right that the two of them are involved in something sick and evil. Played by Matthew Ferguson he makes you literally hate this character his manic glee in denouncing their love his prayers that Simon see the error of his ways are only matched by what I recall being Winona Ryder's ferocious performance in THE CRUCIBLE or Bonita Granville's openly evil character in THESE THREE.In Bilodeau the film has its villain even when in the middle of the movie his character somewhat stands by the sidelines and watches the progressive separation between Simon and Vallier due to other circumstances. The arrival of a personality LydieAnne played by Alexander Chapman and her subsequent engagement to Simon throws in a deeper wrench  she is unaware of Simon's true desires and even more unaware that Bilodeau is conspiring to do some grievous harm. Alexander Chapman is pretty compelling to watch as this socialite I couldn't see a man in drag as much as a brittle woman who knew her way around people seeing him play his male counterpart as events shift back to the present is watching a completely different person altogether.The same can't go for Brent Carver who plays another prison inmate and the Countess de Lilly. As the Countess he comes across at times as a more subdued Katharine Hepburn in THE African QUEEN but also as a man in drag. Even so his is an interesting character to see because it requires a lot of control not to chew scenery when the opportunity presents itself  which is often especially in a scene involving some pretty sharp dialog exchanges with Chapman. Even so his death scene is very moving more so due to the circumstances in which it takes place. That it makes Valliers's and Simon's bond stronger is compelling.Where I believe the movie  and probably the play I haven't read it so I must assume the movie is faithful to the material  fails is at its climax. While I'm not surprised at the revelation of who the Bishop is  many men of the cloth are little more than perverts usurping as the Voice of God because they can't face their own realities  his own punishment comes off as vague. It's as if the movie didn't know how to exact justice against him. In my world the Bishop would have been tormented until the skin would have peeled off his body  eye for an eye. But maybe it's best to leave him alone. I can see why Simon even then wouldn't allow himself to dirty his hands with such human garbage. It would be best to let Life take care of this type of person they always die alone and riddled with their inner cancer.LILIES is a compelling watch. I loved its passion its fearlessness in representing gay love even at the moment of tragedy. Coming nine years prior to BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN it should share the honor of being a movie that was aimed at an audience ready to accept men professing love to each other free of selfloathing and cultural constraints.".

Jason Cadieux is gorgeous beyond words.The movie is quite obviously set in a prison where there would be a lack of women. It is quite artistic. The use of men to play women is both campy and artsy hearkening back to Shakespeare. It is not done to get laughs however.The twist in the movie is that the man who is to give his confession hears a confession. It ends in a way that you must make up your mind about the punishment.".

Jason Cadieux is gorgeous beyond words.The movie is quite obviously set in a prison where there would be a lack of women. It is quite artistic. The use of men to play women is both campy and artsy hearkening back to Shakespeare. It is not done to get laughs however.The twist in the movie is that the man who is to give his confession hears a confession. It ends in a way that you must make up your mind about the punishment.";

It is Simone who is the sinner here but the writer would rather not see that and blames some smitten waiter for all the crimes of humanity.

Simon is in love with Vallier in 1919 Quebec. It seems that everyone knows that these boys are in love and they turn a blind eye to the boys except their classmate Bilodieu. Throughout the film Bilodieu hounds the boys and snobbishly turns his nose up to them when he is not condemning them for the mortal sin of homosexuality. All of the characters in this film are played by men since the play is being put on in a prison. Especially notable are Brent Carver as the Countess De Tilly and Alexander Chapman as LydieAnne Vallier's mother.

The terrible bitterness of homophobia is shown in a way that makes one realize how great a crime it is to hate love.I was amazed at the fine acting and the way the imaginative recreations of the events of 1912 melt into the prison setting of 1952 and back again. I found the males acting the female parts to be quite convincing and much of the time forgot they were really males.The actors who played Vallier and Simon are to be congratulated for their courage and ability to be totally convincing as young men in love  Vallier as the embodiment of undying affection and Simon as a youth who must struggle with the truth of his sexual identity and his heart's deepest longing. The actor who played the countess is also very moving and able to portray a wisdom and truth that transcend the slight insanity of that character.I've watched the DVD a dozen times now and weep for love every time when Vallier reads his letter and during the engagement party scene and during the bathtub scene.Bishop Bilodeau's character is also played well and reveals defense mechanisms like layers of an onion. The film is quite relevant in light of the Church scandals of late.If you buy this film you will never regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "LILIES based on a Canadian play 'Les feluettes' by Michel Marc Bouchard has been adapted to the screen by Bouchard and placed in the sensitive hands of director John Greyson an artist who is able to indulge in surrealism with reality and make it work well. This very beautiful film is cast entirely with men despite the fact that there are women roles in the story. How does he make that work successfully without pandering to artiness? View this little film and make the discovery for your self.Set in Quebec in a prison Bishop Bilodeau Marcel Sabourin has been summoned form the outside to hear the confession of 'a very sick man' who has been imprisoned for 40 years for a murder. Upon the Bishop's arrival the audience knows something is amiss despite the atmosphere of the prison as a stage accompanied by choral singing of plainsong The Hilliard Ensemble there are props and images that seem out of place in a grim prison. The Bishop is ushered into the confessional booth and when he opens the window to hear confession the person in the seat is Simon Aubert Pallascio the 'very sick' man who has planned for the bishop to watch a play depicting the 40 year old crime  a reverse on the confessional stance.Through a small aperture in the bishop's now locked confessional the Bishop is forced to watch a reenactment of the incident 40 years ago when two young boys Simon Jason Cadieux and Vallier Danny Gilmore were in love and the young future Bishop Matthew Ferguson was jealous of Vallier's attention from Simon and played a key role in 'murder' of Vallier that resulted in Simon's being accused and imprisoned. The atmosphere leading up to this act includes the reaction from the small town's homophobia and to Simon's sexual ambiguity that involves a strange lady LydieAnne Alexander Chapman who arrives form Paris via an air balloon. It is the interaction of the boys with the townsfolk the new lady arrival who desires Simon's affections and Vallier's understanding and selfsacrificing mother Countess De Tilly Brent Carver that leads to the fateful death of Simon. How the story ends in the confessional booth reversal is the beauty of the film that must be left unsaid for the drama to affect potential audiences of this movie.The cast is all male because the whole story is a miseenscene a play within a play where all parts are acted by the prisoners for the sake of displaying truth to the Bishop. There is no pretense at making the men look like women except for the costumes and this enhances the message of the story. The actors are excellent and the impact of the story is powerful. Yes this is a highly honored gaythemed film but it is really more about the power of love both in youths and in thwarted adults that makes it a film for all audiences. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "LILIES based on a Canadian play 'Les feluettes' by Michel Marc Bouchard has been adapted to the screen by Bouchard and placed in the sensitive hands of director John Greyson an artist who is able to indulge in surrealism with reality and make it work well. This very beautiful film is cast entirely with men despite the fact that there are women roles in the story. How does he make that work successfully without pandering to artiness? View this little film and make the discovery for your self.Set in Quebec in a prison Bishop Bilodeau Marcel Sabourin has been summoned form the outside to hear the confession of 'a very sick man' who has been imprisoned for 40 years for a murder. Upon the Bishop's arrival the audience knows something is amiss despite the atmosphere of the prison as a stage accompanied by choral singing of plainsong The Hilliard Ensemble there are props and images that seem out of place in a grim prison. The Bishop is ushered into the confessional booth and when he opens the window to hear confession the person in the seat is Simon Aubert Pallascio the 'very sick' man who has planned for the bishop to watch a play depicting the 40 year old crime  a reverse on the confessional stance.Through a small aperture in the bishop's now locked confessional the Bishop is forced to watch a reenactment of the incident 40 years ago when two young boys Simon Jason Cadieux and Vallier Danny Gilmore were in love and the young future Bishop Matthew Ferguson was jealous of Vallier's attention from Simon and played a key role in 'murder' of Vallier that resulted in Simon's being accused and imprisoned. The atmosphere leading up to this act includes the reaction from the small town's homophobia and to Simon's sexual ambiguity that involves a strange lady LydieAnne Alexander Chapman who arrives form Paris via an air balloon. It is the interaction of the boys with the townsfolk the new lady arrival who desires Simon's affections and Vallier's understanding and selfsacrificing mother Countess De Tilly Brent Carver that leads to the fateful death of Simon. How the story ends in the confessional booth reversal is the beauty of the film that must be left unsaid for the drama to affect potential audiences of this movie.The cast is all male because the whole story is a miseenscene a play within a play where all parts are acted by the prisoners for the sake of displaying truth to the Bishop. There is no pretense at making the men look like women except for the costumes and this enhances the message of the story. The actors are excellent and the impact of the story is powerful. Yes this is a highly honored gaythemed film but it is really more about the power of love both in youths and in thwarted adults that makes it a film for all audiences. Highly Recommended.

It was also great how the male actors a la mode Shakespeare played all the female roles. What was so good about that was that they didn't do so as hyperfemale drag queens but simply as actors. after a while the viewer forgets that sex of the actors and focuses on the characters. I was surprised that this illusion held up despite several removals from the narrative when we are transported back to the present and the prison chapel and we see the actors as they really are. somehow the film keeps us from being jarred out of the movie and we once again are transported back to 1912. a profoundly moving story.".

This hourlong film was not RKO's attempt at a main exhibit  that would have been something along the lines of that year's Flying Down to Rio. All of the studios made short little films like this as filler for matinees  much like afternoon TV programming.The film starts out with a young steel town couple Jim and Anna Stanley Charles Bickford and Irene Dunne just before they get married. Anne has big dreams of getting away from the mills Jim is content to go along as things are. After they marry Anna takes in boarders and saves up Jim's sizable paychecks so they can get out of this place although at the time she doesn't have a plan. Her chance comes when quiet and studious boarder Joe Zarcovia Eric Linden comes up with a chemical process for making dye from waste from the steel making process. For some reason Anna seems to believe that her big hunk of steelmaking husband is a genius at business and that he can make a fortune from this formula. Given we only have 58 minutes for our story of course she is right. Thus the chemist and the Stanleys go into business together and soon are fabulously rich. The Stanleys have everything including a little son. Unfortunately in the case of Jim you can take the man out of steeltown but you can't take the steeltown of the man. Soon he's on a spree that involves heavy drinking another woman that for some reason insists on marriage rather than just the cushy keptwoman lifestyle she has in New York City and then the business begins to suffer.This film is so short that quite a few things don't make sense. For one thing the message of the picture seems to be that the Stanleys are made for each other regardless of what happens in spite of the fact that these two seem to be two very different people who want very different things out of life. Anna is supposed to be the epitome of a loyal woman although considering what she's put through by her husband she seems more like a doormat by the end of the film. Then there is Jim's golden business acumen that seems to come out of nowhere  he has done manual labor his whole life and probably didn't even finish high school.From a historical standpoint I found one fact to be just plain ironic. In the beginning of the film Anna is sitting on the porch of her little company town house telling Jim how she didn't want to be just another generation in generations of steel town wives. She talks about how if she and Jim got married all they would have to look forward to is a house supplied by the company and Jim employed by the mill doing the same thing until he retired. Although she seems to think this is all very dull how much so many people living in these now largely abandoned steel towns today would give to have this kind of dullness brought back to their lives  a guarantee of a living wage throughout their adult lives with some degree of loyalty by their employer.This one is worth your time if it comes your way  just don't expect Gone With the Wind.".

Perfect that is until Bickford starts running around with a moneyhungry tramp who urges him to dump his longsuffering wifeleading to a supermelodramatic conclusion in the courtroom.I love old movies so it takes a lot to turn me off of any film from Hollywood's Golden Age...but this terrible film managed to do it. Despite having the excellent Irene Dunne in the lead this film just isn't worth your timemostly because the last 20 minutes of the film manage to undo any good feelings I had for the rest of the movie! Here's the problem. Irene Dunne is the perfect wife in this film...too perfectMary Poppins perfect. Even when Bickford proves that he's a wretched jerk and cheats on her Dunne is like some sort of saint and she refuses to divorce him. Then when Bickford and his sleazy lawyer drum up fake charges that SHE is committing adultery Dunne is just too sweet to really fight back. In a courtroom scene that is just too melodramatic to be true her ultimate niceness convinces the evil Bickford to admit it is all a frameup and he is taken away to prison.The worst part about this terribly overthetop scene is not the silly way Bickford now stricken with guilt jumps up and admits the truth though this is a ridiculous scene but the way that lawyer J. Carrol Naish is allowed to attack Dunne on the witness stand! Even courts in the old Soviet Union might flinch at such a browbeatingand yet her lawyer never objects and the judge seems content to preside over a sham of a hearing! This is just the sort of film they should show young law students in order to elicit a few laughs at all the histrionics.Believe me that there are thousands of better films out there from the 1930s waiting to be discovered. Try almost ANY film of the era and you're bound to be better off than with this silly dud. And additionally almost any other Dunne film is better than this creaky old pile of...melodrama.".

Bickford was the typical blue collar kick your ass kind of actor and usually played to that type. Irene Dunne an elegant nononsense actress was cast in parts befitting her appearance and persona. So whose idea was it to put her in a steel mill town Pittsburgh or the surrounding area running a boarding house and married to the best steel worker in the mill? It boggles the mind!!The story line is equally incredible. A character who seems to come from another world played by Eric Linden invents a marvelous dye in his attic laboratory sells it to somebody and everybody gets as rich as Croesus. Then things begin to go horribly wrong. Bickford gets involved with a woman of indeterminate ethnicity played by Gwili Andre. Andre is a footnote to Hollywood history. Bizarrely beautiful in profile and a dog in full face she never made the grade in Tinsletown and ended up a tragic figure who committed suicide by selfimmolation. The denouement of the film is the bitter court room divorce proceeding that takes an unexpected twist when the selfsacrificing Dunne pulls a fast one on her straying husband. He sees the error of his ways. He has lost his fortune so its back to the steel mill for him where Dunne is waiting with open arms. It's just too good to be true and all this sweetness may cause you to develop an immediate case of diabetes.Dunne finally broke away from these types of roles with Theodora Goes Wild and other screwball comediesfinding the character type that she is remembered for with delight.

	schema:headline " Just Awful  The Most Sexist Film of the 1930's";
	schema:reviewBody "NO OTHER WOMAN started out as an interesting drama of a young woman and man in a steel town in love but with different ideas and different levels of intellect but startlingly turned midpoint into the most sexist film of the 1930's with a jawdropping climax matched only by an equally outrageous finale.Irene Dunne is a lovely sensitive young woman in a steel town in love with the somewhat likable but coarse Charles Bickford. Irene dreams of escaping this dead end life but Bickford has no dreams other than being a big shot at the plant. Irene finds a soul mate in the somewhat younger Eric Linden who studies and experiments with formulas on the side which Bickford ridicules. Dunne and Bickford marry but Irene hasn't quite given up on her dreams taking in boarders and pennypinching for the day they can move away. When Linden tells her of his discovery of a permanent dye she is thrilled that this may be their chance and wants to invest in it. Unfortunately Bickford has had an apparent bad day at the plant and comes home in an angry mood and they have a big fight apparently their first and Bickford storms out to get good and drunk.Repentful the next day he listens again to Irene's idea and becomes enthusiastic when he sees Eric's formula first hand and they start a business that brings them all fortune within a few years. Eventually the couple have a son but Bickford's business ventures keeps him away from home more often than not. While in New York he falls into the lure of predatory Gwili Andre and they have a longrunning affair which climaxes in Andre eventually demanding they end it or he leave Irene to marry her. After initial resistance Bickford agrees but Irene even after being publicly ridiculed everyone knows about the affair it seems refuses to grant him a divorce because she loves him to much to let him go.Things really start to get nasty when Bickford then sues her for divorce alleging adultery on HER part and dragging her through the mud with paidoff witnesses who claim knowledge about Irene's affair. Masochistic Irene however refuses to bring out HER knowledge about his affair into the proceedings since she is fighting the divorce. Bickford's lawyer paints her as a grasping moneyloving woman and even her earlier savings are used against her as proof of her love of money quite oblivious to the fact that this money was the means to build Bickford's fortune. When Bickford's lawyer announces Bickford is seeking full custody of their son and startled Irene erratically admits to the affair and then in hysteria proclaims their son is not Bickford's no doubt in a desperate attempt to keep the child. Bickford finally is broken by his own selfishness and announces to the judge his story has all been a lie. Bickford is sentenced to a year in jail and their business collapses into bankruptcy over the scandal. Once released Bickford goes back to work as a steel miller and is startled to find an allforgiving Irene waiting to take him back as are his old friends including Linden whom he has obviously also driven into bankruptcy.This is the ugliest love story I have ever seen in a film! Based on a 1916 play this jawdropping tale of a woman who loves no matter what is just pathetic and it's horrible to see the lovely Irene Dunne in such a degrading role. This movie is ridiculous beyond belief. How is Irene able to save over 6000 in a few years from her lowerworking class husband's salary in the 1920's even with taking in boarders? How is the crude unambitious and unschooled Bickford able to have the brains to get a major corporation off the ground? Bickford gets only a year for such blatant premeditated perjury? And frankly given his selfish core I couldn't help but think his ultimate confession was not caused by shame over what he had done to his wife but the possibility that his son would not be recognized as his own. The only good things I can think of saying about this film is the atmosphere in the early scenes is excellent fully capturing the hot steamy ambiance in a steel town and Irene looks a vision in the glamorous fashions during the rich years. Seeing this beautiful intelligent woman degraded with this story was too much for me but frankly I was just as disgusted with her character's allforgiving attitude. Bickford gives a tired rather over the top performance and it's no surprise he wasn't used very often as a leading man. Watching this unpleasant travesty would make even the most devoted film archivist wish this one were among the lost films.".

Marred by poor stilted acting particularly by Bickford what may have been a better film is simply too pat with an overly melodramatic ending.Realizing the film itself is more than 70 years old it's hard to fault the plot by itself one which has been done so many times in various forms since it's rather simplistic and common. The film which runs less than an hour also features one of the Gwili Andre's few performances as the titled woman.Jim Stanley Bickford is a big burly steel worker who takes home more than everyone else. His girlfriend Anna Dunne dreams of better things ways to escape the steel company town which claimed her father with another slight thinking young man Joe Zarcovia Eric Linden. Though Anna vows she'll never marry a steel worker Jim's animal magnetism overwhelms her and the next thing you know they're being married. Jim's best friend Eli Bogavitch Christian Rub brags that no man can give more money a traditional dowry celebration? to the bride as he pins some bills to her dress to have the second after the groom dance. Each attendant man in succession does the same until her dress is littered with bills.But Anna sticks to a plan saves excess money scrimps saves and even takes in boarders until after two years the Stanley's have over 6000 in the bank.

He proceeds to take his paycheck and blows it drinking and cavorting all night with another woman. When he returns home past 2 AM Anna is heartbroken. But she's ready to forgive him the next day and an apologetic Jim is excited to hear about Joe's invention. Jim turns out to be a whiz of a businessman such that within 5 years he's parlayed the dye business into a multimillion dollar operation large enough to acquire his biggest competitor for 4 million.Of course now that he's made something of himself with a wife and child back home in Pittsburgh Jim falls for a blonde Margot Van Dearing Andre such that he hardly returns home from New York anymore. Misunderstood by her lawyer friend Bonelli J. Carrol Naish Margot has designs on Jim and manipulates him into asking Anna for a divorce so that he can marry her.

He proceeds to take his paycheck and blows it drinking and cavorting all night with another woman. When he returns home past 2 AM Anna is heartbroken. But she's ready to forgive him the next day and an apologetic Jim is excited to hear about Joe's invention.

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Bickford was certainly a great character actor but in the early 1930's his brawny macho personality made him appear to be brutish brooding and illtempered. He's a rather unlikable fellow so it seems difficult to swallow the fact that the sweet longsuffering Irene Dunne would fall for him and agree to marry him. Unhappy in his work at a steel factory he gets viciously drunk one night after verbally abusing his wife and shows up in the middle of the night with some floozy before passing out. The next morning of course he's all contrite and agrees to go into partnership with Dunne's brother Eric Linden making a fortune. But being well off doesn't change his demeanor and soon he finds himself in the arms of the seductive Gwili Andre who has motivations of her own that aren't so honorable. In the meantime Dunne continues to make a nice home for Bickford and their young son without any appreciation from her brute of a husband.Probably one of the first films to insinuate spousal abuse this is a very difficult film to watch because as noble as Dunne's character is she isn't stupid. This is also one of the first films I saw many years ago and recalled hating. Giving it a second chance I found it perhaps not to be truly awful but really without any entertainment value. Certainly the drama is there giving it a strong plot but I really see no sense in Dunne's character pleading with Bickford to think things over before making a rash decision as if he was thinking of just changing a job. She really shows no emotion in her confrontation but it isn't Dunne's fault since the script makes her character out to be more noble than any woman could ever hope to be. It really becomes downright absurd when Bickford's divorce attorney makes it appear that Dunne was guilty of infidelity not him! Leila Bennett gives an obnoxious performance as Dunne's shrill housekeeper who always gives her two cents without being asked for it. You may find yourself with a headache once this film ends if you make it that far.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my old English teachers once asked us about a book Did you all like the book? I'm not asking whether you enjoyed it I don't care. I want to know if you liked it. She was making an important distinction.I remembered that as I watched PunchDrunk Love. It's very unusual. The film is set in L.A. but you don't see much scenery indicating that. You see unpleasant things. Adam Sandler's office is long and empty just seeing him sitting at his desk assaults you with a feeling of loneliness not because of any sappy musicbut because of the set and the camera work. He walks out into a neverending warehouse it feels empty brutal. He exits the warehouse and you see another unending sight the row of garagelike doors of all the other warehouses. It feels like it lasts forever this row of doors and when Adam gets to the end of it he looks out onto a long straight industrial empty street. It looks HORRIBLE but why? Nothing is happening on the street there are no gruesome sights no particular signs of squalor or anything and yet you feel repulsed hopeless alone. Then out of the distance a car whizzes by nothing unusual but it feels abrasive. With no relation at all to the plot just as it appears this car hits something and explodes its remains slide off into the distance and you see nothing more of it. It's trivial. But you feel like the movie is being hostile toward YOU the viewer.Yes that's the best way I can put it you feel like the movie is being hostile toward YOU. A few minutes later a truck flies by again very abrasively and drops a harmonium in front of Adam Sandler. There is no rhyme or reason to this it just happens and it's all very unpleasant.About a third of the way through the video my phone rang. I told my friend what I was watching and she asked how it was. I told her I can't decide. I'm not sure I like it. I kept watching. At the end I understood. What I had meant to tell my friend was that I wasn't enjoying it. And I wasn't meant to.The film starts out with a very bad point in Adam Sandler's life. He is neurotic you want to kill his sisters even though they're not malicious per se he is lonely his life is unpleasant. This movie is trying to do more than TELL you it's unpleasant and even more than SHOW you it's unpleasant the movie is trying to get inside you and make you FEEL it. You seriously feel the abrasiveness of every image every sound every character you feel accosted by it. When there's silence it's brutal silence. When there are sounds they're brutal sounds. Images and movements are abrasive. Until Adam's life begins to flourish then you get pretty sounds pretty colorsas the viewer you're let off the hook too.So when it was over I was in amazement. How many movies succeed at this at taking you WITH them to the discomfort the character is living? The cinematography the sound work the scriptnone of it is any accident. When his life isn't going well you FEEL it. Did I like the movie? Very much. And if you appreciate a very unusual take on an old topic you will too.".

No one that nice would keep seeing a wacko like Sandler's character in here but that's the movies for you. In most cases you have to suspend your belief.The storyline whether pleasant or very unpleasant got me involved and the camerawork in here was interesting too.

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this at the New York film festival and my expectations were about as low as they could be. I was never a huge Adam Sandler fan and I hadn't ever taken a liking to PT Anderson's other films. I thought that Magnolia was pretty flimsy writingwise and I also thought that it got way too much undue attention when it came out.I couldn't believe how great Punch Drunk Love was. It seems to be the polar opposite of Magnolia. Where Magnolia was sprawling messy and often generic Punch Drunk Love is short tight and completely fresh. It reminded me of Fargo in a way. It centers on a very small cadre of characters it's incredibly focused and it creates its own world for those characters to live and move around in.It's been mentioned here before but the art direction is stunning. I haven't seen such memorable visuals since The Royal Tenenbaums. In a grocery store scene the items are stacked vertically by color echoing the color bars that appear periodically between scenes making the scene appear otherworldly. Other sets are bare of color or distinction. Sandler's love interest in the film played by Emily Watson lives in a maze of white corridors. Somehow every place in the film has its own character and association. Even the characters become associated with particular colors.The movie ends up being genuinely romantic while deviating completely from the very stale paradigm for romantic comedies of the last decade Watson's character pursues Barry Egan their inability to hit it off from the start is more characterdriven and psychological than situational. Through the use of bizarre props and surreal scenes the anxiety and frustration of Barry Egan becomes totally absorbing and affecting.This is a wonderfully directed film. There isn't an extraneous moment. The visual style and pacing are particularly great. There's an interesting subtext in the film about communication  enormous background noise while characters are on the phone Barry Egan's sisters' voices create this wall of noise all voices making fun of him telephones figure predominantly the opening scene is completely bereft of background noise or music. There are a lot of interesting things to consider when it comes to the theme of communication and how sound is handled in the film.That said I'm already cringing at how most people are going to react to this. The Adam Sandler fans might find it too weird. People who liked PT Anderson's other movies might find it too pretensious. I was thrilled to have my low expectations completely overturned.

After his twin masterpieces Boogie Nights and Magnolia not to mention the surehanded and satisfying Hard Eight we knew he was a filmmaker of skill and magic.

This man had taken Mark Wahlberg and turned him into someone we could be proud to watch onscreen. He cast icon Tom Cruise gave him the character of Frank T.J. Mackey and directed the actor to one of the most repulsive offensive and inspired performances of the Top Gun star's career. So I was pretty confident in his ability to handle the star of Little Nicky. But boy I still wasn't prepared for what I saw. Sandler just wasn't good he was INCREDIBLE. I couldn't believe my eyeshere was the man behind Eight Crazy Nights creating a completely realized utterly human character with a studied nuanced performance. Many have commented on the fact that Barry Egan Sandler's character is not that different from his previous incarnations. Socially akward and prone to explosive violence Barry might just be the key to explainging Sandler's Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. The character helps shine a light on the inner torment of those manchildren.The plot is a bit more complicated than your usual romanticcomedy fair. First off it's really not a comedy. Second off the two major playersSandler and Emily Watson as the beautiful and mysterious Lena Leonardboth have quirks and tension that ordinary movie characters who fall in love don't in movies today. Barry has been terribly scarred perhaps irreperably by the constant torment and abuse of his seven sisters. There are several scenes where he bursts into destructive rages for no real reasonto sum it up this guy has problems. Lena seems to have some of the same hurt simmering under her but she controls it and accepts Barry for who he is eventually coming to a stage where she understands him better than anyone truly ever has. Much of PunchDrunk Love's story is how Egan manages to regain control of himself and experience truly human feelings for the first time. Lena is his salvationthrough his devotion to her he saves himself.The film's other specifics are a bizarre but extremely original mix of details. Barry is a toiletplunger salesman. He one day wanders onto a loophole in a snackfoods sponsored contest that would allow him to get enough frequent flier miles to never have to pay for a plane ticket again. First however is the nasty business with a smalltime porn entrepeneur in Utah who is trying to extort a large sum of money from Barry using the company's Four Blonde Brothers to threaten the for a time hapless Egan. The film is so utterly free that to reveal how these disparate elements come together would ruin the movie. Much of the joy of PunchDrunk Love is that you never truly know where the movie is going to go next.The performances are uniformly excellent. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the heavy but he puts a small line of tragedy in his character. Dean Trumbell seems fierce but a telling look at his empire reveals he is all bark and no bite. The alwaysgreat Luis Guzman is Sandler's wellwishing coworker Lance who is constantly supportive of Barry despite his doubts about what is really going on inside his boss's head. And Emily Watson is appropriately fascinating and quietly alluring as Lena who drops her car off one day and admits the next she did it just to meet Barry.The film might seem weird and violent but this is truly one of the sweetest movies I have seen at a long time. At its core PDL is decent honest and beautiful. It is reminiscent of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas which despite its rampant drug use and other disturbing subject matter was a film that had a heart of gold. One of the best of 2002 PunchDrunk Love will be seen in the future as a shining moment for all involved. Here's to hoping it will also be seen as the beginning of Adam Sandler's serious film career.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of P.T. Anderson's work since I saw Boogie Nights' about 3 times in one week at the theater years ago I anxiously awaited the release of his latest film.  Then I heard it starred Adam Sandler who is one of my least favorite actors of all time but even then I figured that if anyone is going to make me not want to start throwing things at Sandler's image it would be Anderson.  After all he got me to respect Tom Cruise after seeing Magnolia'.  When I finally got to see the film this past weekend after wanting to see the film for about a year I wasn't disappointed and I found that my trust was not misplaced.  Anderson took Sandler and turned him into a sad sack who is so psychologically screwed up he would be an analyst's dream.  Emily Watson is his perfect counterpart as a classy yet extremely quirky love interest.  The content is pure P.T. Anderson.  There are issues that are brought up that are completely bizarre and unexplained and there are themes that are culled from reallife stories or incidents.  Stylistically it's a slight departure in that it isn't quite as flashy or slick' as his last two films but the bright primary colors that pervade the cinematography are absolutely beautiful.  And instead of the steady 70's and 80's soundtrack that he usually utilizes he kept it more simple this time and just as inspired with the continuous running of He Needs Me' from the Popeye' soundtrack. That touch was not only fitting but also simply brilliant. I love the work of P.T. Anderson and was absolutely charmed and endeared to this film.  Just like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' isn't going to make me watch a Jim Carrey comedy I'm still going to avoid Adam Sandler comedies like the plague but I have to say that I respect him for his work in this film.  This is the kind of romance film I like and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't settle for the kind of romantic comedydramas that are churned out now by Hollywood.Shelly".

I must admit I was sceptical of Adam Sandler playing a serious part. But he makes fantastic interpretation of his character Barry Egan a small business owner pushed around by his seven ! sisters  who's miserable life takes a turn when he meets love in Emily Watson's character. Watson makes a beautiful portrait of the mysterious and lonely Lena who falls in love with Barry.The movie isn't just well acted it's also magnificent to watch. The camerawork is exquisite and Anderson really shows of his visual talent. Every frame in the one and a half hour film could be frozen and displayed as a piece of art. But the most impressive thing in the film is still Adam Sandler. Every word expression and nuance is perfect and genuine. If this doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination I don't now what will. His performance is superior to the last five winners.Punch Drunk Love is the way a movie should be. It's the way you wish all movies were like and I wish I could hang it on my wall.

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Thomas Anderson's PunchDrunk Love is a fascinating film. Perhaps 2002's best movie  and one of the best dramaromanticcomedies to ever hit the silver screen.PT Anderson is an absolute genius. A talented and master filmmaker. Boogie Nights and Magnolia two of Anderson's previous films were absolutely stunning. Boogie Nights in particular was a complete masterpiece. And PunchDrunk Love is no exception another great piece of filmmaking by what is quickly becoming one of the world's top Directors. I can't wait for whatever he does next.Also it's difficult to overstate the performance of Adam Sandler. I'm confident this will go down in history as his best work. Ironically I thought I'd never see this movie because of Sandler starring in it. I ONLY watched it because of my respect for PT Anderson  and I still waited 3 years to see it!. I enjoy most of Sandler's nonromantic comedies but I couldn't even imagine him in a romantic movie I thought he would be horrible. I couldn't have been more wrong. I wasn't prepared for such a great performance as he stole the show from the opening scene. I can't remember ever being more surprised with the lead actor in a movie. He was simply great a truly terrific performance.On the flip side Emily Watson as the caring Lena was wonderful as well. I've got the feeling we will be seeing much more of her as she had a breakout performance here in PDL. I thought at first that she almost looked too beautiful to put up with the antics of someone like Sandler's character as she would be in high demand with the males but then we see the quirky side of her as well and it all comes together. Great touch.I recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 25. If you're a teenager who's hoping for a few laughs from Sandler you're going to be gravely disappointed. Buy the movie store it in your closet and pull it out when you reach 30  and you'll love it! And please don't let romantic comedy scare you as it does me. I almost REFUSE to watch romantic comedies but this one is much different. Romance and comedy surely aren't the first things that come to mind when I think of this film. It's a drama full of tension and embarrassment. It's an uplifting yet shocking movie. To the intellectual mind I can't recommend it enough.Thank you for reading!...JD".

With films like Billy Madison Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy under his belt one would think that he would stick with what he's got. Sandler has shown us a new side of him with his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love.Sandler plays Barry Egan an ambitious man who owns and operates his own business. He sells his own plungers. One day after finishing a phone call with a food company he walks outside to find a tiny piano someone dropped on the side of the road. He runs after it and puts it in his office. Then shortly after he meets Lena Leonard Emily Watson who needs help with her car. Being the nice guy he is he complies.Barry Egan is a great guy. He is nice and is trying his best to do well. With seven sisters he faces the brunt of their vicious wrath that they unintentionally place upon him. With embarrassing stories of growing up and how they teased him Barry has a little built up anger that he uses here and there like his sister's sliding glass door. Barry means well but man can he do damage.When lonely one night Barry calls a sex line for just someone to talk to. What he ends up getting himself into is a huge scandal with the operator of the sex line due to the fact that he gave his credit card number to them and everything they need to know to get money from him. On top of this Barry has found a way to cheat the food company he talks to in the beginning. The deal is getting free frequentflyer miles due to a deal the company has on all of their items...including individual pudding cups. Barry pounces on the opportunity by buying as many 25 cent cups as he can so he can fly anywhere for free.With an interesting plot and a great performance by both Sandler and Watson this film is bound to make an impact. Sandler's more dramatic side shows giving us a glimpse at the real actor behind all of the goofy nonsense we have come to love over the years. It was really refreshing to see a comedian do a really good job acting in a serious role. It reminded me of Jim Carey is The Truman Show. Serious yet still able to crack a joke much like Sandler in this film.Anderson is no newcomer when it comes to movies. He has written and directed a couple of gems. Boogie Nights and Magnolia are two he both wrote and directed and came out great. This movie is no different. It's unique style with interesting choices for music give the picture an edge.If Sandler keeps landing roles like this he could potentially put himself in position for an Oscar nomination much like Bill Murray did with Lost in Translation. That's not to say he shouldn't make his regular comedies but a nice blend would be great. Punch Drunk Love is a knockout!".

This film portrays the story of a man who escapes his misery in a newly found self esteem and with love.It was an absolute joy to see Adam Sander in a role of such depth and complexity. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds a little bit of his unlimited talent to the show in a role that defined the ending of the movie.'PunchDrunk Love' is the best movie the Coen brothers never made. It is smart and rewarding. The pleasant surprise of 2002.1010";

We went along because he was so competent a borrower and because the target was a metaphoric texture not a drama. That texture in both films explicitly included films in the plots so at least there was some reference for the borrowed bits.But here he attempts something more ambitious in terms of mood and he focuses on a single life. The two complaints borrowing and mood only suppressed for earlier films become stronger here. The result is unwatchable.His metaphoric fabulism works when all it has to do is sustain a mood. But here he uses it to convey a message. More precisely he chooses the form of dramatic romance which by its selection demands some content some purpose. That purpose is missing. At the end all we are left with is the feeling that we were only supposed to laugh and marvel at this character study.' This may have been fair but there is no clue at all through the film that it is just an empty spacefiller in fact just the opposite is promised. So we patiently wait for the deft realization of the emotional anchor and it never arrives. Watch Exotica' for a similar voyage through emotional shoals but one that takes us to the other side a new vista.The obvious borrowing is annoying as well and this is what kills it for me. An interesting filmmaker in his third major project should have developed his own style. But no. In 2000 Karwai Wong changed the face of film with his In the Mood for Love.' It invented a new camera eye one that was anticipative highly mobile. It had an attention deficit and focused primarily on the comings and goings of the tentatively motivated lovers. That camera mirrored the psychology of the characters in a powerful way by forcing us into their perceptive state.PT borrows this camera idea and even some of its little motions an example is the shift while waiting for the call back from the sex girl. The mood is only a little different. Wong tapped the mind of a repressed Kung Fu writer PT substitutes a manic Chaplin tramp and an Amelieinspired girl.' The result is snappier in fact very much like Wong's Fallen Angels' in energy but the substitution is a trivial adaptation. everything else follows from that theft.This borrowing is so obvious I wonder no one is crying foul. Well I will. For a serious filmmaker to score points in my book he has to have hisher own vision and then create hisher own means from what came before. The result will be new personal. Not plagerized.Well anyway we get to see Phil Hoffman again. Oddly all he is allowed to do is be barking wallpaper.Ted's evaluation 2 of 4  Has some interesting elements.".

He is pretty young after all.What PTA really seems to bring to his work is a sense of compassion for the pathetic. While Boogie Nights was a feelgood hackjob in which it is difficult to care about ANY of the morons he depicts and Magnolia was an overdrawn angst film in which the most natural response is to despise the characters Punch Drunk Love did a reasonable job of making Barry Egan into a real person. He is pathetic lovable and unfulfilled through no fault of his own.I definitely got the impression that a good bit of the film was occupied by filler. The harmonium's introduction adds nothing the color blocks are not presented in any coherent way and the brief conversion of Egan into a superhero seems to be severely out of place.HOWEVER...This is a completely allegorical and poetic picture. The meaning of the film is very uplifting. Despite the numerous failures and flaws of our protagonist there is a glimmer of hope that he might somehow find happinessin fact perhaps the entire story is about the first successful dating experience PTA had.Generally speaking I'd rank Hard Eight above this one but given that PTA lacked a great deal of directorial control over that film I'd call this the best job that he personally has pulled off so far.More than anything I appreciated the technical approach. The fact that almost every rule of cinematography andor editing is broken repeatedly in this picture makes it pretty clear that it is not to be taken too literally.More filmmakers should jump at the chance to break the rules when it truly contributes to the structure and meaning of their workI'd rather see the back of Sandler's head and nonliteral interpretations of physical space in this kind of film than see a sterile and clinical presentation of the events depicted.7 out of 10.".

There were a few moments when I thought I might have glimpsed something different something almost human in his face but then there'd be that idiot voice or some wildly exaggerated mannerismsupposedly humorous but actually cringe inducingto reaffirm my antipathy.

And that director? Wasn't he the one who did Boogie Nights? So natch I had to see this movie. I was curious. . . . But soon I was mesmerized.Many Adam Sandler AS fans have lamented his radical departure from the kind of films he has done beforean entirely understandable reaction. None of us likes to see that which we love radically changed. People who love the glitz and neon of Las Vegas would reasonably be peeved to find that it had been razed and a forest planted to take its place. It would be futile to attempt to prove to hardcore AS fans that this is a good film. How can you convince someone that something they don't like is something they should like? I know beets are good for you. I know that some people LOVE beets. I still hate beets. It's regrettable. It's too bad. My beet animus remains. I LOVE PunchDrunk LovePDL. MILD SPOILERS I love it for all the myriad odd detailsthe harmonium that is dropped off in the middle of the street for reasons entirely unknown AS's method of accumulating zillion's of Sky Milesbut then doesn't get to use them. I love it for a plot that is SUNNY in spite of inksodden clouds rumbling ominously all around a plot that clearly originated outside the Hollywood cookieplotcutter factorytotally impossible to predict. I loved it for that odd little romance yes I admit it. Emily Watson's immediate interest in AS was a weakness in the film. I could see how she could fall for him over time but how could her first impression have been anything but negative?. I loved the overall arc of the filmAS insecure sad with occasional bouts of unfocused psychotic rage here reasonably explained unlike in AS's past reputed comedies transformed by love into someone who could take that boilingoveranger and turn it into a powerful directed force for good that scene with the blonde brothers ramming AS's car was wonderfully cathartic. As soon as he saw that trickle of blood running down Watson's face he was transfigured. His protective instincts for this person he cared for transformed his rage into a calm fearsome purpose. I loved it for Watson's luminous presence. Most of all I loved it for Adam Sandler !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Excised from the slavery of less than mediocre cinema his wildly exaggerated mannerisms were given reason and he was suddenly nuanced subtle even human. It was a pleasure to see him act to watch his emotional turmoil play out on his face to be drawn in to empathize . . . with Adam Sandler? Now THAT is movie magic. I'm not ready for AS to elbow his way onto my list of favorite living actors much less supplant Paul Newman from his lofty perch on the top rung but I find myself looking forward to Spanglish.

He seems like a pretty normal guy although you see something in his face something ready to come out and when it comes you can almost understand it.The story is a love story in a way. The love interest is Lena Emily Watson. They are both different and therefore there is a chance it could work. Another part of the story involves a sex line that Barry called. They have his credit card number and everything and force him from time to time to donate money. How this story goes from there is not for me to reveal but it gives us some very unexpected moments.That is one of the other good things in this movie. Most of the time you don't know and can't even guess what will happen next. It is another reason to see this movie although I do think it has some boring moments as well. The story develops slow and that makes it a movie not all people will like. If you like Adam Sandlermovies like 'Mr. Deeds' or 'Big Daddy' I think you should skip 'PunchDrunk Love'. If you like other movies from director Paul Thomas Anderson I am not sure. I liked 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' a lot better but you might want to give it a chance.".

	schema:headline " Paul Thomas Anderson artist of the visual tone metaphor";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love opens with his signature move juxtaposition. Adam Sandler handling a nice Nissan coffee mug in the early morning light on a backstreet in LA watches as a speeding car comes carooming towards him flips flips again and skids offscreen. And then in place of what ought to follow continuity with the car accident a cab appears stops and deposits an electric organ. It's the instrument with which he will learn the harmonies of love and it arrives on the heels of trauma. The scene strictly visually is reminiscent of Jane Campion's piano on the beach or of Herzog's record player aboard the steamer headed up the Amazon in Fitzcarraldo. There is music going on here. It's no secret that Punch Drunk Love is a tone poem. What draws me to PTA's visual ear is his interest in translation. He knows that sound reaches the heart before the image it is the first sense that comes to mind in the womb as we hear our mothers' heartbeat. He knows we have the uncanny ability to name the composer behind a riff played in the style of a modern rock artist but performed by a harmonica trio as in Magnolia. He knows the operatic line the group song sung by each of Magnolia's ensemble cast against harmonic backgrounds each of Magnolia's cast is struggling with the same song the same hurt and together they are a story in the same key. As did Paul Klee who attempted to paint music by rendering an operatic line over color fields. The two Pauls have much in common. Perhaps like Nabokov they are synesthetic? Either way PTA's style is affective and his songlines like those of the Aborigines are maps to emotional territory. He was right in his choice of Sandler whose performance is a musical score in itself. And Emily Watson can do no wrong she's one of our finest a face of infinite depth.

	onyx:emotionText "Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love opens with his signature move juxtaposition. Adam Sandler handling a nice Nissan coffee mug in the early morning light on a backstreet in LA watches as a speeding car comes carooming towards him flips flips again and skids offscreen. And then in place of what ought to follow continuity with the car accident a cab appears stops and deposits an electric organ. It's the instrument with which he will learn the harmonies of love and it arrives on the heels of trauma. The scene strictly visually is reminiscent of Jane Campion's piano on the beach or of Herzog's record player aboard the steamer headed up the Amazon in Fitzcarraldo. There is music going on here. It's no secret that Punch Drunk Love is a tone poem. What draws me to PTA's visual ear is his interest in translation. He knows that sound reaches the heart before the image it is the first sense that comes to mind in the womb as we hear our mothers' heartbeat. He knows we have the uncanny ability to name the composer behind a riff played in the style of a modern rock artist but performed by a harmonica trio as in Magnolia. He knows the operatic line the group song sung by each of Magnolia's ensemble cast against harmonic backgrounds each of Magnolia's cast is struggling with the same song the same hurt and together they are a story in the same key. As did Paul Klee who attempted to paint music by rendering an operatic line over color fields. The two Pauls have much in common. Perhaps like Nabokov they are synesthetic? Either way PTA's style is affective and his songlines like those of the Aborigines are maps to emotional territory. He was right in his choice of Sandler whose performance is a musical score in itself. And Emily Watson can do no wrong she's one of our finest a face of infinite depth. The two play awkward music but in their search for the key to their love they strike notes and find resonating harmonies. The key to their love is the key in which they play the chord the chord that binds.

Fearful of being exposed over his past at first by his friend and later by another gangster the owner chooses to give his factory to the workers then escapes with his friend to the freedom of the open road. The production company for A Nous la Liberte was for more than a decade embroiled in a lawsuit claiming that Charles Chaplin had seen their film and plagiarized many ideas from it as he developed Modern Times.";

Whilst Clair experiments freely here with music and song the Metropolislike buildings lend a sombre note to the proceedings at hand.Stylistically dated perhaps now and the humor betrays its thirties origins nevertheless at its core the observations made still hold true.

	schema:headline " Slapstick Gallic Satire Skewers Industrialism and Corporate Greed Between the World Wars";
	schema:reviewBody "This early talkie is an unexpected joy to watch and an artful piece of transitional cinema. It's difficult to believe that Charlie Chaplin claimed he never saw Ren Clair's fanciful 1931 musical comedy since it predates many of the same leitmotifs that came up in Modern Times five years later including pointed jabs at corporate greed interlaced with Keystone Copsstyle slapstick. In fact Clair seems completely inspired by Chaplin in the way he carefully orchestrates the chase scenes and the robotic assembly line in this film so much so that Chaplin borrowed back the visual cues in Modern Times.Clair sets up his story as an elaborate parable centered on two convicts best friends mile and Louis who make toy horses in the prison assembly line. In a longplanned attempt to escape mile escapes thanks to a generous legup from Louis who is caught and returned back to their cell. Years pass and mile becomes a successful industrialist in charge of a phonograph manufacturing business. Meanwhile Louis serves out his term and upon release ironically finds himself working in the assembly line of mile's factory. After some hesitation Louis and mile reunite and join forces with a rapidfire series of chaotic complications leading the two friends to realize that a life away from work may be their true fate.The film master does not belabor his sociopolitical statements about materialism but it is intriguing in hindsight to appreciate the film's prescience in showing France disconnected from the encroaching Nazi menace. Moreover the film boasts startling visual elements thanks to Lazare Meerson's unmistakably Expressionist art direction. Henri Marchand and Raymond Cordy make a fine comedy team as mile and Louis though what really shines is the timeless spirit that Clair imbues this film. The 2002 Criterion Collection DVD includes two deleted scenes a brief 1998 interview with Clair's widow and a twentyminute short Entr'acte that Clair made with French artists Francis Picabia and Erik Satie. Speaking of Chaplin in an audio essay film historian David Robinson describes the plagiarism suit that the film's producers brought against Charlie Chaplin when Modern Times was released.".

'A Nous la liberte' is in many ways a forerunner to 'Modern Times' with about as much political subtlety  the factory assembly line disrupted by an inept worker would be 'borrowed' by Chaplin although instructively the sequence is much funnier in the Hollywood film perhaps because the little tramp is such a recognised beloved figure and the rather nondescript Louis is not or perhaps because Chaplin was such a master at pantomime and enlivened the mechanical scene with a vibrant display of physical virtuosity more probably it is because Chaplin developed the scene showing not only the effect of human error on the most perfect of technological systems but also the dehumanising mechanistic effect of emergent modern capitalism on its workers.Clair sees life for the worker under capitalism as identical with the life of a convict in prison  both  systems seek to stamp out or rigidly order humanity turn people into socially acceptable machines.  With humanity so thoroughly contained it is not surprising that it should be a fundamental human emotion  love  that causes anarchic chaos in this system. Clair also links capitalism with criminality  the Big Boss in the film the man who engenders the new technocratic society who unites workers and the wealthy past his own his friend his blackmailers present and future the new machines is an escaped convict.  Despite the rigid heaviness of the buildings and machines and the system they uphold the status quo is ultimately transitory and fragile.  It's easy to climb the social ladder but just as easy to fall as Emile shows with remarkably good grace.  No such system  and capitalism claims to be natural  can ever offer stability or genuine security for the exploiters who need it most capitalism carries within itself the seeds of its own destruction.  Clair is also canny or prescient in linking the new capitalism with emerging fascism throughout Europe  Emile's factory is ordered on cryptomilitary lines with uniforms symbols and leader's iconography.If Clair's politics are heavyhanded his visual sensibility is not and this film transcends itself when it looses its political shackles and gives into subversive whimsy a rondelay of chases fistfights drunken fracas Bunuellian iconoclasm.  Clair may not have been as profound a director as Renoir or Vigo but neither had his eye or his way with orchestrating movement of creating chaos from order and vice versa.  The climactic surreal opening ceremony is obvious politically but a visual stunner with even nature undermining the narcissistic parades of power in a way that anticipates Fellini and Kusturica.  The spare oppressive sets are a delight from the 'Metropolis'like factory to the unwitting mirrorhome of the Big Boss.  The end in its rueful freedom is pure Renoir.  The inspired and inventive use of sound doesn't obscure the fact that much of this movie is beautifully filmed silent cinema.".

This was only Auric's 2nd film after Cocteau's BLOOD OF A POET but he already shows the mastery that would lead to well over a hundred further scores.Clair and his Oscarnominated designer fill the screen with wonderful art deco visuals and there's a sympathetic cast cemented by the two central characters Louis and Emile.

Emile's own episode has just a little bit of a Cyrano flavour a passionate love destined to be unfruitful.

The masterful hand of director Rene Clair overcomes an insubstantial plot and imbues the film with some fantastic visuals humorous satire and some good clean knockabout fun. Two prisoners escape from custody and one reaches the top of the ladder while the other clings onto the bottom rung. Clair makes his feeling about capitalism clear by showing how the worker under the capitalist is as much a prisoner as the people locked in the jail. But any political overtones are not so much that they interrupt with the comic narrative and the film merrily continues with it's chases bottomkicking and all manner of goodnatured silliness. Highly recommended.".

I am constantly reminded of Jean Vigo's timeless Conduit Zero and L'Atalante as I guffaw to A Nous La Liberte this one through the course of a lean sinewy 83 minutes deconstructs the wholly arbitrary norms and myths that constitute our mechanized capitalistic civilization before illustrating just how easily these protocol are upset and subverted. I have learned that Rene Clair had previously lent his hand to the surrealists in the silent era and that does not surprise me in the least for this film is for all its cynical realism is Surrealist in agenda a thorough exploration of Liberty.The premise is simple two convicts escape from prison and pursue vastly disparate avenues outside penitentiary walls. One becomes an unscrupulous opportunist and erects a financial empire the rather effete other is more smitten with a flighty factory girl than money. By a dialectical process the two eventually renounce chimeras like wealth and marriage opting for a life of DeleuzeGuattariesquire nomadism true freedom unrestrained by social expectation. Clair is rarely subtle with his jibes the factory workers are represented as wholly expendable vessels of labor weighed and assigned with serial numbers. Their lives are mechanized to the point of eating slop from a conveyor belt. The Paris that Clair evokes is not a romanticised perfumed city of profusion and resplendence but a graven concrete sarcophagus populated with automatons of all varieties. The sole glimpses we get of organic flora are of wretchedlooking daffodils offered to an unappreciative object of affection. Most biting are Clair's sketches of the bourgeoisie whose cultivated tastes revolve around rumormongering rococo decor and totally maudlin and cloying music. Everywhere carnality peers deviously beneath the gaping crevices seething and sizzling beneath the Victorian prudishness look at the rakish dilettante who woos the tycoon's wife and the virile factory worker who commands the secretary's amorous attentions.Through the course of the film Clair's intent is in drawing parallels between life in the penitentiary with dehumanizing industrial life and stuffy bourgeois society illuminating the worrying commonalities that all three share. The conclusive insight then is truly surrealist man constructs his own prisons circumscribing the possibilities of existence with norms that he then perpetuates with bad faith. When this epiphany strikes our phonograph magnate he becomes privy to the sheer tentativeness of these stifling dogmas and engages in a journey towards freedom culminating in his renunciation of wealth and reputation.The latter half of the film is a STINGING lash against cant and cupidity and the film reaches a summit in one of the most uproarious and singularly BRILLIANT sections in French film a fierce gust of wind disrupts an octagenarian's garrulous grandiloquent and nauseatingly vacuous speech blowing away the elaborate ornamentation adorning the speaker's podium and scattering a profusion of overhead banknotes across the compound. The gathered industrialists resist temptation for a few moments before a madcap scramble for cash ensues the bumbling old speechmaker struggling to recite his script in the resultant mania the sole bastion of 'order' in this wild debacle. This is Clair's consummate statement beneath the ostentation and contrived niceties we can barely obscure our animalistic greed. The wind blows beneath surfaces and reveals mercenary ardor.A political film that you can show to your kids as well as a consummate meticulous masterpiece on par with any Keaton Chaplin or Tati. Like those artists and Friedrich Nietzsche Clair knows all about the subversive power of laughter. We must take his approach to life to nurture the capacity to laugh at all the things we take so gravely our environs and even ourselves. This is the wellspring of ecstasy and freedom in life. I wonder if Luis Bunuel was a fan...".

Clair's satirical look at factory workers and their owners who are willing to exchange them for machinery is suppose to be a comedy but I'm not sure which part of it is. Having now seen the film for myself I can see why the original company went after Chaplin because there's no way in hell that this film didn't influence Chaplin and his masterpiece. However to me it seems Chaplin saw a technically brilliant but soul less film and made a much better picture. Credit should be given to Clair because the technical look of this film is brilliant and the music score is top notch but that's about as far as my admiration goes. There wasn't a single time in this film where I laugh and I only cracked a smile a couple times. The film is clearly spoofing the factory workers yet I could never see any of the spoof Had you not told me this was a comedy then everything on screen comes off as drama because it doesn't seem to me that there was any attempt for laughs. Another problem I had was the dialogue which was great but at the same time it kind of went against what was going on in the scenes. The movie is filmed in a silent manor and in my opinion it probably would have worked best as a silent movie. The spoken words because somewhat distracting from the technical side of things so it came off to me as Clair was either making a silent film and later decided to make it sound or the film is just uneven.".

Scenes go on long to ensure the 1930s audiences gets the point but modern audiences are quick to catch on. Even allowing for and expecting a slower pace I was annoyed at times by the movie's pace.I was frustrated with the lead character. He didn't stand out in a good way. While he was suppose to be a simple everyday guy the audience is to identify with he seemed dumb dim witted and oblivious when it came to the woman he was infatuated with. I realize it was a movie style back then but it grates if the actor doesn't have the charisma to pull this act off. It also doesn't help when this movie doesn't have a character say the few words that would clear up the confusion.I liked the sets  they were typical 1930s art deco. Big rooms tall doors and clean lines. Even though it was obvious and heavy handed I was fine with the theme that industrial work is like prison labor while the guards and professors proclaimed that work means liberty.This is shown by the following scene Factory guards discover one of the escaped convicts lying in the grass outside the factory enjoying the day and one guard says Not at work?! Don't you know that .... Then the scene cuts to a classroom where a bearded professor tells his class Work is mandatory. Because work means liberty. The young children at their desks and writing in their notebooks then sing what the professor just told them.".

However Clairs film is in fact very different and the two movies are both great on their respective terms. And both men should be equally praised for their depiction of the industrial developments impact on the individual human being.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1931 many of the films made in France were still silents and the industry was several years behind Hollywood. In this context it's incredible that such a creative and unusual film was released. While it is far from perfect it's got a lot going for it and is a nice bit of social commentary.The film begins with two prisoners trying to escape from their dull and overly regimented existence in prison. One actually does escapethe other is stuck behind but eventually escapes as well. The first guy goes from escaped prisoner to owner of a huge company producing record playersa real selfmade millionaire. The problem is his factory is run almost exactly like the assembly line from prison shown at the beginning of the film. When the second guy escapes he is hired by this company and adapts very poorly to this mechanized regimen. There's MUCH more to it than this but since other reviewers have discussed the film at length I'll stop in explaining the plot.Interestingly enough a very similar film came out a few years later from Charlie Chaplin MODERN TIMES and the parallels are definitely there. However director Clair didn't feel offended by this but the production company instituted a lawsuit against Chaplin. The problem is that imitation IS legalheck you can even use the exact same title as another film if you'd really like. PLUS I noticed that Clair actually borrowed very heavily from Chaplin!! The sympathetic second prisoner is so much like Chaplin's Little Tramp and the parallels here are also quite obvious! The way he walks the doubletakes the klutziness the sweetness and his inability in the end to get the girlall very Chaplinlikeand apparently inspired by THE CIRCUS and several other Chaplin films.I think this controversy is a lousy thing because it obscures the fact that BOTH are excellent filmsthough I'd definitely give the nod to MODERN TIMES. While derivative he was able to do so much more with the materialwith amazing sight gags that were missing from Clair's filmwhich was not nearly as funny.By the way had this film been made just a few years later it would have gotten a much lower score. But compared to the films being made in 1931 it is quite the movie.".

The tone of the movie is sharply uneven and that's likely due to the fact that the movie had no shooting script and the actors were forced to improvise. This ultimately leads to the fragile and disjointed structure. I have no idea why Ren Clair trusted these actors to build the foundation for his movie  they simply do not have the screen presence or charisma to carry a film. On that basis alone the movie is not effective and thus I cannot recommend it. With that said the score provided by Georges Auric is one of the positive aspects of this movie as it attempts to match the movements of the assembly line. It almost makes up for the lack of chemistry between Marchand and Cordy. Ren Clair shows glimpses of promise and with better actors he might have pulled this off but his lack of vision is accentuated by the lack of truth in the messages he attempts to portray.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raymond Cordi and Henri Marchand are two prisoners in an environment without soul. The inmates all sit at a long table and make tiny toy horses on an assembly line. When chow time rolls around they clunk along in ragged lockstep in their wooden sabots to the mess hall where they sit at long tables and serve themselves from a treadmill bearing bowls of food and pitchers of water.Cordi escapes with the help of Marchand who is captured. Cordi is a promoter and begins a business selling old phonograph records on the street. Soon he's a big shot a millionaire in charge of a huge plant and owner of The Record Palace.Later Marchand escapes too in the kind of scene that Charlie Chaplin might easily have used in Modern Times which appeared five years later. Marchard is in his cell and decides to hang himself. He fastens a short noose around his neck and ties the other end to the bars across his cell window. Then he jumps from the bed. His weight pulls the bars from the window and they fall with a clank on his head.Overjoyed Marchand climbs to the open window and looks out. On the curb below him sits an armless and crippled beggar with a coat draped over him cadging change from passers by. Marchand leaps from the window and lands atop the beggar who jumps to his feet and shrugs off the coat revealing two brawny arms. A mle ensues and Marchand is able to dash away.I don't know if Chaplin was inspired by  Nous la Libert but it's a little too coincidental that in both films the workers should sit at an assembly line one should miss a beat causing the next to miss a beat and wind up with half a dozen workers piling all over one another trying to catch up to the unfinished items on the assembly line. I guess if it was good enough for Ren Clair it's good enough for Chaplin and for Lucy and Ethel too for that matter.The plot gets a bit complicated. Marchand seeks out Cordi who is of two minds about the matter but helps him out anyway. Others discover Cordi's real identity and expose him. But just as the police are about to take him in hand Cordi decides to get out from under and turn the factory over to the workers.If it was funny and sometimes touching before the climax is hilarious. An ancient executive of the company is trying to read a famous poem in front of all the other executives and the workers. Gradually a wind begins to blow and then blows even stronger. From a hidden stash a thousand franc note blows passed the executives in their tuxedos and high hats. A second note. The executives are getting antsy as the notes blow past their feet. They fidget and squirm trying to remain dignified as befits their status until one of them breaks ranks and makes a beeline for a thousandfranc note. Then they all run madly after the money and so does everyone else. The listeners brawl the wind blows away the stand the band disappears and the wizened old speaker finally finishes his poem only to look up and find the entire courtyard empty.Cordi is the model of a phony rich guy who has married into society and now has a wife who loathes him and is having an affair with another mustachioed man whose hair seems made entirely of grease.

	onyx:emotionText "Raymond Cordi and Henri Marchand are two prisoners in an environment without soul. The inmates all sit at a long table and make tiny toy horses on an assembly line. When chow time rolls around they clunk along in ragged lockstep in their wooden sabots to the mess hall where they sit at long tables and serve themselves from a treadmill bearing bowls of food and pitchers of water.Cordi escapes with the help of Marchand who is captured. Cordi is a promoter and begins a business selling old phonograph records on the street. Soon he's a big shot a millionaire in charge of a huge plant and owner of The Record Palace.Later Marchand escapes too in the kind of scene that Charlie Chaplin might easily have used in Modern Times which appeared five years later. Marchard is in his cell and decides to hang himself. He fastens a short noose around his neck and ties the other end to the bars across his cell window. Then he jumps from the bed. His weight pulls the bars from the window and they fall with a clank on his head.Overjoyed Marchand climbs to the open window and looks out. On the curb below him sits an armless and crippled beggar with a coat draped over him cadging change from passers by. Marchand leaps from the window and lands atop the beggar who jumps to his feet and shrugs off the coat revealing two brawny arms. A mle ensues and Marchand is able to dash away.I don't know if Chaplin was inspired by  Nous la Libert but it's a little too coincidental that in both films the workers should sit at an assembly line one should miss a beat causing the next to miss a beat and wind up with half a dozen workers piling all over one another trying to catch up to the unfinished items on the assembly line. I guess if it was good enough for Ren Clair it's good enough for Chaplin and for Lucy and Ethel too for that matter.The plot gets a bit complicated. Marchand seeks out Cordi who is of two minds about the matter but helps him out anyway. Others discover Cordi's real identity and expose him. But just as the police are about to take him in hand Cordi decides to get out from under and turn the factory over to the workers.If it was funny and sometimes touching before the climax is hilarious. An ancient executive of the company is trying to read a famous poem in front of all the other executives and the workers. Gradually a wind begins to blow and then blows even stronger. From a hidden stash a thousand franc note blows passed the executives in their tuxedos and high hats. A second note. The executives are getting antsy as the notes blow past their feet. They fidget and squirm trying to remain dignified as befits their status until one of them breaks ranks and makes a beeline for a thousandfranc note. Then they all run madly after the money and so does everyone else. The listeners brawl the wind blows away the stand the band disappears and the wizened old speaker finally finishes his poem only to look up and find the entire courtyard empty.Cordi is the model of a phony rich guy who has married into society and now has a wife who loathes him and is having an affair with another mustachioed man whose hair seems made entirely of grease. Marchand couldn't be better as the simpleminded and impulsive childlike figure. And the director Ren Clair has done well by them. When the two escapees are together and faced by some common threat they exchange glances and we can hear the rough cadence of those wooden clogs on the prison floor.";

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis World War I began in Europe in 1914 but by 1917 the United States had still not entered the war. However many brave young American men went to France to fly and fight for the Allied powers. They joined the Lafayette Escadrille fighter squadron. The Germans had better planes weapons and pilots. The average life expectancy for a fighterpilot was three to six weeks. Why did these Americans volunteer to fight in France with certain death when their own country was not at war? This was a time when men were idealistic but naive to embark on a great adventure. Blaine Rawlings James Franco was forced to leave his home in Arizona after the family ranch was foreclosed by the bank. Blaine sees a newsreel of fighterpilots in France and decides that he has nothing to lose. Briggs Lowry Tyler Labine can't do anything right and is shamed into joining by his rich father. AfricanAmerican boxer Eugene Skinner Abdul Salis had been living in France a racially tolerant country for many years wanted to give something back to his new country. These Americans were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault Jean Reno and American Squadron Leader Reed Cassidy Martin Henderson. They were the world's first combat pilots.My Comment The film was inspired by a true story. What that means is that the writers could write anything they wanted to about the pilots' personal lives. There were actually 38 American volunteers with an average age of 26 that joined the Lafayette Escadrille. Thirty were college educated and eleven were sons of millionaires. These men had a sense of adventure and romance of war and they believed in dying with honor. The movie uses a composite of these qualities of the actual pilots and yes there really was a black pilot in the squadron. The movie does not shy away from the real aspects of war or the sordid aspects of life on the ground. After every mission there are some pilots who do not return and we get to see their replacements and how the pilots deal with the loss of their friends. The aerial combat was exciting tense and realistic with the attack on the zeppelin being the best scene of the movie. There is a love story that slows the pace of the movie and it was a little too long. You will love the scenes with Whiskey their mascot lion. I think the writers could have used the real pilots' stories and names and it would have been a better movie by giving credit to those young men. If you like war pictures this is a movie to see. MGM Pictures Run time 219 Rated PG13810".

Happily the love story is not sappy or sickening and actually helps create character development. And how the love story ends is a very nice nonHollywood ending.The Planes look magnificent but could have been done better. The use of German Dr1's the Fokker Triplanes as the only German fighter is understandable as distinguishing friend from foe. However making all of the Dr1's except for the main villains  solid red is extremely annoying. While it is up to some discussion if the Red Baron's Dr1 was all red or mostly red it does not mean that all Dr1's were red especially all red. The Dr1's came from the Fokker factory usually in an olive drab paint scheme with a light blue underside. The film makers could have added a red scheme to the planes but left a portion olive drab and blue underside it still would have made the Germans distinctive without being clones of Manfred von Rictoffen.The dogfights are fun to watch and are fairly exciting however the planes fly highly unrealistically at times. Overall the CGI is excellent but at times it is noticeable as CGI. The planes that explode Explosions are such a Hollywood staple   are unrealistic. The planes are traveling 70 t0 100 miles per hour in reality but the explosions react as if the plane is standing still going up in a ball instead of being spread along the doomed plane's path.Over all it was fun to watch and covers a historical period that has long been neglected in film.".

I saw a prerelease screening and everyone that I spoke to agreed that it was a good movie. The special effects were really good the airplanes seemed very realistic for the most part. The close ups seemed a little fake but the tactics seemed really good. I found a bit of cheesiness in the dialog at times but managed to not pay too much attention too it. It wasn't deep but kept you interested the whole time. Don't get me wrong it was no Saving Private Ryan but it had enough action and drama to keep you interested.

It is based on a true story and largely faithful to that story. The first world war was the first ugly war. It is the first war where as one of the characters observes Neither side will win. It will just end. And this movie does not shrink away from showing the horror the ugliness and the overwhelming grimness of war.Because the special effects made it possible more than any movie in recent memory it graphically shows the excitement and the adrenaline rush of combat flying. The combat sequences are nothing short of dazzling they were so good I could experience vicariously the rush of bullets tearing through cloth fuselages the spins and turns and dips and climbs and barrel rolls and dives and with all that I could look inside myself and know I did not have the courage to do what they did. In the end that's what this story is about and the love story the individual pilot lives fade into the background.Still it's worth noting one of the movie's best moments is the denouement where we learn what happened to the Americans of the Lafayette Escadrille those who survived. I won't spoil it for you just know that truth is stranger than fiction and often a good deal sadder. I enjoyed Flyboys for what it was the chance to vicariously experience the adrenaline rush of aerial combat. Performances were good and Jean Reno was great as the captain of the Lafayette Escadrille. Nice popcorn flick.".

The combat sequences are nothing short of dazzling they were so good I could experience vicariously the rush of bullets tearing through cloth fuselages the spins and turns and dips and climbs and barrel rolls and dives and with all that I could look inside myself and know I did not have the courage to do what they did. In the end that's what this story is about and the love story the individual pilot lives fade into the background.Still it's worth noting one of the movie's best moments is the denouement where we learn what happened to the Americans of the Lafayette Escadrille those who survived. I won't spoil it for you just know that truth is stranger than fiction and often a good deal sadder. I enjoyed Flyboys for what it was the chance to vicariously experience the adrenaline rush of aerial combat. Performances were good and Jean Reno was great as the captain of the Lafayette Escadrille. Nice popcorn flick.";

This sets you up with anticipation that the filmmakers have developed this film aiming for authenticity recreating what it was like to be the first fighter pilots in the first modern war. For the first time films makers have the tools with CGI to truly accurately portray the visceral effects of WWI dog fighting to put the audience right back into the thick shell smoked 1916 western front.However they fall VERY short of the mark because through their obsession with their aerial money shots they seem to have forgotten the human story of the true horrors of combat and what it does to the human soul. In the fact it's the human story that the director makes the biggest hash of. It's Horrors of war painted by numbers lets have the veteran seen it all lets have the fearless guy and then just so people know war can be nasty lets have a shell shock guy. But this is done so distastefully it truly mocks people who have actually been traumatized by war.This films claims to have the most authentic aerial combat footage ever put to film. The CGI shots are also no where near as good as the film makers think they are. In many cases they come across as in game movie footage from an Xbox360 cartoon like and unreal. The filmmakers have also made no effort to research their period without creating any spoilers there is some truly ludicrous almost James Bond like action set pieces that take away all sense that you are watching a realistic war film. The biplanes might as well have afterburners and laser beams and fly into space the film wouldn't be any less believable and probably a lot more interesting.This is nothing more than a boys own story where the first casualty is truth or realism. It has a TV movie feel and the acting is so bad you couldn't care less who lives or dies by the end of it. This film could have offered so much but it seems the director and the produces bottled out and aimed for an arcade computer style shoot em up with shallow acting and a big helping of cartoon CGI.".

OK maybe with the exception of that fantastic first shot in Episode 3. But imagine that level of technological knowhow applied to a WW1 dogfight. And like the original Star Wars there is a scene here involving the German equivalent of the Death Star threatening Paris that is nothing short of spectacular. A shame then that the rest of the story is less than inspiring. Whatever the actual history I didn't quite believe the subplot of the black American pilot. He seemed a clich and just one of several stock characters. The love story ultimately goes nowhere either though James Franco and Jennifer Decker both turn in moving performances. As innocent and naive as Franco and his friends seem they never get past the cardboard stage. It would've been more interesting to me if they were a neurotic drunken whoring bunch of elitists most of whom would then never get over the experience. Rather than tell that tale of a decadent sophisticated flyboy of the Lafayette Escadrille however they settle here for the Disney version appealing to the lowest common denominator and an audience of teenagers with Franco doing a good job playing Luke Skywalker or maybe Gary Cooper. Jean Reno seemed largely wasted. I kept hoping he'd have more to do. But lest you think I had a bad time think again. This is a movie about aeroplanes and they are all terrific be they replicas or virtual. And the overall production design is superb.".

	schema:reviewBody "Talk about ineptitude among other things this supposed homage to an actual WWI squadron perpetuates just about every conceivable clich imaginable furthermore effectively stealing elements from nearly every aviation flick ever devised including Blue Max the Dawn Patrol Dark Blue World the Tuskegee Airmen and even that ageold silent flick from 1927 WINGS. Furtherome the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly obliviates the entirety of Paris.And as of the various manners in which this film blatantly exhibits its readily apparent lack of prowess for historical and technical accuracies let me count the ways.For starters let's consider the countless manners in which the onscreen aircraft repeatedly defy the laws physics. Admittedly some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's parttime profession as an aerobatic pilot which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood. For one thing the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess of the actual performance capabilities of World War I fighters culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier lowlevel maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal rollrates which no multiwinged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space but not of the actual performance characteristics of World War One aircraft.Furthermore the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades including the SE.5 Handley Page 400 Gotha IV and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind culminating in one of the most trivial misconceptions about World War I aviation. Bottom line the above depiction stems from a childish conception that by default associates World War One German aviation with countless formations of redcoated Triplanes as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.In fact the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitchedbattles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and twoseat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.And another thing the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.Furthermore pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias considering that unlike World War II pilots were rarely assigned individual aircraft often dispersing their ranks among the types available and typically sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore as depicted within the closing scene there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length scattering miles away from each other thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of as one reviewer stated playing a really cool video game as opposed to providing a genuine in the cockpit sensation for piloting such frail machinations.Most offensive however is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.In all fairness perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel.Ultimately the photograph at the end of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.For more informative and productive viewing I can suggest virtually every other aviation flick on the market from the veritable classics like Blue Max and Aces High  to some of the more lukewarm efforts of Ace of Aces and Von Richtofen and Brown.".

For one thing the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess of the actual performance capabilities of World War I fighters culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier lowlevel maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal rollrates which no multiwinged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space but not of the actual performance characteristics of World War One aircraft.Furthermore the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades including the SE.5 Handley Page 400 Gotha IV and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind culminating in one of the most trivial misconceptions about World War I aviation. Bottom line the above depiction stems from a childish conception that by default associates World War One German aviation with countless formations of redcoated Triplanes as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.In fact the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitchedbattles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and twoseat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.And another thing the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.Furthermore pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias considering that unlike World War II pilots were rarely assigned individual aircraft often dispersing their ranks among the types available and typically sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore as depicted within the closing scene there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length scattering miles away from each other thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of as one reviewer stated playing a really cool video game as opposed to providing a genuine in the cockpit sensation for piloting such frail machinations.Most offensive however is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.In all fairness perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel.Ultimately the photograph at the end of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.For more informative and productive viewing I can suggest virtually every other aviation flick on the market from the veritable classics like Blue Max and Aces High  to some of the more lukewarm efforts of Ace of Aces and Von Richtofen and Brown.";

	schema:reviewBody "On Saturday August 26th I saw the first public screening of FLYBOYS at the Warner Theatre in Torrington CT.For those of you who don't know the story of the Lafayette Escadrilles they were a squadron of Americans who during World War I went to France before the US joined in the fight. The Escadrilles were trained there and flew missions against the Germans. They are credited with helping to stop the German advance into France in the early stages of the war.James Franco plays Rawlings...a cowboy whose ranch has been foreclosed. As he's watching a newsreel about the Lafayette Escadrilles the local sheriff tells him that he has an arrest warrant for him and tells him to leave town. Then we see the other pilotstobe as they leave for France the allAmerican guy with the pretty fiance the rich guy who's been a disappointment to his dad the black American who is already in France making a living as a boxer etc...At the Escadrilles' airfield they meet up with the Escadrilles leader Captain Thenault Jean Reno who is really underused in the movie and Squadron Leader Cassidy. Cassidy is known for flying extra missions after their main missions so that he can try to exact revenge for any pilots that they lost during the main missions I actually found him to be more interesting than Rawlings.They are dropped off at the American barracks which is a mansion that's been taken over by the military. As soon as they get into the mansionbarracks Rawlings is jumped by a young lionthe Escadrilles' tame mascot Whiskey which is a true part of the Escadrilles' history. Then we are shown the pilots' flight training in a fairly short montage which ends with each of them taking off on their first solo flights.After that their real missions begin. Their first mission is a bust when they are ambushed by the Germans but with each following mission the pilots improve. After awhile they begin to earn the respect of the more seasoned pilots. As their missions continue some of the pilots are killed and replaced by newbies with their own unique personalities including a Biblecarrying Christian who sings Onward Christian Soldiers as he shoots down German planes I liked this guy. There is also the clich pilot who loses his nerve early on in the film only to come back strong later but this is still handled well.We are introduced to the German ace Wolfert who has the sense of honor and chivalry that other movies about World War I pilots always overplayed a bit too much for my liking. Thank God Flyboys doesn't make the same mistake...they make it clear that Wolfert will kill the allied pilots when he has the chance. We are also introduced to the Black Falcon who is Wolfert's counterpart in the German squadron. He is sadistic and has no qualms about shooting a pilot who has crashlanded walked away from his plane and is no longer a threat. Although all of the Germans are the Escadrilles' enemies the Black Falcon is the real bad guy in the movie. He is used sparingly in the film but to good effect.There is also a love story...and just like most movies based on history...this love story is unnecessary for the telling of the Escadrilles' story. Rawlings meets a pretty French girl after he crashes during a training mission. Rawlings is taken with her and tries to build a relationship with her. She is afraid of getting too attached to him afraid that he's going to be killed in combat but eventually she gives in to his advances as if she wouldn't ...come on. The love story could have been worse could have been more sappy could have been Pearl Harbor but it wasn't at least I give the filmmakers credit for that.Now if you've seen the trailer for Flyboys you've already seen glimpses of the high quality of the visual effects. I was reading that the movie cost somewhere around 60 millionand these days that amount of money doesn't usually lend itself to a visual effectsheavy movie. But this movie is LOADED with long visual effects sequences of the highest quality. Except for some shots of the pilots in the cockpits that you just KNOW were shot on a sound stage everything else looks fantastic. The big scene with the zeppelin that is in the movie's trailer is great. The flight scenes in general are exciting and tense. The flight characteristics of the planes are very realistic and they don't do anything that the real planes couldn't have done. Also the sound effects and editing are fantastic. I'll say right now that this movie should easily be nominated for Oscars in the visual and sound effectsediting categories.I know enough about the Escadrilles to know that the filmmakers didn't stray too far from historical reality Tony Bill even mentioned that the black character wasn't in the film as the token black guy...the first black American fighter pilot WAS a part of the Escadrillesand except for in the beginning of the movie they don't make a big deal out of it. Again putting aside the love story part of the movie the story is very welltold and the acting is solid. Even James Franco who I have always found to be wooden in past films seems relaxed and comfortable in his role as Rawlings and he gets the job done although I might have gone with someone less wellknown who was just a better actor in general. The actor who played Cassidy Martin Henderson and Jean Reno are excellent although Reno's role is a bit too small.DON'T WAIT FOR THE DVD!! See this movie in a THEATER to get the full effect of the amazing work done by the filmmakers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seriously this movie is just a piece of expensive trash.Only thing really worth looking is probably the beautiful scenes of nature and nice places  people around. Photography is simply gorgeous! But wasn't this movie about WAR?Well computergenerated war without real dialogue or matter to discuss idea to present etc. Just 3D models and characters suitable for girly Sunday soap opera not hardboiled war movie.Even if it tries simply to be digital form of art and nothing else I wouldn't call this a thriller or typical war movie of any kind it fails also. I won't start with factual errors they're clear to anyone ever opened history book. But the CGI... It's horrible. First the CGI scenes don't look that good at all. For a 2006 movie they seemed to use technology from year 2000 or so. The plane models don't have really any complex shading or any other modern light simulation applied so everything looks even worse than a typical PC video game from same year. There's also heavily noticeable lack of realistic shadows. But this is not the worst part.Planes are extremely overpowered and feel like something Man hasn't built yet. Like superb aeroacrobatic devices even our modern technology can't do. It looks nice but hey wasn't this movie about WWI? Shouldn't those... things be a pieces of wood and cloth with a small engine applied? Simply motorized kites? But even that total messup in CGI and directing department isn't the worst part.The worst question is... where's PHYSICS? If CGI department would have recorded a demo from early 1994 flight simulator and used movement capture of game planes for ones seen in movie they would get at least half of it believable. But in this movie planes float. They have no mass or friction no speed nor gravity. And in era of motorized kites tiny amounts of speed and angles defined by physics law was what really decided who won the dogfight. It was all about pilot playing on the edge of plane's capabilities milliseconds and laws on nature to gain this tiny almost invisible advantage over enemy. No pilot had 360degree freedom in 3 dimensions at constant speed. In this movie it doesn't matter if pilot rises or drops plane it doesn't lower or raise his speed a bit.And there's a terribly stupid scene with protagonist's gun jamming while enemy is at gunpoint. Just look at this When enemy notices the problem he speeds up and flies away. Why in the hell was he flying at gunpoint until then? Weren't German planes much faster and more maneuverable? Doesn't EVERY damn historical air battlerelated book describe this?I won't even start with romance and drama portions from the movie. The unbelievable fights to any sane man and pretty actors already defined the target group of the movie early teenage girls. So it's needed by default even if it sucks in this movie. But why is the chosen topic war and why not skip all that lousy plane thing just make another movie about nice nature and love?And why oh why did director do strange attempts at discussing something serious like racism social classes mourning war refugees etc? Either one of them... failed miserably.It's simply difficult to blame a movie for being bad if it's actually idiots' fault who made it.".

I won't start with factual errors they're clear to anyone ever opened history book. But the CGI... It's horrible. First the CGI scenes don't look that good at all. For a 2006 movie they seemed to use technology from year 2000 or so. The plane models don't have really any complex shading or any other modern light simulation applied so everything looks even worse than a typical PC video game from same year. There's also heavily noticeable lack of realistic shadows. But this is not the worst part.Planes are extremely overpowered and feel like something Man hasn't built yet. Like superb aeroacrobatic devices even our modern technology can't do. It looks nice but hey wasn't this movie about WWI? Shouldn't those... things be a pieces of wood and cloth with a small engine applied? Simply motorized kites? But even that total messup in CGI and directing department isn't the worst part.The worst question is... where's PHYSICS? If CGI department would have recorded a demo from early 1994 flight simulator and used movement capture of game planes for ones seen in movie they would get at least half of it believable. But in this movie planes float. They have no mass or friction no speed nor gravity. And in era of motorized kites tiny amounts of speed and angles defined by physics law was what really decided who won the dogfight. It was all about pilot playing on the edge of plane's capabilities milliseconds and laws on nature to gain this tiny almost invisible advantage over enemy. No pilot had 360degree freedom in 3 dimensions at constant speed. In this movie it doesn't matter if pilot rises or drops plane it doesn't lower or raise his speed a bit.And there's a terribly stupid scene with protagonist's gun jamming while enemy is at gunpoint. Just look at this When enemy notices the problem he speeds up and flies away. Why in the hell was he flying at gunpoint until then? Weren't German planes much faster and more maneuverable? Doesn't EVERY damn historical air battlerelated book describe this?I won't even start with romance and drama portions from the movie. The unbelievable fights to any sane man and pretty actors already defined the target group of the movie early teenage girls. So it's needed by default even if it sucks in this movie. But why is the chosen topic war and why not skip all that lousy plane thing just make another movie about nice nature and love?And why oh why did director do strange attempts at discussing something serious like racism social classes mourning war refugees etc? Either one of them... failed miserably.It's simply difficult to blame a movie for being bad if it's actually idiots' fault who made it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was curious to see how a World War One flying film would benefit from CGI but I was unprepared for the sheer sloppiness of historical detail and lack of dramatic imagination that afflicted FLYBOYS. The title kinda sucks too  it belies the gravity of the emotional subject matter that the film purports to celebrate. Several other commentators here have pointed out the historical inaccuracies and anachronisms of this film. It continues to surprise me that bigtime filmmakers who put millions into a motion picture in this case reportedly 60 million of their own dough can't be bothered to get the details right when they know that the audience that can make or break a film like this one is made up of history and aviation enthusiasts who will spot the mistakes a mile away.Then there is the script a melange of clichs gleaned from previous films. I'll give the writers credit for at least trying to imagine characters who were residents of the World War One era rather than populating the film with contemporary 21stcentury sensibilities and language with whom today's audiences can identify. But the characters are so stereotypical and the storyline so predictable that after the first thirty minutes I could hardly wait for the film to end. The film also was harmed by a rather lackluster cast. It hardly seems fair to slam young actors for a lack of screen presence but neither James Franco Martin Henderson or Jennifer Decker really command the screen at least under Tony Bill's direction.But what about the CGI? There are some moments in the aerial sequences that stand out and which of course would be almost impossible to capture using conventional cinematography. But by the last dogfight I had the strange sensation that I was watching a host of diving jinking Fokker DR1s turning into a host of diving jinking velociraptors. In other words some of the movement of the CGI aircraft seemed rather unrealistic a little bit too nimble for these maneuverable but relatively slow 1917 airplanes.All in all decent CGI does not compensate for a horrid script. To see where all the clichs came from  and to see them portrayed much more convincingly  I would suggest checking out the three finest World War One flying films ever made 1 Howard Hughes' HELL'S ANGELS which contains some horrid acting but is breathtaking for its sheer spectacle and 1930 technical achievement 2 Edmund Goulding's DAWN PATROL from 1938 with Errol Flynn and David Niven as the quintessential stoic flying dead men of the RFC and with incredible aerial footage from the first DAWN PATROL directed by Howard Hawks in 1930 and 3 John Guillermin's THE BLUE MAX from 1966 an imperfect but gorgeously photographed film with interesting characters some impressive aircraft reproductions and flying sequences and a great Jerry Goldsmith score.".

The three principal players at the time this film was made Luke PerryBeverly Hills 90210 Stephen BaldwinThe Young Riders and Cynthia GearyNorthern Exposure were all at the height of exposure from popular television series' and brought a built in audience to the show.It helps by the way that Luke Perry bears an absolutely uncanny resemblance to the real Lane Frost. During the end credits there is some interview footage with the real Lane Frost so I'm sure there were a lot of oohs and aahs from the audience as the movie ended.I remember reading about Luke Perry and that his background before he became a teen heart throb was from a really tiny Ohio town. I'm sure that Perry understood the character of Lane Frost very well who hailed from a small town in Oklahoma. This film now joins other good movies about the rodeo scene like The Lusty Men and Junior Bonner. Only difference is this one had an actual rodeo champion as a heroprotagonist.The portrayal of Lane Frost was as genuinely nice young man who rose to the top of his chosen profession through skill hard work and dedication. He was doing as so few of us are privileged to do actually make money doing what he loved. He gained a celebrity status in his field and was prey to the temptations that accompany fame. The Lane Frost Perry gives us is a man who was very human. Doesn't detract in the least from his accomplishments. Cynthia Geary is fine as the wife who wins loses and wins Perry back ultimately. She's also rodeo people the real Mrs. Frost was a barrel racing champion.And Stephen Baldwin as Tuff Hedeman who was Frost's best friend and eventual successor as bull riding champion registers well in his role.In 1994 the very year that 8 Seconds came out professional bull riding spun out on its own as a sport with the formation of the Professional Bull Riders. It's champion in 1995 was none other than Tuff Hedeman. And in 1996 Tuff Hedeman and Lane Frost with both inducted in the PBR Ring of Honor the equivalent of their Hall of Fame. It's a good biographical picture and should have gotten much more attention than it did.".

The Lane Frost Perry gives us is a man who was very human. Doesn't detract in the least from his accomplishments. Cynthia Geary is fine as the wife who wins loses and wins Perry back ultimately. She's also rodeo people the real Mrs. Frost was a barrel racing champion.And Stephen Baldwin as Tuff Hedeman who was Frost's best friend and eventual successor as bull riding champion registers well in his role.In 1994 the very year that 8 Seconds came out professional bull riding spun out on its own as a sport with the formation of the Professional Bull Riders. It's champion in 1995 was none other than Tuff Hedeman. And in 1996 Tuff Hedeman and Lane Frost with both inducted in the PBR Ring of Honor the equivalent of their Hall of Fame. It's a good biographical picture and should have gotten much more attention than it did.";

Evidently the film follows Lane's life fairly accurately and the diversions from the truth are acceptable when you consider films are in the business of making money and must appeal to a wider audience than those who are in the know.It is fitting that his parents said If people remember one thing about Lane we want it to be that he was a kind person and knew Jesus. I am not a religiouschurchy person at all and I add this here show you that this film is about a decent good person don't worry though the film does not preach etc.The acting is very good and the characters are quite believable. This is a nice film to watch with the family. I suppose if you cannot connect with the American West or horses or rodeos you may want to leave this film alone but otherwise it is a refreshing alternative to the usual Hollywood car chases gun fights sex and cheap jokes.My hat comes off to Lane Frost a person to admire.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a biopic about Rodeo superstar Lane Frost. It tells his story of living in his fathers footsteps and becoming a legend in his sport. It tells of how he met the love of his life and the ups and downs of his career full of broken bones and broken homes. A must see for anyone who knew his story or followed Rodeo competitions. It will be enjoyed by those who like a good honest story about a real person.The acting was really good here and although Luke Perry was a huge star on Beverly Hills 90210 to me this is by far his best acting role. Stephen Baldwin is th only guy I wish they had replaced those Baldwin's with the exception of Alec in some roles are just bad actors. The movie was good production wise and whoever is responsible for shooting and arranging the bullriding sequences did a great job too.It has a lot of heart. Lane is a great guy and everyone loves him but he wants his dad to be as proud of him as the rest of the world is doesn't every boy that looks up to their dad deserve to be told how proud they are. The movie shows that it takes a lot sometimes to know what love is and it truly shows that following your dreams can make and often break a person.This movie was a good little drama. It was slow at times and thats what hurt it for me it has some very dated stuff which makes it cheesy. I wish they had made it a little more exciting but it has tons of dialog and lovey dovey appeal. It is often labeled as an action and other than the bullriding it is not action at all and its often called a family movie but although it has a pg13 rating I think it is not family friendly not for younger kids anyway.If you like sad drama's give it a try or if you like rodeo stuff. I still can't give it more than 3 stars cause it didn't do a whole lot for me.Yee Haw!".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a biopic about Rodeo superstar Lane Frost. It tells his story of living in his fathers footsteps and becoming a legend in his sport. It tells of how he met the love of his life and the ups and downs of his career full of broken bones and broken homes. A must see for anyone who knew his story or followed Rodeo competitions. It will be enjoyed by those who like a good honest story about a real person.The acting was really good here and although Luke Perry was a huge star on Beverly Hills 90210 to me this is by far his best acting role. Stephen Baldwin is th only guy I wish they had replaced those Baldwin's with the exception of Alec in some roles are just bad actors. The movie was good production wise and whoever is responsible for shooting and arranging the bullriding sequences did a great job too.It has a lot of heart. Lane is a great guy and everyone loves him but he wants his dad to be as proud of him as the rest of the world is doesn't every boy that looks up to their dad deserve to be told how proud they are.

Instead they will cringe at badly done accents and wonder where the boy's likability went. No loved one is spared and the writers seemed to go out of their way to transform Lane's Justins from leather to clay. Why does the media tear down our heroes?Luke Perry's affected accent borders on parody and Cynthia Geary formerly Shelly on Northern Exposure is downright unappealing as Lane's wife Kellie. All too often TV actors lack a certain texture to make it on the big screen and the casting here proves it. I suspect the powers that be were trying to cash in on the popularity of Perry's and Geary's television shows. The late Red Mitchell a genuine Texan and film actor was excellent as the poetry spouting  Cody Lambert. Cowboy poetry is a real art form but the real Cody Lambert wasn't known for his poetical abilities.Further evidence that Perry is no Lane Frost comes from the scene where he tosses his hat brim down on a chair. No self respecting cowboy would ever do that! In fact it was a rapid glance test for sniffing out cocacola cowboys back in the days following Urban Cowboy when everyone and their brother was trying to pass as a real cowboy. On that subject a lot of rodeo cowboys are treated with disdain by those from working ranches. Rodeo is an extremely expensive hobby and most real cowboys can't afford to ride any circuit other than the pasture fence line. The vast majority of rodeo cowboys and wage riding cowboys for that matter end up so stoved up that they are old men by the age of 40 something the film gave a passing nod to. Lane really did wear a wild turkey feather in his hatband but he wasn't hurt by Red Rock who was actually a popular bull to draw. The trailer in the picture was an insult to the man and they did split up for awhile but it wasn't over cheating. Tuff really did manage to hang on for 8 more seconds in honor of Lane during his ride at the 1989 National Rodeo Finals. You can say well heck it is only a movie cut it some slack but I say this is about a real man who really touched a lot of people's hearts and those that don't know any better now only get this fractured view of him. He deserved a lot better.Then there is the way family members are portrayed. If one believes this movie the whole Frost family had closeness issues... and that is just with the parents. Lane's siblings are ignored all together. In real life Elsie is generous and the picture of Christian charity and bless her for it but this film showed her and Clyde in a pretty bad light and doesn't say much for his real life wife either.Still there are some interesting moments and an absolutely priceless credit sequence where we get to see the real Lane Frost in action. Your heart can leap into your mouth watching him get busted up by those bulls and you may cheer when he gets up and walks away with that infectious grin of his. If you want to be a bullrider you may even give it a rethink after seeing that even a champion gets stomped every once in awhile.I always bust out sobbing while those precious minutes roll by but it is from seeing Lane ride again and being mentally transported back in time. Those were exciting and very stressful years and I frankly resent the director's attempt to force us into reaching for the tissues by the choice in music over the credits. Typical country tearjerkers. Instead of walking away in contemplation or in marvel of Lane's life we are left on a very big downer a box office killer and further proof someone was asleep on the job. Lane would not have wanted that for us.Overall I give it low marks for the mauling of a genuine American Hero but qualified high marks for that credit sequence!".

The story behind the riding was a lot darker as he was married young to a woman named Kellie Cynthia Geary and the two suffered many problems.8 SECONDS was a film that was meant to turn Perry into a major movie star but it was released to a lot of lukewarm reviews and it didn't do overly well at the box office. The film pretty much didn't live up to what it was trying to do and it certainly left a mark on Perry's career.I'm really not sure why the film didn't do better. Perhaps it was a bit too dark for a kids movie yet not quite adult enough to cater to older viewers. In my opinion the film was unjustly criticized and it's really too bad because this was a pretty good movie that at least told a good story and featured some nice performances.I think the film probably would have been better had it gone straight out as an adult movie and dealt with the darker issues in a more serious manor. Both Perry and Geary are so good in their roles that you can't help but enjoy them as they take us through the story. The two of them are especially good during the more dramatic moments and they certainly sell the story of the young couple dealing with things they don't quite understand.".

As Lane works his way up the rodeo circuit with his best friend Tuff Hedeman Stephen Baldwin he meets Kelly Kyle Cynthia Geary a pretty barrelrace rider with whom he falls in love. Lane and Kelly marry and while Lane's dedication to rodeo and its fans earns him a devoted following it also keeps him away from Kelly and threatens to sink their relationship. Lane's hard work pays off when he wins the 1987 world championship but the danger of the sport catches up with him two years later when he dies as a result of an accident during competition. This movie was made to commemorate the life of Lane Frost. Lane was the typical boy. At a young age he started to bull ride. He traveled around with his best friends and he made his way up the rodeo circuit. He followed his dreams. They made the movie to show that Lane lived his life to the fullest. He made mistakes just like the normal person. Also that Lane died doing what he loved. He did not let the fear of death stop him from doing what he loved to do. He had his minor injuries every now and then but he did not let that stop him also. This just shows us that if a bull rider could do it we could do it also.Growing up always loving animals the movie intrigued me to want to watch it. With loving horses and cows I knew that 8 Seconds would be a movie that I would love. After watching the movie I saw that it was about more than just the fact of rodeos. The movie taught me to always follow your dreams no matter the risk. I believe there is no better way to die if I am doing what I love!".

The country lifestyle is shown well and I guess this is part of the reason a lot of people don't like it  country jokes and country boys are often crude and seemingly disrespectful and for someone who doesn't really understand it the 'redneck' stereotype can certainly sway opinion.

And it was fairly accurate to his life although from what I've heard and read Lane and Kelly never really cheated on each other it was just added for the film for more drama. And as a personal friend of Stephen Baldwin I'm not just saying all of this because he's in it although it makes it more fun and enjoyable to watch the film even more. I saw this film before and after I knew him and now when I see him I always quote the movie to him and talk to him about it. I think it is a great movie truly inspirational it really touches the heart!

And it was fairly accurate to his life although from what I've heard and read Lane and Kelly never really cheated on each other it was just added for the film for more drama. And as a personal friend of Stephen Baldwin I'm not just saying all of this because he's in it although it makes it more fun and enjoyable to watch the film even more. I saw this film before and after I knew him and now when I see him I always quote the movie to him and talk to him about it. I think it is a great movie truly inspirational it really touches the heart! I would recommend this movie to anyone you don't have to have any interest in bull riding or cowboys for that matter to enjoy this film!";

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people don't find The Cocoanuts to be as entertaining as some of the later Marx Brothers films. Maybe not but it definitely comes close. Personally I thought this was the Marx Brothers' fifth best film. It's not that it's bad because it great but it's just not as good as some of the others that's all.As several other people have said it really doesn't stand up technically as well as most of the others but that has nothing to do with the quality of the script which is just great. I truly believe that if I had seen this in 1929 I would have been as hooked on the Marxes as I am now.There are many great bits in this movie including the first scene between Groucho and Chico the Auction the connected bedroom thing and the first time we ever see Groucho do his thing with Margaret Dumont. But the only scene in this movie to make my personal Ten Best Marx Scenes is the WhyADuck routine. Genius it's just pure genius. That's my only word for it.Harpo really doesn't have a lot of good stuff in this movie. He's great in what he doesn't have but he really shines in Monkey Business and Duck Soup. Those are his two best performances if you ask me. If you are looking for classic Harpo I'd suggest watching either of those. Also Zeppo obviously has nothing to do. But then what did you expect?This movie has a few actually rather unfunny spots in it but you can blame that on the fact that this is the brothers' first movie and they are still getting used to the camera. But it has a lot more comedy than noncomedy and is still a whole lot better than most of the comedies that are coming out nowadays.This may sound a little strange but if you have never seen a Marx Brothers movie I suggest watching this one first. It's a lot more enjoyable if you aren't expecting it to be equal to Duck Soup or Animal Crackers. Because it's not. But as I can not stress enough it is still worth checkout and better than than anything they did postA Night at the Opera.Well it's the Marx Brothers best movie of the 20's anyway.810".

Also making her film debut at age 40 is the wonderful and imperious Margaret Dumont. Basil Ruysdael plays the house detective. Zeppo Marx plays the desk clerk.A blah ballad is sung to death but The Monkey DoodleDoo song is terrific and well sung and danced by Eaton a Broadway star and chorus. Oddly staged productions number with chorus in monkey suits and tourists milling about in the background. But Eaton is quite good considering the early sound equipment. And she has great legs.Francis is fun in her second film she made five in 1929 but teamed with the unappealing Ring. Shaw is OK but seems too old to be playing the juvenile lead.But while Dumont Francis and Eaton are fun it's the 3 brothers who dominate the film. Several classic bits including the viaduct gag Chico's great piano solo Harpo getting to steal a few scenes and of course Groucho riding roughshod over everyone. What a treat! While Kay Francis went on to major stardom in the 30s Mary Eaton made one disastrous film after this hit Flo Ziegfeld's Glorifying the American Girl. That ended her starring career in Hollywood.The more I watch the Marx Brothers the more I appreciate Chico who was always my least favorite of the 3. Now I notice his perfect comic timing and I just love his piano solos.".

It is set in Florida during the 1920s land boom down there by the time the show opened in 1928 a hurricane had destroyed the land boom. Groucho runs a seedy hotel where Mrs. Potter and her daughter Polly Margaret Dumont and Mary Eaton are residing. So is Polly's boy friend the architect Bob Adams Oscar Shaw as well as black sheep socialite Harvey Yates Cyril Ring and Penelope Kay Francis. Yates needs money and is trying to marry Polly. Penelope is willing to assist him as she wants to steal Mrs. Potter's jewelry. Mrs. Potter is favorable to Yates because he is one of the Boston Yates but Polly favors Bob  who is still struggling to get any backers for his architectural ideas. Because he is not making money or from money Mrs. Potter dislikes his attentions to Polly.Groucho's Mr. Hammer and his assistant Jamison  Zeppo are hoping to sell various lots of real estate to their hotel guests at an auction. Then two new guests arrive Chico and Harpo. Groucho notices their luggage is empty. That's okay says Chico It will be full when we leave. Naturally the arrival of Chico and Harpo excites the suspicions of the local sheriff Hennesy Basil Ruysdaal. It is impossible to sensibly discuss the humor of the Marx Brothers in this their first sound film and one of their zaniest. Just a few choice momentsGroucho and Chico as a plant at the auction where Chico knows he has to raise the bids. Unfortunately he does not realize when to stop doing so so that when Hammer frantically tries to stop him from preventing someone with money from buying a lot Chico keeps ignoring. I go higher...higher...I have plenty of numbers left! he says.Groucho Chico and Harpo playing musical rooms with Dumont and Kay Francis on the night of the jewel robbery. And Francis discovering that her comeon line Has anyone ever told you you look like the Prince of Wales? is being used by everyone else.Even a slightly sad moment is memorable. When Bob is arrested at one point a tearful Mary Eaton watches this  Harpo walks over to her and hands her a flower. She embraces the silent brother who just looks perplexed about what else to do.It is constantly brought up that Eaton and Shaw are drags on the film. Actually Ms Eaton was quite lively when given a chance and Shaw is game in one of the routines with Groucho and Harpo. Kay Francis would later show a comic flair in movies too but here she is relatively subdued as far as comedy is concerned until her last shot with Cyril Ring. Ring is a nonentity. Ruysdaal has one really glorious moment when he demands his shirt  he can't be happy without his shirt!. And of course Margaret Dumont got her first chance to show what an asset she was to the Marx Brothers in seven films.For a musical comedy the surviving songs mostly by Irving Berlin one is by Victor Herbert! are passable only. When My Dream Comes True can linger in the memory but it is not gradeA Berlin. Sadly Irving composed Always for the show but George Kaufman showed his contempt for the tune and and angry Berlin took it back. A case of pearls before swine there.".

And of course Margaret Dumont got her first chance to show what an asset she was to the Marx Brothers in seven films.For a musical comedy the surviving songs mostly by Irving Berlin one is by Victor Herbert! are passable only. When My Dream Comes True can linger in the memory but it is not gradeA Berlin. Sadly Irving composed Always for the show but George Kaufman showed his contempt for the tune and and angry Berlin took it back. A case of pearls before swine there.";

	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to popular belief Cocoanuts was not the first Marx Brothers movie. That honor belongs to Humorisk a silent film which no longer exists. It was greeted with such hostility that one master reel was burned and the other deteriorated in a producer's closet. It is difficult to imagine Chico and Groucho in a silent film and while one might envision Harpo as the ultimate silent comedian his whistling and hornhonking formed an essential part of his act.By 1929 however sound was here to stay and many silent comics suddenly found themselves out of work. In fact the only two comedians to successfully make the transition from silent to sound were Laurel and Hardy Chaplin didn't make his first sound movie until 1940 and was never comfortable with sound. Comedy teams like Stan and Ollie and the Marx Brothers needed dialog even Harpo communicated with his brothers using broad gestures and the aforementioned honks and whistles.The biggest story of 1929 besides the stock market crash was the Florida land boom. Mr. Hammer Groucho is the manager of a struggling hotel trying to lure customers so that he can sell them Florida lots. Of course Astoria Long Island where this movie was filmed is not exactly the Sunshine State and the opening tribute to sunny Florida shows us some sand poured on a sound stage to simulate a beach and a painted backdrop of palm trees and coconut. Groucho pursues the rich Mrs. Potter Margaret Dumont whose daughter Polly Mary Eaton is in love with Bob Adams Oscar Shaw. Also interested in Polly or rather her mother's money is Harvey Yates Cyril Ring. Together with his parter Penelope Kay Francis they decide to steal Mrs. Potter's expensive necklace and blame it on Bob easing the way for Yates to marry Polly.The highlight of the film is the famous Why a duck? routine. It's Chico versus the English language and guess who wins? When Groucho tells Chico that there's going to be an auction he replies I come from Italy on the Atlantic Auction. When Groucho talks about levees Chico thinks that's the Jewish neighborhood. When he asks him what a radius is Chico responds that it's WJZ at that time a popular New York radio station. And when it comes to the word viaduct he is totally lost.Groucho Here's a little peninsula and here is a viaduct leading over to the mainland.Chico OK why a duck? Waya no chicken? Having been told by Groucho to keep the bidding high during the auction Chico in a very funny scene takes over the whole show refusing to let anyone else in on the action.As far as the music is concerned it is difficult to imagine Irving Berlin writing such drivel as When My Dreams Come True and Monkey DoodleDo. The former is sung in a duet between Mary Eaton and Oscar Shaw whom Groucho described as strictly notalent. Indeed it's hard to determine which is worseShaw's acting or his singing.There was a song written for Cocoanuts however that was rejected because it made the show too long. It became one of Berlin's greatest hits. The song was Always.The print quality varies from good to fair. It appears that Universal spliced together scenes from several different prints to make one entire movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1929 the Marx Brothers had been in show business for quite sometime mainly doing live theatre work but the only film they did prior to that year was a 1921 silent comedy short entitled Humour Risk which was publicly screened only once and then never seen again. The comedy team made their featurelength film debut with this 1929 release an early Hollywood talkie called The Cocoanuts based on the group's stage musical of the same name. This marked the beginning of a successful series of comedy movies from the brothers. Every member of this comedy team died before I was born but I have now seen several of their films most recently this one. Unsurprisingly it wasn't as good as Duck Soup but it was perhaps a bit better than I expected.Mr. Hammer runs a resort hotel in Florida known as Hotel de Cocoanut with his assistant Jamison. Unfortunately business is not going well at all as the hotel doesn't have enough paying guests. Harpo and Chico are two criminals who come to the hotel with empty luggage and intend to fill it up during their stay by stealing from the other guests and conning them! It turns out that they are not the only thieves in the building. A rich widowed guest named Mrs. Potter wants her daughter Polly to marry a man named Harvey Yates not realizing that this man is actually a con artist who intends to steal her diamond necklace with the help of his partner Penelope! To add to this chaos Mr. Hammer tries to make money by trying to win Mrs. Potter's heart but does a very pathetic job saying some ridiculous things to her.I wasn't sure what I thought of this particular Marx Brothers effort right at the beginning but knew I had to be patient as none of the comedians had appeared yet. It isn't long at all before Groucho first appears in the role of Mr. Hammer and begins rapidly delivering his funny lines! The comedian had a remarkable gift for that. When Harpo and Chico enter sharing their stage names with the characters they play the laughs continue. Zeppo plays the straight role of Jamison while the other three brothers who appear in the film all play very comical roles and they all provide some hilarious moments! Groucho has so many priceless lines such as some of the things he says to Mrs. Potter played by Margaret Dumont who appeared in a number of Marx Brothers films to try and win her heart and some of his lines in many other scenes. Harpo and Chico make a hilarious pair with their fighting and such and Chico has some hilarious lines while Harpo is responsible for a lot of the hilarity with his visual antics and honking noises. I would say each of these three is equally good in his own way.This is not the most popular movie from one of the 20th century's groundbreaking comedy acts but overall it's still an extremely funny one. I didn't like everything about The Cocoanuts. In addition to being a comedy it's also a musical and I found that the singingdancing scenes generally don't work so well. They can be tedious and can also get in the way of the humour. Since this is the earliest talkie I've ever seen it's not surprising that it probably has the worst audio I've ever heard in a movie. I guess it was the best they could do at the time but as I watched this it was sometimes difficult to understand some of the dialogue and because of this some of the jokes may have gone over my head. However for the most part these weren't big problems for me I could usually tell what the characters were saying and I certainly have to give the film credit for how much it made me laugh! The Marx Brothers' silliness is obviously not for everyone but this featurelength debut of theirs is probably worth watching if you're a fan and you can get over the poor sound quality.".

Who could forget the classic Why a duck? routine as hotel owner Mr. Hammer Groucho explains to his guest Chico about his upcoming auction at Cocoanut Manor? During Penelope's Kay Francis' attempted heist of her neighbor Mrs. Potter's Margaret Dumont's necklace Mr. Hammer Chico  Harpo cause a great deal of havoc as they repeatedly barge in and out of the two ladies' rooms. Harpo displays his kindheartedness by walking up to the weeping Polly Potter Mary Eaton and offering her a lollipop. At the costume party detective Hennessy Basil Ruysdael  company sing a lament to the tune of the Habanera from Bizet's Carmen regarding Hennessy's lost shirt once Hennessy finds his shirt he  company rejoice in singing to the tune of the Toreador Song from Carmen. When Chico and Harpo first check into the Hotel de Cocoanut Harpo uses a few pens as darts drinks a container of ink and tears up some of the residents' mail a little later Chico and Harpo perform the Anvil Chorus from Verdi's Il Trovatore using a bulb horn and a cash register.In closing here are a few interesting tidbits about The Cocoanuts. The person who handled the choreography for the dance numbers was Erna Ernie Kretschmer who a few years later became the wife of the famous comedian Joe Besser. The famed composer Irving Berlin wrote the music for both the play and the movie but afterwards he reportedly never again wanted to work with the undisciplined Marx Bros. Berlin supposedly had written the tune Always for the Broadway show but it was never used...and it eventually became one of his most popular songs! Harpo remembered that the filming of The Cocoanuts was quite a difficult adventure that ultimately became in his opinion a lot funnier than the actual film. When Harpo travelled to Russia in 1933 to perform on stage as a solo act he rehearsed his aforementioned penthrowing inkdrinking mailtearing act for a couple of Russian playwrights Harpo was bewildered when one of the writers actually had the gall to ask him WHY he was doing these bizarre acts!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been suggested by more than one intelligent film critic that the Golden Age of movie comedies ended with the arrival of sound. Probably the earliest definitive refutation of that is this 1929 film introducing motionpicture audiences to the Marx Brothers.The great Florida land boom has yet to hit the swampy resort town of Coconut Beach where hotel owner Mr. Hammer Groucho and his assistant Zeppo deal with a paucity of paying guests and a platoon of bellhops who haven't been paid in weeks. Hammer manages to placate them You wanna be wage slaves? And what makes wage slaves? Wages! but finds two new arrivals Chico and Harpo less easy to sucker while he tries to marry into the wealthy arms of the widow Mrs. Potter Margaret Dumont.It may be the Marxes' least revered film from their Zeppo period but this the earliest surviving comedy of theirs provides more than quaint curio appeal or historic interest. It's a nice transfer of their stage act using one of their successful Broadway plays with nifty direction by Robert Florey and Joseph Santley. While hobbled by early sound technology there are plenty of neat camera tricks and a less static composition than on offer in the next more heralded Marx Brothers film Animal Crackers with overhead shots and cutaways. And the antic wordplay especially from Groucho is so fast and dense it provides fresh laughs even after five or six screenings.I even like the singing and dancing especially an opening number shot on a soundstage in Queens N.Y. but dressed to resemble either Florida or a Haircut 100 video. The letusentertainyou spirit on ample evidence here evokes a fastfading preDepression giddiness where flappers with wide hips and small chests bat eyes at derbywearing men glad for the attention.The Brothers themselves don't really need the help their craft honed to perfection on stage that they clearly know where the laughs are. Groucho and Chico perform one of their classic routines the ViaductWhy A Duck number while Harpo does some prime gurning and props his knee upon every passing dame and some guys.Groucho takes a look at Chico and Harpo's lone suitcase when they check in.That bag's empty!We fill it up before we leave answers Chico.The most glaring weakness of Cocoanuts is a lamerthanusual romantic subplot. Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle slowed things down in Night At The Opera but at least they could sing unlike Mary Eaton and Oscar Shaw whose caterwauling here may attract dogs to your doorstep from a mile away. Irving Berlin's score is amazingfor its inanity. Though MonkeyDoodleDoo isn't quite as bad as its title it sounds like Blue Skies compared to When My Dreams Come True a lifeless ballad reprised five ! times in the picture including twice by Harpo once each on oboe and harp.Dumont is not yet the presence she became in later Marx films but Kay Francis offers an attractive foil to the Boys as a designing woman who bites off more than she can chew trying to make a stooge of Harpo. Audiences may start off thinking Basil Ruysdael is just another straight man playing a suspicious cop but the joke's on us as we discover by the end.Speaking of straight men this may be Zeppo's finest film if you go along with those who argue he was the master of minimalist comedy serving up subtle metahumor in the face of his brothers' hijinks by literally doing nothing on screen. Not until Night At The Opera in which he set a new standard by not appearing at all would Zeppo be quite this masterful again.".

The sound is full of hisses the camerawork is static and the production has a very stagy quality about it. Really it's more of a filmed stage play than a movie. The parts where the Marxes aren't the focus especially the lame romantic stuff and the forgettable musical numbers are tough to sit through. But when the Marxes are on screen they're lots of fun. They perfected these parts on stage so it should come as no surprise they seem more relaxed in their roles than many of the other actors in the movie who are very stiff. In addition to being the first film for the Marx Bros this is also the film debut of Kay Francis. She does nothing in this to make an impression. Margaret Dumont gets her first big screen role here which is fitting considering she's best remembered today for her movies with the Marxes. In the opening minutes pay close attention and you'll notice Barton MacLane as a beefy guy on the beach with an amorous woman draped on his arm. It's a fun movie despite its problems. See it for the Bros and keep your finger on the FF button for when they aren't around. Their 'viaduct' routine is a classic.".

It plays secondfiddle to their hilarious hijinks and there are plenty of them to savor. The musical numbers can be a bit tedious but they're worth sitting through while we wait for Groucho Harpo and Chico to take center stage. Oh yeah Zeppo's in this one too but who really expects much from him? One of the delights of The Cocoanuts is the presence of a prestardom Kay Francis who would soon sign with Warner Bros. and become one of their highest paid stars. Sadly her reign as the queen of Warners was shortlived and she is rather obscure today but she was not only a great actress but an absolute babe! Having seen her in this I now look forward to seeing more of her films.Brian W. Fairbanks".

	schema:reviewBody "The Marx Brothers' first sound Hollywood film a reworking of their successful stage show of the same title. As demonstrated in their one try at a silent film their brand of humor just didn't work without sound. Even Harpo needed sound to communicate with his horn and whistle. The plotand it does have one apparently unappreciated by some reviewers consists of 2 themes1a struggling Florida resort hotel in the early days of vacation land Florida trying to get on a firm financial foundation 2a young romantic couple in trouble accused of stealing the priceless diamond necklace belonging to the girl's mother with one of the actual thieves scheduled for an immediate marriage to the daughter via her mother's insistence. As things turn out the romantic couple help the hotel to attract customers400 guests all of a sudden! while the brothers locate the stolen necklace and provide evidence of the real thieves. Margaret Dumont serves as the wealthy widowed society matron whose priceless diamond necklace is stolen. Harpo and Chico as a pair of suspiciouslooking transients are the chief suspects. They arrive with an empty suitcase and tell Groucho the proprietor that they hope to have it full when they leave. But instead they provide evidence of the real thieves and the temporary location of the necklace. Groucho who owns some surrounding land as well as the hotel auctions off some of the land to prevent the hotel from going bankrupt. He tells Chico to bid up the price but Chico almost always comes out the high bidder. When Margaret offers a 1000. reward for the recovery of her necklace Chico bids up the reward to 2000. There's also a good amount of music in conformity with the vaudevillian formula of a mix of comedy drama and music. Some reviewers think that music should have been minimal that it tends to distract from the flow of comedy. However in the '30s through the early '50s when the comedy and musical stars were often exvaudevillians musicals generally had some comedy as well as drama and comedies generally had some music and drama. Most of the musical numbers were derived from Irving Berlin's compositions for the stage show there being only one new composition. The film begins with a troupe of chorus girls practicing on a studio sandy beach to the tune of Florida by the Sea. A little later the female bellhops form a chorus line to The BellHops. Then the romantic couple played by Oscar Shaw and Mary Eaton sing When My Dreams Come True which serves as the theme song for the film popping up again periodically. Harpo plays it on his clarinet. He also plays the harp as expected. Chico plays The Gypsy Love Song on the piano. The novelty songs MonkeyDoodleDoo and Tale of the Shirt were included. Visually the most spectacular production number was performed by the GambyHale Ballet Girls. In addition to a standard ballet presentation they are seen in an overhead projection forming various geometric patterns as might be expected in a kaleidoscope. This was a pioneering concept. The much more remembered Busby Berkeley was also experimenting with this concept about the same time and used it in several musicals in the earlymid '30s. This was the only example of overhead projection in a Marx Brothers film as chorus girl productions were few in subsequent films. Although Harpo is usually associated with harpplaying in fact he was reasonably proficient with several other instruments as demonstrated here or in subsequent films. These included the clarinet harmonica and piano. When the brothers saw the completed film they were appalled and offered to buy the master copies to be burned. However it turned out to be a hit with audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's strange to see the archaic musical numbers punctuating the mayhem of the Marx Brothers but in 1929 musicals were still all the rage in Hollywood. At the time this film was being made the Marx Brothers and Margaret Dumont were being shuffled between the big street where they were starring in Animal Crackers and Paramount's New York studios that weren't even soundproofed yet.You know Irving Thalberg was wrong about the Marx Brothers. When he picked them up at MGM in 1935 he said The problem with you guys is you never help anybody but in this film the Marx Brothers  well Harpo and Chico anyways  end up helping a couple that are in love played by Mary Eaton Polly and Oscar Shaw Bob who were probably picked for these roles for their musical rather than their acting talents. Polly's mom played by the imperious and hilarious Margaret Dumont Mrs. Potter wants Polly to marry Yates Cyril Ring who actually is after Polly's money. That plan isn't working too well so Penelope Kay Francis comes up with a way to get money by stealing Mrs. Potter's necklace and frame someone else.One of the great questions I was left with was why would Penelope help Yates? She could have just stolen the necklace and kept it for herself and left him out of it completely. After all she took all of the risk! Their connection is never explained and neither is her generosity. It's a strange role for Kay because one thing Kay never was in her films was a doormat.But back to the Marx brothers. Some people complain about the lack of a plot but you simply can't lock the Marx brothers into one. You need to let them run free to do their series of one liners of which Groucho is a master allow Chico to be the character and allow Harpo to be the menace. Note he doesn't chase women in this film because the camera still cannot move in 1929. And then there is Margaret Dumont. Would Groucho ever be so funny as when he is verbally harassing this society matron she really was one folks!. She always told people she never got the jokes but she had to keep up the front. Half the fun is that everything seems to go right past her. She looks like she THINKS she's being insulted but with her breeding she simply can't quite make sense out of her being made the joke  and THAT is the plausible illusion that makes the act.I mentioned earlier that the music was archaic but Paramount manages to come up with a kaleidoscopic aerial shot of a dance number before Busby Berkeley ever does. As for Mary Eaton 1929 is pretty much the beginning and the end of her film career. Not being able to take the end of her fame as one of the Seven Little Eatons and then a Zeigfeld girl she died of alcoholism at only age 47. As for the Marx Brothers? This film had two directors and they were wise to pretty much let the brothers wing it. They made four more films for Paramount the last being the political satire classic Duck Soup in 1933. Mary Eaton's time in the limelight was over because her time was past as for the Marx Brothers their films were not huge financial successes in their era mainly because they were ahead of their time by decades.This first film is a little awkward but that is mainly because of the sound film era being new. Try to enjoy it in that light and I think you'll like it as much as I do.".

They are Groucho Chico Harpo and Zeppo. Actually Zeppo's role is so small it's pretty easy to forget he's in this as most of the attention is on the Greasepaint Mustachioed one the fake Italian one and the Silent RedWigged one. Oh and then there's Margaret Dumont who's so frequently in these movies that she's sometimes referred to as the fifth Marx Brother and with good reason as watch how she's always in good chemistry whenever she interacts with Harpo Chico and especially Groucho. And you not only hear their voices for the first time here but also see Harpo playing his harp and Chico his piano with the utmost seriousness which they both did beautifully. Oh and this was also the first time an Irving Berlin musical was adapted for the screen but with the exception of The MonkeyDoodleDoo and maybe When My Dreams Come True not much of the songs was worth remembering. But enough of that I'm sure what you want to know is if this is as funny as it's reputation. It is and lots more! I mean the Why a Duck? sequence is a deserved classic but there's also a great scene taking place in two hotel rooms with doors slamming and the camera mostly staying in place on those scenes that's also very hilarious and then there's Harpo's silent visual treats like him drinking ink or eating a telephone. Oh and many of Groucho's puns are still hilariously priceless! One more thing Busby Berkeley is often credited as the one who invented the overhead shot of dancers creating a kaleidescope pattern in film starting with Samuel Goldwyn's Whoopee! the following year but there was actually one in this movie previously before his arrival in Hollywood. Really I can't describe just how funny I found most of the thing whenever it's on Groucho Chico and Harpo of course so on that note The Cocoanuts is really still well worth seeing!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read quite a few comments on this movie and some of them I disagree with and others I don't. Sure it may be a little predictable and a bit 'all been done before' but there is a certain level of originality and uniqueness to it also.For starters it has a fantastic cast and both lead actors Jolie and Washingtonhave won Oscars and thats says something. It can't be easy playing a paralysed man and remaining so still and wooden and he plays the frustrations and emotions so realistically that I would imagine a person actually would be like in real life. Jolie is charming composed and works well with the camera. Her character is convincing enough and this goes for her performance.The support cast is fantastic too especially Queen Latifa.The film may have the usual iconographic elements found in the psychological thriller genre but they are necessary for it to firstly conform and also progress. 'The Bone Collector' introduces new techniques and a slightly different angle for the viewer. there has to be a certain amount of repetition with this genre for it to work and this is the case for many others such as romantic comedies and a couple falling in love or teen flicks with a football jock character.I am currently writing my degree dissertation on sexual subjectivity in psychological thrillers and this film is perfect for that. The changing levels of gendered representations is very interesting and both supports and detracts away from the current representations in society.I say give it a go! Don't listen to people who have already seen it and didn't like it. If I'd have done that then I wouldn't have given it a go and my dissertation would have been short of argument!".

In this case he plays homicide inspector Lincoln Rhyme who has been nearly paralyzed after suffering from an accident in the line of duty. But now when a mysterious killer begins killing off people in a very peculiar matter he must team with a hardheaded rookie cop Angelina Jolie to solve the crimes. Supporting cast includes Queen Latifah Michael Rooker Mike McGlone Luis Guzman Leland Orser and Ed O'Neil. I like the way they have the killer as an intelligent person. Someone who has a knowledge of what he is doing. And the way he leaves clues for the cops to follow. To come up with something this perfect you must a genius. While not really scary this suspense thriller is actually thrilling as opposed to the many number of thrillers that are not even thrilling. Example HANGMAN. Thank you Hollywood for giving us THE BONE COLLECTOR. This is a good one. Highly recommended.....55.".

I have read all of the previous reviews of this film on the IMDB and find them very interesting. Many of the reviews mention a movie titled Seven. I have never heard of much less seen Seven. I consider this fact to be a fortunate one because I was able to watch The Bone Collector without having to constantly compare it to a previous film. In short I liked this movie. I was entertained royally precisely because I didn't take the story line too seriously. There was not much time wasted on character development. GOOD !! I don't need to know why the characters became the persons that they are. I simply want them to get on with whatever they must do. Another thing that I liked was the lack of sex scenes which seem to be almost a necessity it today's movies. The two leads did a great job and their chemistry was excellent. Mr. Washington and Ms. Jolie were very believable. The killer? No big deal. I couldn't have cared less who did the killings. I simply waited for justice to be done. In short I don't agree with any of the harsh criticism that I have read on this forum. I guess that's because I am a rather down to earth person who has no need to turn watching a movie into an academic exercise complete with thorough analysis of character motivation etc.".

	schema:reviewBody "A bed ridden paraplegic NYC detective Lincoln Rhyme Denzel Washington teams up with a rookie cop named Amelia Angelina Jolie to try and catch a serial killer in this dark moody atmospheric thriller from Director Phillip Noyce. This is a fine thriller.From the getgo viewers understand that an intelligent maniac is on the loose and could strike at any time. That is the very definition of cinematic tension. In addition the killer uses dark subterranean spaces to torture and kill victims. That inky darkness together with a haunting musical score further amplifies suspense.But the solution to the whodunit puzzle is ultimately unsatisfying because the screenwriter withholds important backstory from viewers. This could have been so easily fixed with the addition of a line or two of dialogue andor a brief added scene near the film's beginning. Even so good plot misdirection creates ample red herrings so that the killer's identity is not a foregone conclusion.The film's cinematography production design and editing are fine. Washington does a good job as the paralyzed cop. But Angelina Jolie is miscast she pouts her way through the film looking like she's bored out of her mind. The support cast helps a lot with highly credible performances from delightful Queen Latifah capable Ed O'Neill and reliable Michael Rooker.The crime scenes tended unfortunately to be inyourface grizzly. But at least the gore quotient was minimal.For dark moody serial killer films set in NYC I prefer Sea Of Love 1989. Nevertheless The Bone Collector can be enjoyed for its elevated level of suspense its fine cinematography and its generally high level of acting. Be advised however that the film's finale may be a disappointment if you expect all the whodunit puzzle pieces to fall into place neat and tidy.".

This laziness feeds right through to the ending  if you thought that the Scream films were lazy and stupid wait till you see the stupid ending to this! Up till this the film does have plenty of horrible scenes and lots of tense bits with Jolie walking round in the dark with the killer potentially just round the corner.Jolie is good and deals with her character well  despite the fact that a beat cop would never just be able to become a crime scene officer on the whim of an excop. Washington deals well with his character being paralysed for the whole film but does get a bit silly at the end where he fights the killer with just his head! Support is fine  but Guzman is not as good as he usually is.Overall this is a B movie that got an A movie budget.

	schema:reviewBody "One time when I was about 11 years old I rented a film called The Silence of the Lambs and... Wow! I can't describe the the feelings I had. It was the best film I had seen till that moment and it is on my mind until today.In my opinion this was the inspiration for all the other thrillers which came out after 1991 specially those ones with a serial killer. Some time after that I rented Se7en which was for me wicked claustrophobic in the good way brilliant almost as good as The Silence of the Lambs. Taking those two films almost all the other serial killer thrillers were a big waste specially Kiss the Girls. However The Bone Collector was released in 1999. But for some reason it received many bad reviews. I really don't agree with them.The theme of The Bone Collector despite the fact that it has already been used in many other films is really interesting. I won't say much about it to preserve your entertaining but I can say it is very suspenseful dark wellwritten welldirected and wellacted. Denzel Washington gives another great performance as the paralitic detective but the big star is really Angelina Jolie. She's very very pretty and talented and has a GREAT future. She has been keeping my attention since the TV movie Gia and surprised me last year in the wonderful Playing By Heart. I'm very glad that she won the Golden Globe for Girl Interrupted and I hope she wins the Oscar for that part. Angelina deserves it for walk one more step on her brilliant career. Her acting in The Bone Collector is not different. Her dialogues with Denzel Washington in the film are intense and provoking and without her the film would have been a little lost.So when you see The Bone Collector try to forget the bad reviews and have fun. It is not The Silence of the Lambs. It is not Se7en. But it is a fine film if you want to feel your hands cold and your heart beating fast. And appreciate Angelina's beauty.710".

Taking those two films almost all the other serial killer thrillers were a big waste specially Kiss the Girls. However The Bone Collector was released in 1999. But for some reason it received many bad reviews. I really don't agree with them.The theme of The Bone Collector despite the fact that it has already been used in many other films is really interesting. I won't say much about it to preserve your entertaining but I can say it is very suspenseful dark wellwritten welldirected and wellacted. Denzel Washington gives another great performance as the paralitic detective but the big star is really Angelina Jolie. She's very very pretty and talented and has a GREAT future. She has been keeping my attention since the TV movie Gia and surprised me last year in the wonderful Playing By Heart. I'm very glad that she won the Golden Globe for Girl Interrupted and I hope she wins the Oscar for that part. Angelina deserves it for walk one more step on her brilliant career. Her acting in The Bone Collector is not different. Her dialogues with Denzel Washington in the film are intense and provoking and without her the film would have been a little lost.So when you see The Bone Collector try to forget the bad reviews and have fun. It is not The Silence of the Lambs. It is not Se7en. But it is a fine film if you want to feel your hands cold and your heart beating fast. And appreciate Angelina's beauty.710";

It was so !!! predictable. Some people even made bets  la 5 bucks she will save him. Moreover it was really stupid that the killer's motive had nothing to do with the entire film. And maybe the worst about the film was this completely ridiculous christmas scene where both lead characters seem to be a couple. It seemed to me like the writer thought Oh st I forgot the two have to fall in love and so he wrote this scene.Bottom line Quite entertaining but too predictable to be good.

One of the most recent in this generation's trend of serial killer movies is called The Bone Collector and stars Golden Globe winning actor Denzel Washington and the sexy actress Angelina Jolie. As often true the production is well acted directed with focus and precision by Philip Noyce The Saint Patriot Games and creates an appropriate mood for its characters. But even big stars and a appropriate atmosphere cannot save a movie this familiar and predictable. Denzel Washington plays a heroic cop named Lincoln Rhyme. He is an underdeveloped character however the screenplay supplies him with a vast reputation and experiences as a cop he has written a dozen books on crime scene tactics and his mind in an encyclopedia of crime solving methods. As the movie opens he is paralyzed at a crime site leaving him bedridden in his Manhattan apartment with control of only a single index finger. His headquarters  is decorated with all sorts of hightech gadgets and a kind nurse named Thelma Queen Latifah who is always there for him when he goes into violent seizures.A few gruesome murders transpire leaving a rookie cop Amelia Donaghy Angelina Jolie whose assistance is selected by the paralyzed but smart cop who uses her as his body to stop the psychopathic serial killer. The killer uses a taxi cap to lure his victims to their final and disturbing death. What is most bothersome about this production is that it teases us with intriguing implications of the graphic murders instead of portraying guts and irony by exploiting the supposedly grotesque images.The production consists mainly of sequences in which various characters loom in dark hallways allies rooms or sets designed specifically for the killer to lurk around in. Of course there is plenty of suspenseful music and a few surprising moments but the actual story greatly lacks imagination and edge. Angelina Jolie is the movie's standout performance but she is mainly used as a plot device to explore such areas as listed above. The Bone Collector is not a horrible movie just a recycled one. The material has been experienced so many times before we can never become too involved in the story or too interested with the characters. What bothers me most is how this kind of story has no cause or purpose the serial killer's motive as always is explained during the climax sequence and is disposable and contrived. Why do screenwriters create killers with disturbing motives but no reasoning behind them? Kind of defeats the purpose of rationalism doesn't it.".

They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10.

I'm tired of serial killer movies that try to cash in on the success of 'The Silence of the Lambs.' We've had countless films over the years since 'Silence' that are just tragic rehashes of each other with predictable and ridiculous endings.Now we have 'The Bone Collector' another typical 'psychological thriller' brought to life by a great cast and director.Angelina Jolie plays the coponthestreets who discovers a corpse next to a railroad. She immediately sparks interest in herself as the chief of police starts watching over her more and a paraplegic man named Lincoln Denzel Washington summons her to his home to ask her a simple question.Washington wants Jolie to help him catch the killer.Denzel Washington plays Lincoln a man who used to be big but is now immobile. His only moveable joint below his neck is a single finger which he uses to click a computer mouse by his bed. He is watched over by Queen Latifah a caring woman sure but not exactly loving.'The Bone Collector' based on the novel of the same name by Jeffery Deaver could easily have slipped into the average slot but because of a great cast is just good enough to recommend. There are some gutwrenching scenes in 'The Bone Collector' but then there are some scenes including the end that recede into the stereotypical psychological thriller.Director Phillip Noyce uses some great shadowing and a dark moody atmosphere to bring the surroundings of his film to life. Exterior shots are dark and withdrawn and interior shots are almost brighter. It is as if the darkness symbolizes the chemistry in the characters. The more Denzel talks to Jolie the brighter the room gets when they are outside it is darker. Why? Because she doesn't know anyone outside. It is as if the surroundings are tailored around her character's emotions. She's happy it's bright. She sad it's dark. EtcAll in all I was going to give 'The Bone Collector' a higher recommendation than three stars before I saw the ending but it turned out to be quite ridiculous and average plus it was very predictable. I guessed it before it happened.35 stars John Ulmer".

He is watched over by Queen Latifah a caring woman sure but not exactly loving.'The Bone Collector' based on the novel of the same name by Jeffery Deaver could easily have slipped into the average slot but because of a great cast is just good enough to recommend. There are some gutwrenching scenes in 'The Bone Collector' but then there are some scenes including the end that recede into the stereotypical psychological thriller.Director Phillip Noyce uses some great shadowing and a dark moody atmosphere to bring the surroundings of his film to life. Exterior shots are dark and withdrawn and interior shots are almost brighter. It is as if the darkness symbolizes the chemistry in the characters. The more Denzel talks to Jolie the brighter the room gets when they are outside it is darker. Why? Because she doesn't know anyone outside. It is as if the surroundings are tailored around her character's emotions. She's happy it's bright. She sad it's dark. EtcAll in all I was going to give 'The Bone Collector' a higher recommendation than three stars before I saw the ending but it turned out to be quite ridiculous and average plus it was very predictable. I guessed it before it happened.35 stars John Ulmer";

The other problem with this film is the script which does not play fair with the viewer. The killer turns out to be someone totally unexpected which would be fine if any clues to his or her identity had been given somewhere in the movie.

Phillip Noyce is a prime example of this. In my opinion he is one of the very worst directors not only working today but in the whole history of Hollywood cinema he's got Ed Wood beaten by a mile and this view is reinforced every time I watch or more appropriately endure one of his films I would call them something else but bad language will prevent this review from being posted I'm afraid. I'm not sure if the problem lies in his limited capabilities for the art of storytelling or in his appalling penchant for choosing wretched screenplays but the truth is that all of them and I regret to admit I have seen no less than six have made me wonder whether to laugh or cry at their incompetence or simply go to sleep from the boredom. The Bone Collector is of course no exception. In fact I think Noyce has outdone himself with it as it is an exceptionally terrible movie. I cannot find a single redeeming feature in it. For one Jolie is quite obviously miscast and even the usually solid Washington takes this as an opportunity to overact Well It's not like there's any actor's director around on set to restrain him is there?. The storyline is absurd from its very inception and I find it extremely hilarious that it pretends to be about the elusive science of evidencegathering when this kind of leftthereonpurpose evidence that only a movie killer would leave is precisely the one kind that requires no talent at all to find. BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT THERE. And then the investigations made from this evidence seems to follow little logic other than Rhyme's whims and intuitions or risible strokes of luck. The film keeps throwing oneortwoline characters at you so that you wonder which one the killer might be oh how very exciting but still the ending won't fail to underwhelm you. I have to admit one thing this pathetic excuse for a film kept me hooked not because it was interesting but because I was morbidly curious to find out how dire it could become as it went on. But of course that's because I saw it on TV and I didn't have to pay a ticket I swore years ago more precisely after I saw the narcolepsyinducing Clear and Present Danger that they would only take me to the cinema to watch a Phillip Noyce movie if I was WRAPPED IN CHAINS.Note This review was written before Noyce directed Rabbitproof Fence.

	schema:reviewBody "May Contain Spoilers  Director Phillip Noyce delivers an atmospheric thriller with The Bone Collector' a somewhat grisly tale of a serial killer in New York City.  Homicide detective Lincoln Rhyme Denzel Washington is an expert in the field of forensics he has also been a quadriplegic for four years the result of an accident sustained during the investigation of a crime scene.  From the neck down he has the use of only a single finger with which he controls a computer and monitor from his bed. Useless though his body may be his mind is still sharp and circumstances bring him together with a young NYPD officer Amelia Donaghy Angelina Jolie who has just received a long sought after transfer to the Youth Services Division.  Destiny takes her elsewhere however.  When she is the first officer to arrive at a crime scene Donaghy proceeds to secure the area and take the appropriate measures to insure that any evidence is not compromised.  Rhyme is consulted on the case a murder and takes note of the precision employed  by Donaghy in handling the crime scene.  When he meets her he learns that while at the academy she had read one of his books on the subject He has written a dozen on forensics and related issues. Rhyme then presses her into service as his eyes and ears to physically do at a crime scene what he cannot by talking her through each step via radio. Reluctant initially Donaghy soon exhibits an affinity for forensics and becomes much more than merely the physical extension of Rhyme they become partners and continue with the case accordingly. The Bone Collector' offers some chilling moments especially in two scenes one of which involves a steam pipe the other lots of rats.  In each case it is all the more horrifying because the victims can see exactly what is about to happen to them they have time to think about it and there is absolutely nothing they can do about it.  It makes for an eerie disconcerting story and though inherently dark it never descends to the appalling level of a predecessor in the genre Seven.'  Washington gives a top notch performance keeping Rhyme interesting though confined to bed for the entire movie and Jolie takes Amelia to a believable level that far surpasses the typical ingenue rendering of such characters.  Unfortunately character development on the whole is sacrificed for sensationalism with the exception of Rhyme whose character is readily established we are offered mere glimpses of the rest.  We have hints as to what motivates Amelia but we are left guessing as to the agenda of Captain Cheney Michael Rooker.  Along the way some characters are used like obstacles thrown into the path of a race track Cheney is one a bookstore clerk is another with the sole intent of manipulating the audience.  With a little more depth this could have been a remarkable movie.  The supporting cast includes Queen Latifah who brings a welcome presence to the film as Rhyme's nurse Thelma Ed O'Neill Detective Sellitto Leland Orser Richard Thompson Mike McGlone Detective Solomon Luis Guzman Eddie Ortiz and Arthur Holden Bookstore clerk.  While this film provides for some real gut wrenching reactions it is not The Silence of the Lambs.'  On a dark night however when you're alone in your living room with nothing but the flickering of the television and the wind howling outside it'll do.  I rate this one 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "It never seems to amaze me but even through the most contrived films out there Denzel Washington could still pull off an amazing thriller. His body language in his comfort zone which is why he more often gets cast as an athlete or a military personnel. He truly has the gift of the gab and The Bone Collector' clearly exemplifies that. It's a bit shameful that Washington is for most of the film quadriplegic. In The Bone Collector Washington is a forensics specialist named Lincoln Rhyme who works for the NYPD. In the opening scene at the lower depths of the subway station he's hit by a beam which was the cause for his immobility. As a result the only joints that are still in tact are a finger his shoulders and his brain. In order for this film to work requires someone extraordinary to equally match Mr. Washington's talents. In one of her earlier starring roles Angelina Jolie steps up to the plate as a rookie detective Amelia Donaghy who's been assigned to fill in his running fieldwork for him. And even though she's drenched in sex appeal backed by a upbeat soundtrack and a tantalizing view of the Manhattan skyline The Bone Collector could still be a potential dust collector.The plot involving a methodical macabre sadistic killer with clues scattered around is unoriginal of a story and it reminds us all of the 1995 film Se7en but at least in the aforementioned story it is executed more subliminally. Some of Rhyme's conclusions are illogical and implausible. Spending most of the film planted flat on his back Mr. Rhyme is able to unravel esoteric clues with pieces of bones and skin particles situated overhead like Velma of Scooby Doo fame he can easily trace these small clue fragments towards the murderer being a NYC cab driver committing sadistic acts from over a hundred years ago. Rhyme is able to track down the killer's next whereabouts located to what appears to be a old slaughterhouse. Rhyme is able to know exactly which one it is. Based on the bestselling novel by Jeffrey Deaver the script by Jeremy Iacone The Bone Collector had the potential to be a very intriguing mystery thriller in the same vein like Sherlock Holmes the only problem that makes this film too unbelievable was that Rhyme was never once wrong about all his fragmented evidence. And to top it all off wasn't it just coincidental that Queen Latifah as Nurse Thelma who seems very savvy at putting pieces together almost like it was a hobby to her. And another reason this film is not mindnumbing brain work can be found in the cab itself. If you look closely on the rearview mirror you will see a doll with a noose tied around his neck. I mean would you hop into a New York cab seeing something like that? To all cabbies watching this movie I'd advise you to avoid this one unless you want your clients to fear you that you might drive them to a slaughterhouse. Even though this film's genre is billed as a psychological thriller it actually work better as a romantic drama. It might not look that way but through watchful eyes I can see the connection. We can see through the character of Jolie's character Amelia Donaghy. From her evidence she unraveled from the killer's first victim Rhyme narrowly believes that Donaghy has the talent for forensic science but it's clearly obvious she is still very green in experience. He also believes that she is the only one who is capable of digging up evidence to cluesearching. I'm sure the NYPD can find more experienced people than her. I think he's hiring her because he loves her company. Director Philip Noyce's closeups of Rhyme looking over his inexperienced cohort. Sure she's nice on the eyes and the way they look at each other it shows they have feelings for one another.The performances are what makes this story at least not a complete letdown. Secondgeneration performer Jolie bears a striking resemblance towards her father Jon Voight in the classic film Midnight Cowboy. Knowing her dominance and charisma she really can outperform her cohorts whether she's playing leading or supporting roles. Washington lets his eyes metaphorically do the talking his intelligence is what carries the movie quite well. Next to Morgan Freeman Washington is able to embody an infallible detective none the better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ben Sherwood's Novel THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD pretty much describes this Hallmarky love and spiritualism showcase for teen idol Zac Efron. Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick adapted the book for the screen and director Burr Sherwood known for his other films that are of this genre stirs the whipped cream. It is a pretty story with pretty people filmed in a pretty location British Columbia and the results are pretty predictable yet when compared to the types of stories on film that flood the theaters at least this film has gentle heart and a lack of terror and horror and for that we should be pleased. Charlie St. Cloud Zac Efron who holds in own in this rather implausible role is a highly regarded young sailor who is wins a sailing scholarship to Stanford upon graduation from high school. He is devoted to his younger brother Sam Charlie Tahan and his single mother nurse Claire Kim Basinger  don't blink or you'll miss her very brief appearance in the film. One night while Claire is on extra shift at the hospital Charlie and Sam are in an auto accident Sam dies but Charlie is resuscitated by paramedic Florio Ferrente Ray Liotta in another very brief cameo. Charlie is devastated over Sam's death and gives up his chances for a life by taking a custodian job in the town cemetery so he can be near a certain spot where he 'sees' and communicates with Sam every sunset  a life long promise to never leave his little brother. Five years pass and Charlie's friend Alistair Augustus Prew  his only other friend Sully Dave Franco brother of actor James Franco has gone into the military  tries to encourage Charlie to date but Charlie's eyes fall on Tess Amanda Crew a fellow sailor from the past and love begins. Tess decides to take a long solo voyage in her boat and disappears. Charlie meets the now cancerridden and dying Florio who gives him his St Jude medal and encourages Charlie to embrace life. Charlie strikes out on a mission to find the missing Tess and the rest is pretty obvious. Though the story is heavy on the saccharine edge and strains credibility the team of actors is very fine  especially Zac Efron whose presence is on the screen in practically every frame  so the film ends up being endearing. The cinematography by Enrique Chediak is gorgeous and the musical score by Rolfe Kent leans heavily on sad love songs. It is not a profound film though it does dip gently into the ideas of 'the beyond' but there is something about the honesty of it all that makes it s a satisfying evening of entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "I was much moved by Charlie St. Cloud and by Zac Efron in the title role. It looks like the young man is going out way beyond being a Walt Disney bubblegum poster boy for pubescent young ladies. When we first meet Efron in the title role he looks to be a young man with a bright future. A scholarship to Stanford is his as he graduates high school from his New England coastal town where he enjoys sailing and the companionship of his younger brother Charles Tatan. The two are rabid Red Sox fans as all New England kids are brought up to be. Efron's boat is named the Splendid Splinter which everyone in New England knows is the nickname of Ted Williams. Being much older than Zac or his character I actually remember seeing Ted play.A cruel trick of fate puts the two of them in the path of an oncoming drunk driver. Both die but a determined paramedic played by Ray Liotta brings Efron back.As per an agreement they made minutes before the crash Efron and Tatan still meet in the woods every day to play catch and work on Tatan's baseball skills. It's all Efron lives for. By some trick of fate he can communicate and see Tatan in fact he sees all kinds of dead folks including a young man he graduated with from high school who was killed in Iraq. Efron's forgotten Stanford and he now works at the local graveyard the better to be near the ones he identifies with. I won't go into the rest except that Efron does learn to let the dead bury the dead. Meeting up with Amanda Crew another sailing enthusiast does help. And Liotta now dying of cancer tells Zac that he was saved for some special purpose.Two great lessons of life are to be learned in Charlie St. Cloud. First that we all have some kind of destiny the trick is to find it and recognize it. The second is that some people die young and maybe are meant to so that the rest of us recognize how precious life is and not to waste it. Having lost any number of people including a sister at a young age it's something that is always uppermost in my mind.Charlie St. Cloud is beautifully filmed with some breathtaking sailing sequences. The performers are flawless especially Zac Efron. One thing I will agree with other reviewers about is that I wish that the role of the mother of the St. Cloud brothers played by Kim Basinger was more fully developed. After the death of her younger son she moves out of town and you never really learn why.Despite that minor criticism Charlie St. Cloud is a moving film that should be seen by all generations for the life lessons imparted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie St Cloud is the type of movie many people will love to hate. The plot is simply contrived and the script is somewhat identical to Shyamalan's film The Sixth Sense yet I was very much moved by the story of Charlie St. Cloud and by Zac Efron in the title role. It looks like Zac is going out of his way to shred that teenage 'High School Musical' image that he is now known for.When we first meet Efron in the title role he looks to be a young man with a bright future. A scholarship to Stanford awaits as he graduates high school from his New England coastal town where he enjoys sailing with his younger brother Charlie Tahan. The two share some heart warming chemistry as brothers those who have younger siblings will understand the brotherly love between the two.However a cruel trick of fate puts the two of them in the path of an oncoming drunk driver. Both die but a determined spiritual paramedic played by Ray Liotta manages to bring Efron back.As per an agreement they made minutes before the crash Zac and Charlie still meet in the woods every day to play catch and work on Charlie's baseball skills. It's all Efron lives for. By some trick of fate he can communicate and see his deceased brother. Efron's forgotten Stanford and he now works at the local graveyard to be close Charlie so that He can fulfil the promise he made.I won't go into it too much except that the climax is something that we have seen before yet it is still touching and shows that we must learn that the true value of life is to live and let live. I came out of the cinema feeling good and that is what the film is all about loving life. My only criticism is that Liotta and Kim Basingeras the mother don't have enough screen time although i must say that Liotta still manages to impress even with this small supporting role. Zac Efron and Charlie Tahan deliver strong performances as the two brothers and Amanda Crew is pretty decent. The film is beautifully shot and the scenery is quite breathtaking at times.We've seen quite a few romantic dramas this yearDear John The Last Song but this has to be one of the most touchingnot the most original i must say but still it'll make you feel good inside. So my advice is go watch the movie or rent it when it comes out on DVD and don't believe those critics who's job it is to tell us how bad the movie must be just because it didn't earn 100 million at the box office.".

Efron's forgotten Stanford and he now works at the local graveyard to be close Charlie so that He can fulfil the promise he made.I won't go into it too much except that the climax is something that we have seen before yet it is still touching and shows that we must learn that the true value of life is to live and let live. I came out of the cinema feeling good and that is what the film is all about loving life. My only criticism is that Liotta and Kim Basingeras the mother don't have enough screen time although i must say that Liotta still manages to impress even with this small supporting role. Zac Efron and Charlie Tahan deliver strong performances as the two brothers and Amanda Crew is pretty decent. The film is beautifully shot and the scenery is quite breathtaking at times.We've seen quite a few romantic dramas this yearDear John The Last Song but this has to be one of the most touchingnot the most original i must say but still it'll make you feel good inside. So my advice is go watch the movie or rent it when it comes out on DVD and don't believe those critics who's job it is to tell us how bad the movie must be just because it didn't earn 100 million at the box office.";

He is trying to act. And I have to admit that I was surprised at how engaging and how truthful he seemed in this one. I do think he is better than the High School Musical tag he has stamped on him which would mean he is a bad actor which frankly I don't think could be said of him.His character does get a lot of attention from the female characters on display here which seems natural. On the other hand you do have the female lead in here that does not seem to get any attention whatsoever which makes you wonder if the male population in the movie is blind or into other things. Whatever it is this is one of the things that do not feel right. The other being the mixture between the elements on display here. Let me just tell you that this isn't neither your simple romantic movie nor just pure drama. There is other aspects to it. I can see though that this might ruin the movie for quite a few people.

	schema:reviewBody "After reading the book I could hardly wait for this film to open and believe me it doesn't disappoint.Zac Efron does a great acting job as Charlie St. Cloud a boy who has just received a sailing scholarship from Stamford. His future is all but sewn up until he and his brother Sam played wonderfully by Charlie Tahanget into a car accident. Sam and Charlie both die but a caring paramedic by the name of Florio Ferrente another great performance by Ray Liotta performs a miracle and is able to bring Charlie back. Before he returns to the land of the living Charlie promises Sam that he will always be there for him no matter what. And so every day Charlie comes back to play catch with Sam. Five years later he has chucked his scholarship and is now a caretaker at Waterside Cemetery so that he can be close to his brother. Everything is going along well until he spies a young woman by the name of Tess Carroll another great acting job by Amanda Crew who is getting ready to sail around the world. He meets her at the cemetery while she is cleaning out her father's grave and the two form a strong bond although neither of them knows it yet.One day Florio spots Charlie in the street and tells him that he was saved for a reason and was given a second chance at life and that Charlie is just throwing his life away.After a few days he spots Tess again at her father's grave and their bond becomes deeper until the two fall passionately in love. Now Charlie must choose between the living and the dead and find his second chance at life.By the way Charlie can see the dead because of the promise he made to his brother before he was brought back to life by Florio. When he breaks the bond with Sam he loses the ability to see the dead.The movie did follow the book closely with slight differences but all in all it is a film worth checking out just to marvel at the great acting job by all. And I am going to recommend reading the beautiful book The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud by Ben Sherwood. You will need a hankie for both.for geniuskentyk...my advice is to read the book..it will explain away a lot of the things that are missing for you...".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie St. Cloud is a remarkable story about life and love death and loss letting go and moving on. But above all it's about the bond between two brothers that not even death can break. Charlie St. Cloud the movie was not exactly like the book but it did not disappoint me as a wholebecause while it is based on the book you also have to appeal to the movie goers and I think they did that well.For me having read the book there were a couple things scenes and script that I missed. Iwill point out what I missed but I feel I first have to comment on the beautiful portrayal of the main character Charlie St. Cloud by ZacEfron. Even if I had not known who was going to be playing Charlie in the movie Zac Efron would have been my choice he just fits the part.He brought everything that was needed in that character to the big screen. You really felt the bond between him and his younger brother Sam who was portrayed by Charlie Tahan wonderful performance. AfterSam dies but is caught in the in between he and Charlie are still connected and you need that bond to be strong but also believable throughout and they did just that. Zac Efron is one of the best actors out there today in my opinion. Yes he is incredibly handsome but he is also incredibly talented and in my opinion as the years go on I think he is just going to become more of a talented actor and may be even become one of the best actors of all time if he continues on. I think people should not type cast him in the musical roles because while he is great in all of those he is also amazing in more serious roles that don't involve singing and dancing like Me and Orson Welles and 17 Again... he may do a tiny bit of both in each of those but you get what I mean I'm talking the full on musicals and I hope he continues to do more of the seriousmature roles like this one was. I've heard that some critics out there don't feel that Zac got the emotions across that Charlie goes through I feel that all those critics are wrong I think he got all the emotions across the way that the book intended them to be and the way that in real life sometimes you feel in those kind of situations. Zac to me always gets his emotions across through his beautiful blue eyes and too me that's important because you can tell a lot of what someone is feeling from their eyes at least in my opinion. I felt every emotion that he felt and to be honest I think every time he cried I cried because it was a moment when you would and the same goes for his happy moments and so on so don't tell me that he didn't get his emotions across because I felt them all through his acting. All of the actors and actress's portrayed their characters well however there were a few characters from the book that were missing in the movie and in some ways I felt they were needed but what can you do. This movie had some incredible scenery and the way it was captured on film was beautiful. The soundtrack which is always important to me was amazing. I especially loved the song While We Were Dreaming by Pink Mountaintops. The things I missed from the book in this film well there's a scene where Tess meets and can see Sam and I think it is a pivotal moment in the book and would have brought more sense to those who watched the movie and had not read the book. I think they should have taken us on Tess's journey in her boat when things go wrong I guess for the movie goers they thought maybe it would give away too much I suppose in some ways it might have. Ray Liotta's character Florio Ferrente to me did not get enough of a part he is a key character in the book and I think it would have given the movie just that much more if he had narrated a bit at the beginning and end like he seems to do in the book. Some of the most beautiful words come from his character and I don't think they did him justice in the movie and that's too bad I really admired his character in the book. All in all I think both the book and the movie are a must read and watch. Until next time! Qualcuno ti ama.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this movie. It didn't disappoint me at all because I didn't expect much more than a beautiful love story pretty scenery very good acting and thoughtprovoking ideas. I got exactly what I came for and maybe even a little more. The script is pretty dull but the way the movie was filmed and acted made it absolutely amazing the way I saw it. Absolutely gorgeous scenery and cinematography original ideas and scenes I loved the graveyard scene when Tess and Charlie are chasing each other around with candle lights and pretty music there was nothing at all about it that I'd seen before very good acting and a very beautiful story is what made this movie so great in my eyes. Despite how gorgeous Zac Efron is it is clear he is capable of abovemediocre acting. He had nearly nothing to work with but made this movie captivating because of how carefully he played his words and showed his emotion. Nothing felt forced. The script is so dull but because of his ability to portray what was meant to be said it made the movie ten times better. He is much more than good looks even though and I know his blue eyes are distracting but he has a lot of talent. I think some people don't want to believe that someone can have both great looks and great talent because they get envious. He has made astounding career choices and has worked his way to the top unlike Miley Cyrus he has pure talent and heart at what he does and hasn't gone all bareskinned and photo scandalish to draw attention away from his lack of talent. He is grateful for his career and his talent is shining through. I believe he has a very promising career ahead of him despite all this silly hatred he is getting. He is a precious gem in my eyes both gorgeous and very talented and able to show emotion in such a real way. The lead actress Amanda Crew did an okay job she wasn't terrible wasn't great. His graveyard friend provided comic relief and I thought he was funny. All in all I give this movie 1010 because I went in theaters to see it twice I am thoroughly impressed with Zac and the career choices he has made I loved how uniquely it was filmed and how original the story was and I'm just a sappy hopeless romantic so I love films like this.".

He is grateful for his career and his talent is shining through. I believe he has a very promising career ahead of him despite all this silly hatred he is getting. He is a precious gem in my eyes both gorgeous and very talented and able to show emotion in such a real way. The lead actress Amanda Crew did an okay job she wasn't terrible wasn't great. His graveyard friend provided comic relief and I thought he was funny. All in all I give this movie 1010 because I went in theaters to see it twice I am thoroughly impressed with Zac and the career choices he has made I loved how uniquely it was filmed and how original the story was and I'm just a sappy hopeless romantic so I love films like this.";

I thought Zac handled it well. Sam was adorable which makes Charlie putting his life on hold for five years a bit more believable. The one thing about which I am confused is location. They call the town Quincy so I think Quincy Mass. until Tess is sailing and she tells Tink she just passed Whidbey Island on Puget sound and when they go to rescue her they head for Cape Flattery which is on the western tip of WA near the Olympic National Park. I loved how Charlie interacted with spirits and we were kept in the dark such a captivating idea I like to think it is possible for any one of us though it has never happened to me. As no one gets out of this alive we must say goodbye to those we love some too soon and go on living just as Charlie finally does. I recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A suggestion on understanding the movie or possibly allowing a brief introduction to it would be to read the book prior to watching the film. The first two chapters should suffice. My 'feel' upon entering the movie with the brief knowledge of the brothers and their relationship upon start of novel allowed me to get into Charlie's head and the movie adaptation. A very well selected cast in my opinion for all 3 very intricate characters IE. Zac Amanda and Charlie Tahan. The 2 brothers played the roles brilliantly and with great emotion even if only with a facial expression. Amanda Crew played Tess with equal  great style. She only had to watch Charlie St Cloud from a distance for us to understand why her interest in him. The movie plays off of emotion alone thus the facial expressions in this movie are not something to ignore. They are the 'script' of the film. Naturally the movie timing does not allow the entire details of the book to be entailed which is why the Book and Movie must be read and watched as suggested. A great feat for Zac his acting skills are bettering by each choice of project. When watching him at his skill I myself see a familiar style such as in his peers DiCaprio LeBouf and an undiscovered River Phoenix. Not many actors can do  allowfor too much emotional depth in their projects. They are few and far between. Overall a Beautiful story of choosing to hold on and being forced to let go. One cannot put these emotions into a spoken script but rather in an actor who can express it as we need to see it.".

He has some great acting from Charlie Tahan in particular to raise the rating a notch or two too.The opening is neatly crafted as back story explaining how brothers Charlie Efron and Sam Tahan are as inseparable in death as in life. Fast forward five years and we have the revelation of a gift Charlie may or may not have. The story takes over from there as a charmingly meandering exploration of promises principles reasons and deeply held beliefs. Zac Efron gives a goodish but slightly uneven presentation of the man with a mission his own worse enemy but also one of his word. There are moments when Efron is very convincing but there are others when he seems to be going through the motions. What Charlie Tahan succeeds in doing is taking the simple and raw and keeping it simple and raw something Efron needs to work on.Amanda Crew is good as the romantic interest and there are a couple of cameos from Kim Basinger and Ray Liotta.Now I will not plot spoil to reveal the bigger flaws in the script but I was not expecting a revelation to be made in quite the way it was and at the time was left thinking  that's stupid it should have been done differently without spoiling the story  but that is show business for you!

	schema:headline " Engaging and heartfelt if a bit pretty at times";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie for what it tries to do. It's not trying to be an arthouse Oscarbait film. It's basically a story about a good man who loses himself to grief and how he recovers. The core message of letting go and moving on is a good one.It's not a dumb rollyoureyes movie and it's not too clever. It sails the line between those two extremes but manages to do so without being bland. There's a lot to enjoy here Efron's excellent performance Tahan's charm and chemistry with Efron and Crew's solidity. Prew also has his moments and although nobody manages to steal any scenes from Efron they were all believable. I wish we could have seen a lot more of Basinger and Liotta though and Logue's relative lack of prettiness was actually a kind of relief.Although the characters are clean they still do foolish things loose their tempers and make poor choices about how to spend their lives. Personally I'm not as moved by stories where the main character is a selfabsorbed selfdestructive jerk whono surprisebrings pain on himherself and others and succumbs to the usual pitfalls alcoholdrugs meaningless sex or general idiotic acting out. That might have made the movie cooler or made Efron seem edgier but the story and character wouldn't have been as resonant for me. I can root for and identify with characters who are trying to do their best to do the right thing but it still leads them quite naturally into struggling with personal demons.There's not much logic or explanation for Charlie's ability to interact with the dead physically. It's the conceit of the film and the whole plot falls apart without it so if you're going to enjoy the story at all you have to suspend that bit of disbelief. On the level of pushing emotional buttons this film hits them pretty hard everything from raw attraction a nearly constant undertone to outright laughing I loved the running gag with the geese to embarrassment one scene shows how even someone as goodlooking as Efron can fall completely flat on his face in an awkward blinddate situation to aching from a sense of loss and separation and loneliness. I never actually got close to crying but I certainly felt tugged although more so with the CharlieSam relationship than with the CharlieTess relationship more than once.Clearly the main draw of this film is Efron. If you're going for Efron eye candy you'll get it in spades but happily despite the many reviews that sneer to the contrary he actually spends most of the movie with his shirt on so you have some hope of focusing on his face. Of course easily a quarter of the scenes where he's got his shirt on he's wet for one reason or another so it doesn't actually help much. And even if you do manage to focus on his face you again have to get past the Damn he's pretty! reaction and focus on whatever emotions the character has. Happily once you've invested that much effort you find yourself caring about Charlie and responding to those emotions. The story is compelling because of Efron's acting precisely because once you get past the pretty there really is something there. When he finally does get around to taking off his shirt it's not without reason so at least you're not left laughing like you are with most of the embarrassing shirtless moments in the Twilight series.Let me reiterate the part about the eye candy. There's lots of it. And not just the actors but the indoor locations the lighting the framing the ocean the sailboats the shoreline even the sculptures in the graveyard. There's a gorgeous sculpture of a desolate angel crying on a gravestone near the end of the film. Although there's a strange moment in the middle of the movie when the camera focuses on a childangel gravestone for a little too long and you suddenly wonder if the movie is going to turn into a horror flick with the childangel coming to life and terrorizing the townspeople. But the sensation passes and you realize how clean the story is. Despite the fact that the main character talks to dead people there's never a creepy sense of foreboding. It might have been more interesting if they'd taken it in that direction. Perhaps the plot is a little bit predictable and the surprise twist isn't a huge surprise but it does hit Charlie's character hard and Efron and Crew make it work.I gave it an 8 out of 10 because it mostly succeeds at what it tries to do. One interesting thing about it is that it tends to defy easy categorization. Is it a romance? A comedy? A tragedy? A star vehicle? A story about depression? A fable? A story about mental illness? A story about loss? A fantasy? A story about grieving? Predictable? Engaging? A thin excuse to watch pretty people standing in front of pretty things? Something with emotional resonance? The answer is yes. One thing I liked about it was the sheer variety of emotions that I experienced while I watched it. Small funny things happen alongside small moments of sadness and vice versa. In that sense it has resonance that dips below the pretty surface.".

One is that this game of catch has been going on for an hour a day for over 1800 days now and even after all that time neither kid can throw a baseball worth a damn. Another tidbit is that Charlie is able to talk to other dead people besides Sam. Also he's artistic. And really really sensitive. Did I mention that already?So that leaves us with the only real dilemma posed by this lowwattage wouldbe tear jerker mawkish or maudlin mawkish or maudlin?Sam is played by the young actor Charlie Tahan and even while watching the movie my mind kept drifting off to thots of what the onset reaction would be when Director Burr Steers said something like Charlie you stand over here. who really did he mean the actor or the character? If the movie doesn't engage you enuf in the plot to keep these kinds of distractions from creeping in it's not a good sign.Kim Basinger and Ray Liotta are also in the pic in separate scenes for just a tad longer than it took you to read their names off the poster.There's nothing egregiously offensive about this movie it's just not worth seeing.".

Did I mention that already?So that leaves us with the only real dilemma posed by this lowwattage wouldbe tear jerker mawkish or maudlin mawkish or maudlin?Sam is played by the young actor Charlie Tahan and even while watching the movie my mind kept drifting off to thots of what the onset reaction would be when Director Burr Steers said something like Charlie you stand over here. who really did he mean the actor or the character? If the movie doesn't engage you enuf in the plot to keep these kinds of distractions from creeping in it's not a good sign.Kim Basinger and Ray Liotta are also in the pic in separate scenes for just a tad longer than it took you to read their names off the poster.There's nothing egregiously offensive about this movie it's just not worth seeing.";

	schema:reviewBody "12 out of Charlie St. Cloud the film that bombed critically and financially had to at least target a specific demographic which typically consists of teeny boppers. Unfortunately one of my guy friends had highly anticipated the film so since nothing else that peeked my interest was playing I decided to give the film a try. I literally had zero expectations. I didn't know whether to expect this great cinematic extravaganza or one of the most filthy syrupy romances in cinematic history. Fortunately Charlie St. Cloud isn't the latter but alas it's neither the former. My review is simply nonbias because I am not a Zac Efron hardcore worshiper yet I don't loathe the guy either. Basically Charlie St. Cloud is a syrupy melodramatic piece of filmmaking. The plot is rather bitter and clich the performances are pretty much standard and the picture offers nothing new in terms of originality or entertainment. I'd go as far as saying that this was a pretty terrible film. If one must have their thirst quenched a rental is the most sufficient. Charlie St. Cloud revolves around the namesake character who shares a strong bond with his brother Sam Cloud. Unfortunately Charlie and his brother get into a severe car accident. Alas Charlie's brother passes away in the unusual car incident and now Charlie has to cope with the death of a brother. Strangely Charlie starts hallucinating his brother after the tragic situation. Albeit is Sam really alive or just an image in Charlie's mind? Meanwhile Charlie starts to go head over heals with this woman sailor. However will Charlie's relationship deteriorate the wall Charlie built for his bondage with his brother?First off the plot is simply contrived and paintbynumbers. The script is somewhat identical to Shyamalan's film The Sixth Sense because of the picture's last thirty minutes. Moreover the whole girlfriendinterferingwithfriendship situation has been done to death. Furthermore the relationship portrayed in the film is as formulaic and disposable as the viewer has been witnessed to countless times before. Additionally the acting is nothing to write home about. Zac Efron gives a decent performance and Amanda Crew gives a passable performance as well. To top it off the pacing of this film is uninteresting. There were moments that seemed so tedious that switching theater chairs would have been a more preferable choice instead. Also the film is painfully anticlimactic and melodramatic. I get that this film is suppose to be depressing but the film milked its tearjerking moments and even those felt so predictable and dry that it comes off as a gimmick rather than tragic. While the cons outweigh the pros there are still some nifty things about the film. For starters the cinematography is just eyepopping and simply gorgeous. Furthermore the bondage between the two brothers is the only thing that caught my attention. To add to that the film's opening twenty minutes or so were actually pretty intriguing and not too bad. Overall it's highly improbable that Charlie St. Cloud will walk home with a Razzie although it certainly won't walk home with my money again. The film could have been passable entertainment but it's another paintbynumbers flick that rather than coming off sincere and touching it sadly comes off as gimmicky and a quick buck. I'm surprised this film was on the radar for green lighting. This type of film has Lifetime written all over it. Let me put it to you this way Charlie St. Cloud is like that dopey Hallmark get well card which contents are so dry delivering that it's like beating a dead horse. Okay maybe my criticism is a tad preposterous but I just want to get the message across that this is another clich Hollywood film. Here's a little game for all my fellow readers. If you had a nickel for every time I made my 3rd last sentence of the review could you make your own movie?".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most Americans I have found myself bewitched by Zac Efron his stunningly blue eyes his sullen good looks and his perfectly tousled hair make him a great leading man. But alas not even his good looks could save this film.The premise is interesting enough a senior in high school who has the world on a string suddenly finds himself plunging down a path of apathy and regret after the death of his 12 year old brother. This is quite hard to believe however due to the poor relationship Charlie Efron has with his little brother. In the scenes before young Sam dies the two don't seem to share any fraternal bond. So when we find out that 5 years after Sam's death Charlie is grounds keeper at the cemetery and plays catch with his dead brother every night I thought it ridiculous. Efron plays Charlie the same way both before and after Sam dies completely apathetic and nearly removed from the screen. There is a twist towards the end of the film that makes the plot even more difficult to grasp. It is very difficult to empathize with Charlie at this point. Ray Liotta has a tiny tiny part which should have been developed much more fully. Kim Basinger is totally forgettable. Efron's love interest Amanda Crew is very hard to like. The film hardly explores her character and I found myself responding to her supposedly dramatic scenes very negatively. The young actor who plays Sam does an okay job. He tries to be the awestruck younger brother but Efron doesn't give him enough to work with. Overall I feel as though this movie was mishandled. In the hands of either a more sensitive director andor cast this could have been very touching coming of age film. Sadly it's far from it.One redeeming quality is that the scenery is beautiful. The lush forest and ocean water surrounding the cemetery and town are magnificent. If you really want to see this movie I'd say wait. Wait to rent or see it at the dollar theater or until you just totally forget about it.".

He has the ability to make the audience feel the pain and hardships he is going through in his own life and he is very good at toning down some of the cheesy screenplay with his own experience as a wellachieved and believable actor. The kid who played his brother Sam was also GREAT for being cast at such a young age. They had a realistic bond and it perfectly personified the true relationship of any brotherly comradeship.

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie St. Cloud starring Zac Efron is the story of the title character and how he deals with the loss of his younger brother Sam Charlie Tahan in a car accident made even worse by the fact that Charlie is driving. Seemingly from beyond the grave or only in Charlie's mind Sam shows up every day for a promised baseball lesson. We flash forward five years and Charlie has given up on college his love of sailing and become the town recluse all to make his daily appointment with Sam. From my title of my post you may have picked up on the fact that I think Charlie St. Cloud is a awkward mismatch of ideas that don't necessarily fare well in the same movie. Selfediting is a valuable skill that would serve the creative forces behind this movie very well. There are three possibly four distinct story lines going here including a missed opportunity at a supernatural drama. I don't think any of them succeed because it doesn't appear this movie knows what it wants to be.As far as acting Efron has a charming face and disposition that lends well to the humor but not so much the drama. You can practically see him straining in the first part of the movie to keep up with the movie's over the top dramatics. It's further proof to me that Hollywood finds us a bit dense and believes we need a trail of bread crumbs leading to the obvious. In this case the obvious is that the sudden loss of a young family member is tragic. Of course you cannot have Zac Efron as your lead without some romance. Charlie attracts the interest of Tess Amanda Crew a young woman training for a round the globe sailing trip. I hate to be harsh but my biggest criticism is for Amanda Crew. She has a delivery so flat as to suck any spark or chemistry out of the scenes between Charlie and Tess. Since I'm really trashing this movie I will give some props to Charlie Tahan who plays Sam. He is genuinely funny and at times conveys the sadness embodied by his character. Have I made this sound so terrible? There is an audience for this movie but I don't think that includes people like me who take a cynical view about the state of creativity in film.".

	schema:headline " A Marion Davies MegaHit";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1922 production now restored was at the time the most expensive picture ever made. It was also a major boxoffice hit. Marion Davies plays Mary Tudor sister of Henry VIII and intended bride of old Louis of France. But she's in love with the dashing Charles Brandon Forrest Stanley. After Brandon is framed for murder Mary agrees to bargain with Henry he'll spare Brandon's life if she willingly marries old Louis. She counters that she will agree if she can choose her second husband. Henry agrees.Mary goes off to France to marry old Louis William Norris but his nephew and heir William Powell has designs on beautiful Mary. After old Louis dies the nephew pounces on Mary but she escapes with Brandon's help in a race across France with an army in pursuit.The breathtaking restoration on this film with the original tinting scheme and digital handcoloring restored is a great achievement one that lets us view this film as it was seen in 1922. The fabulous sets by Joseph Urban and costumes by Gretl Urban Thurlow make for a sumptuous film experience that enhances the exciting story of medieval court intrigue.Marion Davies is nothing short of superb as Mary Tudor. She is willful impetuous determined and throws herself into the role of the princess who at one point masquerades as a boy in an attempt to escape the English court of Henry. Forrest Stanley is a suitable Brandon Lyn Harding is impressive as Henry. William Norris is terrific as old Louis. William Powell is appropriately oily as the king's nephew. Johnny Dooley plays the court jester who has an important scene.Others include Ruth Shepley as Jane Theresa Maxwell Conover as Queen Catherine Flora Finch as a lady of the French court Ernest Glendinning as Caskoden Pedro de Cordoba as Buckingham Arthur Forrest as Wolsey Gustv von Seyffertitz as the soothsayer Paul Panzer as captain of the guards and William Kent as the court tailor. Nicely directed by Robert Vignola.This is first and foremost a Marion Davies film and she is spectacular. This new restoration July 2107 is a mustsee film for all fans of Davies in particular and silent films in general.".

Vignola directed no less than 99 movies starting way back in 1911 and continuing through to 1937. A look at The Scarlet Letter 1934 confirms the impression that he learnt his craft back in 1911 and stuck with it. Throughout the entire length of When Knighthood Mr Vignola does not move his camera so much as a single halfinch. Were it not for his fondness of editing constantly from a group shot to a tight twoshot the whole movie is otherwise presented as if it were a stage play. Nonetheless he does maintain the pace of his tale with admirable dexterity. I was amazed to find that I'd been glued to the screen for well over two and half hours. I thought I'd been watching the action for no more than 90 minutes.Of course the overwhelming richness of the production tight plotting that most effectively builds up to two separate climaxes plus spellbinding acting particularly from Miss Davies herself Lyn Harding William Norris and William Powell all contributed to the movie's appeal. On the other hand I thought Forrest Stanley made a rather dull hero and the fact that he and Ernest Glendinning who played his friend Caskoden were virtually interchangeable lookalikes did not help.All told however this is a thrilling engrossing and visually appealing production and I can't wait until it's released on DVD with an appropriate music score.".

The pet project of the famous media magnate William Hearst it is the tale of a woman sister who defies all royal conventions especially one she falls in love with a commoner  Knight Charles Brandon  while bethrothed not of her choice of course to King louis XII of France. Action ensues as the forces of tradition conspire to keep them apart. The sets are very good and Marion davies is extremely good. When I watch a silent movie and I wish to hear what the actor is saying then the performance is classic. Everyone else is adequate and passable. The director who isn't very good throws in a lot of gothic subtext and an unusual editing style of what I'll term flash cutting is used. Cinematography is especially wonderful. Deeper meanings or detailing beyond the obvious social strata innuities and foresight castigations of a bygone era is pitifully missing. Entertaining yes actionpacked  agreed but a bit quaint unlike Robin Hood released around the same time but which holds up much better. It alsao looks as if it cost more it did not. But Garbo Shearer and Dietrich did this too and theirs are better. Worth watching but watch out for sappiness in many moments. Just as a note this movie was the biggest hit of the 192223 movie season ahead of Robin Hood and Safety last.".

The script by the director best known for Truth or Dare is funny and charming. This is definitely the best movie I've seen so far at Outfest this year. It may even be the best movie I've ever seen at Outfest ever!If you like Notting Hill Four Weddings  A Funeral or any other romantic comedy of that style you'll definitely enjoy this little gem as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love and Other Disasters is just as the title says. It's about love and lovelike disasters mistaken as love. It's not your typical romantic comedy because it's better than that. There's quite a few lines that are making fun of the genre but paying a sort of homage to it as well.The late Brittany Murphy stars as Emily Jackson 'Jacks' who takes her cues in life and style from Holly Golightly. The filmmakers as well have taken their inspiration for the look feel and tone from Breakfast at Tiffany's.The best character in the film is Peter played by Matthew Rhys. In romanticcomedyspeak he's the gay best friend but again he's better than that. He's very funny and in a much more realistic way than the other characters are and his musings on love probably mirror those of the audience more than the other characters.The film is very fastpaced with witty dialogue and a lighthearted manner. I recommend Love and Other Disasters for fans of Breakfast at Tiffany's fans of the dialogue of Gilmore Girls fans of Matthew Rhys and definitely aspiringscreenwriters  the filmmakers have made a number of inferences to the craft of screen writing that I think it becomes a must see.".

That however is explained half way into the movie when she reveals she was born in England her parents died she was shipped off to family that lived in the US then returned to England. So she really doesn't have an English accent more of just a formal way of speaking. Yes the accents were horrible but I love this movie though. Funny though that Matthew Rhys who was born in Wales and spoke Welsh for a good part of his life does an American accent better than a London accent but just saying London accent is like saying an apple. If you've met 2 people from London you know none of them talk exactly alike.Poking fun at the romantic comedy genre every character in this movie is an emotional mess. Brittany's character breaks up with her boyfriend only to continue dating him and having sex with him but insisting they've broken up. The one guy she has a true emotional connection with in the movie besides Matthew Rhys' character Paulo is because she thinks he's gay and she doesn't stand a chance. Matthew Rhys character is gay and falls in love with men until he actually gets to know them then finds some flaw in them and sneaks out the back door. He spends most of the movie trying not to be set up with the man of his dreams only to find out he got the guys name wrong actually goes out with the man of his dreams only to find himself bored to tears. Catherine Tate's character is an emotional train wreck with Sybil at the switch and I absolutely love Stephanie Beacham as her mother.This movie might not win any awards but it got some good laughs from me kept my interest and I wasn't bored.".

Also as was pointed out in the introduction on the night this is a movie that shows a London closer to the one I actually live in though the director Alek Keshishian did point out he himself had lived in London for ten years!.

It has some clever twists great dialog silly moments and is generally a great time. I would put in the same genre as Four Weddings and a Funeral and as silly and absurd as Notting Hill.

I couldn't help but be wary and with good reason her hybrid accent sucked anyway. Anyway like I saidI couldn't even get through the first 20 minutes. It was absolutely excruciating to watch Ms. Murphy's blatant ripoff of Audrey HepburnasHolly Golightly in the modern world. It's been sooooo DONE before Sweetie. And done way better for that matter see Parker Posey in 1995's 'Party Girl' for a way superior and much more likable performance. And the plot? Merely seeming like just another version of Jane Austen's 'Emma.' Done done done. Tired tired tired. Plus she is just trying waaaaaay too hard. Already the dialogue lacked any true wit or originality and I didn't care one bit about the onedimensional and dull characters. Plus if I had to watch Brittany screw up her dumblooking face into one more unattractive facial expression in her pathetic attempt to adorably?!?!

I can't imagine what she was thinking after reading the script and signing on for this unapologetically indulgent exercise in the mass employment of gay actors. We've seen sicko Hollywood's regular inclusion of at least one gay man in almost every one of their insipid offerings in recent years and now there are gay couples slobbering all over one another not to mention the fact that they almost never show a naked woman anymore because the gays think that would be immoral they are really screwed up that way and the feminists think her modesty ought to be preserved at all costs just to show proper respect for her womanhood. These people far prefer and expect to see some man's stinkin' hairy ass instead which you may have noticed is a regular offering in almost every Hollywood production these days. What the rest of the audience thinks about it isn't even a consideration. This movie takes that situation to a real extreme. There are several gay couples in it and they get all kinds of air time. You're gonna need that fast forward button and will be using it liberally. We occasionally get to see Brittany Murphy hopping around in her skivvies even naked hiding behind a newspaper but this little cutie is completely ignored by the men in her life who are only interested in each other and walk right by her as if she doesn't even exist. Can't wait for all the homosexuals to clear out of Hollywood or at least to have control of movie making wrenched from their sickening grasp. Better yet for Hollywood to go under and leave movie making to the foreigners. You can thank that Mama's Boy Steven Spielberg for starting Hollywood's precipitous decline following the American film renaissance of the 1960s when the American movie industry was collectively engaged in serious work. Those days were over long ago.".

I enjoyed the realistic elements of the lives of the characters of the first one expecting the second film to be the same. It's obvious it has been modernized and made significantly more urban than the first one but I assumed there would be some similarities wrong!This film tells the story of a young self taught dancer who fails to get into the academy but falls for the new rising star. She finds herself working as a waitress come dancer at a club but eventually manages to overcome all the odds to gain the leading role in a new ballet Just to show her sister you can make all your dreams come trueAnother reviewer claimed these characters had great chemistry. They may have had great chemistry but they certainly lacked acting ability. I can't say whether it was the clich script or the poor acting but this movie became somewhat painful to watch. There were several moments of very typical flirtatious close ups and over the top crying. It was ultimately cheese in a TV screen.Being an experienced dancer myself I was particularly infuriated with the ending of this film in which Kate A self taught Ballerina triumphs over all other dancers to gain the lead in this new Ballet with her boyfriend. Not only is it extremely far fetched to say that she would receive this role but it is simply impossible for someone to as she says Just watch ballet videos and mimic what I saw IT JUST Doesn't HAPPEN! The mere fact she received the role over the more technical dancers is simply ludicrous namely because they are significantly better Which is emphasized in several shots Essentially this movie was more Step Up rather than Center Stage. It lacked the discipline that was evident in the first one that so many dancers could relate to. If you enjoyed Step Up and can stand to watch poor acting in replacement of attractive people then you may enjoy this movie. For everyone else Ignore the Center Stage part and focus on the Turn it up because this film has no resemblance to the first one.".

The first Center Stage was very cheesy while this one is much lower on the cheese scale.There's a great sweetness to the lead couple's relationship and while they are clearly great dancers rather than experienced actors they're very natural with each other.Highly recommended and very satisfying and the music is GREATI thought it was even better than the first Center Stage's soundtrack which was also very good.".

I however have to agree that the makeup used on the lead actress was a little bit too much but other than that she was fine in the role she was playing. Two things stood out to me as odd in the film 1 was that the main actress could find parking on a New York City street 9a.m. on the morning of her audition and the second thing was the fact that she was working 3 jobs yet still couldn't afford to get her car out of impound? That was just odd. Nevertheless the dancing was on point. It a film about dancing so the less said about the acting and certain other flaws in the film the better.".

I loved the film. About Kate Rachele Brooke Smith I very much enjoyed watching her in this film. I've never heard of her before but now I know who she is. Aside overall pretty adorable smile and cool dancer personally I think she did very good in her role as Kate. Somebody commented that she looks like Ashley Simpson dark hair preop Ashley. I agree in quite a few scenes I thought so too and I couldn't help for a moment to wonder if Ashley Simpson might've been a good Kate too. Well actually probably she would've done okay with the ballet dancing scenes since I hear that Ashley Simpson used to dance ballet when she was younger. But as for the other dancing styles performed in this movie the only other kind of Ashley dancing I'm familiar with aside her ballet is the Ashley Hodown thing. So on second thought nope. I don't think it would've been appropriate for this film. Picturing her as Kate no. I think they definitely chose the appropriate actress for this film. I'm glad they went with Rachele Brooke Smith. She owned the part. She owned the dance floor. I look forward to seeing her in other cool films such as this. I give her and the overall movie a 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "So I watched the first part and though the dancing was good it was still not the greatest dance movies I watched . Then this one came out and I was like if they made a part 2 then they definitely improved it  if producers actually considered to pay money AGAIN... Not to my greatest disappointment the actors need acting classes either they are completely talentless or they didn't have time to go to acting class with all the dancing.

Not only that it has the exact same story of another dance movie which just came out  frankly I don't know which one copied which but this was actually much worse than the first part.However  if you watched the 1st part watch this one just out of curiosity.Rachel Brooke Smith  Kenny Wormland make a good dancing couple. Howver lil advice folks  let's keep it to the dance floor and away  far far away from the screen.".

Then this one came out and I was like if they made a part 2 then they definitely improved it  if producers actually considered to pay money AGAIN... Not to my greatest disappointment the actors need acting classes either they are completely talentless or they didn't have time to go to acting class with all the dancing.

Yep that's some hardcore passion right there.The acting or whatever the hell it was those people were doing was absolutely atrocious. Probably some of the worst acting I've seen in awhile and I watch porn.

What kind of club owner hires a girl as a waitress because she moves her ass in time with the music? How is it OK for her 10 year old sister to just get on a bus and travel to New York? It's all very stupid.But not as stupid as the cringeworthy 'dance' by the water fountain. It was the most horrible horrible thing I had ever seen I prayed to the gods to strike me blind so as to never see that terrible thing again.It's best altogether to stay as far away from this crap as possible.".

It has an edgier feel than Center Stage 1 but fans of that movie should see this as Cooper returns and his dancing is AMAZING.Yes it has hip hop but it's not the same old hip hop v. ballet movie. There's no battle between the hip hop and ballet dance styles lol. It's more subtle the way the different dance scenes are included and almost like a documentary in the way it's filmed.But that doesn't really sum it up. You just have to watch the whole movieit all ties up so well and brings a tear to the eye.  See it!".

Even though I would fit the 'target market' for this film teenage dance student I found it totally contrived and unrealistic.Part of the reason why I loved the first one so much was that it showed all the hard work and dedication required for ballet but also had some beautiful dance sequences especially Ethan Stiefel and Julie Kent in Romeo and Juliet!! but this one had none of that.The other thing that annoyed me was that the Kate character was supposed to be a selftaught dancer which I think is just irresponsible filmmaking! Sure it may be possible to learn some things on your own but ballet is not one of them. It's just asking for a broken ankle or worse. Furthermore when it's just ridiculous that she would get the lead role in the new ballet when clearly all the other dancers were BETTER than she was. Particularly her turnout and her pointe work were weak. The only ballet scene that really grabbed me was Cooper demonstrating the solo to Tommy but even that felt as though it was only there to give Ethan Stiefel and dance scene.However I did enjoy the club sequences somewhat but as this is a sequel to Centre Stage I felt they were unnecessary and I would have much preferred a focus on ballet. And overall I just didn't care about the characters.Overall even though the original movie wasn't great it was way better than this. The original totally outdanced outscripted and outdirected the sequel. But mostly outdanced.".

I love watching teen romance films with a lot of dancing. When I saw a preview of the movie I knew I had to see it. It's a sequel on the movie Center Stage. The movie is set in New York City. Kate Parker is a girl who had a dream to perform at the American Academy of Ballet. So she applied for an audition. But when she doesn't make it after the audition she realizes that it takes more than perfection to succeed in the dance world. At the audition she meets a boy Tommy Anderson. They become quite good friends. With his help and with the help of her job at a hiphop club she finds the passion the fire and the strength again she needs to make her dreams come true.In general I really liked the movie. But it was a little bit disappointing because I thought that it was a hiphop dancing movie and not a ballet show. There were a lot of ballet scenes in it and that was just too much for me. Some of the other dance scenes were spectacular and very stylish because they are the kind of dance scenes I really like to watch. The music fitted into the movie along with the dance scenes.I definitely would recommend this film because it's worth to see it. You can see how a girl gives up her dream but then when she met that boy she got the passion back to chase her dream again. I would this movie a 8 out of 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I want to start off saying that I loved the first movie and I own it on DVD I have been a big fan of Peter Gallagher since The OC and now I'm a fan of Amanda Schull and Ethan Stiefel! I originally gave the first installment a low ranking 2 12 or 3 but it now deserves a higher ranking especially as I've watched it about 10 times! This movie however... I am giving it a two but that's the movie itself there are actors in this movie who do deserve a higher ranking but that's only a select few!I have mixed emotions about the title of this film as part of me says that the title's not appropriate for the movie especially how it's not very properly made and the script doesn't have much in it on the other hand it's appropriate because this movie needs to turn up the script at the most. The story lacks oomph also the chemistry with the characters the speed and... the sex appeal. Centre Stage Turn It Up is supposed to be the second installment of the original and it's supposed to play of the original and even though it mentions what's happened to Cooper's dance company it still doesn't explain what happened to the rest of the original movies characters like Jody Eva Maureen Sergei Charlie or Erik nor does it mention whatever happened to Kathleen or Juliette... It'd be a much better movie if it did the forementioned.The dance sequences were great I must say but again it lacked the forementioned especially as I also mentioned before oomph not the oomph the first one did. It was great that the director respected Cooper and Jody's relationship even though she'd turned him down at the end of the first movie. Don't get the wrong impression here Amanda Schull who played Jody Sawyer in the first installment is not in the second movie nor is she mentioned.The cast also lacks that certain quality... mainly it's called experience or capability to act. Of course that doesn't imply to Ethan and Peter as they've both done this before and Sarah Jayne Jensen Suzanne Von Stroh was very good and Nicole Munoz Bella Parker was exceptionally awesome! The rest of the cast though weren't very believable in their roles and they need more coaching!Peter Gallagher doesn't make a 'cameo' as that implies that he only pops up once He pops up roughly five times throughout the movie and he resumes his position as the director of the company though Ethan has a much bigger part and is in the movie a lot more! I have to give a dishonourable mention for the fact that the film only follows Kate Parker played by Rachele Brooke Smith for the most part and only occasionally follows another character her love interest Tommy Anderson Played by Tommy Wormald.Saying that it's not a very bad movie and it's worth a second or more look! I do recommend it for a movie on a rainy day and who knows? My opinion might just change! Better luck next time guys!".

Kenny Wormald is also an excellent dancer and his acting was better but his character came off as your average randy teenage boy and I'm not sure if that's what the writers had in mind. The shiny diamond earring in his ear didn't help. The story is the same as most other dance movies just with more ballet dancing than hip hop.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Steven Jacobson ''Center Stage  Turn It Up'' tracks a small group of students at the fictitious American Ballet Academy with plenty of appeal and energyfilled film about following and reaching for your dreams this story is as much about passion as it is about ballet and hip hop.All Kate Parker has ever wanted to do was perform with the American Ballet Academy. Kate played by Rachele Brooke Smith a girl from Detroit with fire passion attitude and a blindingwhite smile and Tommy played by Kenny Wormald have a natural chemistry between the two characters and their dance moves were really hot. Despite the fact that she has something special Kate learns the hard way that it takes more than just natural talent to succeed in the dance world. Suzanne Von Stroh Sarah Jayne Jensen a smooth ballerina whose father just happens to be a major donor is chosen instead.Not very sexual or too intriguing the dancing and the choreography are inspiring the movie  however  does have its faults  as for instance some technicalities  but it is definitely enjoyable as this is a story that involves dance and romance jealousy misunderstanding and the fire that ignites the passion. They may not get any Oscar nominations for their performances but they did a good job with the movie especially for teens. The film is easy on the eye as we watch beautiful bodies rhythmically and elegantly contort in the rehearsal room and on the stage.But yet again the movie is all about dancing. Hiphop street dance it's the music that thrills and is a sequel to the teentargeted dance romance.Not as good as the original movie but I would still give it 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are the type of person who simply loves dance movies then you will probably like this movie. I am one of these people.. and i do like it. However the movie does have its faults. For one thing the lead characters are horrible actors... its makes me laugh in embarrassment for them they are just simply horrible in my opinion. The story line is very blah. With the ballet dancer Cooper Nielson coming back to the academy as his own company fell through he seems pretty pointless within this movie. If anything the whole thing that brings this movie way down is the acting and partially the story line.Unlike other people who have reviewed this movie who considered the first movie cheesy.. and this one not. I don't believe it. I believe the first movie wasn't 'cheesy' at all and i believe unlike other people yet again that it was about the dance. The lead character in the original movie after all did have a weakness about her by not having great feet and that was the point of that film was breaking through those limits of the ballet world to still be AMAZING. This movie being the 2nd within the series yet again has the same kind of focus.. as Kate parkers weakness is she doesn't have a rich daddy and thats why she didn't make it. The whole point here is to make it out on top and to prove she was worthy to be in the academy with of course a romance going on between. Overall the original center stage and this 2nd version incomparable as the first is definitely a MILLLLLLLLLION times better. The dancers were better. This 2nd movie is just a way for the people to make more money due to the high success of the original. Its just a quick buck. I give this movie a 510 that is just for the factor that it is a dance movie and its one of those bad movies you can sit back and watch every now and again if you are wanting a cheesy dance movie to watch. But other than that its not spectacular".

Then the film develops into the usual rulerisevil flick with a rescue mission in tow when Xiaolian decides to probe around paradise to find the woman he put into trouble and rescue her. This leads to more special effects opportunities involving giant turtles flying beasts and such while also allowing plenty of wire kung fu to happen during battles where most of the best parts are already contained in the trailer.Gordon Chan and his team of storytellers seemed to have lost it during the opening and first act then stumbled around and finally found their ground with the narrative only to lose it all with the final few scenes that couldn't decide how best to seek closure even ending with a coda that added to the ridiculousness. Chan allowed the film to go all over the place which accounted for its run time of over two hours with plenty of wasteful scenes that could have been excised or focus could have been put on its key characters. Instead you emerge with a feeling that some shots were in just to show off the special effects. Even Mark Lee Ping Bin's cinematography cannot save the day since the story gave way toward the end which was a pity because it had found a gem to latch onto with regards to the more philosophical approach which was somewhat like The Wachowski's Matrix films involving the Architect and the Oracle being involved in some kind of grand plan and bet but Mural failed to capitalize on that.Instead we get constantly reminded on the types of men that exist in this world with regards to romance like an instructional booklet for women anywhere  there are some who are promiscuous as seen as the Longtan character those who are the one woman type in Xiaolian and those who are subservient you know in today's context the ones carrying their girlfriends handbags around. The three male characters here predictably falls into each of the characters above just so we know which are the kinds of guys we should aspire to be like or from the opposite sex which of the three are their flavour of the day. Andy On's presence only adds some much needed muscle for battles in its limited action scenes since only him and Collin Chou are the bona fide action stars dutifully wasted in the film whose true focus is on relationships that could have been done without the swords and sorcery. The actresses in the film collectively are some of the best flower vases in Chinese cinema looking jaw dropping and stunningly incredible in their costumes and their call to order was how they each could act cool coy cute or shed tears on a whim.Eventually Mural is that roller coaster ride you have been warned about with highs when the narrative gets to what it wants to say and lows when it suddenly decides to tangent off into something qutie implausible or ridiculous fantasy film limits notwithstanding. And at the end there's no exhilaration when you step off only that feeling of dread and a pitiful loss of potential when it had so much bubbling underneath in what it wanted to say but couldn't decide on a climax and further tanked itself with its coda. Like a lover who desperately wants your attention and does everything heshe can for that only to be resoundingly rejected for trying too hard. I won't go as far as to say this is one of the worst this year but it just barely stayed above that mark.".

	schema:headline " Looks every bit gorgeous but with poorly developed story and characters as well as loose direction 'Mural' is ultimately as interesting as watching paint dry";
	schema:reviewBody "We can tell you this much about Gordon Chan after watching almost twenty years of his films the guy is an action man and despite his attempts at dabbling in other genres it is his action movies like Jet Li's 'Fist of Legend' Jackie Chan's 'Thunderbolt' and the Michael Wong SDU films 'Final Option' 'First Option' and 'Option Zero' that have truly been outstanding. We say this also because 'Mural' is Gordon's attempt at a fantasy romance and like his other nonaction genre forays it is ultimately disappointing.In all fairness this is not the first time that he has tried his hand at something similar. Gordon was also at the helm of 2008's surprise hit 'Painted Skin' adapted as well from a Liaozhai story by author Pu Songling and it was the success of that earlier movie whose Chinese title bears remarkable resemblance both written and pronounced which led to the genesis of 'Mural'. But whereas that movie had a strong lead action star in Donnie Yen and therefore could boast some decent action sequences 'Mural' has Mainland actor Deng Chao in the lead and let's just say that he is no Donnie Yen. Deng plays the righteous young scholar Zhu Xiaolian who lands up in the Land of Ten Thousand Blossoms after getting distracted en route to his imperial exams by a mural depicting some beautiful women. Needless to say Xiaolian will find love and so too will some of the women in the kingdom who have been taught by their evil Fairy Godmother Yan Ni that men are all scumbags and love is strictly forbidden. But despite the complications that follow Deng's role as the virtuous idealist fighting for his right to love is essentially dull and simplistic not helped by the actor's straightforward delivery. The same could be said of his other two male companions the timorous servant Hou Xia played by a whiny and annoying Baobeier and the mountain bandit Meng Longtan Collin Chou whom Xiaolian and Hou Xia were in pursuit of right before ending up in the temple with the titular painting. Both these supporting characters are given little development in the story Hou Xia gets to show his caring side by taking in a woman rejected by Meng as his wife while Meng has a change of heart when he sees Xiaolian's sacrificial love and the same can be said of the bevy of Chinese actresses each contributing nothing more than their looks as the other fairies in the Land.The fault lies with the slackly written story credited to Frankie Tam Maria Wong Lau HoLeung and Gordon Chan the latter two also behind 'Painted Skin'. The first half of the movie fumbles with little direction with the writers and director Chan content on letting the characters wander about CGIed vistas leaving the second half struggling for some dramatic focus on the love story between Xiaolian and Shaoyao played by Deng's wife in real life Sun Li. But with too much time spent on Zhu's apparent obsession with another fairy the softspoken and honest Mudan Taiwanese TV presenter Liu Yang playing against type and his quest to rescue her at the hands of the Queen even the romance between Xiaolian and Shaoyao never quite convinces.That the intended love story lacks any genuine emotion is also because Deng Chao and Sun Li share little onscreen chemistry. Sun Li plays her character icy and distant and the consequence is that we end up rooting for Xiaolian and Mudan instead of Shaoyao to get together. The other couplings also don't have much emotional heft so what should have been a touching supernatural fantasy romance ends up bland and uninspiring. More unforgivable is the miscasting of Collin Chou the action star best known for playing 'The Matrix's' Seraph out of place in a romantic movie.Ditto for fellow action maestro Andy On think the baddie in 'True Legend' who has a bit part as the Queen's bodyguard with obvious affections for Shaoyao. Not only is his role sorely underdeveloped the film hints at a love triangle between him Xiaolian and Shaoyao but never quite gets there he and Collin get short shrift in the poorly choreographed wireful action sequences that would have ended up as outtakes in their other action films. There is also plenty of CGI and while they are impressive it's perplexing why a film with perfectly good martial arts stars would waste them while trying to better their Hollywood counterparts in the visual effects department.But yes we'll be fair to praise the team behind the CG graphics of the movie which is probably one of the best ever done for a ChinaHong Kong movie. Deserving of praise too are Cyrus Ho's beautiful set design and Bobo Ng's lavish colourful costumes pity then that their efforts are wasted on a story that could have done with more plotting and a film that should have been done with tighter direction. Coming after the disastrous 'King of Fighters' 'Mural' once again finds the talented Gordon Chan out of his league and fans of his earlier action movies should probably steer clear of this since it will only make you long for the kind of films he used to make. www.moviexclusive.com".

This is one of the most versatile roles in films in decades. It surely ranks among the very best of all time. As King George Hawthorne covers a range of emotions personalities and temperaments not often found in film roles. His character is a study in transition from the serious to the serene to the silly. It's a role of drama of hilarity of ego and stuffiness of pathos of sorrow and regret and of gentleness and kindness. What an exceptional acting job.Most often I watch a movie for the whole experience taking in the plot characters acting scenes and scenery location action intrigue comedy tragedy as a blend of the whole product. All of these weigh in and affect how much I enjoy the film. But half way through this film I became aware that I was more engrossed in the lead character himself and the great diversity and excellence of acting on display. Others have commented that Hawthorne should have won the Best Actor Academy Award for his role in 1994. While I like Tom Hanks as an actor I agree that his role in Forrest Gump wasn't anything exceptional. Certainly not on the order of Mr. King in The Madness of King George. Indeed Hawthorne must have had to work on his role  even as a consummate actor if not for the variations of mood and portrayals at least for the vast amount of lines he had to speak in the film. By comparison the Forrest Gump role had a very small amount of lines and those were far less taxing to an actor. Hanks' was a role that seemed more fun and easygoing than a challenge or demand. I'm not one to complain about Hollywood except for the low quality and volume of attempts at humor in the past 20 years but once in a while I think that many others who make the same observation are right on. Hollywood flops big time in its Oscar choice of an actor actress or film once in a while. It seems to me that the Californiabased Academy at times doesn't look as objectively and honestly at films produced outside the U.S. Nothing else produced in 1994 even came close to the outstanding acting by Hawthorne in this first rate film.".

We see the confusion of an equerry who has no idea of what his duties are a royal attendant hurriedly spit on and cuffpolish a jewel on the kingly crown the boredom of the king's eldest sons who would rather be just about anywhere else than waiting for their father in the chilly anteroom. Colder in here than a greyhound's nostril mutters the Lord Chancellor. It's a theme that will carry through the entire film. Kingship and royalty are shams it seems  magic acts that require faith on the part of the audience. A peek behind the curtain of noblesse oblige and it's all likely to fall to pieces.The story remains fairly true to the facts. Late in 1788 George III is taken by a mysterious illness lately surmised to be porphyria that strongly resembles the thenpopular conception of madness. Chaos ensues mainly in the desperate efforts of the Government headed by William Pitt  Julian Wadham to hush the whole matter up lest the forces of the Whig Opposition led by Charles James Fox  Jim Carter use the power vacuum to place the king's eldest son the Prince of Wales at the head of a regency sympathetic to their political cause. But Alan Bennett who originally wrote the script for the theatre is wise enough to treat the potentially tragic story as essentially comic even while raising the question of the basic insanity behind all pretensions to royalty. Some of my lunatics fancy themselves kings notes the mad doctor who undertakes the case. But he IS the king. Where shall his fancy take refuge?The power of the film radiates from neither history nor comedy but from performances and Nigel Hawthorne who sharpened his characterization of George III over months of playing it on stage dominates a roster of topnotch actors. Whether browbeating his older children with admonitions of Do not be fat Sir! Fight it! Fight it! or freed from his selfimposed strictures of kingship by illness slipping the reins and pawing under the stays of Lady Pembroke Amanda Donahoe Hawthorne is both maddeningly and appealingly autocratic. Perhaps his Farmer George England's prime example of husbandry both in his knowledge of horticulture and in his brood of 15 children is more sympathetic than the historical personage but in the end that matters little. It's a superbly nuanced performance.And he's given able support by Helen Mirren as his faithful Queen Charlotte who's devoted her life to supporting the man who rescued her from the obscurity of a small Germanic kingdom and married her despite her rather spectacular lack of good looks. Mirren's accent is variable her etching of Charlotte's desperate groping at every straw in order to see her husband cured is not.The rest of the cast is impeccable as well. Ian Holm is all steely religious conviction turned to medical practice as Dr. Willis who undertakes to treat the king. Rupert Everett despite the double handicap of an obviously false stomach and the silliest wig in the film does a creditable turn as the Prince of Wales though the script treats Prinny unfairly mainly for the comic potential of doing so. Ministers of state and Parliamentarians Wadham Carter and John Wood handle their lines with a panache and wit that would do credit to any authentic 18thcentury gentleman. Some of the best lines go to Wood who as usual gives his unsurpassable style and timing as when he growls out in church I'm praying goddammit!The costumes are both faithful and sumptuous the cinematography is luminous and the sets borrowed at low cost from various castles and colleges are lovingly handled. Of special note is the music of Handel adapted so cleverly by George Fenton that one would swear the old boy in the knee breeches wrote the score himself for every scene.".

And he was actually a hard working monarch wrong headed at times who had the longest reign for any monarch  until Queen Victoria in English history. He was George III reigned 1760  1820  the last nine years incapacitated by insanity and blindness. It was while he was ruling Great Britain that the American Revolution occurred the French Revolution occurred Napoleon rose and fell and the industrial revolution hit Western Europe and the Americas. His is a key reign of modern history.We are taught he was a tyrant. Actually he was a conscientious supporter of the British Constitution but he believed the colonists were disobedient children who should have been punished for their own good. Once it was obvious that they had won on the battlefield George offered to abdicate. He was talked out of it and eventually faced up to accepting the papers of the new Minister from the United States Mr. John Adams. But he never really fully accepted it and in his last decade the two countries fought a second war the War of 1812.George III was a good but strict family man. He and his wife Charlotte had seven sons and six daughters. But his sons were disappointments the best one Frederick Duke of York was a secondrate army commander who got involved in a scandal when his mistress Mrs. Clarke sold army commissions in the name of the Duke of York to undeserving men. The German Georges had a tradition of hatred between the Kings and their sons and heirs. George I was hated by George II because the former had imprisoned his wife George II's mother for life for infidelity see SARABAND FOR DEAD LOVERS. George II was hated by his son Frederick Prince of Wales and kicked the son out of the royal palace. Frederick died prematurely in 1758 so his son George III succeeded in 1760. His son known as Florizel or Prinny had a long standing relationship with Mrs. Fitzherbert a popular actress who happened to be Catholic. It was actually known by King George III that Prinny had an illegal marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert. As head of the Church of England George III resented this act. He also disliked Prinny's support of Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Sheridan and sometimes Edmund Burke. The King was a good Tory  he never realized that Prinny's politics were a way of annoying him and Prinny was even more reactionary than the King was. Prinny's gambling and drinking debts also annoyed the King.George was able to support the wise government to 1789 anyway of William Pitt the Younger. So supportive was he that Pitt would reciprocate. For one day in 1788 King George got out of his carriage in a forest walked over to a tree and had a long conversation with it. The tree you see was not a tree but actually the now dead King Frederick the Great of Prussia. George III was showing signs of dementia. He was the first really certifiable monarch since Henry VI back in the 15th Century. George's son Prinny was ready to back a bill to remove his father and lock him away. Pitt saw Fox ready to replace him and fought a long delaying action on the Regency bill. It worked as Dr. Wills managed to bring the dementia under control.It would only be in 1811 when Pitt was dead for five years and Fox for four that a Tory Government passed a Regency bill but by then Prinny was openly antiWhig. It was politically allowable for the Percival Ministry to chance Prinny as Regent by then. After George III died he would become George IV and reign until 1830.This film has followed the tragic illness that incapacity and eventually destroyed George III but only to the conclusion of it's first appearance in 1789. Nigel Hawthorne had performed the role to international acclaim on stage. He repeats it here showing a thoughtful monarch witness why he is upset about the errant colonies gaining independence  the valuable natural resources are lost and he is aware of this. He is puritanical when normal but with a son like Prinny who could blame him for being sorely disappointed. From the start you find yourself rooting for Hawthorne's monarch who was not the evil tyrant that Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson painted.Rupert Everett shows the callousness of the Prince of Wales who is so selfish that at one point when safely alone Pitt and Fox wonder if their American cousins were right about abolishing the monarchy. Ian Holm as Dr. Wills is properly a mixture of early pioneer of psychology and tyrant. A wonderful film of how a national crisis was met and overcome peacefully. And timely too. Within weeks of the recovery of George III in 1789 the Bastille fell in Paris.".

While the Prime Minister places him in the hands of Dr Willis to keep him in power The Prince of Wales and the leader of the opposition both plan to replace the king with the prince by way of a parliamentary bill.Based on the great little play that is historically based this film went down very well with the awards season since it is very English and well acted.  The plot is well written I'm not sure if it is totally accurate but it is surely based on facts even if it has been coloured for artistic and entertainment reasons.  The film embraces both the internal workings of the royal family and the politics of parliament really well again it may not be totally true but it is colourful dissenting and enjoyably.  The film is involving but yet still manages to be enjoyable and funny.  It is a great story and it is lavishly brought to the big screen in this great production.The sets and costumes are really good and establish the period and setting of the story very well but it is the performances that really make it work. Hawthorne is wonderfully cast and delivers a great performance in the lead  both as the cruel monarch or the madman.  He is totally believable all the way and never lets his performance become comical or silly even when it is amusing in delivery.  Mirren and Donohoe both have less to do but make impacts in their scenes.  Everett Holm Wadham and Graves support the film to great effect their performances are colourful impacting and very enjoyable.Overall historical films will quite often be viewed as lifeless dull and overlong.  Here this film goes against all those old clichs and is lively colourful and enjoyable.  The rich sets and costumes add value to some great performances in an engaging story that is very enjoyable.".

All the while court intrigue has everyone in parliament conspiring about appointing a Regent to take over the King's duties. His son the Prince of Wales RUPERT EVERETT is more then willing to replace his father on the throne.Much of it is played for fine comic effect with many nuances and comic timing in spite of the seriousness of the central character's illness.

HELEN MIRREN is highly satisfactory as his wife who wants nothing more than to see him make a complete recovery and RUPERT GRAVES is fine in one of the more lowkey roles as one of the King's supportive aids.As usual in all of these British historical pieces the settings costumes photography art directionall are exquisite. The photography is a marvel at suggesting that only candlelight illuminates many of the scenes so that it's like watching a series of fine paintings come to life. Effective use of Handel's music provides solid support throughout.".

It chronicles King George III's gradual slip into what was thought to be madness but was later discovered to be another disease and perhaps one of the most impressive things does so without bending and mangling history.Granted now I'm American born and raised and live here so don't think I'm bashing them or anything many parts of this film might be hard for American audiences to grasp but if you have the brain cells to sit through it it's absolutely wonderful.The shining star to me is Englishborn Helen Mirren. Talk about a robbed Oscar! She portrays the originallyGerman Queen Charlotte incredibly well. The costuming in the film are what add to not only Mirren's but the entire film's historical accuracy. Granted Mirren's German accent didn't stay exactly on key the entire time but someone who had lived in England long enough the accent could have begun to fade no? Nonetheless a flawless performance by Mirren.The other reason this film is so incredible is its star Nigel Hawthorne. Every scene he portrays the King in is perfect. He makes you feel like you're part of the movie the interaction between Hawthorne in Mirren is great as well.Others who add to the film's quality are Everett as the Prince of Wales Donohoe Lady Pembroke and Holm Dr. Willis. A truly great ensemble cast makes this my 1 movie of the 90s.Overall Just absolutely incredible! Go watch it! 55 Stars.".

I read a biography of the King recently and the death of Sir Nigel Hawthorne over Christmas prompted me to have another look at this.I'm still bowled over and this will always be one of my top ten films Hawthorne was never better and this will stand as the best of his legacy of fine performances.His portrayal of the King is painfully accurate and largely historically correct in a superb script by Alan Bennett. The King was well educated but not particularly bright and Hawthorne brings his preremptory manner out so well. The scene where the King cross examines the Prime Minister about a minor appointment tells you more than you need to know of the sane man in two minutes.The descent into madness is subtle at first and might just be eccentricty but then gets worse and the Government are appalled at how they might lose control to the Opposition if there is a regency declared. The machinations become immense as so much hangs on the King's sanity.Meanwhile treatment goes ahead and in a superb scene Hytner parodies the Coronation service when the King is strapped to a chair and gagged to Handel's 'Zadok the Priest'. In the Coronation service this music has since 1727 been used when the monarch is ceremonially led to St Edward's chair and is enthroned at the precise moment the choir comes in on the music.However the King recovers though he had separate bouts of subsequent illness before totally losing it though by then to Alzheimers in 1811 though he was to live until 1820.Hawthorne was robbed of an Oscar here in my view. Scriptwriter Bennett one of our best living playwrights has a small part as an MP.".

While George was reasonably rational when the Revolutionary War began his mental impairment must have affected his reasoning even then.

	schema:reviewBody "A superlative drama.  By now most sophisticated moviegoers are aware that King George III's sickness might very well have been a result of porphyria a hereditary disease that some doctors have traced back to Mary Queen of Scots i.e. George III's greatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandmother. Whatever the cause Nigel Hawthorne gives the performance of a lifetime as the tortured king.  The conflict between George III and his heir the Prince of Wales the eventual King George IV is brutally and unapologetically portrayed the director does not spare us in his vivid reenactment of the combative and sour relationship that actually existed between the two men. As an American one might suspect I'd be unsympathetic to the British monarch who presided over England's attempt to brutalize its colonies  but George III's almostwistful resentment of his errant colonists generates some sympathy for the man himself  a sympathy which is unexpectedly intensified by Hawthorne's sudden descent into incoherence his dim yet aching realization of what he has become and his eventual recovery.

	onyx:emotionText "A superlative drama.  By now most sophisticated moviegoers are aware that King George III's sickness might very well have been a result of porphyria a hereditary disease that some doctors have traced back to Mary Queen of Scots i.e. George III's greatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandmother. Whatever the cause Nigel Hawthorne gives the performance of a lifetime as the tortured king.  The conflict between George III and his heir the Prince of Wales the eventual King George IV is brutally and unapologetically portrayed the director does not spare us in his vivid reenactment of the combative and sour relationship that actually existed between the two men. As an American one might suspect I'd be unsympathetic to the British monarch who presided over England's attempt to brutalize its colonies  but George III's almostwistful resentment of his errant colonists generates some sympathy for the man himself  a sympathy which is unexpectedly intensified by Hawthorne's sudden descent into incoherence his dim yet aching realization of what he has become and his eventual recovery. George III was haunted by demons not of his own making and no human being deserves the fate to which his disease if such it was eventually condemned him.

George III is married to Charlotte yet he dallys with Lady Pembroke and fathers 15 children and an empire. The thing is Farmer Georgethe king's nickname is starting to show signs of madness the rest.. well you'll have to see it for yourself. Nicolas Hytner directs impeccably and while the screenplay has some sardonic jokes and colloquialisms it ensures that the film is essentially a serious study of 18th century politics and the monarchy. The period detail and art direction is nothing short of sumptuous exquisite costumes scenery and settings and the use of music by Handel was appropriately fitting. Then there is the acting it was top notch. Nigel Hawthorne's performance here is so exceptional he pretty much embodies the film in a performance that is funny moving and charming. Helen Mirren and Amanda Donohoe both do wonderfully as his wife and mistress they both are great actresses and both look lovely here. Rupert Everett is suitably detestable as the foppish Prince of Wales Ian Holm is brilliant as Willis in some of the more harrowing scenes of the film and Rupert Graves is entertaining as Greville. Overall this is a truly great film so worth seeing for Hawthorne's performance alone! 1010 Bethany Cox".

Yes it's a bit of a frockcoat and wigs fest but if you allow yourself to look past all of that there is a sensitive and deeply moving story of human nature and the nature of human relationships.Of course Freud's Oedipus complex is hard to completely brush aside considering the actions of the Prince. Though it cannot be a term used without hesitation indeed the son attempts to usurp the Father but not with the Mother. Perhaps if you consider the old idea that a monarch is married to the country  then the allusion works quite well.Even if you are not sure on the rights  wrongs of continuing to have a monarchy in the UK I don't feel that the republican agenda is pushed too strongly. For me I guess the fact the plot is concerned with royalty is a byline for the main theme of relationships.In madness the King portrays traits of teenage antics and requires in the end a disciplinarian approach to combat his outbursts and help him grow into the man. It's also an amazing love story with a wife torn between medical advice and wanting to be beside Mr. King's side which she knows is possibly the best medicine.

	schema:headline " Some Impressive Elements In A Movie That Comes Up Short In The End";
	schema:reviewBody "I want to say right off the top that there is a lot about this movie that was impressive. As a political statement the movie makes valid points about the problems of hereditary monarchies. The performances of Nigel Hawthorne as George III Helen Mirren as Queen Charlotte Rupert Everett as the Prince of Wales and Julian Wadham as William Pitt the Prime Minister were excellent the portrayal of the era's manner of dealing with madness seemed very realistic the sets were wonderful and the closing caption left one wondering about the current royal family since they are direct descendants of George III! So there was a lot that I liked. Unfortunately in rating this movie I also found that it was a difficult movie to really sit down and be drawn into.One of the things that kept coming into my head the entire way through was that there just didn't seem to be anything really vital at stake here. I know that sounds unusual when you're talking about the Throne of England but it's true. Even in the 1790's when this seems to have been set the power of the English monarch was increasingly possessed by Parliament and the monarchy was well on the way to becoming the figurehead it is today. George III's grandfather George I didn't even really want to become King in 1727 because of the limited powers the King of England possessed. Whether George III or the Prince of Wales was on the throne didn't matter much more than whether Elizabeth II or the current Prince of Wales is on the throne. The Prince may have wanted the trappings of power but that was all he would get because there was no real power to be had by being King. I realize that at least in the movie the Prince promised the office of Prime Minister to Fox Jim Carter in place of Pitt but this had more to do with the dynamics of Parliament than it had to do with the King or regent being able to choose the Prime Minister. If the bill to make the Prince of Wales Regent had passed it would have meant that the majority in Parliament was now in the hands of the opposition and a transition of power would occur. So the Prince wouldn't make Fox Prime Minister Fox would make the Prince Regent. I also went through the whole movie not really being sure what my reaction to George's predicament should be. On the one hand as you watch him being subjected to the grotesque treatments of the day you want to feel sorry for him. Even in history George III truly was a tragic King Learlike figure. On the other hand the whole movie had a rather overt antimonarchy feel to it and it was hard to feel sympathy for any of them. I was unclear where the movie was going on that point. The repeated joke about the former American colonies  they're gone just let them go  also started to bug me after a while. As an aside thinking about those former American colonies it's always intrigued me that there seems to be far greater fascination with the Royal Family in the United States which rebelled against the monarchy than there is in Canada which remained loyal. That however is another story! As to the movie? It's a middling movie  certainly not a disaster but nothing to write home about and I certainly wouldn't watch it again. 510.".

Working for a publishing company is a hard job to take even if you went through a rough marriage and trying to start over finding yourself shouldn't be so hard. Not with Carly NorrisSharon Stone. She moves into a new high in New York called Sliver Heights she gets a room which the deceased lived. and their she meets the owner Zeke HawkinsWilliam Baldwin owns Sliver Heights and he thinks he God. This man is not only the owner he's the biggest voyeur of that complex. A voyeurPeeping Tom like him make others look like amateurs. I liked ever scene of this movie the love scenes the shower scenes the conversation scenes and he actually records them which I think is downright obscene. Sharon never looked any hotter in that movie and he character is really hard core all the way. The author Jack LandfordTom Berenger seemed to be a decent character however his shady past makes him the target for police. When he was killed the murders stopped but the voyeurism was way more sinister than the crimes earlier. So Zeke was given a major attitude adjustment there and I think it's time for a new owner. This movie was really hardcore imagine for what the unrated version would be like! Rating 3 out of 5 stars.".

Of course being a thriller something isn't quite right and so Carly searches to find out what is going on.Stone and Baldwin are both excellent in their leading roles. She's attractive he's handsome and both are charismatic. There's some steamy scenes between the two of them Stone's character is one that you can really care for. The supporting characters in Sliver actually do what supporting characters are supposed to  support. Tom Berenger's character the dodgy Jack Lansford is the is he or isn't he redhearing and is played well. Polly Walker plays the vampy Vid Warren Carly's apartment neighbor and is a good parallel to the reserved Carly. Colleen Camp is Judy Marks Carly's incorrigible assistant and she is terrific. Finally CCH Pounder plays the detective Lt. Victoria Hendrix though she is rather underused here this not being one of her best performances probably because of the fact that she is underused.Sliver provokes some interesting topics of conversation for your next cocktail party namely the notions of privacy and what would you do if you had the power to watch almost whoever you wanted as Baldwin's character did. With the increasing notion of Big Brother is watching you in today's society Sliver seems even more relevant to our lives. Sliver is presented in a glossy manner with a cool soundtrack and is relatively fastpaced. However while the ending is effective more could have been done to raise the notions of privacy that I previously talked about. Other than that Sliver is a very sexy thriller.".

Not having read the book I can only guess based on my experience with the pulp mystery genre that the film follows its plot closely. All of the main characters seem to be either sex addicts perverts or impotent men and this provides an opening for too many boring and unnecessary sex scenes. I suppose these were meant to fill in the gaps left by the vacuous plot and the uninspired script.In terms of mystery Sliver's central plot succeeds as it does somewhat but not completely keep you guessing right up to the end. However the plot would have made a much better 30 minute or hourlong episode of a TV detective show minus the sex. Sliver is overloaded with baggage and filler  too many sex scenes a little too much character development especially considering how shallow irrational and absurd most of the characters are and not enough psychological realism.Overall I found the film slightly entertaining but a little difficult to get all the way through.".

A number of the building's residents seem friendly especially Zeke.Someone is able to see what is going on in the apartments and this person even has videotapes of some of the action. In addition to whoever this person is Carly is also spying on people after someone gave her a telescope. Specifically the couple having sex in a nearby building.Carly's boss Alex won't give her a raise. He does take her to lunch where they meet Jack Lansford author of 'Flesh and Blood' which Carly has never read.Strange things start happening in the Sliver building. And Carly knows something happened to the woman who had her apartment. The movie has a chilling quality that increases as time passes.I thought Sharon Stone did a good job here but her best moment was a funny scene where Carly's date wants to see her panties. And Carly did have a surprising reaction to ... well I won't give it away. Stone was quite good in the scene though.There was plenty of good acting but I think CCH Pounder stood out as one of the detectives.Overall I was happy with the movie. It was a little violent which is to be expected but just tense enough to be interesting.";

Sliver plays almost like a genderreversed Basic Instinct but lightning doesn't strike twice the sex scenes are unremarkable except maybe for the fact that you see more nudity from William Baldwin than from Sharon Stone in them and there is nowhere near the same tension or action. On the other hand Eszterhas' subplot about the ethics of voyeurism and about real life as the ultimate soap opera was prophetic in the preBig Brother era. Baldwin's poor acting is a detriment but Stone is very good in a role far removed from Catherine Tremell nice funny little turn by Colleen Camp as her colleague. 12 out of 4.".

Of course much of this is because of the success of Basic Instinct.The main problem with this approach is that i feel it warrants a sure hand. Otherwise you'll end up with a movie that lacks drive and in worst case just becomes silly. Unfortunately Sliver both lacks drive AND becomes silly. While i feel that Basic Instinct is a good thriller i don't know if trying to copy it is such a good idea. Basic Instinct worked mainly because of the chemistry between Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas in the two leads. Paul Verhoevens directing was mostly intent on creating appropriate moods and settings for their encounters. Here on the other hand we have a seemingly much less dedicated Sharon Stone having no chemistry whatsoever with William Baldwin. The fact that Baldwin is not even close to Michael Douglas actingwise doesn't help either. But the failed sexy approach is not the only thing wrong with this movie. There is also the insanely crappy story of murders happening in a house full of cameras and still noone knows who the killer is.In the end Sliver fails where Basic Instinct succeeds. The era of sexy thrillers has passed now fortunately and this is one of it's biggest disappointments considering actors budget and ambition. I rate this 310.".

Sharon Stone is at her best as Carly Norris. William Baldwin is weak but I guess passable. Tom Berenger is fantastically entertaining. Polly Walker is a joy. Martin Landau in a small role is a nice surprise. People for years have told me that this film is torrid and boring weak and heavy handled and so on and so on. I disagree. It's perfect and I hardly think movies are perfect they can always have a little something more or a little something less. When people say like most of you people on these message boards that the ending is no surprise or weak or arbitrary you have NOT been watching closely. What makes you think that Tom Berenger's character is the only murderer about?I suggest you all look CLOSELY very CLOSELY at the clues Phillip Noyce and Joe Ezsterhas have laid out for you. If you just take the ending for what it is you're wrong and need to review the film to understand everything that's been going on before your eyes and in the unseen.

She does a little microfiche sleuthing and finds that other tenants have met untimely ends. Seems that evil is aloft. Meanwhile she meets two guys intent on releasing her from the sexual doldrums one a best selling macho writer Tom Berenger the other a pretty boy with charm William Baldwin. Somebody mysteriously gives her a telescope so she can check the action through the windows of the high rises around town. Meanwhile we are flashed shots of the tenants as though on video tape. Stone opts for Baldwin who seduces her. This is interesting Stone crying tears of joyful release as she climaxes. Afterward it is revealed that he owns the apartment and has set up surveillance cameras in the walls to spy on the inhabitants.I forget what this is ripped off frommaybe Crawlspace 1986but believe it or not there was a man in Alaska a few years back who actually did this sort of spying on a modest scale. He had a fourplex or the like with peep holes in the bathroom etc. It was on the news. Here we have high tech spying from a war room with monitors along the wall and an easy chair. Charming boy truly likes to watch.The main problem with this film is the source material. Ira Levin who penned the novel never presumed to literature while managing a very successful career shocking the book club set with such madeintomovie hits as Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives. His first success and perhaps the only thing genuine book he ever published was No Time for Sergeants from the fifties. The other novels suffer from flashy fake premises that lead to psychological waters never fully navigated. In Sliver what is not engaged is the character of a man who would choose to spy on his neighbors as a way of life. It is like throwing him in a grab bag to make him into your standard issue psycho killer. As such he is left unexplored.A secondary problem is Phillip Noyce's uninspired and underdeveloped direction. We can see even without reading the novel that heroine Carly Norris was a somewhat frumpy sexually fallow woman headed straight for matronhood. If only they had the guts to play her full out like that. But Stone seemed ill at ease in such an unfamiliar role and Noyce couldn't be bothered with nuances. A tertiary problem is the casting of Stone in the first place. It might be said that Miss Stone with her onscreen rapacious sexual appetite and her success at any cost cinematic persona is truly a woman for the 'nineties. If so it makes me long for the woman of the 'oughts. At her best Stone is a professional without charm but unless she is cast as a slutty evil predatory female she just doesn't cut it at all. In the war room she reverts partially to her usual persona as she goes along with Baldwin's sick program and she comes to life. Here we glimpse what might have been done with the premise the surveillance cameras strip away all privacy and for a moment the man who welds them is exposed as a nazilike monster while she is confronted with her own compromised nature.A final problem is the ending. It's an inappropriate joke told by someone insensitive to any context. Yet I can see how Noyce thought it might work Carly Norris not only looks like his mother but now she punishes him as a mother would by destroying his toys and telling him to grow up. She actually says Get a life. Maybe she should have given him a spanking as well.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

After having her application accepted very quickly she soon finds out that the previous tenant in her apartment was not only killed but Carly looks just like her. Signs point to the fact that the killer is someone Carly knows from the building...The plot tries to tackle some pretty deep psychology by probing into human nature's curiosity and compulsiveness but only manages to scratch the surface if that. The film also spends too much time developing as a who's the killer? movie to tackle any deeper subject matter. The list of suspects is also surprising limited so any who has seen a few films in the genre will narrow the mystery here to only a few key shreds of evidence though the actual ending might still not be totally expected it won't be satisfyingly clever either. The film's misguided development brings about some serious questions since there are pretty big changes in character yet very little happens to actually merit them. In a brief but interesting scene Carly is dared to take of her panties in a fancy restaurant as part of a game. Pretty risky game that would require a good amount of nerves and buildup yet this is the first and only game they ever play. These things go on and what is left is an uneven psychological sexthriller that even manages to deliver only mediocre sex scenes.  410Rated R for sexual content and some violence".

So when I saw this movie I was totally pleased with this sequels outcome. There was so much more in this one then the original. Especially the whole dancing Scooby in the whole soul getup.

In this movie Daphne is much smarter. Sure she has a few stupid moments but overall she has intelligence and wit. Sarah Michelle Gellar did a wonderful performance as this character. Shaggy and Scooby were of course you're regular brainless heroes who somehow end up saving the day. Mathew Lillard was exceptionally well in playing his role and didn't overact. VelmaLinda Cardellini was still the same old Velma. Linda Cardellini fit the role expected of her and made the movie well rounded. Freddie Prinze Jr.Fred made his character less Narcesistic as he was before. Fred is still the committed leader who loves his admirers and especially Daphne.My rating on this movie is a 10 because it was like watching a cartoon episode of Scoobydoo only being a motion picture. The characters were funny and the actors did an amazing job as portraying them.".

The humor has also been improved and this movie actually does have some entertaining and funny moments in it.Not only the story itself has been improved but also the storytelling. The pace is good and the characters work better for this movie. Also the actors seemed more at ease in their roles. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar certainly improved their acting compared to the first movie. Still best parts are played by Matthew Lillard and the perfectly cast Linda Cardellini. Plus of the movie is that it also has actors Alicia Silverstone Tim Blake Nelson and Seth Green in it.The monsters are enjoyable and are good looking. There still are some 'fake' moments but on the other hand there also are some truly spectacular looking sequences involving monsters. The character of ScoobyDoo himself is also looking more convincingly this time.It's not really a memorable or great movie but it is simple good entertainment to watch.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "For the first film I was a little disappointed. Mostly because the plot was a bit out of whack the characters were nothing like their cartoon counterparts and the ending revelations were silly. I found the second film on DVD and decided to buy it. I watched it and loved it.The second film is a great deal better than the first film and more faithful to the cartoons in fact that's what it feels like  watching a feature length liveaction episode of the show. The actors portrayals of Mystery Inc. have greatly improved and they seem more comfortable in their roles. The sets stunts and special effects a phrase taken from the bonus features on the DVD were all well put together adding to the fun.Monsters Unleashed involves Mystery Inc. in their hometown of Coolsville attending the opening of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum where the costumes of monsters the gang faced in the cartoon are on display. However the Evil Masked Figure attacks stealing the costumes and transforming them into realisticlooking monsters who all seek revenge on Mystery Inc. However to make matters worse a trashtalking news reporter Heather Jasper Howe berates the gang and turns the city against them. Fred Daphne Velma Shaggy and Scooby Doo must fight and run for survival and regain the confidence of Coolsville.The portrayal of Fred and Daphne are greatly improved and a lot more funnier than in the first film where they were greatly out of character. Velma is generally the same as before but the presence of a romantic interest for her is a new side to her. As for Shaggy and Scooby they are hilarious and really emotional.It was really great to see a lot of references to the classic shows. The monsters are all accurate to their cartoon versions with some changes to make them look realistic. Among the monsters are the ghostly Black Knight the electrifying 10000 Volt Ghost the vicious Pterodactyl Ghost who steals the monster costumes the comical duo of the Skeleton Men Captain Cutler who is a deceased deep sea diver with a glowing helmet gargantuan firebreathing Miner 49er boggleeyed Zombie who covers an unfortunate news reporter in slime the massive blob that is the Tar Monster and the Cotton Candy Glob who meets his end by Shaggy and Scooby's stomachs. Other monster costumes appear heavily similar to their cartoons forms.I recommend this film is anyone who likes Scooby Doo as it is really fun and enjoyable. Although there are some swear words used a couple of scary images and disturbing ones too and Scooby Doo wearing an afro and dancing for a little while this film is colourful and memorable experience to watch.".

It was also good to see Seth Green in a very different role than in his previous works.  Hats off to Sarah Michelle Gellar for another great performance as Daphne.  I also enjoyed seeing Peter Boyle who of course was in Young Frankenstein as the monster. He always works in these types of films.  I give this film a 7 out of 10. See this at any price!".

The SFX were way betterthe acting was better and what is all about thestory was GOOD. This movie is true to the cartoons. Mathew Lilard is just great if Johny Depp got an academy award nomination for Pirates I think Mathew deserves to at least be considered. Freddie Prinze although I hate him mainly because he is maried to the beautiful Sara Michelle Gellar really gets into the Fred character this time. Velma is greatly cast and she's hot. Sara Michelle Gellar what can I say I love her and she kicks butt in this movie it reminded me of the Buffy days Sniff. The small parts by Seth Green Alicia Silverstone and Peter Boyle are great. All in all this movie was made for people who know that all movies are not Citizen Kane and that movies are to have FUN!!!! so don't pay any attention to Ebert  Roper if you liked the cartoons go see it.  910".

	schema:reviewBody "Scooby Doo 2 is honestly the worst movie in the entire world and I'm even accounting for Kool Kat. The acting might be straight from a third grade play and every actor in the movie should consider redacting it from their resumes.First off the town that we find ourselves immersed in is named Coolsville the lamest town ever. The characters in the movie have literally no clue what to do and the awkward sexually confused Velma is off putting. Plus the overly girly personality of Daphne makes any normal person want to puke.

Scooby then gets hit on because somehow the villainous woman can't see through a badly tailored suit and an Afro wig or does and is attracted to a dog. I'm not sure which is scarier.

The acting might be straight from a third grade play and every actor in the movie should consider redacting it from their resumes.First off the town that we find ourselves immersed in is named Coolsville the lamest town ever. The characters in the movie have literally no clue what to do and the awkward sexually confused Velma is off putting. Plus the overly girly personality of Daphne makes any normal person want to puke. Shaggy has no personality traits other than hungry dumb stoner. Fred is just a archetypal jock.

Freddie Prince Jr has a good look for Fred but his acting isn't great and Sarah Michelle Gellar is wrong for Daphne bring back the pathetic Daphne in the cartoon that always needs to be rescued. Seth Green as Patrick is great it was so sad when you think he is the bad guy and he and Velma are really cute together.I love the way this movie ties back to the cartoons with the same monsters. I also like this one because it has the unmasking of the villain at the end just like in the cartoons.Those little skeleton Guys are really cute and the other monsters are great to the cotton candy glob was great.The animation for Scooby Doo is great way better than bits in Lord of the Rings. Old man Wickles is great I love his house and when Scooby and Shaggy are hiding in the bushes and he says darn bushes howling at me again that is great one of the best lines.".

I acknowledge that the sequel isn't actually that good I avoided the first one on critical advice but it would be churlish for me to say it is unbearable. In fact it's actually watchable to an extent. It's great to look at and I'll admit to getting a reasonable number of laughs from it. But I still can't recommend the film. It's too childish doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or not and above all is just far too disjointed. Someone should've told the director that the way to approach a film like this is to play it for laughs the whole way through and have a story that will in some way reach out to adults. This is more playground fare than family entertainment. And on top of all that it has the wooden Freddie Prinze Jr. as the lead although thankfully not much is expected of him or anyone in the cast. Still blink and you'll miss a wasted Tim Blake Nelson. You won't miss the latest American Idol though...This is one for the cartoon's audience children or anyone who's really really bored and just needs a bit of a laugh. I'm sure it'll really amuse the kids both at home and in the cinema believe me nothing will be lost to DVD although I can't see many of the general public wanting to watch the whole thing again.".

Linda Cardellini does look like Velma but even the makeup job cannot bring the character to life. Alicia Silverstone appears as a reporter in her worst performance since her embarrassing turn as Batgirl in Batman and Robin.

The cartoon had the same plot for a gazillion years kids investigate ghost and find it is a human in disguise sort of a kiddie Baskerville. Now along came the movie and instead of humans in ghost costumes we had ghosts in humans. And the story rolled with it all sorts of gags based on different notions of selfreference. It was perfectly right for the project which after all puts humans in cartoon figures and with the dog a cartoon figure among humans.I liked it. It played with the nature of film. Velma's hair was cast as dark red so both the girls were redheads. This was a cinematic decision. No fools in charge that time.Now this. The story this time could have been taken to the next level. It certainly seems to have been conceived that way from the basic idea you start with a collection of costumes from all the old cartoons. These are the costumes that humans wore pretending to be ghosts. Now you have real ghosts wear those costumes. Has promise.Also take our Velma out of her costume. Since the first Scooby we've seen Cardinelli in Brokeback Mountain. In that she played the 21 year old daughter to a fiftysomething Ledger though she is quite a but older. It reminds us that 30 year olds are playing these teenagers. Anyway take Velma out of her dorky costume but keeping the fake teeth and into something sexy. Part of the joke about costumes. And there's some minor play with Shag and the Dog transforming too. All this indicates that it got started as intelligently as before but in development someone must have wanted it to be more like the cartoons. This means you're mostly just looking scared and running away in comic fashion.Velma's hair is black. That should have been the giveaway. Where is Rodriguez when we need him? This is a waste. But I'm going to keep coming back. Maybe next time someone will want it like the first one which after all did double the business.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

It ain't high are but it's loads of fun and there are plenty of injokes for the wiser viewers. The movie is fairly mindless otherwise it would lose its kid audience. but that doesn't mean there's no good humor or plot to it.Granted the plot is dumb the gang go up against all the monsters from the first season of the TV show only this time they're real. The manic setpieces just bombard us one after the other. Once again there's not a moment of boredom but there are enough quieter scenes with the Mystery Inc. gang. The main stars are as usual Shaggy and Scooby. Matthew Lillard is deadon as Shaggy so much so that he actually replaced Casey Kasem as his animated voice.One moment that requires major suspension of disbelief is not any scene featuring sludge monsters or a cotton candy ghosts but a scene in which Velma utters 'I'm not hot'. NOT HOT!!!???? WHAT??? She's a total babe more so than Daphne. Every frame of her is a work of art as far as I am concerned.The CGI effects this time round are thankfully superior to the trashy effects of the first film. It's a much better movie all round and will not fail to amuse anyone of any age.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First I'm impressed with the special effects. It really did look like Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted it for a minute.Secondly I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer and his renditions of Havin' My Baby and Movin' On Up were priceless. John Witherspoon who coincidentally played Grier's father in 1992's Boomerang if you remember he coordinated the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun.Beyond that this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40yearold man and not a baby? He's got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there's a Rob Schneider cameo. And please if you're stupid enough to waste 8 on this movie at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children. This movie is way too sexual for small children lots of jokes and innuendo about sex going down eating out etc. and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic film as least spare your children the pain and suffering.".

When I requested my money back at the end of the movie I was informed that because I watched the whole thing 'I wasn't entitled to reimbursement'. I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though.The movie summary is pretty basic. The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police. Underneath this clever outline however lies a repertoire of original fresh and hilarious skits. Or not.Ask yourself the following Do you like to see people getting hit by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drool?If you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed in some places as 'The Worst Movie of the Decade' there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse...somewhere. I can't say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously. This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny.Respect".

I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man however had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.Obviously the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner Tracy Morgan steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents however cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK. I mean it was not 100 believable but it was OK...nothing great. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.Wait for it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly funny";
	schema:reviewBody "First off I definitely don't think this movie deserves to have such a low rating. Mind you I thought this movie was going to reek to high heaven when I saw the trailers. My expectations were extremely extremely low. I enjoyed the other films the Wayans Bros. did. There is no doubt that they are all talented comics. I just feel that they're a little overrated. Sometimes people seem to talk about the Wayans Bros. like they're the new Zucker brothers. I don't think they will EVER reach those heights in comedy. One of the things I feared about Little Man was most of the humor was going to consist of bathroom gags. The movie has its small share of bathroom humor but never overdoes it. After seeing the previews for movies like The Pacifier I was afraid there was going to be some joke involving diaperchanging. Stuff like that was funny back when Three Men and a Baby came out but now it just makes me want to roll my eyes and cringe. Little Man didn't have one of those stupid gags and that was a breath of fresh air for me. I found myself laughing through about 70 of the film and the cast does a fine job. The only weak link was Tracy Morgan who was funny on SNL but the character he plays in this movie is just plain obnoxious. The gorgeous Brittany Daniel who was also in White Chicks provides some great eye candy. And the monotonespeaking comedian Fred Stoller provides some really funny scenestealing moments. Even Chazz Palminteri gets into the act playing a gangster I know not exactly a stretch for him but he adds some class to the film. Keep on the lookout for Rob Schneider who has an amusing cameo. And last but not least John Witherspoon never fails to please. Marlon Wayans's rubberfaced comedy style gets a little annoying at times but I can't deny that the mere image of him as a midget is pretty damn hilarious. My advice is ignore the low rating and tons of bad reviews and give the film a chance. As I said before I thought this was just going to be another brainless comedy".

Of course this film is not a masterpiece but what else could I expect from a movie directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans? Honestly if I did not like this genre I would never spend my time watching it. This movie is politically incorrect and has the same substandard of the franchises American Pie and Scary Movie or The 40 Year Old Virgin with many gross scatological and low level jokes.

	schema:reviewBody "A naive country boy desperately tries to rescue his silly sweetheart from the affections of a shyster lawyer.Unseen for decades THE BOOB is a wonderful surprise a delightful silent comedy Western full of the right mixture of good humor  pathos. At barely an hour in length and with the support of an excellent new piano score by Arthur Barrow it will inevitably invite favorable comparison with Harold Lloyd's masterpiece THE KID BROTHER 1927.Scots actor George K. Arthur a popular MGM comic star at the end of the silent era wins immediate sympathy with his sad face and diminutive stature. All decked out in cowboy duds he looks ridiculous and the audience instinctively knows he'll have to endure much humiliation before the final fadeout.Character actor Charles Murray is hilarious as the boozy bowlegged old buckaroo who grubstakes Arthur  just watching his droll facial expressions is a joy.

At barely an hour in length and with the support of an excellent new piano score by Arthur Barrow it will inevitably invite favorable comparison with Harold Lloyd's masterpiece THE KID BROTHER 1927.Scots actor George K. Arthur a popular MGM comic star at the end of the silent era wins immediate sympathy with his sad face and diminutive stature. All decked out in cowboy duds he looks ridiculous and the audience instinctively knows he'll have to endure much humiliation before the final fadeout.Character actor Charles Murray is hilarious as the boozy bowlegged old buckaroo who grubstakes Arthur  just watching his droll facial expressions is a joy.

Wellman a long forgotten silent comedy made its television premiere on Turner Classic Movies April 3 2003 as part of its Directors Under 30 spotlight along with a piano score by a young composer named Arthur Barrow. Although feature billing goes to Gertrude Olmstead the story relatively belongs to George K. Arthur playing in the title role. The opening title card start off with The same old story in which a young country girl named Amy Gertrude Olmstead is seen sitting on a velvet swing smooching with Harry Benson Antonio D'Arcy a city slicker by Peter B. Good George K. Arthur a rustic farm hand who happens to be in love with her. Suspicious of this man who not only wants to marry Amy but wanting to meet at the Booklovers Club Peter learns that Harry might be a bootlegger involved in illegal doings in the Wyoming town near his farm. To prove to Amy and to himself that he is not a weakling or in other words a Boob the then slang term for today's description of a jerk as he is made up to be Peter after failing to make an impression by wearing some outlandish cowboy clothes decides to become a prohibition agent and obtain proof that this city slicker is not on the level with her. After getting into the Booklovers Club Peter not only notices the club members there drinking from the books where the liquor is kept but encounters a woman named Jane Joan Crawford who might either be one of the club members or a secret agent.THE BOOB has the distinction of being a film that combines the elements of the works of directors D.W. Griffith the country boy trying to make good and Mack Sennett comic characters and a car chasing scene but fails on both levels. What makes this particular one hour length comedy of sole interest today is an early screen appearance of future screen legend Joan Crawford whose character doesn't make her first screen appearance until thirty minutes from the start of the film. Almost unrecognizable she does obtain a screen presence that stands apart from the other actors. George K. Arthur a young comic relieftype of MGM silents during the 1920s who somewhat resembles future film actor Jack Haley performs his task well but had this same character been played by the likes of the more popular comic Buster Keaton two years away from becoming an MGM contract player chances are he would have developed his yokel boy into something special. Arthur appeared in other MGM films usually teamed opposite the tall Karl Dane but because their films haven't been seen since their initial releases Arthur and Dane separately or together have become obscure names from Hollywood's past. They both faded by the advent of talkies.Also seen in the supporting cast are Charles Murray as Cactus Jim sporting a droopy mustache that makes him resemble another silent screen comic of the time Snub Pollard Hank Mann as the Village Soda Jerk and Babe London briefly seen as the Fat Girl. Interestingly there is another character in the story who is given enough screen time to warrant his name in the casting credits but doesn't. He's a little black boy characterized as Ham Bunn who accompanies George K. Arthur along with a little dog throughout the film.THE BOOB which has fortunately survived after all these years while many other silent movies from this era have vanished to dust for all it's worth is still a worthy offering and a real curio at best. And Arthur Barrow should also be commended for supplying this forgotten little item with a satisfactory piano score to help this movie along. THE BOOB will never be regarded as a sortafter comedy masterpiece but a place in cinema history as a surviving silent film featuring Joan Crawford or one of the early works of director William A. Wellman and nothing else. ".

The funny joke is that the film takes place in the 1920s and an old cowboy makes the farm boy dress up as if it were the 1820s. There are a few funny moments but for the most part all the jokes fall flat on their face. Arthur makes for a rather poor leading man but Joan Crawford is good in her small role. Olmstread is decent in her role but it's another role where our hero falls for a woman who is a bitch throughout the movie. The one thing that sets this film apart is that Arthur's best friend in the movie is a small black boy and the film never plays down to racial jokes or racial stereotypes which is certainly rare for this era.".

Perhaps denying him any credit for his work was deemed sufficient punishment. It was apparent that some portion of the script was edited out since nothing was ever developed regarding the other ladies' objections to the elderly woman's relationship with the George K. Arthur character. Ultimately the main attraction of this film is its absolutely stunning photography courtesy of the great William H. Daniels.

The Boob is more of a curiosity than a comedy but it's a chance to see some silent performers in wellpreserved celluloid.  The Boob 51726 William A. Wellman  George K. Arthur Gertrude Olmstead Joan Crawford Tony D'Algy";

	schema:reviewBody "The Boob 1926 a 1010 Warner Archive release is mostly of interest to really devoted Joan Crawford fans who won't mind the facts that her role is small and that's she's poorly costumed made up and photographed. In addition to this disservice to Joan Crawford the movie is slackly directed by a heavyhanded William Wellman. In fact both both director Wellman and the script heavily favor the comic antics of Charlie Murray George K. Arthur and soontobewed to MGM director Robert Z. Leonard Gertrude Olmstead. True the movie does have its fun moments the uplifting chorus costumes but basically it runs out of puff well before its actual conclusion.It could be said that at least The Boob obviously cost MGM a little bit of money. Not much. The unlikely speakeasy set for example is a leftover from Ben Hur.".

She has a small supporting role as Jane and Crawford herself also hated this movie.  She thought she was being punished by MGM for getting this part.  Earns 12 stars out of four.".
